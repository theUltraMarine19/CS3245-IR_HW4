      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The Director of Public Prosecutions is the plaintiff on a summons in this Court and the first defendant is a person facing committal proceedings in the Local Court. The second defendant on the summons is the magistrate who made rulings in the Local Court providing for the cross examination of certain persons in the committal proceedings. The second defendant has filed a submitting appearance but the first defendant opposes the relief sought on the summons. That relief has been expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The record of the proceedings in Burwood Local Court committal proceedings  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Nemani Rainibogi 
         be removed to this Honourable Court. 
        
       
       
        
        2. An Order staying the Orders made 28 October 2002 by the Second Defendant under Section 48E of the  
        Justices Act 1902 
         in the First Defendant’s committal proceedings, pending the determination of the within summons. 
        
       
       
        
        3. A declaration that the Second Defendant erred in law in holding that evidence in the First Defendant’s prosecution was such that Section 105(6) of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
         would enable the oral examination of nominated witnesses, including the alleged victim of a prescribed sexual offence, concerning the victim’s sexual experience. 
        
       
       
        
        4. That the Orders made 28 October 2002 requiring the victim of a prescribed sexual offence and other witnesses, namely [JT], [JB], [FB] and [WR], attend the First Defendant’s committal proceedings for the purpose of giving oral evidence be set aside and that his Worship’s rulings of 4 October 2002 in relation to section 105(6) of the  
        Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
         be quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The matter be remitted to the Second Defendant to hear and determine the matter according to law. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The witnesses be referred to by pseudonyms to protect the identity of the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        7. The First Defendant pay the Plaintiff’s costs.” 
        
       
      
    2 At the outset I address para 6 of the summons. The committal proceedings relate to alleged sexual offences against a child at the relevant time fifteen years of age. In her interests it is appropriate that the witnesses be referred to by pseudonym to protect her identity, and I will adopt this course in this judgment. The alleged victim I shall refer to as “TT”. 
     
      
       
      Background material 
       
      
    3 The first defendant is presently charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault upon TT and the offences are alleged to have been committed during the night of 8/9 July 2001. It is alleged that the first defendant engaged in digital penetration of the victim’s vagina and thereafter in penile penetration of the vagina. (The first defendant is also charged with possession of a prohibited weapon contrary to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act, 1998, but nothing turns on this for present purposes.) 
     
      
    4 The prosecution case may be shortly summarised. TT is a stepdaughter of the first defendant who, by the time of these alleged offences, had separated from TT’s natural mother, JT. Following an argument with her mother, TT went to stay with the first defendant. TT was, at the relevant time, still at school but had part-time work. According to her account, on an evening when she came home from her part-time work the first defendant gave her alcohol which rendered her ill and she vomited. Subsequently, as TT lay on a bed the first defendant allegedly massaged her body and ultimately, after the removal of the child’s clothing, committed the act of digital penetration the subject of one offence and later engaged in penile vaginal intercourse. After he had done so, the first defendant dressed and went to work, he being a shift worker in the security industry. 
     
      
    5 The first defendant had a ten year old son who was present in the bedroom at the time of the events above described. After the first defendant left home the complainant asked this child to go out and ring TT’s boyfriend, FB, and to ask FB to call her. FB did so in due course and TT complained that she had been raped. Later, within two to three days of the alleged offences, TT also complained to her friend JB, and at the latter’s suggestion, TT and JB went to a shopping centre and purchased a home pregnancy test kit. TT used the kit which showed that she was not pregnant. 
     
      
    6 On 21 July 2001 TT’s half brother, WR, came back from overseas and TT immediately informed him of the offences committed by the first defendant but declined his suggestion that she inform the police. 
     
      
    7 It was not until after WR had spoken to his mother that JT confronted TT on 13 October 2001 and TT told her mother what the first defendant had done to her. At that time TT said: “It was the first time I had ever had sex.” The plaintiff acknowledged that that statement would be inadmissible having regard to s 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act, to which provision I shall refer shortly. 
     
      
    8 After TT had spoken to her mother the police were informed and TT was interviewed. An interview with the first defendant followed in which he denied any sexual activity. 
     
      
    9 TT was medically examined at the Sydney Children’s Hospital by Dr Pennington on 25 October 2001. Upon physical examination TT showed no signs of acute injury but “her hymen was thickened and irregular with a well healed V-shaped transsection at seven o’clock.” Dr Pennington concluded that the physical examination findings were consistent with past vaginal penetration having occurred, but during the course of investigations it was discovered that TT was pregnant and the date of conception was determined by Dr Pennington as having most likely occurred between 7 and 14 August 2001. Dr Pennington further wrote:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is possible that this pregnancy was conceived up to a week either side of these dates but not possible for it to have been the result of sexual intercourse on 9 July 2001.” 
        
       
      
    10 TT told Dr Pennington that she had sexual intercourse with two boyfriends of similar age after the assault committed by the first defendant. 
     
      
    11 It is against the background of the material above reviewed that the rulings of the magistrate are to be considered. 
     
      
       
      Orders for attendance for cross examination 
       
      
    12 When the hearing in this Court commenced Mr Penhall, appearing for the first defendant, raised a preliminary issue. It was his submission that the magistrate did not make any orders for the cross examination of witnesses on committal and that the plaintiff’s application was premature. Having considered the relevant transcript and the bench sheet, I rejected that submission by Mr Penhall for reasons that I gave earlier. The Local Court record for 28 October 2002 records the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Order that victim and other witnesses attend for xxn [cross examination] as to matters set out in sheets initialled by me.” 
        
       
      
    13 The relevant sheets comprise Annexures C and D to the affidavit of Helen Langley sworn on 10 February 2003, which affidavit was read in support of the relief claimed in the summons. 
     
      
    14 It is necessary to record the content of those two annexures because, in conjunction with the order endorsed on the court record, they identify the various matters which the magistrate determined should be the subject of cross examination, considering each of the witnesses required to attend for cross examination in turn. 
     
      
    15 Those annexures were prepared by Mr Penhall in the interests of the first defendant and Annexure C, apart from identifying the witnesses who Mr Penhall wanted to cross examine and the matters about which he wanted to cross examine them, also contained submissions as to why the magistrate should allow such cross examination. Those submissions obviously found favour with the magistrate but I do not propose to record them here. The relevant content of Annexure C for present purposes is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. [

          (i) The dates he was absent in Fiji in July, 2001 (with Passport confirmation);

    16 The magistrate’s order requires that each of the above witnesses attend at committal for cross examination on the topics above recorded. 
     
      
    17 There was a fifth witness nominated in annexure C, Constable Bruce, who was involved in the investigation of the relevant complaints. However the plaintiff seeks no order here concerning Constable Bruce. 
     
      
    18 Annexure D was put forward in the terms following: 
     
      
       
        
        “

          (vii) Particulars of the victim’s alcohol and drug use and associates in relation thereto.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    19 So far as the victim was concerned, the magistrate’s order requires the attendance of TT for cross examination on the matters referred to in annexure D. 
     
      
    20 It will be necessary for me to consider the reasons expressed by the magistrate for making the orders recorded on the bench sheet, but before doing so I set out the statutory provisions which the magistrate was required to consider before making the orders here challenged. 
     
      
       
      The relevant statutory restraints 
       
      
    21 The first of these provisions is s 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act. I set out sub-paras (1) to (6) of s 105: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        105 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies to prescribed sexual offence proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, is inadmissible. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) Subsection (3) does not apply: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if the evidence: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) is of the complainant’s sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) if: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the accused person is alleged to have had sexual intercourse (as defined in section 61H (1) of the  
            Crimes Act 1900 
            ) with the complainant, and the accused person does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the evidence is relevant to whether the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury is attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to have been had by the accused person, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) if the evidence is relevant to: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) whether at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence there was present in the complainant a disease that, at any relevant time, was absent in the accused person, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) whether at any relevant time there was absent in the complainant a disease that, at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, was present in the accused person, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) if the evidence is relevant to whether the allegation that the prescribed sexual offence was committed by the accused person was first made following a realisation or discovery of the presence of pregnancy or disease in the complainant (being a realisation or discovery that took place after the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence), 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) if the evidence has been given by the complainant in cross-examination by or on behalf of the accused person, being evidence given in answer to a question that may, pursuant to subsection (6), be asked, and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) A witness must not be asked: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or (b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (6) If the court is satisfied: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    22 Section 105(9) defines “prescribed sexual offence proceedings” as meaning: 
     
      
       
        
        “…proceedings in which a person stands charged with a prescribed sexual offence alone or together with any other offence…” 
        
       
       
      and the offences charged against the first defendant, being offences against s 61J of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , are prescribed sexual offences by definition under s 3 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      . 
       
      
    23 Section 48E of the Justices Act provides in sub-ss (1), (1A), (2) and (7) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) For the purposes of committal proceedings, the Justice or Justices may give a direction requiring the attendance at the proceedings of a person who has made a written statement for the purposes of this Subdivision. The direction may be given on the application of the defendant or informant or on the motion of the Justice or Justices. 
        
       
       
        
        (1A) The Justice or Justices must give the direction if an application is made by the defendant or the informant and the other party consents to the direction being given 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        (2) In any other circumstance, the Justice or Justices may give the direction only if:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in the case of a witness in proceedings that relate to an offence involving violence who is the alleged victim of the offence—the Justice or Justices are of the opinion that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in any other case—the Justice or Justices are of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        …………………. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) If the Justice refuses or Justices refuse to give a direction under subsection (1), the Justice or Justices must give reasons for doing so.” 
        
       
      
    24 “Offence involving violence” includes for the purposes of s 48E(2)(a) a prescribed sexual offence, and hence the offences here charged (s 48E(9)). 
     
      
       
      The decision in the Local Court 
       
      
    25 The magistrate heard argument leading to the order made on 28 October 2002 over a number of days and it has been necessary to consider the transcript of proceedings in the Local Court on 9 May, 4 October and 28 October 2002. It is clear enough that Mr Penhall based his argument for the making of the orders upon s 105(4)(a) and later upon s 105(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act. I do not propose to record here the details of the oral submissions made but eventually, on 4 October 2002, the transcript records that the magistrate said this (p 27): 
     
      
       
        
        “Look, I think I should allow this, I really do, and I put it on this basis. Section 105 is plainly aimed at preventing unnecessary, embarrassing cross examination of victims about their earlier, or later for that matter, sexual activity, but there are exceptions. Sub-section (6) is one of them. It appears to me that that sub-section is met and once it is met the door is open so to speak. It is met, the door is open, and then one has to consider whether there are special reasons. There are special reasons, those that have already been ventilated, they are obvious, and I think the girl must be cross examined.” 
        
       
      
    26 Counsel for the plaintiff then asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Perhaps just to clarify, can I just ask you this? Are you making an order that she can be cross examined about sexual activity prior to the date?” 
        
       
      
    27 The magistrate’s response was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Post and prior, because the post raises the prior by inference. Now the relevance really is in the prior sexual activity but you can only get at it in part by reference to the post event sexual activity.” 
        
       
      
    28 The transcript goes on to record at p 28: 
     
      
       
        
        “BENCH: Well because it won’t be possible to put to her, I imagine, the sort of argument which would be put to her in cross-examination in the form of propositions and questions unless you can say ‘Now, madam, do you not agree that you had sexual activity with this fellow and that fellow on that day’, that’s post the event, ‘and that the reason you had your pregnancy test two days after this event is because you were fearful that you’d been made pregnant by one of those same two fellow?’ It’s all integral. You can’t – it couldn’t be sensibly put to her without bringing up the sexual activity post the event. That’s what I would think. 
        
       
       
        
        ROBINSON: Well to the extent that she is cross-examined does your Worship have in mind simply the question ‘Did you have sex with these two people?’ 
        
       
       
        
        BENCH: No, I had in mind what I’ve just said, namely that that would be one question surrounding questions aimed at getting at the likelihood that she’s had sexual activity with those two people before the subject event and her motives for making up fibs about dad, in that context.” 
        
       
      
    29 The issue was revisited on 21 October 2002 and again on 28 October 2002. On the latter date the court’s attention was taken to the documents prepared by Mr Penhall, being the annexures to Ms Langley’s affidavit previously referred to. Whilst the orders for attendance for cross examination were made on 28 October 2002, the transcript does not reveal anything further as to the reasons which influenced the magistrate to take the course that he did. 
     
      
    30 With respect to the learned magistrate, it is not easy to ascertain from a consideration of the transcript of proceedings in the Local Court precisely what the reasoning process was that led to the making of the orders or just how it was that the magistrate concluded that s 105 permitted cross examination that went to the complainant’s sexual experience.  
     
      
    31 There have been detailed submissions on behalf of the plaintiff and the first defendant on the issue as to whether or not s 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act permits of the cross examination of TT at committal on those matters the subject of the magistrate’s order. Section 105 would not prohibit the cross examination on those topics (i), (iv), (vi) and (vii) in para 18 above, nor concerning the pregnancy test the complainant undertook just days after the commission of the alleged offences, provided of course there were “special reasons” why the complainant should attend to be cross examined on committal on those matters (s 48E(2)(a) of the Justices Act). However, upon what basis can the complainant be required to be cross examined on the remaining matters referred to in para 18? 
     
      
    32 Mr Penhall relied upon s 105(4)(a) and s 105(6) in the alternative to exclude the operation of s 105(3). His instructions are that TT had a pregnancy terminated as a thirteen year old, and he submitted that the very fact that TT employed the use of a pregnancy test kit within days of the commission of the alleged offences gives rise to an inference of a concern that she may have been pregnant through some activity some time before the date of the alleged offences. Then there were the sexual relationships admitted to the doctor at the time of TT’s examination. There were episodes of sexual intercourse with two boyfriends after the assault but prior to 25 October 2001 when Dr Pennington saw TT. There may well have been such episodes prior to or about the time of the commission of the alleged offences. It was submitted that evidence of TT’s prior sexual activity and fear of pregnancy should not be excluded on statutory grounds. The position may well have been that TT feared a pregnancy to some putative father other than the first defendant. It may be that TT had a motive to protect a boyfriend and exonerate herself with family members by falsely accusing her stepfather. To be able to point to some motive for TT to make a false allegation against the first defendant was clearly in the interests of the first defendant. 
     
      
    33 Whilst it is understandable that the first defendant might wish to cross examine TT about her sexual experience, Mr Penhall has not sought to argue that this would be permissible, if not permissible under either s 105(4)(a) or 105(6). 
     
      
    34 Before s 105(4)(a) is enlivened the evidence sought to be introduced must be of events “that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the prescribed sexual offence was committed.” It does not seem to me from the material that the first defendant would seek to introduce that any of it could be said to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed: see R v Tubou [2001] NSWCCA 243 and in particular the judgment of Heydon JA at para 72. 
     
      
    35 There are, as the plaintiff has submitted, a number of matters to be taken into account in considering whether the complainant may be cross examined as to sexual experience by reason of s 105(6).  
     
      
    36 A reading of the available transcript does not convey to me that the learned magistrate gave close attention to the requirements of the sub-section. What triggers the operation of s 105(6) is disclosure or implication “in the case for the prosecution that the complainant has had or may have had sexual experience or a lack of it” or that the complainant had “taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity…” The fact that the report of Dr Pennington served on the first defendant contained a history that TT had had sexual intercourse with two boyfriends after the alleged offence did not render such history a disclosure in the case for the prosecution in the sense of that history being material to the elements required to be proved by the prosecution. Nor do I perceive that the evidence as to the use of the pregnancy kit within a few days of the alleged offences triggered the operation of s 105(6). “‘Disclosure’ means intentional expressed revelation. The word ‘implied’ in the expression ‘disclosed or implied’ means ‘intentional suggestion’”: see the judgment of Heydon JA in Tubou (supra) at para 70. 
     
      
    37 I accept the plaintiff’s submission that the evidence of the taking of the test does not involve an intentional suggestion by the prosecution that the complainant had engaged in some sexual activity outside that the subject of the offences charged. 
     
      
    38 Further, in relation to s 105(6) the magistrate had to be satisfied that the first defendant would be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross examined, and again the transcript does not indicate that the magistrate considered s 105(6)(b). The concluding words of s 105(6), namely “but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified” must be addressed in any case in which cross examination is to be allowed. Under the terms of the order made concerning her, TT is to attend to be cross examined as to her boyfriends, her associates and her sexual activity from 1 January 1997, when TT was but ten years of age, until the present time. The very width of this order conveys that the learned magistrate has not directed himself to all the requirements of the sub-section. 
     
      
    39 In the much cited judgment of McHugh JA in Soulemezis v Dudley Holdings Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 his Honour said at 279: 
     
      
       
        
        “… However, without the articulation of reasons, a judicial decision cannot be distinguished from an arbitrary decision. In my opinion the giving of reasons is correctly perceived as ‘a necessary incident of the judicial process’ because it enables the basis of the decision to be seen and understood both for the instant case and for the future direction of the law.” 
        
       
      
    40 The decision in Soulemezis related to the obligation to state reasons which was imposed upon a judge of the Compensation Court but, to my mind, the principle applies here. My conclusion, following a consideration of s 105, is that no reason has been demonstrated for the requirement for the complainant to attend to be cross examined on subject matter to which prima facie s 105(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act applies. In any event, the failure to give reasons for requiring the complainant to attend for cross examination about the subject matter of her sexual experience itself amounted to error of law. 
     
      
    41 There were, of course, other topics to be addressed in cross examination of the complainant and the other witnesses, but where, as here, there was no consent under s 48E(1A), s 48E(2)(a) of the Justices Act required a determination that there were “special reasons” why in the interests of justice TT should be required to attend to give oral evidence and s 48E(2)(b) in the case of the other witnesses called for a determination that there were “substantial reasons” why in the interests of justice those witnesses should attend to give evidence. 
     
      
    42 I do not find in the transcript any identification of “special reasons” or “substantial reasons” as the case may be. 
     
      
    43 Once again the dicta of McHugh JA in Soulemezis (supra) is in point. I cite also Downes v Director of Public Prosecutions [2000] NSWSC 1054. 
     
      
    44 It was not sufficient for the magistrate really to state that there were “special reasons” for the purposes of s 48E(2)(a). What may constitute “special reasons” was considered in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kennedy 94 A Crim R 341 and more recently by O’Keefe J in O’Hare v DPP [2000] NSWSC 430. 
     
      
    45 Kennedy was concerned with the provisions of s 48EA of the Justices Act but what was said in that case was apposite to a consideration of s 48E as it now stands. 
     
      
    46 Hunt CJ at CL in Kennedy said at pp 351-352: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the purpose of the provision is to avoid the complainant having to be cross examined twice – at the committal and in the trial – unless it is justified as being in the interests of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        What are ‘special reasons’ and what are not will vary from case to case and cannot be defined in advance. The decision should not be approach in an unduly restrictive way; what must be shown is that such evidence will serve the true purposes of committal proceedings, which exist in order to achieve a fair trial in the trial court. Something more than the disadvantage to the accused from the loss of the opportunity to cross examine the plaintiff at the committal must be shown. There must be some feature in the particular case by reason of which it is out of the ordinary and which will establish that it is in the interests of justice that the complainant be called to give oral evidence.” 
        
       
      
    47 Then in O’Hare O’Keefe J, following a review of the decided cases in this State, in Victoria and in South Australia, said at para 51: 
     
      
       
        
        “In summary the decided cases in New South Wales establish and in Victoria and South Australia indicate that the facts or situations that constitute ‘special reasons’ should not be confined by precise legal definition, are not a closed category, should not be approached in an unduly restricted way and need to be: 
        
       
       
        
         Special in relation to the particular case; 
        
       
       
        
         Solid, that is substantial, in nature; 
        
       
       
        
         Not common or usual; 
        
       
       
        
         Out of the ordinary; 
        
       
       
        
         Unusual or atypical; 
        
       
       
        
         Clearly distinguishable from the general run of cases; 
        
       
       
        
        and must be relevant to the interests of justice. In this regard relevance to the interests of justice will involve a consideration of the interests of the defendant and the interests of the complainant as well as other wider considerations of justice. In this context: 
        
       
       
        
        . the strength or weakness of the prosecution case; 
        
       
       
        
         that there will be a real risk of an unfair trial should oral evidence not be permitted; 
        
       
       
        
         the prospect of prejudice to the defendant beyond the ordinary in such event; 
        
       
       
        
         the real possibility that a defendant may not be have to stand trial if oral evidence is permitted; 
        
       
       
        
         the existence of inconsistent statements by or different versions from a complainant or witness; 
        
       
       
        
        will be material considerations in the exercise of function by a Magistrate under s 48E(2)(a).” 
        
       
      
    48 In Hanna v Kearney (unreported, NSWSC, 28 May 1998) consideration was given to the concept of “substantial reasons” (relevant to s 48E(2)(b)). In that case I stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. There can be no rigid or exhaustive definition of what constitutes ‘ 
        substantial reasons’ 
         and it would be undesirable to attempt to give one. Relevant issues inevitably vary from case to case. However, any statement served has to be considered with reference to the issues it addresses and the charge to which it relates. The application to cross-examine requires identification and consideration of the objective of the cross-examiner, and the framework of the prosecution case. To require a witness for cross-examination without a definite aim but in the hope of eliciting some evidence that might prove useful to the defence would not constitute  
        ‘substantial reasons’ 
        . It is for the applicant to clearly define the purpose or purposes of the cross-examination which he seeks. 
         
         
        3. It would be wrong to limit  
        ‘substantial reasons’ 
         to situations where cross-examination is likely to result in the discharge of the defendant or to establish grounds for a no bill application. Equally it would be wrong to limit 
         ‘substantial reasons’  
        to situations where cross-examination is likely to substantially undermine the credit of an important witness. ‘ 
        Substantial reasons’ 
         may well be found elsewhere.  
         
         
        4. On any application under s 48E the fundamental objective of committal proceedings must be borne in mind, namely the objective of facilitating a fair trial in the event that the person charged is committed and later stands trial. This may mean that there are substantial reasons for requiring a witness for cross-examination for a proper understanding of the nature of the prosecution case or for an understanding of the basis of a relevant opinion held by a witness. I do but give those instances, I certainly do not intend them to be exhaustive. 
         
         
        5. ‘ 
        Substantial reason’ 
         may be shown for cross-examination where this may lead to the narrowing of matters in dispute…” 
        
       
      
    49 Mr Penhall referred to the language of s 48E(7). That requires of a magistrate who refuses to give a direction under sub-s (1) that he give reasons for doing so. However, the section does not specifically require a magistrate who requires the attendance of a person at the committal proceedings to give reasons for that decision and hence he submitted it was to be implied there was no such requirement. I am not attracted by that submission. The broad scope of the concepts of “special reasons” and of “substantial reasons” seem to me to add emphasis to the necessity for a magistrate to make it plain what he regards as “special reasons” or “substantial reasons” as the case may be. There was a need for the magistrate to consider the provisions of s 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act and of s 48E of the Justices Act, giving discrete consideration not only to whether a particular person was to be required to attend for cross examination but as to what topic or topics might be the subject of cross examination. The statutes required this approach of the magistrate and the absence of reasons leads me to conclude that the magistrate erred in failing to apply himself fully to those questions which those statutory provisions prescribed. 
     
      
    50 Accordingly, I conclude that error has been shown both in the failure to give reasons for the decision reached in relation to s 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act and in relation to the decision reached concerning s 48E of the Justices Act: see Ex parte Hebburn Limited; re Kersley Shire Council (1947) 47 SR 416 per Jordan CJ at 420 and Saffron v DPP (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 per Priestley JA at 418. 
     
      
    51 Section 104(3) of the Justices Act affords an opportunity to appeal to this court “against any order that is made in relation to committal proceedings on a question that involves a question of law alone, but only with the leave of the Supreme Court.” To the extent that the plaintiff here relies upon s 104(3), it seems to me that this is a matter in relation to which the Court should grant leave, and I do so. 
     
      
    52 For the above reasons the orders for attendance for cross examination of TT and the various witnesses cannot stand and the matter must go back to the Local Court for reconsideration. 
     
      
    53 I have earlier adverted to the need for the magistrate to find and to express special reasons if the complainant should be required to attend for cross examination on any matter. The witnesses identified in annexure C to the affidavit of Helen Langley have been ordered to attend for cross examination on those various matters set out in para 15 above. I do not propose to address each of those topics and each of those proposed witnesses seriatim. I do observe however that the order that was made contemplates that each witness would be cross examined about the subject matter to which s 105(3) applies unless the operation of that sub-section is otherwise excluded by s 105(4). Section 105(6) could have no application because that sub-section is only concerned with what may be permitted by way of cross examination of a complainant. The magistrate here has not given any reasons such as would identify what particular sub-section of s 105 would permit cross examination of any one of the witnesses concerning a topic to which s 105(3) prima facie applies. Were he to contemplate permitting the introduction of evidence under s 105(4) it would be necessary for him to assess the probative value of the evidence and whether it outweighed any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer. Plainly that exercise has not yet been undertaken. 
     
      
    54 The other matter of fundamental importance in considering whether any of these witnesses identified in annexure C should be required to be cross examined at committal is whether or not there are “substantial reasons” why in the interests of justice such witness or witnesses should attend, because it is only if the magistrate considers that there are such reasons that any direction for attendance for cross examination may be given. This requirement under s 48E(2)(b) necessitates discrete consideration of the subject matter contemplated concerning each of the proposed witnesses. 
     
      
    55 For the reasons stated, I now make the following orders. 
     
      
    56 1. That the orders made on 28 October 2002 requiring the victim of a prescribed sexual offence and other witnesses identified in annexure C to the affidavit of Helen Langley sworn 10 February 2003 to attend the first defendant’s committal proceedings for the purpose of giving oral evidence be set aside and that the rulings made by the magistrate on 4 October 2002 in relation to s 105 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1986 be quashed. 
     
      
       
      2. That the matter be remitted to the magistrate to be heard and determined according to law. 
       
       
      3. I reserve the question of costs.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 His Honour: By Notice of Motion filed 3 December 2002 the applicant/accused sought a determination that the evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown to support two counts in an indictment presented against him on 31 October 2002 was not sufficient to constitute the offences charged, namely supply not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin, and in the alternative, supply heroin. 
     
      
    2 I heard submissions on the Motion on 27 February 2003 and ruled in favour of the applicant indicating that I would give my reasons at a later date. These are my reasons.  
     
      
    3 The applicant was charged in Count 3 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 20 January 2000 and 16 December 2000 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely heroin, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug.” 
        
       
      
    4 He was charged in Count 4 in the alternative as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 20 January 2000 and 16 December 2000 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely, heroin.” 
        
       
      
    5 For the purposes of the Motion no issue arises as to the quantity of the prohibited drug. 
     
      
    6 Count 3 was a charge under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (the Act) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
      
    7 Count 4 was a charge under s 25(1) of the Act not alleging that a commercial quantity was involved. 
     
      
    8 “Supply” is defined in s 3 of the Act, relevantly, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.” 
        
       
      
    9 For the purposes of the Motion both parties accepted the facts set out in the document entitled, “Chronology and Facts” (Ex. 1 on the Motion). In summary, some time after the arrest of Vincent Caccamo by the applicant and a fellow detective, David Patison, in relation to drug matters on 20 January 2000, the applicant or Patison (but in any event in each other’s company) told Caccamo that they knew he was selling drugs, but agreed that he could continue doing so if he paid them $1,000 a week. Caccamo told them he would take a few weeks to get started.  
     
      
    10 Following this a series of meetings took place between Caccamo and either the applicant or Patison at which various amounts of money ranging from $400 to $1,000 were handed over by Caccamo. Although they knew that Caccamo was supplying heroin, they took no steps to arrest him, carry out surveillance, obtain telephone interception warrants, or supply information they had to their superior officers. Moreover, about 23 May 2000 the applicant, as a result of information obtained from the police computer system, told Caccamo that the details of his runner’s car were known to other police and he should change it.  
     
      
    11 The Crown relied on the extended definition of “supply” and submitted that the applicant suffered or permitted Caccamo to sell and distribute, to keep or have in his possession for supply, to receive for supply, and to deliver prohibited drugs. It appears that initially the Crown alleged that the facts amounted to the applicant “permitting” Caccamo to supply the heroin, but it later relied, in the alternative, on the submission that he was “suffering” the supply. In my view for present purposes there is no meaningful difference between “permitting” and “suffering” in this context: cf R v Thomas (1976) 63 Cr App R 65 at 68, R v Sanewski [1987] 1 Qd R 374, R v Lonie & Groom [1999] NSWCCA 319 at [93], R v Bett [1999] 1 WLR 2109 at 2113. 
     
      
    12 In a number of different contexts it has been held that in order to “permit” an activity, it is essential that the person charged has the power and authority to prevent that activity: Adelaide Corporation v Australasian Performing Right Association Limited (1928) 40 CLR 481, Broad v Parish (1941) 64 CLR 588 at 594, R v Souter (1971) 55 Cr App R 403 at 409, Ex parte Jenkins; Re Ross [1965] NSWR 364, R v Lonie & Groom [1999] NSWCCA 319 per Smart AJ at [86] to [92]. In R v von Snarski [2001] QCA 71 at [24], the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mere inactivity by a person seeing others doing something does not establish permission. But neither is specific activity always necessary to prove “permitting” in the case of someone who knows what another is doing, has the 
          
        capability of preventing 
         it 
        ,  
        and stands by while the act is done. It is a question of fact in which degree and circumstance may affect the conclusion.” (my underlining) 
        
       
      
    13 As in all cases of statutory construction, the meaning of the words used depends on the context. The cases where persons have been held to have “permitted” or “suffered” the activities of others have all been cases where the concerned had authority either as employer, publican, occupier or such like to prevent the prescribed activity being carried on. In R v Bradbury [1996] Crim LR 808 the English Court of Appeal held that there had to be assistance or encouragement, and mere acquiescence was not enough. This would be in accordance with the general principles of the criminal law because acquiescence without a power to prevent would amount to an involuntary crime consisting of a mens rea without an actus reus. 
     
      
    14 The Crown however submitted that because of his duty and authority under the Police Service Act 1990 a police officer is required to keep the peace and prevent offences, using the best of his skill and knowledge, and that he has a positive obligation to prevent the commission of crime as well as to investigate offences that have been committed. 
     
      
    15 However, notwithstanding that the applicant had the powers of a police officer and knowledge that Caccamo was carrying on business as a heroin supplier, it does not appear from the Chronology and Facts that he had knowledge in advance of any particular intended transactions, and even if he did, it is not clear what powers he would have had in advance to prevent the commission of the offence. Once the offence was committed or even attempted, he would have had powers of arrest but not prior, as there is no power to arrest in advance merely because of knowledge or information that an offence will be committed. 
     
      
    16 As a police officer he was not in a position to stop Caccamo from making a sale or from being in possession of heroin. He was not empowered to arrest him on account of his “intention” to continue to deal in drugs. He was not empowered to arrest him before he committed the offence of supply or posses, but could only do so after he had committed the crime (including an attempt to do so), and only if he then had sufficient admissible evidence to warrant such arrest. In other words, he did not have authority or power to prevent the commission of the offences. It is not relevant for present purposes to consider whether the facts disclosed could amount to a conspiracy between the applicant, Patison and Caccamo to supply prohibited drugs, as such offence was not charged. 
     
      
    17 The real gravamen of the applicant’s criminal conduct in relation to these transactions was his soliciting and receiving payment in return for not causing investigations to be carried out which might have resulted either in Caccamo being arrested and charged with offences which he had committed, or in him being led into a position of supplying drugs to an undercover police officer whereupon he could be arrested and charged. The appropriate charges in respect of such conduct were solicit corrupt reward and receive corrupt reward contrary to s 249B of the Crimes Act 1900 which were the charges contained in counts 5 and 6 of the indictment of 31 October 2002 and to which the applicant indicated he would, and subsequently did, plead guilty. 
     
      
    18 For these reasons I ruled that the facts disclosed in the Chronology and Facts did not amount to “permitting” or “suffering” the supply of the drugs and therefore did not come within the extended definition of “supply”. 
     
      
    19 The question then arose as to the form of the order that should be made, the Notice of Motion merely seeking a “determination” that the evidence contained in the brief of evidence upon which the applicant was committed for trial did not amount to either offence charged in counts 3 or 4 of the indictment. The Chronology and Facts is, as I understand it, a condensed summary of the committal brief of evidence. 
     
      
    20 The Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 61(1) provides that an objection to an indictment for a formal defect apparent on its face must be taken, by demurrer or by motion to quash the indictment, before the jury is sworn, whilst subs (2) permits the Court to cause the indictment to be amended in which case the trial is to proceed as if there were no defect. 
     
      
    21 A demurrer admits that all the statements in the count in the indictment are true but it maintains that, even admitting their truth, they are not sufficient in law to make the applicant guilty of a crime, and therefore he is not bound to answer them. It challenges the substantial matters alleged as not constituting any crime at all: The King v Boston (1923) 33 CLR 386 at 396.  
     
      
    22 As the Court of Criminal Appeal said in R v Glynn (1994) 33 NSWLR 139 at 140-1: 
     
      
       
        
        “A demurrer is concerned only with the adequacy of the facts as stated in the indictment. It is not concerned with the adequacy of the evidence available to the Crown to prove those facts - for the facts as stated in the indictment are, for the purposes of the demurrer, admitted. Accordingly it is an error, in determining a demurrer, to have regard to depositions or other material indicating the evidence available to the Crown. A court is not concerned, in determining a demurrer, whether the evidence available to the Crown will, if adduced and accepted, make out the facts as stated in the indictment. Equally, if the statements of fact averred in the indictment do not disclose an offence by the person charged it is wholly foreign to the demurrer procedure that the court have regard to evidence available, or claimed to be available to the Crown, which might establish any fact or facts which if added to the facts averred in the indictment would make good any deficiency or deficiencies therein and constitute, if true, an offence. What matters are the statements averred in the indictment itself.” 
        
       
      See also  
      R v Inner London Quarter Sessions 
       [1970] 2 QB 80. 
       
      
    23 In the present case, counts 3 and 4 in their terms clearly specify sufficient facts to justify convictions under s 25(1) and (2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, irrespective of whether the Crown has available to it sufficient evidence to establish such facts. It follows that this is not an appropriate case to consider by way of demurrer. 
     
      
    24 Another form of challenge to an indictment is by motion to quash the indictment (or individual counts therein). This is the appropriate course if the indictment (or count) on its face does not disclose an offence or is bad for duplicity or for a number of other reasons: R v Jones (1974) 59 Cr App R 120, R v Wilk (1982) 32 SASR 12 at 14, Archbold (2001 ed) at paras 1-236, 1-190, 1-191. 
     
      
    25 In R v Jones (1974) 59 Cr App R 120 at 126 the Court said that upon a motion to quash a count made before indictment the judge gives his ruling upon the form and matter on the face of the indictment, and the only circumstance in which the depositions and statements can be examined is when the motion to quash is on the ground that the offence is not disclosed by the depositions or statements and there has been no committal for trial of that offence (my underlining). 
     
      
    26 In this the Court followed what had been said by Lord Goddart CJ in R v Chairman, County of London Quarter Sessions (1953) 2 QB 750 which was based on the premise that once there had been a committal for trial, the trial court was bound to hear the case and had no power to quash the indictment on the ground that the evidence available to the Crown would not support the charge. 
     
      
    27 With respect, this reasoning appears to be erroneous, in view of the Courts power, now clearly established, to stay proceedings if such proceedings are doomed to failure: Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 378, Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19, R v Smith [1995] 1 VR 10 including cases where it is clear beyond argument that there is no evidence of an essential element. Moreover, I cannot see any practical distinction between counts in respect of which there has been a committal for trial and counts in respect of which there has not, and if the depositions and statements can be looked at in the latter case, I see no reason why they should not be looked at in the former. 
     
      
    28 However, because of the doubts which arise because of the English decisions, I consider that the safer and more appropriate course is to make a composite order. 
     
      
    29 I therefore order that all proceedings on counts 3 and 4 in the indictment dated 31 October 2002 be permanently stayed and that the said counts be quashed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      (Application to exclude evidence of Christian Painter) 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 7 April last a jury was empanelled following the arraignment of Mazin Mehajer and John Jacobs charged with murder. On the third day of the trial the Crown called Christian Painter, and Mr Pike of counsel, appearing for Mehajer, thereupon made application that the evidence of the witness ought be excluded. Mr Hoenig, who appears for the co-accused, did not join in that application. 
     
      
    2 It became apparent in the course of submissions thereafter made in the absence of the jury that the application would necessitate a lengthy voir dire involving a considerable number of witnesses and the jury was then discharged. 
     
      
    3 The hearing of the evidence relevant to the application made on behalf of Mehajer commenced on 14 April 2003. 
     
      
    4 The application for the exclusion of the evidence of this witness is based upon the provisions of s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence that was obtained: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
        
       
       
        
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the probative value of the evidence, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and 
        
       
       
        
        (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the  
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
        , and 
        
       
       
        
        (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and  
        
       
       
        
        (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
        
       
      
    5 The submission made is that the evidence obtained from Mr Painter was obtained improperly. Before considering that submission more closely, it is necessary to trace how the witness became involved in the investigations into the crime the subject of the indictment to which I have referred and also the circumstances in which he gave various accounts. 
     
      
    6 The prosecution case is that the crime of murder was committed on an industrial estate at Leumeah in a café there located. The deceased was assaulted in the course of a robbery at that café and died from injury sustained. The deceased was one of two victims present in the café at the time of the robbery and the other witness, although allegedly assaulted, survived, and, indeed, gave evidence at the trial before the jury was discharged. That witness was Shane Phillips. 
     
      
    7 There were two mobile phones stolen from the crime scene and one of these phones came into the hands of Mr Painter’s girlfriend with whom Mr Painter was living at the time of execution of a search warrant. The seizure of that mobile phone by the police prompted the attendance of Mr Painter at the Blacktown Police Station on 14 June 2000 when Mr Painter gave the first account to the authorities. At that time he told the police he knew nothing about the murder and that he purchased the mobile phone from a stranger in a hotel. He said he then gave that phone to his girlfriend, Tennille Mitchell. 
     
      
    8 In evidence given on the voir dire the witness acknowledged that that account in that first statement was false. 
     
      
    9 Mr Painter was later summonsed to attend the Crime Commission in the course of its investigations concerning the alleged murder. He first gave evidence at the Crime Commission on 22 June 2000 when in sworn evidence he maintained the false version that had been given to the police earlier that month. 
     
      
    10 In his evidence on the voir dire Mr Painter acknowledged that he asked his brother Jason and a friend, Neil Kohler, to support his false account of the acquisition of the mobile phone by saying that they were at the hotel when he bought the phone, but, as Mr Painter also acknowledged in evidence, he became aware that these men did not support his story when they were summonsed to give evidence before the Commission. 
     
      
    11 Indeed, on 16 October 2000, Mr Painter was again summonsed to give evidence before the Commission and in the course of questioning was informed that Mr Kohler had told the Commission he was not with Mr Painter on any occasion when he purchased a mobile phone at a hotel. Nevertheless, in extensive questioning on 16 October 2000, Mr Painter did not retreat from his explanation as to how he obtained the mobile phone that was seized in the execution of the warrant. 
     
      
    12 On 16 October 2000 Mr Painter said he did not know the accused John Jacobs and he was asked these questions (pp 27-28 of transcript of evidence of 16 October 2000): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q You’ve already said that you don’t know Mr John Jacobs. Well, I can tell you that Mr Jacobs is known to Mezz. It may not be of significance to you, but Police investigations have ascertained that Mr Jacobs rang Mezz at 11.35 on the day Mr Cole was assaulted. The 3rd of March. 11.35 he rang him. Now at 24 minutes past 1, Mezz rang you. 
         
         
        A. Uh huh. 
         
         
        Q. And at 13.25, he rang you. And at 13.31 he rang you. And at 13.38 he rang you. At 14.46 he rang you. And at 16.29 he rang you. So he rang you, when you were in Campbelltown. Because your phone put you in Campbelltown at that time. 14… or 16.29 is about ten to fifteen minutes prior to the assault. Right? You’re in Campbelltown, in the vicinity, and Mezz rings you. Now at 21 minutes past 6, you rang him. So you obviously do have his number. And the significant thing about that is that you’re in Campbelltown, you’re talking to another suspect. That suspect’s talking to Mr Jacobs. Now the interesting thing about Mr Jacobs is that during the course of Mr Cole’s robbery, there were two mobile phones stolen. You finished up with one. Mr Jacobs finished up with the other. See the significance now of you talking to Mezz? Well, he’s talking to you and he’s talking to Jacobs. You both finish up with phones that are stolen during the course of a robbery that turns into a murder. You’re in the vicinity of the murder at the time. The circumstantial case against you is starting to mount up, and I can tell you that it’ll continue to mount up. As I’ve told you before, at some stage, you’re going to have to tell the truth. What you’re telling us at the moment is not the truth. Now do you know Mr Jacobs? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q., Did Mezz tell you about another person who is also detained by the Police because they had the phone? The other phone? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You sure? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you ever advised by these, by Mezz or by anybody else what to say to the Police when you were interviewed? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You sure? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. See, there were three of [sic] four, depending on what witness version you look at, at least probably four persons involved in the assault on Mr Cole. At the moment the primary suspects are you, Mr Jacobs and Mezz. It will be a matter of time before we discover who the fourth person is. What do you say to that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. [No audible reply]” 
        
       
      
    13 In further evidence on 16 October 2000, Mr Painter denied participation in the robbery of the deceased and he denied providing any assistance to those involved in it. He expressed a willingness to provide a copy of his fingerprints to the Commission. 
     
      
    14 On 6 April 2001 Mr Painter was again called to give evidence before the Crime Commission and was cross examined about certain phone conversations which had been intercepted. Those phone intercepts included the interception of a conversation between Mr Painter’s girlfriend and Mr Kohler’s girlfriend. The intercepted conversation appears to have related to Mr Kohler not having supported Mr Painter’s version as to how the latter acquired the mobile phone and to the maintenance of the friendship between the two women notwithstanding what had occurred between the two men. I propose to record here some detail of what occurred in the Crime Commission on 6 April 2001 because of the submission made by Mr Pike in reliance upon s 138 of the Evidence Act. This questioning occurred at pp 28-29: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you recognise those voices? 
         
         
        A. I think so. 
         
         
        Q. Who are they? 
         
         
        A. Sounds like Taneill. 
         
         
        Q. And? 
         
         
        A. My brother’s defacto I think, Diane I think. 
         
         
         [TAPE PLAYING] 
         
         
        Q. Do you know the person they’re referring to as Rocky? 
         
         
        A. I think so yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Who’s that? 
         
         
        A. It’s one of Taneill’s friends I think. 
         
         
        Q. Could it have been Neil Kohler’s girlfriend? 
         
         
        A. I think it’s his girlfriend too yeah. 
         
         
        Q. So when there’s a reference to, ‘Whatever happened between the boys I don’t want it to affect us’ do you think that could have been referring to the incident between, where Coller rolled over and gave evidence to the Commission that in fact he wasn’t with you when you acquired the phone? 
         
         
        A. Could be. 
         
         
         [TAPE PLAYING] 
         
         
        Q. Diane speaking with Taneill says that it could send Chris to gaol. ‘He didn’t do it he was there unluckily.’ That’s a reference to the robbery? 
         
         
        A. I’m unsure. 
         
         
        Q. Well I suggest to you that this is a reference to the robbery at Colley’s Café that occurred on the 3rd of the third 2000. Diane is saying that you were there unluckily and it could send you to gaol. What do you say to that? 
         
         
        A. I don’t know what she meant or what she’s talking about, what she meant. 
         
         
        Q. Well Diane says he shouldn’t have, this is reference to Neil Coller, ‘He shouldn’t have but he had no need to sign the papers and go to court against him.’ Now that’s a reference to Mr Coller. 
         
         
        A. Uh-huh. 
         
         
        Q. I say giving evidence against, or contrary to your version. Do you agree with that? 
         
         
        A. Yeah it sounds like it.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Commissioner, Mr Bradley, then interrupted the questioning by Mr O’Connor, who was assisting the Commissioner. I record this exchange between the Commissioner and the witness: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “…You see Mr Painter what you’ve been played is a conversation between two people, one of whom is intimately known to you and they agree that you were there but you didn’t do the deed which we are most interested in. Do you understand that? 
          
         
         
        A. I think so yeah. 
         
         
        Q. We think they’ve got it right. We think you were a bit unlucky. We think somebody went a bit too far. We don’t think it was you. We might be wrong about that someone might tell us that in due course because this inquiry will go on and on until we know exactly what happened. 
         
         
        A. Uh-huh 
         
         
        Q. But at the moment we don’t think you did anything that killed anyone. Do you understand? They don’t think you killed anyone either. 
         
         
        A. Who’s they? 
         
         
        Q. These people that are talking on the phone Taneill and Diane. 
         
         
        A. Oh right. 
         
         
        Q. What’s been put to you by Mr O’Connor is, they know because they’re close to you and they’re close to Jason and you’re close to Jason. And Darren and one or two other people that have been mentioned today. And just say they are right, say we’re right, say you were there, you went along to relieve someone of something for your own benefit. 
         
         
        A. What’s relieve someone what does that mean? 
         
         
        Q. We think that some people of which you were one went along to Colley’s Café to take his drugs and money. See. But one of the people who you went along with went a bit over the top and Mr Cole died as a consequence. Do you understand that? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. That’s what’s being put to you? 
         
         
        A. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    16 The Commissioner then said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Alright. Now you can give evidence about that we would suggest and we also suggest that you ought to give evidence about that. I can understand why you might have some reasons for not wanting to do that. Think it might be misguided loyalty to some mates. Mates like Jacobs and Majahar or more likely that you might be concerned that persons who do these sorts of violent acts might want to do something violent to you should you cooperate with this inquiry. Now because we can demonstrate that you’ve told a lot of untruths about matters which are material to our inquiry, you’ve already put yourself at substantial risk. It’s also the possibility and you should talk to Mr Roberts about this that you could be charged with other criminal offences as well. Especially if you’ve been involved in, if you’ve had knowledge of an offence that you’ve not disclosed. If you’ve caused other people to tell untruths about that and you’ve told untruths yourself. An alternative course would be for you to give a truthful account of what you know. That would eliminate the necessity for us to go through all of these other witnesses whom we think can put little pieces in the jigsaw. We’re not really interested in prosecuting Taneill or anyone else who we think have told lies in this matter it’s necessary for us to interrogate them with the possible sanction of being prosecuted for telling lies so that we can find out what the facts are. But you can short-circuit that whole process by giving an accurate account of what happened. You can do that without causing any further criminal liability to yourself. In other words if you tell me that you were there and you tell me who else was there and what happened then those answers can’t be used against you. But if you need some assurance about that you can talk to Mr Roberts about it. There is some more material which we have which hasn’t been disclosed to you, some if it will be today. None of it would suggest that what I’ve said to you is wrong, most if it suggests that what you’ve been saying up till now is wrong and I think it’s time you thought about the course that you’ve set for yourself. Now without even telling us what you know it’s possible for you to explore through Mr Roberts what the consequences of telling the truth might be. But if you sit there and continue to say that you can’t remember or give false accounts of what happened then you’re just digging a deeper hole and the hole is quite deep it’s not a matter about which you can say on the one hand there’s a serious matter, on the other hand there’s a less serious matter. At the end of the day it’s very serious. Whichever you do. Now there are some things that you might not understand about what could happen if you were to tell the truth and as I said to you through discussion with Mr Roberts and Mr O’Connor those things can be explained to you more carefully. We think you’re in quite a bit of trouble already and we don’t think you should get into any more trouble. Now do you want to think about your position and have a talk to Mr Roberts or do you want to go on? 
         
         
        A. Yeah that’d be okay yeah, is that alright but?…” 
        
       
      
    17 A short adjournment then followed. I am satisfied from the evidence on the voir dire that what then occurred was that Mr Painter took advice from his solicitor, Mr Roberts before returning to give his version as to what occurred at the deceased’s shop on 3 March 2000. He told the Commissioner that he was present with the accused and the Commissioner interrupted, with the following exchange then occurring: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Right. Now I know that Mr Roberts would have given you some advice about this and I know there’s been some discussions between Mr Roberts and Mr O’Connor. 
         
         
        A. Uh-huh. 
         
         
        Q. The thing I want you to understand very clearly is that we regard this as a very positive thing that you’re doing but you must tell us everything and you must get it all right. Now you might think oh well if I leave that little bit out of it someone won’t get into trouble or if I leave something else out it won’t make me look so bad or whatever and that’s an understandable human reaction. But the problem with that is that as we go through this process at the end of the day we will know everything, and it’s very important that we get everything that you can tell us, do you understand? 
         
         
        A. Uh-huh. 
         
         
        Q. Because if you’ve left something out or you’ve told us something that’s not true then how we act in the matter thereafter will be affected by that you see? 
         
         
        A. I don’t know what you mean by that? 
         
         
        Q. Right well if you say to us this is what happened and you don’t quite get it right then we might take a different view about what you’ve told us than what we do if you tell us everything. 
         
         
        A. Alright. 
         
         
        Q. See as I understand it you want to tell the truth… 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q …all of it? 
         
         
        A. Uh-huh. 
         
         
        Q. Right. And you understand that you’re not increasing your criminal liability doing that, alright. But it’s very important that you get it all right. Now you might make a mistake and that’s understandable and I understand that it’d be a stressful thing for you and the last few months have been very stressful for you as well and we’re not here to catch you out on making mistakes but you must make a proper attempt to tell us everything… 
         
         
        A. Tell you the best I can. 
         
         
        Q. Mm. 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Right you understand that? 
         
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Right. 
         
         
        A. The best I can I’ll tell you.” 
        
       
      
    18 Mr O’Connor then questioned the witness and he gave an account of what occurred in the shop. He said that he saw “Mazin” hit the deceased in the side of the head and he saw John kick the victim Phillips whilst he was on the ground.  
     
      
    19 The proceedings were then interrupted and the Commissioner invited the witness to sit down “in a less formal environment” with Mr O’Connor and Mr Roberts to give a statement. That is what occurred. 
     
      
    20 I accept the evidence which Mr Roberts gave about the procedure which was adopted in obtaining his client’s statement. I accept the following evidence given by Mr Roberts (p 35 of the evidence taken on the voir dire): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Was anyone else present besides you, Mr Painter and Mr O'Connor? 
         
        A. I think there was a lady present who was doing the typing I think she was doing the typing of the statement. I am not too sure. 
         
         
        Q. How was the statement prepared; what was the process? 
         
        A. Well from my recollection it was that a question Mr O'Connor would ask a question, Christian would answer the question and it would be put in a statement form. And at the end of the statement Christian was given the statement to read and he read over it and - he appeared to read it - and he signed it. 
         
         
        Q. Well at any stage did Mr O'Connor tell Mr Painter what he should say?  
         
        A. No. From my recollection is that Christian was the one who was saying what had happened and Mr O'Connor was trying to get it into the proper form as to getting the events in some sort of chronological and meaningful order, and I think that that's the way that the activities took place.” 
        
       
      
    21 In the version of events recorded in the statement taken on 6 April 2001, Mr Painter said that he took the mobile phone from the deceased’s car which was parked outside the shop. His version on 6 April inculpated both accused in what occurred on the premises, although his version was inconsistent with the account of the victim Mr Phillips in a number of respects, not the least of which was Mr Painter said it was the accused Mazin Mehajer who struck the deceased. 
     
      
    22 In his evidence on the voir dire Mr Painter said that, having made the statement, he later told the police he was not willing to testify, and I accept that this is so. 
     
      
    23 Mr Painter did attend the Campbelltown Police Station to supply a set of fingerprints on 26 April 2001 and then on 29 May 2001 he was charged with doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice. So, too, was his brother Jason. Those charges of course related to the false accounts about the circumstances of the acquisition of the mobile phone. 
     
      
    24 I accept that after being charged Mr Painter changed his mind and, as he said in his evidence on the voir dire, he decided, after speaking to his solicitor, that he would assist by giving evidence. 
     
      
    25 On 18 July 2001 Mr Painter gave a further statement to the police at the Liverpool Police Station concerning the events of 3 March 2000. Once again that account, consistently with the account given on 6 April 2001, inculpated both accused, although again there were inconsistencies between his account and that of the surviving victim. 
     
      
    26 On 28 July 2001 Mr Painter attended the crime scene with police officers, giving an on-the-spot account of what took place, and that was recorded on video and became Exhibit B on the voir dire. 
     
      
    27 Mr Painter, having pleaded guilty in the Local Court, adhered to his plea in the District Court concerning the attempt to pervert the course of justice and was sentenced by his Honour Judge Coleman QC on 29 October 2001 to a fixed term of six months imprisonment, suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The sentencing judge directed that Mr Painter be released from custody conditionally upon his entering into a good behaviour bond for the term of the sentence. In imposing that sentence the judge took account of the assistance given by the offender to the authorities and the offender’s undertaking that he would give evidence against the accused presently before the Court at their trial now pending. 
     
      
    28 This concludes the narrative of events as I have found them to have occurred. It is against this background that Mr Pike’s application is to be considered. 
     
      
    29 The police officers principally involved in the investigation of the death of the deceased were Det. Sgt Box, Det. Sgt McLean and Const. Scanlon. Each of those officers gave evidence on the voir dire and I do not understand it to be suggested that any one of those officers behaved improperly. None of them was involved in the events of 6 April 2001 and it is unnecessary for me for present purposes to record a detailed review of the evidence each of these witnesses gave. 
     
      
    30 Det. Sgt Box was involved in taking the first of Mr Painter’s statements on the date the mobile phone was seized from his girlfriend, but he had no involvement in the taking of the statement of 6 April 2001, nor did he have any contact with Mr Painter in the period between the making of those two statements. 
     
      
    31 Det. Sgt Box, having learned from Mr Roberts that Mr Painter was willing to give evidence against the accused, took the further induced statement of 18 July 2001, and he was then present at the interview on 28 July 2001 at Colie’s Café (recorded in Exhibit B) 
     
      
    32 Det. Sgt Box was asked these questions and gave these answers (T 53 on the voir dire): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you ever put to Mr Painter a version of what you believed had taken place at Colies Cafe on 3 March 2000? 
         
        A. Never, never. 
         
         
        Q. Did you ever discuss with him what evidence you had gathered in relation to those events? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Did you ever suggest to him that his role in the events of that day were of a minor nature? 
         
        A. No, never. 
         
         
        Q. Did you ever talk to Mr Painter about the question of an indemnity for prosecution? 
         
        A. Never.” 
        
       
      
    33 I accept the truthfulness of the above evidence. 
     
      
    34 Det. Sgt McLean was involved in investigations as from 3 March 2000 but was not involved in the taking of Mr Painter’s first statement on 14 June 2000. Nor was he involved in the taking of the statement at the Crime Commission on 6 April 2001. His recollection is that he had no contact with Mr Painter until after 6 April 2001 (T 70 on the voir dire). Det. Sgt McLean was one of the arresting officers when Mr Painter was charged with doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice and he was present at the crime scene interview on 28 July 2001. 
     
      
    35 Det. Sgt McLean was asked these questions and gave these answers (T 72 on the voir dire): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you ever give to Mr Christian Painter any version of what you believed had happened at Colies Cafe on 3 March 2000? 
         
        A. No, definitely not, sir. 
         
         
        Q. Did you ever talk to him about his role, possible role, in those events? 
         
        A. No, I - I didn't play an active role in any conversation with him in relation to his - other than what you see on that video, certainly I was present there, and I asked some questions on that day. 
         
         
        Q. Did you ever suggest to him that you believed that his role in those events might be of a minor nature? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Did you ever speak to him in connection with the possibility of his obtaining an indemnity from prosecution? 
         
        A. No, I didn't.” 
        
       
      
    36 I accept the responses recorded above as being truthful. 
     
      
    37 Det. Snr Const. Scanlon’s first contact with Mr Painter was on 20 June 2001 at Campbelltown Local Court and he saw him at the Liverpool Police Station on 18 July 2001 when the induced statement was taken. The officer was asked these questions and gave these responses (T 116 on the voir dire): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you ever discuss with him the question of whether he would be given an indemnity or might be given an indemnity from prosecution? 
         
        A. Never, no. 
         
        Q. Did you ever have a discussion with him in which you suggested that his role in the events that led to the death of Mr Cole were of a minor nature? 
         
        A. No, I did not. 
         
        Q. Apart from when the statement was being taken or the walk-through of the crime scene which was recorded on video, did you discuss what evidence he might give, with him? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    38 I accept the truthfulness of the above evidence. 
     
      
    39 I find that there was no behaviour on the part of any one of the above police officers such as would warrant consideration of the possibility of excluding evidence by Mr Painter under s 138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    40 Mr Pike’s submissions focussed on what occurred at the Crime Commission on 6 April 2001; the questions asked of Mr Painter concerning the intercepted telephone conversation between his girlfriend and the girlfriend of Neil Kohler; the subsequent intervention of the Commissioner as recorded in the extracts from the transcript which I set out earlier; and the circumstances in which the later evidence was then taken. 
     
      
    41 Mr Pike submitted the witness was alerted to the peril to which his family and friends were exposed and of his capacity to “short-circuit the whole process”. The suggestion was made that his involvement was minor and there was the prospect of an indemnity if he assisted the authorities. The impropriety in what occurred on 6 April 2001 was identified by Mr Pike in his written submissions in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        “To tell Painter in the circumstances he found himself during the course of the Commission investigation that his role was minor, and to apply the other pressures, placed almost unbearable pressure upon a young man like Painter. In a very real sense he was being forced to play the hand he was being dealt by a jaundiced process. There was a chain of causation between the impropriety and the obtaining of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    42 Mr Pike submitted that there seemed to be no good reason why the Commission should have considered Mr Painter’s role in the events of 3 March as being a minor one, particularly since the witness had lied to the Commission and to the police from the outset and had enlisted others to support him in his deceit. 
     
      
    43 Further, Mr Pike submitted that the process by which the written statement was taken on 6 April was flawed. 
     
      
    44 I am not persuaded by Mr Pike’s submissions and I prefer those to the contrary advanced by the Crown. 
     
      
    45 I do not find impropriety in the circumstances in which the evidence given by Mr Painter came to be given eventually before the Commission on 6 April 2001 nor in the circumstances in which Mr Painter made his written statement on that date. 
     
      
    46 “Improperly” is not defined in the dictionary for the purposes of s 138 of the Evidence Act or otherwise. However, in its ordinary meaning the word involves or connotes some sense of wrongdoing. The word “improperly” is expressed as an alternative to “contravention of an Australian law” in s 138(1)(a), and s 138(1)(b) contemplates the possibility of exclusion of evidence obtained “in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law”, subject to the balancing exercise contemplated in sub-s (1). 
     
      
    47 Section 138(2) focuses on various ways in which evidence is taken as having been obtained improperly. The sub-section is not exclusive of other circumstances in which evidence may be obtained improperly, but the circumstances it specifically contemplates do involve inappropriate behaviour in obtaining the evidence. 
     
      
    48 Then s 138(3) raises as a matter to be taken into account whether the impropriety was “deliberate or reckless”. 
     
      
    49 In Director of Public Prosecutions v Carr 127 A Crim R 151 Smart AJ had occasion to consider s 138 of the Evidence Act in circumstances very different from those now before this Court. However, there are passages in his Honour’s judgment which are of general relevance to the language of s 138. Smart AJ drew attention to the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission’s report prior to the Evidence Act which, as his Honour observed, are embodied in s 138: 
     
      
       
        
        “31 The Australian Law Reform Commission Report which preceded the  
        Evidence Act 1995 
         reviewed the then existing discretion to exclude improperly obtained evidence including the public interests supporting admission and those supporting exclusion. The ALRC did not discuss what ‘improperly’ meant. It recommended that an approach based on the existing discretionary approach be adopted. It suggested that the conflicting concerns in this area and the wide variety of circumstances necessitated such an approach. It proposed some changes. It recommended that the nature of the conflicting interests which should be balanced should be indicated precisely and the articulation of factors which should be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion. The report adopted the comment of Stephen and Aickin JJ in  
        Bunning v Cross 
         (1978) 141 CLR 54 at 74 that what is involved ‘is no simple question of ensuring fairness to an accused but instead the weighing against each other of two competing requirements of public policy.’ 
        
       
       
        
        32 The report listed a number of factors which it suggested were relevant to the balancing discretion. It was pointed out that if the impropriety was the result of a mistaken belief by an officer that he was entitled to do what he did this would tend to reduce the seriousness of the misconduct. However, it was noted that it was largely irrelevant to the criminal suspect that his rights were infringed deliberately or mistakenly. He has suffered the same damage regardless of the mental state of the officer. 
        
       
       
        
        33 The recommendations of the Law Reform Commission have largely been embodied in s.138. Among the matters that the Court is to take into account under s.138 is the nature of the relevant offence and the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding and the gravity of the impropriety.” 
        
       
      
    50 His Honour then went on to make the point with which I respectfully agree that the word “improperly” and the phrase “in consequence of an impropriety” should not be narrowly construed: 
     
      
       
        
        “34 Section 138(2)(a) deems evidence of an admission and evidence obtained in consequence to have been obtained improperly if the questioner knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission of the questioner was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally. Section 138(2)(b) also deemed evidence to have been obtained improperly if the questioner made a false statement knowing or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person being questioned to make an admission. Actual knowledge is a subjective matter. The test of ‘ought reasonably to have known’ is objective. Put very broadly, s.139 provides that for the purposes of s.138(1)(a) evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning or official questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if the questioner does not administer a caution. Questions of knowledge or intent are not relevant under s.139. Under s.138(1) and (3) it is not necessary for there to be the subjective element of bad faith or abuse of process or abuse of power or intentional wrongdoing in relation to the offence of offensive language. Section 138(2) and s.139 indicate that the word ‘improperly’ and the phrase ‘in consequence of an impropriety’ should not be narrowly construed.” 
        
       
      
    51 A value judgment is required in all the circumstances of the particular case as to whether evidence is to be considered as having been obtained improperly. 
     
      
    52 The evidence available to the Crime Commission as at 6 April 2001 justified the conclusion that prior to the interruption of Mr Painter’s evidence on that date he had not been telling the truth, and the objective of the Commission was to ascertain the truth. The witness was afforded the opportunity to give a truthful account of his involvement and the Commissioner used language that made it plain that what was being sought was the truth. In the passage recorded at para 16 above the Commissioner expressly posed as an option for the witness “to give a truthful account of what you know.” Later he used the words “but you can short-circuit that whole process by giving an accurate account of what happened”. And later: “Now without even telling us what you know it is possible for you to explore through Mr Roberts what the consequences of telling the truth might be”. And then still later:  
     
      
       
        
        “Now there are some things that you might not understand about what could happen if you were to tell the truth and as I said to you through discussion with Mr Roberts and Mr O’Connor these things can be explained to you more carefully.”  
        
       
       
      Then in the further remarks I recorded in para 17 above, the witness was once more enjoined to tell the truth. 
       
      
    53 The evidence from Mr Roberts and from Mr O’Connor as to the circumstances in which Mr Painter gave his written statement on 6 April 2001 do not disclose irregularity. I referred to Mr Roberts’ account earlier. Mr O’Connor in his evidence, acknowledged that an ERISP machine was probably available and hence could probably have been used, but it does not follow to my mind that it was improper to obtain Mr Painter’s account in the way in which it was obtained in the form of the statement that was taken. I do not find that any of the content of the statement was suggested to Mr Painter by any person in the room where the statement was taken. I entertain no disquiet on the evidence that what was recorded in that statement may have come from some source other than Mr Painter. In that context I am mindful of the evidence of Mr Roberts to which I referred earlier at para 20. 
     
      
    54 Before the interruption of the proceedings on 6 April 2001 Mr Painter was told of the Commissioner’s belief as to the extent of Mr Painter’s involvement. Whether that belief was at the time well founded it is difficult to judge. It is true, as Mr Pike submitted, that Mr Painter had consistently lied to the Commission and he had endeavoured to have others lie for his benefit. The evidence available to the Commission from Mr Phillips certainly did not exonerate Mr Painter and the intercepted telephone conversation that had taken place between the two women only expressed their views which were probably based upon what Mr Painter had told them. However, the Commission had heard evidence from witnesses other than Mr Painter prior to 6 April 2001, including the two accused. I do not know precisely what evidence the Commission had considered prior to that time, and I am unable to find that the Commissioner did not genuinely entertain the belief conveyed by him to Mr Painter in the remarks recorded in paras 15 and 16 above. 
     
      
    55 Turning to the question of an indemnity, it was Mr O’Connor’s recollection that the question of an indemnity was raised on 6 April 2001. His evidence about this (at T 79 on the voir dire) was this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Well, sticking with the occasion of 6 April 2001, do you recall what you said regarding an indemnity? 
         
        A. That the taking of an induced statement was the first step in making application for indemnity, should Mr Painter ask for one, and that at some stage later if he decided to give evidence on behalf of the Crown - something we wished him to do - that the Commission would make arrangements for an application to be submitted on his behalf and that we would be supportive of that. 
         
         
        Q. You said that you recollected that the question of an indemnity that had been raised by you on an earlier occasion? 
         
        A. Yes, I think I discussed it with Mr Roberts on the previous occasion that Christian had attended the Commission. 
         
         
        Q. Was Christian present during that discussion? 
         
        A. I don't think - oh, no. No, he wasn't. 
         
         
        Q. At any stage did you promise Mr Painter an indemnity? 
         
        A. No, that wasn't within my power.” 
        
       
      
    56 I accept the evidence above referred to and I observe that it is consistent with what later occurred. 
     
      
    57 Following the events of 6 April Det. Sgt Box gave evidence that work was commenced on an application in relation to a possible indemnity for Mr Painter. However that activity was suspended when Mr Roberts informed the police that Mr Painter would not be giving evidence. 
     
      
    58 Subsequently, when that decision was reversed, Det. Sgt McLean said that he prepared a lengthy submission forwarded to the Campbelltown office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Det. Sgt McLean’s evidence was that he prepared his report acting on advice from Det. Sgt Box. The evidence of Det. Sgt McLean at pp 72-73 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you have any involvement in preparing any reports with regard to the obtaining of an indemnity? 
         
        A. No, sir. I did prepare a - quite a lengthy submission which was submitted to the Campbelltown office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the exact date of that I'm not sure again. I can refer to my notes if you'd like. 
         
         
        Q. I think that was 23 July 2001? 
         
        A. Yes, that would be right. Certainly I prepared that report acting on advice from Det Box that I understood that he had received from the New South Wales Crime Commission and from an advice we received from the New South Wales Police Legal Services. Now I should point out that that submission was not to make application for an indemnity. Without having the document in front of me, it was merely a question to the Director as whether this person should be considered for an indemnity based on the evidence that he could give and the evidence that may be available against him should any proceedings be instigated against him.” 
        
       
      
    59 In addition to that oral evidence, there was the evidence, being an exchange of letters between the Crime Commission and Mr Roberts in Exhibit C. On 1 May 2001 Mr O’Connor wrote to Mr Roberts seeking confirmation of Mr Painter’s undertaking given on 6 April 2001 to give evidence on behalf of the Crown. Mr O’Connor advised Mr Roberts in that letter that that confirmation was required before an indemnity application was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration. Mr Roberts responded two days later advising that Mr Painter had decided he did not wish to give evidence. Exhibit C also contains a file note made by Mr O’Connor on 23 May and at that time Mr Roberts advised Mr O’Connor that his client did not wish to proceed with the indemnity application. 
     
      
    60 Considering the evidence in point, I do not find that there was impropriety in what Mr Painter was told concerning the possibility of indemnity nor do I find that there was any impropriety in the measures taken following 6 April 2001 in the pursuit of a grant of indemnity. 
     
      
    61 For the reasons I have expressed I do not find evidence was obtained improperly from Mr Painter on 6 April 2001 or subsequently in the statements taken from him on that date and on 18 July 2001. Nor was the evidence taken at the crime scene on 28 July 2001 tainted with impropriety. 
     
      
    62 In the circumstances therefore it is unnecessary for me to undertake the balancing exercise contemplated by s 138 of the Evidence Act. I should add that had I concluded the Commission behaved improperly in expressing its belief concerning the role of Mr Painter, in what was said by Mr Bradley (at paras 15-16 above), I would nevertheless have been minded to allow the evidence obtained on 6 April 2001 and in the later induced statement taken by Det. Sgt Box on 18 July 2001 because the desirability of admitting such evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting it. I would have done so after taking into account each of the elements referred to in s 138(3). It is apparent on the face of the remarks made by the Commissioner in paras 16 and 17 above that the witness was being urged to tell only the truth before he acted on independent advice to provide the evidence that followed such remarks. The crime here charged is murder and the evidence Mr Painter can give is very significant evidence. Of course whether it is ultimately acted upon by a jury is a matter to be determined in due course. 
     
      
    63 I conclude therefore that the evidence of Mr Painter ought not to be excluded under s 138 of the Evidence Act and the trial is to proceed accordingly.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: This Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence was heard on 10 April 2003. The Court dismissed the appeal on that day. These are our reasons for that decision.  
     
      
    2 The respondent, Candy Patricia Shannon, pleaded guilty before Christie DCJ to two counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, being under the influence of a drug: an offence under s 52A (3) (a) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. She also asked his Honour to take into account on a Form 1, two summary charges: driving under the influence of a drug and driving whilst her licence was suspended. On the first count his Honour sentenced her to a fixed term of nine months imprisonment, to date from 12 December 2002. On the second count, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, he sentenced her to imprisonment for eighteen months, also to date from 12 December 2002, with a non parole period of nine months. The overall sentence, then, was eighteen months with a non-parole period of nine months. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 The first offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm occurred on 17 November 2000. The respondent was driving from her home at Woolgoolga, when her car veered across double unbroken lines and collided with an oncoming car. Both cars were extensively damaged and she and the other driver were trapped in their cars for a period of time. The driver of the other car suffered severe multiple fractures to his left leg, severe bruising and lacerations and nerve damage to the right side of his face. A blood sample taken from the respondent revealed a level of morphine sufficient to have impaired her driving ability. It also detected the presence of cannabis, suggesting that she had used that drug recently. 
     
      
    4 On 31 July 2001 the respondent was stopped by police after she was observed to be driving erratically in the area of Valla West. Blood and urine tests on that occasion revealed a significant level of morphine and diazepam. This led to the first of the charges taken into account on the Form 1. On 9 August 2001, after she failed a medical test, her driver’s licence was suspended until 9 November 2005. The other charge on the Form 1, driving whilst suspended, arose from the fact that she was subject to that suspension at the time of the second offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    5 That offence occurred on 3 September 2001. Whilst she was driving in the Woolgoolga area, the respondent’s car again veered to the incorrect side of the road and collided with an oncoming car. The driver of that car suffered a number of injuries, including a closed head injury and facial neurological damage, as well as severe injuries to his left knee which could leave him with a degree of permanent disability. A blood sample taken from the respondent again revealed a significant level of morphine and diazepam, together with evidence of recent use of cannabis. 
     
      
    6 Apart from the suspension of her licence, the respondent’s vehicle was also unregistered on this occasion. She told police who attended the scene that the car had been driven by a man who had absconded. However, on the following day she admitted that she was the driver. 
     
      
    7 The bare recitation of these facts is alarming, but the offences must be understood in the light of the respondent’s unusual subjective case.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    8 The respondent was forty-seven years old at the time of the offences and is now forty-nine. She had a traffic record, of little significance for present purposes, but no previous convictions. She is married, although she was separated from her husband at the relevant time. That union produced a son, who was then in his mid-teens. She had two children, now adults, from a previous marriage. 
     
      
    9 Even though the relationship was over, her husband remained supportive of her and gave evidence. Also before his Honour were a pre-sentence report and a number of medical reports. She had worked as a teacher’s aide until she suffered a back injury in the mid-nineties. Since then she has had a number of health problems, both physical and mental. Difficulties faced by the children of her first marriage contributed to her mental state. At times both of them were living with her and her present husband. The son of the first marriage was a heroin addict, was prone to stealing and was suicidal. The daughter of that marriage became pregnant at the age of fifteen. 
     
      
    10 The respondent’s husband summarised the situation in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        Our marriage had been failing: the stress of Candy’s nervous breakdowns; Michael the eldest son, his heroin addictions; Kelly, Candy’s daughter, she’d at 15 years old, got pregnant, came home – we had six, seven people living in the house and I was trying to run the house because Candy was too sick to. We had doctors coming backwards and forwards. Most of the time Candy lives in the bedroom I suppose. So … that was what basically pulled the marriage apart. I’ve stayed as a friend and I go back and have time with my son most weekends, holidays.  
        
       
      
    11 He also explained that she was very close to their own son, William, who had helped care for her in recent years. As he put it, “William’s the sole purpose for Candy to live …”. This is significant when one considers her explanation for driving on 3 September 2001, while her licence was suspended and her car unregistered. She told police and the Probation and Parole officer that she needed to pick up William from school to take him to an appointment relating to his further education, and that she had arranged for a friend to drive her for this purpose but the friend had let her down.  
     
      
    12 Morphine and diazepam were both drugs which she had been prescribed. She was taking morphine as a slow release narcotic for her back pain and the diazepam as a sleeping draught. These were but two of a large number of drugs, including anti-depressant medications, which she had been prescribed over the years. A medical report described a history of “multiple physical problems”, including restless leg syndrome, pain syndrome and chronic back problems. In September 2000 she underwent lumbar spinal stabilisation surgery, but this did not relieve her pain.  
     
      
    13 Perhaps not surprisingly in all the circumstances, she had also been diagnosed as suffering from a major depressive disorder. She tried many anti-depressant medications but they did not help her. She had one admission to a psychiatric unit because of suicidal thoughts. She told the Probation and Parole officer that she felt “helpless and hopeless” about her medical conditions and resented having to rely upon medication to function.  
     
      
    14 Notwithstanding her plea of guilty to the first charge of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, she told the Probation and Parole officer that she did not consider that she had been at fault in that accident. As to the accident the subject of the second charge on the indictment, however, she expressed contrition which the officer accepted as genuine. In a handwritten statement to the sentencing judge she described her offences generally as “unforgiveable”. She wrote that she felt she had made progress, with support, in the period leading up to sentence and that she had begun to appreciate that there other ways of dealing with her many problems than resort to medication.  
     
      
       
      Reasons for sentence 
       
      
    15 Judge Christie clearly recognised the seriousness of the offences, particularly the second offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. He concluded that a custodial sentence was inevitable and, while expressing “the greatest sympathy for the prisoner’s predicament”, he had this to say:  
     
      
       
        
        Nevertheless I have a responsibility to protect the public, and to venture upon the roads on three occasions within a period of approximately a year, significantly influenced by prescription drugs, is just something the community would not expect the community’s representatives to tolerate. Judges are but representatives of the community …” 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour noted that the second offence of dangerous driving occasioning actual bodily harm was committed while the respondent was waiting to be dealt with in respect of the previous offences. He referred to the reformulated guidelines for offences under s52A of the Crimes Act in Reg v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343 at par [215] ff, accepting a sentence of two years as the appropriate starting point. However, he felt it proper to pass a lesser sentence because of the “very unusual objective circumstances” of the case and the “compelling subjective circumstances” of the applicant. This led to the sentence of imprisonment for eighteen months on the second count in the indictment, although it appears that his Honour saw that term as sufficient to reflect the criminality of all the offences. He made no reference to the question whether cumulative sentences were called for before passing the wholly concurrent term of nine months imprisonment in respect of the first count.  
     
      
    The appeal 
     
      
    17 The Crown prosecutor in this Court submitted that Judge Christie had fallen into error in a number of respects. He argued that: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) His Honour failed to determine the sentence appropriate for each of the counts of the indictment and then to consider the question of accumulation or concurrence, the exercise required by  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623-4. The proper exercise of discretion would have led to the imposition of cumulative sentences. 
         
         
        (b) The sentence on the second count was manifestly inadequate, given the objective seriousness of the offence. On that occasion, the respondent was aware from the earlier accident of the serious consequences which could result if she chose to drive while on medication. In addition, the other three charges were pending against her at the time.  
         
         
        (c) The sentence on the second count failed to give appropriate weight to the matters on the Form 1, themselves committed after the offence the subject of the first count. The Crown prosecutor referred to authorities on the proper approach to Form 1 matters, including  
        Reg v Harris 
         (2001) 125 A Crim R 27 and  
        Attorney-General’s Application under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
          
        1999 (No 1 of 2002) 
         [2002] NSWCCA 518. 
         
         
        (d) That sentence also failed to meet the need for deterrence, not only general but also particular, given the pattern of re-offending disclosed by the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (e) Finally, while not challenging his Honour’s finding of special circumstances, the non-parole period of nine months itself failed adequately to reflect the respondent’s criminality. 
        
       
      
    18 These were all arguments of substance, but we remained unpersuaded that the Court should intervene. As Judge Christie recognised, this was a most unusual case. While the offences were undoubtedly serious, they were committed by a mature woman of good character who was beset by severe emotional difficulties and plagued by poor health, both physical and mental. The drugs by which she was affected on the occasion of both accidents were part of a prescribed course of medication. (We put to one side the fact that cannabis was also detected on each occasion, a matter to which the Crown prosecutor made no reference in his submissions. As we understand the evidence, it did not contribute in any significant way to her manner of driving on either occasion.) 
     
      
    19 The Crown prosecutor’s argument that the sentence on the second count in the indictment should have been cumulative assumes that the first count necessarily called for a full time custodial sentence. In the unusual circumstances of this case, standing alone, it might not have done. If Judge Christie did assess an overall sentence for all the offences without separate consideration of the sentence appropriate for the first count, he would have fallen into the error identified in Pearce (supra). However, that error might well have been to the detriment of the respondent, resulting in a full time custodial sentence on that count when a more lenient disposition might have met the requirements of justice.  
     
      
    20 Given the respondent’s major depressive disorder, the question of general deterrence might have been affected by the special considerations governing offenders suffering a mental illness which were summarised by Gleeson CJ in Reg v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 70-1. However, this does not appear to have been raised before Judge Christie and it was not fully argued in this Court. Particular deterrence was a matter which required consideration but, as we have said, there was evidence of the applicant’s remorse and of her developing insight into her problems, including her dependence upon medication. While not expressed by Judge Christie, the conclusion that she was unlikely to re-offend was clearly open. 
     
      
    21 The circumstances of the offence the subject of the second count, together with the offences on the Form 1, might well have justified a higher sentence and non-parole period. On the other hand, the experience of imprisonment would be particularly severe for a woman of her age, background and state of health. In this exceptional case, we were not satisfied that his Honour’s sentencing order betrayed such inadequacy as to call for this Court’s intervention on a Crown appeal. 
     
      
    22 It was for these reasons that the appeal was dismissed.

An issue as arisen as to whether he is entitled to claim the privilege against self incrimination in respect of evidence that he would give as to his relationship with two of the co-accused in this trial, Diez and Lawrence. As I understand it, the accused, Cornwell, will give evidence, if he is permitted to do so without making himself liable for a prosecution for any other offence than the offence charged, that he, Diez and Lawrence, were from about January 2001 involved in the distribution of cocaine in New South Wales, that cocaine having been previously brought into the country by Diez or persons associated with him. 
       
        
       
      2 The evidence of possible involvement of Cornwell, Diez and Lawrence in the distribution of illegal drugs first came to light in conversations which the Crown sought to have admitted involving Cornwell and Diez and Lawrence and Cornwell and in respect of which it was open to the jury to conclude that those conversations contain material which indicates that those persons were involved with each other, that is Cornwell and Lawrence and Cornwell and Diez, in the distribution of narcotics which were at that time available to them. 
       
        
       
      3 As well as those conversations containing references to what the jury might find was the supply of drugs, the conversations also contain material that the jury might find was relevant to the charge before them in a more direct way, that is as to the involvement of those three persons in the conspiracy to import cocaine which is the subject of the charge. To some extent the different types of material in the conversations are intertwined. I admitted the evidence of conversations suggesting that Cornwell and Diez and Cornwell and Lawrence were involved in the distribution of drugs on the basis of the principle set out in 
        
      Harriman v The Queen 
       (1989) 167 CLR 590. I do not intend to indicate again why I believe that this evidence was highly relevant to the Crown case. 
       
        
       
      4 In the course of the debate about whether, if Cornwell gave evidence, he could claim privilege against self incrimination in respect of any question the answer to which would tend to suggest that he was involved in criminal offences other than the offence charged, the question arose as to whether s 128 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       applied. That section concerns the circumstances in which a witness can claim the privilege and the response of the court to such a claim. The section empowers a court, where it is in the interests of justice to do so, to require the witness to answer the question, notwithstanding the claim, but to provide the witness with a certificate protecting the witness from use later being made of the answer given to the question to which objection is taken. 
       
        
       
      5 Subsection 128(8) provides: 
       
        
         
          
           
          (8) In a criminal proceeding, this section does not apply in relation to the giving of evidence by a defendant, being evidence that the defendant:  
           
            
            (a) did an act the doing of which is a fact in issue, or 
             
            (b) had a state of mind the existence of which is a fact in issue. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      6 This subsection gives rise to a consideration of what is a “fact in issue” in a criminal trial. The Crown submitted that evidence as to the involvement of Cornwell in the supply of drugs was a fact in issue such was its importance to the proof of the offence charged. I do not agree. The term, “fact in issue” is not defined in the Dictionary of the Act or anywhere else in the  
      Evidence Act 
      . However it is a term that features in a number of sections of the Act not the least being s 55, the section dealing with relevance of evidence. I also note, without attempting to indicate all of the sections in which that phrase is used, that it also appears in s 94 of the Act, the section dealing with the application of the Part dealing with tendency and coincidence. I shall return to that section shortly. 
       
        
       
      7 In a note in its Report Number 26 Volume 1 at paragraph 641 note 3 The Australian Law Reform Commission stated: 
       
        
         
          
           
          “The expression ""fact in issue"" should be interpreted as referring to the issues in the proceedings defined by substantive law and pleadings and thus would extend to facts to be proved in undefended or ex parte proceedings.” 
          
         
        
       
      8 In my view a fact in issue in a criminal trial is any matter that must be ultimately determined by the jury in order to decide whether or not an accused person is guilty of the offence charged. A fact in issue in a criminal trial would generally be an element of the offence charged but might include any other matter that must be determined in order to find the accused criminally liable for that offence. It may include the issue of mental illness, self defence, or any statutory defences and, in a charge of murder, issues such as provocation and substantial mental impairment. They are examples of the fundamental issues that the jury must resolve in order to determine the charge brought by the Crown against the accused. 
       
        
       
      9 I respectfully agree with the view expressed by Odgers in Uniform Evidence Law (5th Ed, Lawbook Co) at [1.3.80] that a fact in issue is not any fact in dispute in the proceedings. It does not include those factual disputes the resolution of which may merely assist the jury in determining whether the accused has committed the offence charged. This is so regardless of how probative or significant the fact might be to either the Crown case or the accused’s defence of the charge. A fact does not become a fact in issue simply because of the way that the case is conducted by the Crown or the accused. It seems to me that, generally speaking, a court would be able to determine what was a fact in issue for a particular criminal proceeding without understanding the nature of the Crown case or the defence to it. 
       
        
       
      10 This is made clear by the reference to the term in s 94. That section is as follows: 
       
        
         
          
           
          94 Application 
           
          (1) This Part does not apply to evidence that relates only to the credibility of a witness. 
           
          (2) This Part does not apply so far as a proceeding relates to bail or sentencing. 
           
          (3) This Part does not apply to evidence of:  
           
            
            (a) the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or 
             
            (b) a tendency that a person has or had, 
            
           
           if that character, reputation, conduct or tendency is a fact in issue. 
          
         
        
       
      11 In order to determine whether Part 3.6 applies, and whether the tendency rule and the coincidence rule have any application, it is necessary to know whether the character, reputation, conduct or tendency of a person is a fact in issue in the proceedings. Because it is necessary for the party wishing to tender evidence falling within the tendency or coincidence rules to give reasonable notice of its intention to do so, there must be some understanding of what will be a fact in issue in advance of the proceedings. The question whether the Part applies and, therefore, the rules operate to exclude otherwise relevant evidence cannot depend upon the manner in which the proceedings are conducted by the parties. The character, reputation, conduct, or tendency of a person is a fact in issue only where any of those matters have to be determined in order to resolve the proceedings before the court. This is consistent with the view adopted by the Australian Law Reform Commission, see Report No 26 Vol 1 paragraph 786. Odgers cites examples of proceedings where such a matter might be a fact in issue, see at [1.3.6480]. 
       
        
       
      12 I believe that this view is supported in the judgment of the High Court in  
      Smith v The Queen 
       (2001) 206 CLR 650. The Court was there concerned with the relevance of evidence given by police officers purporting to identify the accused in security photos taken during an armed robbery. In the course of their joint judgment, their Honours Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, and Hayne JJ stated (footnotes not included): 
       
        
         
          
           
          [7]  
          In determining relevance, it is fundamentally important to identify what are the issues at the trial. On a criminal trial the ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged. They will, therefore, be issues about the facts which constitute those elements. Behind those ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue. In proceedings in which the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies, as it did here, the question of relevance must be answered by applying Pt 3.1 of the Act and s 55 in particular. Thus, the question is whether the evidence, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment by the tribunal of fact, here the jury, of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. 
          
         
        
       
      13 It seems to me that the reference to the “ultimate issues” is a reference to the facts in issue for the purposes of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . Earlier their Honours noted that the Crown case was that the appellant was the person who was shown in the security photographs, apparently keeping lookout while the co-offenders took the money. The joint judgment then states: 
       
        
         
          
           
          [4]  
          It was, therefore, a fact in issue on the trial of the appellant whether the appellant, the person standing trial, is the person depicted at the right-hand side of some of the security photographs. 
          
         
        
       
      14 As it was an element of the offence charged that the accused was a participant in the robbery (that is, that it was his act), and as the Crown sought to prove that element by identifying the accused as the person in the photograph, it is understandable that the Court should refer to the issue of identification as a fact in issue. Clearly this is an example of those cases where it would be appropriate to refer to a particular disputed factual matter as a fact in issue because the resolution of that fact will itself resolve a fact in issue. In other words, the particular factual dispute is synonymous with the relevant fact in issue. 
       
        
       
      15 In the present matter, I am firmly of the view that the issue whether the accused, or any one of them, were involved at the time of the alleged importation in the trafficking of narcotic goods is not a fact in issue. It is not an ultimate fact for the jury to resolve in order to find the charge of importation proved. It is simply a fact, which the Crown contends, is relevant to a fact in issue, being the participation of the accused in the conspiracy alleged. This finding leads me to the view that s 128(8) has no application in the present case, in so far as questioning of Cornwell in relation to his involvement in the supply of cocaine is concerned. 
       
        
       
      16 In my view, the accused Cornwell is entitled, notwithstanding s 128(8), to refuse to answer a question on the ground that the answer may incriminate him in relation to his involvement in the ongoing distribution of narcotic goods at or about the time of the alleged conspiracy. In particular, he is entitled to refuse to answer questions as to his relationship with other accused, in this case Diez and Lawrence, with regard to the distribution of drugs that were at the time in his possession or in the possession of some person associated with him. 
       
        
       
      17 He is not, of course, entitled to refuse to answer questions in relation to the importation of 120 kilograms of cocaine on The Flaning or any other importation of drugs being considered by him at the relevant time. Notwithstanding that the two matters are to some extent intertwined, that is his involvement in the ongoing supply of drugs and his involvement in a conspiracy to import drugs, they are separate and distinguishable. The Crown sought to put the evidence of drug supplying before the jury in support of the charge of importation. The accused should be able to put forward his defence to that charge without putting himself at risk of being prosecuted for other serious criminal activity. 
       
        
       
      18 The question then arises as to whether in respect of any question as to his involvement in the distribution of drugs with Diez, Lawrence or anybody else at the relevant time, the accused should be required to answer the question asked of him either in-chief or in cross-examination and either by the Crown or by any other accused. This question is answered by a consideration of whether it is necessary in the interests of justice to require him to answer the question. If it is, the consequence is that Cornwell is to be given a certificate. 
       
        
       
      19 It seems to me that the balance has to be struck as between different interests involved in the interest of justice. There is the interest in having a relevant matter being fully ventilated before the jury. There is the interest of the accused Cornwell in being able to place his defence fully before the jury notwithstanding that answers given by him might implicate him in other criminal activity of a serious nature. There are the interests of the co-accused in having a fair trial free from prejudicial evidence that is not strictly necessary for the jury to have in order to determine the offence before them. I have to take into account the interest of justice in so far as it involves a fair trial for both Diez and Lawrence in light of the evidence that Cornwell would give, if he were required to do so. 
       
        
       
      20 One of the matters that seems to me to be highly relevant is the fact that evidence of the involvement of Diez and Lawrence in the business of drug trafficking is already before the jury. In my view, a jury could well find that both Diez and Lawrence were involved in the business of supplying drugs already in the country at the time of the conversations which have been played to them. It seems to me that the inference of their involvement with Cornwell in the supply of drugs arising from those conversations is very strong indeed, if not overwhelming. 
       
        
       
      21 It is clear, and this is the basis upon which I admitted the evidence, that if the jury find that the conversations do relate to the supplying of narcotic drugs, that supply had been on foot for a considerable period of time. These are not conversations relating to an isolated, insignificant supply of drugs. The amounts of money talked about, the various people to which reference is made, what they have and what they do not have, what they are doing in relation to the business in which Lawrence and Cornwell were involved all seem to me to indicate a substantial venture in the supply and distribution of drugs at the relevant time. 
       
        
       
      22 The other matter that I take into account is that Cornwell apparently will give evidence that might implicate Diez in a very significant way in the importation charged. As I understand it, Cornwell will give evidence that Diez approached him and spoke to him about Cornwell becoming party to receiving the drug when it arrived from overseas. The amount of drug was thought to be in the vicinity of 125 kilos. Cornwell, as I understand it, will give evidence that the conversations, which have been played to the jury and which involve himself and Diez and himself and Lawrence, do in fact relate to, in part at least, the importation of cocaine and the jury could conclude that it is the cocaine which is the subject of the charge. 
       
        
       
      23 As I have already indicated, it is open to the jury to come to that view in any event because of the nature of the things spoken about in those conversation. But it seems to me that the evidence, which Cornwell might give, is on one view highly prejudicial to Diez and Lawrence, and flows simply from the fact that a co-offender has taken the decision to give evidence in his own defence and by doing so to implicate his co-offenders in the offence charged against him. That is not an unusual situation in joint trials and, generally speaking, courts do not grant separate trials because of the fact that the defence is one that is generally referred to as ""cut-throat"". 
       
        
       
      24 The other matter which seems to me to be relevant, although not relied upon necessarily by Lawrence's counsel Mr Waterstreet, is that it would be far fairer for Diez and Lawrence to be able to cross-examine Cornwell fully as to the allegations he makes against them, both as to their involvement in the conspiracy and their involvement in activity at the time of the conspiracy, rather than to be met with a partial cross-examination because Cornwell relies upon the privilege and refuses to answer questions asked of him on particular topics. 
       
        
       
      25 All of these matters have to be weighed up by me when considering whether it is in the interests of justice in the circumstances of this particular trial and the circumstances of the evidence that is placed before the jury and what they might make of it and what conclusions they may draw from it in support or against the Crown case that Cornwell should be required to answer questions and receive the benefit of a certificate if the privilege is maintained. 
       
        
       
      26 The Crown has indicated that it has no submissions to make in respect of that matter. The Crown has taken the view that I am wrong in permitting Cornwell to rely upon the privilege in respect of conversations involving the ongoing distribution of drugs between him and Diez and him and Lawrence. 
       
        
       
      27 In those circumstances, it is my present opinion that, if Cornwell refuses to answer questions about his involvement in the ongoing supply of drugs on the grounds that it might incriminate him, he is entitled to take that stance, but in the interests of justice I would require him to answer the questions and grant him a certificate in accordance with the section.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: On 25 March 2002 the appellant was indicted before His Honour Judge J X Gibson QC at Tamworth District Court on a count of aggravated sexual assault by digital penetration of the anus, the aggravating feature being that he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on the victim immediately before the sexual assault. The appellant pleaded not guilty. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on 28 March 2002.  
     
      
    2 A sentence of imprisonment for a term of two years and six months with a non-parole period of 12 months was later imposed, commencing on 5 July 2002. This sentence had been partially served when, following the first day of hearing in this Court on 18 December 2002, bail was granted pending the determination of the appeal. 
     
      
    3 The appellant and the complainant had married in October 1995. They separated in 1997 and were divorced in October 1998. The offence allegedly occurred on 30 April 2001. 
     
      
    4 In January 1997 the appellant suffered severe injuries in a motor vehicle accident. His chest was crushed, his diaphragm damaged, his stomach muscles torn and his spinal cord completely severed, resulting in paraplegia from his nipples downwards. In consequence, at the time of the alleged assault, he weighed 120 kilograms, with much of his weight distributed to his shoulders and arms. He used a wheelchair but had developed significant strength and agility. 
     
      
    5 The issue fought at trial was whether the physical and sexual assaults happened at all. It was not suggested that there was consent or a belief of consent. The credibility of the complainant and of the appellant were the key matters for the jury. It was put to the complainant that she had fabricated her allegation, inter alia with a view to getting compensation from the Victims Compensation Tribunal. 
     
      
    6 It is convenient first to summarise the defence case. 
     
      
    7 In his evidence at trial, the appellant said that the complainant had been to his house on numerous occasions in the four and a half years since he had moved there. He agreed that she had come on the day in question, but said that she never entered the house. She was crying and said that she had been to her mother’s grave. He asked her to leave and she did. He denied any sexual or other assault. 
     
      
    8 I have given a very abridged version of the defence case at trial. It was not accepted by the jury. The appellant does not suggest that the verdict was unreasonable in the sense indicated in s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    9 The Crown case rested upon the evidence of the complainant as corroborated by evidence as to complaint and medical evidence. 
     
      
    10 The complainant said that she went to visit the appellant at his invitation, arriving at around 1.30pm. He was at the front of the house when she got there and she went inside at his request. He made her coffee and they talked in the front lounge room. When she finished and was about to leave he said that he wanted to suck her breasts. She said: “No you don’t – I haven’t got a ring to say that you can do that or a piece of paper”. Her evidence as summarised in the Crown submissions was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        He grabbed the complainant by the back of the head and pulled her down forcibly to the side. She was crying and her neck hurt. He threatened to smack her or hit her if she didn’t let him suck her breasts: T 11. Her nose was running and he allowed her to get a tissue, but after she sat down on another chair in the front room, he came over to where she was sitting: T 12. He threatened to hit her if she didn’t stand up. He told her to take off her jumper and bra: T 13. She did so and he hit her breasts very hard twice on each side and bit her left nipple very hard: T 14. He told her to put her legs on either side of him while he was sitting in his wheelchair. When she did this, he asked her to put her arms around him and kiss him like she used to when they were married. She did all of this because she was fearful of her life: T 14. After she kissed him once, he hit her across the face and said, “do it again”. She kissed him again: T 14. 
        
       
       
        
        She tried to think of a way to escape and told him she needed a Panadol. Instead of letting her go alone to the bathroom where the Panadol was kept, he wheeled them towards the hallway to the bathroom and then followed her into the bathroom after she got off the wheelchair. She took out three packets of tablets. He watched her take one Panadol: T 15. He then asked her to pull down her leggings and underpants and put her hands on top of her head. After she did this, he slapped her breasts again very hard, grabbed her left nipple, punched her in the pubic bone area and pulled her clitoris very hard: T16. 
        
       
       
        
        The front of her leggings was ripped. He ripped them “probably before we went to the bathroom”: T16. 
        
       
       
        
        While in the bathroom, he told her to lean across his legs with her bottom in the air: T16. She could see that he was going to digitally penetrate her anus: “I sort of was a bit freaked and I squeezed my bum cheeks together and I said, “If you’re going to do that, use lubrication”: T17. He spat on his fingers and put two fingers up her anus very hard two or three times. She gritted her teeth and cried: T17. 
        
       
       
        
        He told her to pull up her underpants and leggings and go into his bedroom, which she did. He gave her a pair of blue tracksuit pants to wear. He retrieved her bra from the lounge room and she put that on but not fully. He gave her a black “boob tube” and denim dress to wear. The dress however did not fit: T18. She tried on the “boob tube” after asking him which way round it went. She finally ended up wearing the track suit pants, her bra and jumper, shoes and socks: T18. 
        
       
       
        
        He told her not to mention what had happened to the police or anyone else and she said that she wouldn’t. He wanted another kiss so she kissed him. He grabbed her head again “very hard” and said, “Have a nice afternoon”: T 18. 
        
       
       
        
        As she was about the leave, she received a telephone call. She said it was about 3pm. She was very upset at that stage and the Appellant was right next to her. The caller, Mr Luck, asked what was wrong because she sounded upset to him. She said, “I just came back from my mother’s grave out at Lincoln Grove” and that she was at a friend’s house, Donna Singleton: T19. Mr Luck’s Optus telephone bill (Exhibit C) established that this telephone call occurred at 3.10pm on 30 April 2001: Tr 114, 131. 
        
       
       
        
        The complainant left the Appellant’s house, taking her ripped leggings. She saw his mother arrive in the driveway as she left: T 19. 
        
       
       
      
    11 The complainant drove to the house of a friend, Donna Singleton, arriving in a visibly distressed condition. She showed her bruised left breast and made a complaint the details of which are addressed below in relation to Ground 3. The two women drove to the Tamworth police station where there was a complaint of sexual assault. This latter evidence was corroborated by the police officers involved. 
     
      
    12 The complainant was examined that evening by a general practitioner, Dr Kennedy. Photographic and other evidence attested to the fresh bruising in the upper body and left buttock. She repeated her complaint of sexual assault to Dr Kennedy and again to Dr Grotowski who was a member of the sexual assault crisis team who interviewed her three days later. The medical evidence from the two doctors was that the observed injuries were consistent with the history given by the complainant. 
     
      
    13 Again I have truncated the Crown case. It was challenged in a number of details. But it was clearly open to the jury to accept it, as they did. 
     
      
    14 An affidavit from trial counsel for the defence, Ms Francis was read in the appeal, without challenge. She referred to lines of defence that would have been pursued at trial in cross-examination and by the calling of witnesses had it not been for the trial judge’s rulings. 
     
      
    15 With this background I turn to the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The trial judge erred in excluding evidence of motive to fabricate a false allegation of sexual assault 
       
      
    16 In cross-examination of the complainant, defence counsel sought to raise the issue of motive to fabricate the allegations of assault. It was put to the complainant that she was seeking to obtain financial compensation and was motivated to lie in aid of that goal. 
     
      
    17 One strand of this cross-examination related to the possibility of a claim under the Victims Support and Rehabilitation Act 1996. Counsel put it to the complainant that she was aware of the Victims Compensation Tribunal and the complainant agreed that she had heard of that body. This line of questioning was taken no further. 
     
      
    18 The other strand of cross examination was developed somewhat more fully, but again the sting of the allegation was left somewhat hanging. The first ground of appeal asserts nevertheless that the cross-examiner was wrongly prevented from developing this line of attack on the complainant’s credibility. Wakeley & Bartling v R (1990) 93 ALR 79 was cited to support the proposition that counsel should be given leeway and not required to get to the ultimate goal by the shortest route. 
     
      
    19 The relevant passage in the evidence was as follows (Tr pp96-98): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. You’re aware aren’t you that the accused is due to receive in excess of a million dollars worth of compensation from his car injury? 
         
        A. I knew he was – I knew he was entitled to some money but I didn’t know how much. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’d had discussions with him hadn’t you that he was to receive in the order of about 3 million dollars? 
         
        A. No. All I knew is that he was entitled to some compensation ‘cause I was still legally married to him when he had his accident. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And at the time that you were legally married to him you indicated to him didn’t you that you’d spoken to a solicitor from Legal Aid and that they had indicated to you that you weren’t entitled to any of his money, but you loved him anyway? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What’s the relevance? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: It goes to motive your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Motive? What’s the motive that it goes to? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: That if there’s any fabrication involved in respect to the complaint that the possibility of compensation in respect to it is a live issue in this case your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Compensation? There’s a court for compensation in relation to criminal injuries? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Yes your Honour. Intend to ask the witness some questions about that as well your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: As well? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Yes sir. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I don’t think it’s relevant to establish whether she’s made a claim or not quite frankly. You can ask her that. 
        
       
       
        
        WITNESS: She can ask me --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No look --- 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Q. You’re aware of the Victims Compensation Tribunal? 
         
        A. I don’t think so. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.. And you had dinner with him at your father’s house? 
         
        A. I don’t think so. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you had dinner with him at your father’s house? 
         
        A. Not that I can remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’d had occasion to see the accused regularly since he had his accident since 1997? 
         
        A. I was still – I got a phone call from his mother in regards to his accident ‘cause I think I was living at my mother’s or my father’s place now at this stage saying that --- 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    20 It can be seen that the cross-examiner elicited from the complainant that, some time prior to the complaint, she knew the appellant was entitled to an unknown sum of money as compensation for his motor vehicle injury. 
     
      
    21 The question commencing “And at the time that you were legally married” was neither rejected nor pressed. It was left hanging, probably because counsel was deterred from pressing it by his Honour’s indication that he did not think it relevant to establish whether or not the complainant had made a claim upon her husband referable to the compensation moneys due to him. 
     
      
    22 The affidavit from trial counsel indicates that her instructions were that the complainant had told the appellant, whilst he was hospitalised, that she had sought legal advice in respect of her entitlement to the compensation exceeding $1 million that he was about to receive arising from his accident and her marriage to him at the time. The question that was left hanging was said to have foreshadowed a line of defence to the effect that the complainant had a particular need of money at the relevant time (namely to buy her sister out to purchase her father’s house when he passed away); and that she knew on legal advice (from Legal Aid) that she was not entitled to any of his compensation money because the couple had separated before the accident. 
     
      
    23 According to trial counsel, it was then going to be suggested that the complainant was motivated to fabricate the alleged sexual assault in order to obtain substantial compensation from the appellant (Affidavit par 9 (g)). Counsel states that the “ruling” that it was not relevant to establish whether or not the complainant had made a claim on the appellant cut short this line of cross-examination. It also meant that, when the appellant’s mother was called as a witness for the defence, counsel asked her no questions to establish that she had witnessed a conversation between the couple in hospital to the effect that the complainant had sought legal advice in respect of her entitlement to the compensation. 
     
      
    24 The judge’s words “You can ask her that” were interpreted by trial counsel as meaning that she could pursue questions about the Victims Compensation Tribunal, but not questions about whether or not the complainant had claimed a share of the accident compensation moneys. Later discussion between defence counsel and the judge confirmed this interpretation of his Honour’s ruling (Tr pp200-1).  
     
      
    25 The issue for this Court is to determine whether a line of admissible questions was stopped by the judge and whether this caused a substantial miscarriage of justice. In my view, each question should be answered in the negative. 
     
      
    26 It was nowhere suggested (at trial or in trial counsel’s affidavit) that the appellant had refused to share any of his compensation money with his former wife or that such a refusal stung the complainant into making a false allegation of sexual assault. On the contrary, the cross-examination was directed towards the goal of establishing that the complainant was motivated to lie in order to obtain compensation from the appellant out of his motor accident verdict moneys. How this could have come about is neither explained nor apparent. 
     
      
    27 Resolution of these issues is complicated by trial counsel’s failure to clarify the line of questioning she was pursuing in cross-examination of the complainant. It is therefore far from clear what was ruled to be irrelevant and what further questioning or evidence was blocked thereby. 
     
      
    28 In the course of discussion later in the trial (Tr p202), his Honour told counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        You can by all means, suggest that she did these things because she was trying to get money from him. She has denied it. You can suggest it. You don’t have to prove anything. The Crown have to disprove it. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    29 These remarks went to what counsel could say in final addresses. They also tend to confirm that the judge at least appreciated that the complainant had been cross-examined to the extent of suggesting a motive to lie associated in some way with the accident compensation moneys. 
     
      
    30 One suspects that trial counsel may have wanted to suggest that the complainant formed an intention to lie because she was either frustrated at her inability to get a share of the accident compensation moneys or, possibly, because she was prepared to use the threat to lie in order to extort a share. But these were serious allegations and counsel’s failure to press the matter at trial or to spell it out in her affidavit may reflect a gap or ambiguity in her instructions. 
     
      
    31 The persuasive onus rests upon the appellant. I am unpersuaded that admissible questions were stopped or that a substantial miscarriage of justice ensued. I would therefore reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: (Not pressed) 
       
       
      Ground 3: The trial judge erred in rejecting a submission that Donna Singleton could be cross-examined about the contents of a previous representation made by the complainant 
       
       
      Ground 4: The trial judge erred in declining to direct the jury that defence counsel had not acted improperly 
       
      
    32 The two grounds are related. 
     
      
    33 The complainant said that she “went straight around to Donna Singleton’s house”, which was not far from where the appellant lived (Tr pp19-20). She then gave the following evidence in chief (Tr pp20-1): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. When you got there, where was Donna Singleton? 
         
        A. She was across the road talking to one of her friends and I called her over because I was in hysterics after what happened and she asked me what was wrong and I said “I can’t say” and --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did she then do? 
         
        A. Then she asked me again and – because I was crying and shaking, like very shooken up and I just asked her well I’ll show – I showed her what happened but I didn’t show it in front of her son or her son’s friends, so we went into the bedroom and I showed her the left breast that was bruised. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Right. And did you say anything else to her about the clothing you were wearing at that stage? 
         
        A. No she didn’t. I basically changed out of Murray’s tracksuit pants back into my leggings ‘cause she sewed them up for me, and I told her to do what she wants with the tracksuit pants. And then she rang up a domestic violence 1800 number because I was that terrified, I didn’t know what to do, and then explained to the lady on the other line about what happened, and then she basically told me to report it to the police and go into a refuge, like a women’s refuge. But I was living at my father’s at that stage. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So after you’d had this conversation with the counsel [sic] what did you then do? 
         
        A. I went – Donna followed me, I went to pick up my son from a family day care at a lady’s house and dropped him off at his auntie’s place over in South Tamworth, to drop him off and then I went to the police station. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What time did you get to the police station? 
         
        A. Would have been probably roughly after 5 o’clock. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So how did you get to the police station? 
         
        A. I drove and Donna Singleton followed on behind in her car. 
        
       
       
      See also cross-examination at Tr pp93-4. 
       
      
    34 At the police station there was a complaint of physical and sexual assault and the complainant was sent to the Tamworth Base Hospital for medical examination by Dr Kennedy. 
     
      
    35 The complainant was not cross-examined about her conversations with Donna Singleton on 30 April 2001 beyond being asked to confirm that the only injury she showed to Ms Singleton was her left breast (Tr p94). Presumably matters were left where they were because the defence wanted to run the argument that sexual assault was not mentioned and that this showed that sexual assault had not occurred. 
     
      
    36 Let it be assumed that this option was open notwithstanding the possible application of the principles of fairness embodied in the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67. If matters had been left there, one would have thought that the defence case had not advanced very far. After all, the complainant was in an hysterical state and she showed her bruised left breast to Ms Singleton before the latter rang a domestic violence 1800 number and accompanied her to the police station. The evidence of Ms Singleton (summarised below) clearly showed that the two women had talked together for a lengthy period, so the complainant’s version in her evidence was obviously highly abbreviated. Nevertheless, the complainant’s own evidence allowed the argument to be put that an allegation of physical assault had developed into one of sexual assault between the first discussion with Ms Singleton and the arrival at the police station. (It is curious that no such argument appears to have been put to the jury: no reference to it appears in the summing up.) 
     
      
    37 On 1 May 2001 the complainant gave a detailed written statement to the police. It was never put into evidence at the trial. But it was available to the defence at all material times and the complainant was asked several questions in cross-examination about portions of it.  
     
      
    38 Paragraph 40 of the statement included the following (deleting certain names): 
     
      
       
        
        I talked to Donna about report (sic) this to the police and I finally decided to report that Murray had assaulted me. I didn’t tell Donna that Murray had also sexually assaulted me. Donna organised a babysitter for … and then followed me in my car to pick up my son… from his babysitter…. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    39 This part of the statement was not adverted to during the cross-examination of the complainant.  
     
      
    40 When her cross-examination was completed the complainant was excused.  
     
      
    41 The next witness was Ms Singleton. She gave evidence in chief about the complainant arriving at her home, shaking and very scared. The complainant burst into tears but was unwilling to say what had happened. She showed Ms Singleton her torn tights and Ms Singleton sewed up the crotch where it had been ripped. After a cup of coffee the following occurred, according to Ms Singleton’s evidence (Tr p105): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Right, and what was the next thing that happened? 
         
        A. I asked her the question again, I said “What’s wrong” and she said she couldn’t tell me, and I said “Look you may as well tell me now than later” and I gave her time, about half and hour, or an hour and a half later she came back and told me what happened. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Did she show you something? 
         
        A. Yes she did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how did that come about? 
         
        A. Well she told me that her ex-husband raped her and then she went to go and put her pair of tights on and she said “Look come in and I’ll show you”. She didn’t want to show in front of my kids and I said “Right, come in to the bedroom” and she showed me what he had done to her. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did she show you? 
         
        A. She showed me the bruises on her, like her breasts and where he hit her. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what was the next thing that happened? 
         
        A. Then she burst into tears. I said “Well come back out here” and I said “while we ring the domestic violence phone call” so I was talking to the lady on the phone and then I handed the phone to her and the lady said “It’s the best thing to do that, to go and report it to the police”. 
        
       
       
      
    42 The evidence in cross-examination on this issue is ambiguous (see Tr pp106-7). I read Ms Singleton’s answers as asserting that the complainant did not originally say in as many words that the appellant had raped her. Rather, this was elicited by a direct question to that effect from Ms Singleton. The answers were however somewhat confusing and, when there was no re-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, his Honour entered the fray. It is necessary to set out his questions and the further cross-examination that ensued before addressing the precise issues raised in Grounds 3 and 4: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Well I’ve got a question. You told this court that the complainant told you that her husband had raped her. That was your word wasn’t it? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you mean by that? 
         
        A. I asked her, I said “Did your ex-husband rape you or did he done something else instead of rape?” 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yeah, and what did she say to that? 
         
        A. Well she told me that she got raped and I said “That’s different than what”, it was different than rape than what other things that he done. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well I’m sorry, I still don’t understand? 
         
        A. Well she told me that she’d got raped, and I didn’t believe it. Then I asked -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened then? 
         
        A. I asked her again “Did he rape you” and she told me “Yes”. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes, and what were the other things that you understood that were different. 
         
        A. The ones that I understood I said it was different than rape to say sexual harassment or things like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she use the word “rape”? 
         
        A. Yes she did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she tell you what the actions were that her husband performed on her? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well I’m still trying to understand why you said that she didn’t tell you? 
         
        A. Well I didn’t ask --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That she was raped? 
         
        A. Well she told me that she got raped and -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yeah and you didn’t believe her, I understand that? 
         
        A. Yeah I didn’t believe her, but I didn’t go --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did she say after that? 
         
        A. She didn’t say nothing after that because she burst into tears and she was scared and I didn’t want to go into more details because it wasn’t my business. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Anything arising out of that? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The complainant, and you’ve already given this evidence, the complainant never said that her ex-husband had raped her did she? 
         
        A. Yes she did. Her ex-husband told – J…… told me that her ex-husband did rape her but I didn’t believe him, believe her and I didn’t want to go into any more details because it wasn’t my business. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You see when I asked you a question --- 
         
        A. Yeah I got a little confused. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Maybe if you could read this paragraph, paragraph 40 and just read that to yourself and indicate if you’d like to change your evidence? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, the witness is being shown the statement of the complainant, not the statement of the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Oh come on. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Section 44 your Honour, the representation --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Section 44. Well what does section 44 say? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: The complainant has already given evidence that she didn’t --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Just a moment, just be quiet for a moment please. See you never told this court that that was somebody else’s statement. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: No your Honour, the provisions --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Why not? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Because I’ve asked this witness -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I don’t care what you’ve asked this witness. Don’t you think that you might let me in on it? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: I was trying not to let this particular witness know -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I don’t care what you were trying to do. You see I run this court and I’m entitled to know the documents that you’re putting into the hands of the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Yes. Section 44 allows -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Look I’m not interested, I’m asking you for an explanation at this stage as to why you didn’t tell me what you were doing. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Because, as I understand section 44, I’m entitled to cross-examine the witness about it and -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You may well be, but I’m entitled to know what’s going on and the impression that was given was that the document you were giving to her was her statement. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: I informed the Crown when they had concerns that -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well the Crown doesn’t run this court, I do. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        WITNESS: Section 44, I haven’t got it there. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. You’re asked to read that particular -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour there’s a legal issue arising out of this which I really think -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Wait till I just read this first would you? It’s the old Queen’s rule, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: May I carry on your Honour? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well you already have, you’ve asked the question. You’ve been asked to read that particular statement and say do you want to change your evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Q. That statement indicates doesn’t it -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOR: No, no, no, you can’t ask that. You can ask her the question that you did ask specifically, and that’s it. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Maybe there should be some legal discussion about it in the absence of this particular witness. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No there’s no question about it. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: A cross-examiner may question a witness -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Please don’t, please -- 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Is your Honour not allowing me -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I am ruling that the question you asked is the proper question to be asked and that’s it. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Your Honour won’t entitle me to go any further? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now do you want to change your evidence? 
         
        A. No thank – no. 
        
       
       
        
        MFI #4 STATEMENT OF COMPLAINANT 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Q. And when you indicated now that the complainant did say that she had been raped, there was no further discussion about it at that stage? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, now what’s your problem Mr Crown that you want to raise? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, it’s a matter which really needs to be raised in the absence of the jury. It probably won’t come to very much but it’s something that needs to be placed on the record. 
        
       
       
        
        IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, section 44 as I read it says that the cross-examiner may question a witness about a previous representation alleged to have been made by a person other than the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, there’s been some evidence given about that. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes, but as I understand it, what my friend was talking to in paragraph 44 -- 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: No paragraph 40. Section 44. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Section 44(3). 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: The paragraph I was taking her to, asked her to read was paragraph 40. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It’s merely the old Queen’s case. It’s a situation where you can put a document in front of a witness that’s not their document and say “Having read that, do you still adhere to your prior evidence” and that’s the only question that can be asked and that’s clear from the question as well. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour, I don’t wish to take it any further because my understanding was that my friend was referring to paragraph 44. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yeah 44, she is -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Paragraph 44 as opposed to section 44. I couldn’t see how paragraph 44 -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Section 44 she’s referring to. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No I withdraw the objection. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Your Honour section 44(2) entitles the cross-examiner to question a witness about the representation of -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: And it’s contents. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Yes, if the representation has been admitted. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: So I’m seeking to cross-examine -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No, you put the document in her hand, not cross-examine her. You put the document in her hand, but once you put the document in her hand, all you can do is put the question that you asked. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Yes. In my submission I’m entitled to question -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I reject your submission. You’ve asked her the only question you could ask her. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Your Honour I might seek some instructions from my client in respect of this exchange that your Honour has had with me in front of the jury. Would you Honour give me -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well you can take such instructions as you see fit. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Would your Honour give me five minutes? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No well I’m bringing the jury back and you can take your instructions at 4.o’clock. 
        
       
       
        
        IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY 
        
       
       
        
        NO FURTHER RE-EXAMINATION 
        
       
       
        
        WITNESS RETIRED AND EXCUSED 
        
       
       
      
    43 Later that afternoon, not long before 4pm, there was the following exchange in the absence of the jury (Tr pp117-18): 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Have you got your instructions yet? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Yes your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yeah, what do you want to do? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Make an application for a discharge of the jury your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Why? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Because your Honour gave the impression to the jury that the accused’s counsel had acted dishonestly by not informing your Honour of the author of the statement --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No, not dishonestly. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: It was something that I’m entitled to do pursuant to s44. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You are entitled to bring it to my attention what you’re doing. I decide what the law is, not you and it’s not for you to put a statement from somebody else in the witness’ hand without informing the court. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Without having meant to have misled your Honour or the court, the issue is that the jury have been given the impression that what I did was improper, and in my submission it was not, it was something that I was --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well it was, in my opinion it was. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: I would ask your Honour to correct – if your Honour’s not prepared to discharge the jury and that application is pressed, then to at least indicate to the jury that it was something which the defence counsel was lawfully entitled to do, albeit if your Honour is not of the view that it was done in the proper fashion. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No, I’m not going to tell the jury that and I’m not going to discharge them. 
        
       
       
        
        SHORT ADJOURNMENT 
        
       
       
      
    44 Section 44 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        44 Previous representations of other persons 
         
         
        (1) Except as provided by this section, a cross-examiner must not question a witness about a previous representation alleged to have been made by a person other than the witness. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A cross-examiner may question a witness about the representation and its contents if:  
         
          
          (a) evidence of the representation has been admitted, or 
           
          (b) the court is satisfied that it will be admitted. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) If subsection (2) does not apply and the representation is contained in a document, the document may only be used to question a witness as follows:  
         
          
          (a) the document must be produced to the witness, 
           
          (b) if the document is a tape recording, or any other kind of document from which sounds are reproduced—the witness must be provided with the means (for example, headphones) to listen to the contents of the document without other persons present at the cross-examination hearing those contents, 
           
          (c) the witness must be asked whether, having examined (or heard) the contents of the document, the witness stands by the evidence that he or she has given, 
           
          (d) neither the cross-examiner nor the witness is to identify the document or disclose any of its contents. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) A document that is so used may be marked for identification. 
         
         
        
       
      
    45 Section 44(1) applied because the cross-examiner was questioning Ms Singleton about the “previous representation” made by the complainant in par 40 of the complainant’s statement to the police set out above. 
     
      
    46 Subsection (3) reflects the common law position, based on that part of the rule in The Queen’s Case (1820) 2 Brod & Bing 284, 129 ER 976 dealing with cross-examination on inadmissible documents (see Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 443, 464). Under that subsection, the cross-examiner was not permitted to identify the document or disclose any of its contents to the jury. But the document had to be produced to the witness, who then had to be asked whether, having read it, she stood by the evidence she had given. Judge Gibson ruled that the cross-examiner could proceed in this manner, so there can be no complaint on that ground alone. 
     
      
    47 However, his Honour made it plain that counsel should have informed him of her intention to proceed even thus far, and he chided her (both in the presence and absence of the jury) for effectively not having sought his permission before showing the document to the witness. 
     
      
    48 In my view, counsel was acting within her rights, even if she may have overlooked the need to inform the judge before taking the next step of revealing the contents of par 40 to the jury in accordance with s44(2) (discussed below). Section 45 of the Evidence Act also gave the trial judge a discretion to require production of the document and to admit it into evidence (see also Alchin v Commissioner for Railways (1935) 35 SR(NSW) 498 at 509). But it did not follow that counsel was at fault in putting the document to the witness without prior permission from the judge, so long as she did not transgress s44(3)(d) by identifying it or disclosing its contents to the jury. 
     
      
    49 Subsection (2) of s44 conditionally lifts the barriers that prevent identification of the document or disclosure of its contents to the jury. It permits the cross-examiner to question a witness about the previous representation and its contents, but only if: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) evidence of the representation has been admitted; or 
         
        (b) the court is satisfied that it will be admitted. 
        
       
      
    50 The complainant’s police statement, par 40 in particular, had not been admitted into evidence, so (a) did not apply. 
     
      
    51 The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in preventing the cross-examiner from endeavouring to satisfy the court that par 40 of the document would be admitted later, thus engaging s44(2)(b). 
     
      
    52 One problem confronting the appellant is the absence of material indicating that counsel ever intended or attempted to seek to persuade the court to be satisfied of this. 
     
      
    53 Logically, one should first consider the admissibility of the document, although (as will appear) it is unnecessary to reach a concluded view on that matter.  
     
      
    54 The admissibility issue was addressed at some length by Mr Odgers SC on the appeal. In its ultimate reformulation, the argument went thus: 
     
      
       
      1. Donna Singleton’s evidence that the complainant told her that  
      “her ex-husband raped her” 
       was relevant both to the credibility of the complainant and to the issues (as hearsay evidence relied upon to prove the truth of the complainant’s assertion that she had in fact been  
      “raped” 
       by the appellant). The jury were later directed that complaint evidence was admissible as evidence of the truth of the facts claimed in the complaint (SU 23). 
       
       
      2. If the Crown is entitled to rely on evidence that the complainant said she had been raped (to prove she had been raped), the defence must be entitled to rebut that evidence – by adducing evidence that the complainant did  
      not 
       in fact say that she had been raped. 
       
       
      3. Such rebuttal evidence would be relevant both to the credibility of the complainant and to the substantive issue in the trial. It would therefore not only be relevant to the credibility of a witness and would thus not be caught by s102 (to which s106 creates an exception): cf  
      Adam v R 
       (2001) 207 CLR 96. In  
      Adam 
      , the principle was relevant to both credit and an issue (albeit hearsay) and, since not excluded by s102, was admissible under s56 even if it was not admissible for a hearsay use under s59. 
       
      
    55 The Crown submitted that there was no inconsistency between the complainant’s oral testimony and par 40 of her statement. Each attested to the fact that no complaint of sexual assault was made to Ms Singleton. In these circumstances, the document was not relevant to the complainant’s credibility. 
     
      
    56 The Crown further submitted that par 40 was not admissible as to the issue of sexual assault. It could not rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding (cf s55). 
     
      
    57 Furthermore, the police statement was a hearsay assertion by the complainant as to what she had (not) done on an earlier occasion. It was a “previous representation” about an “asserted fact” (as defined in s59), namely what was (not) said in the complaint to Ms Singleton. This hearsay problem with the complainant’s statement meant that the evidence in par 40 of the statement was excluded by the hearsay rule (s59). 
     
      
    58 The difficulty with this last-mentioned submission of the Crown is that the complainant had personal knowledge of the asserted fact (s62); she was available to give evidence about the asserted fact; and the statement was made when the asserted fact had been fresh in her memory (see s66 and Dictionary, Part 2 cl 4). She was, in my view, available even though she had been excused. 
     
      
    59 The unfairness possibly implicit in the complainant not having been confronted about par 40 of her statement (upon which I express no concluded view) would not render the statement incapable of being admitted. But it will bear on the issue of substantial miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    60 I return to the Crown’s submission that the evidence was not relevant. I cannot accept that submission. Proof that the complainant made par 40 of her statement tended to establish the fact that the complainant spoke to Ms Singleton of a physical but not a sexual assault. If this aspect of her earliest complaint was true, it was material which, if accepted, could rationally affect the jury’s assessment of the probability of the ultimate issue in the trial. 
     
      
    61 It follows that par 40 was evidence capable of being admitted. This probably meant that it was open to the court at trial to be “satisfied that it will be admitted” in the language of s44(2)(b). (I simply flag the argument that the latter words might be read as referring to a present, practical reality at that stage of the trial, as distinct from a theoretical admissibility depending on certain additional matters, including making the complainant available by recalling her as a witness.) 
     
      
    62 The transcript is silent as to whether counsel ever intended to seek to satisfy the judge that par 40 was admissible as a prelude to confronting Ms Singleton with its contents in such a manner as to bring those contents to the attention of the jury. Counsel never made such an application. The silence of her affidavit also supports the conclusion that she never intended to do so, at least once her attention was drawn to the distinction between subs (2) and (3) of s44. If in those circumstances defence counsel was stopped in her attempt to confront Ms Singleton openly with the contents of par 40, no miscarriage ensued. The judge ruled that she was free to use the statement in accordance with s44(3). According to the transcript, his Honour assumed the cross-examiner’s role by asking the complainant whether she wanted to change her evidence; and receiving the answer “No thank – no” (Tr p110). Counsel chose not to do so, no doubt believing that Ms Singleton would remain firm in her testimony that rape had been discussed. The ruling did not prevent the defence from tendering par 40 of the complainant’s statement. 
     
      
    63 Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that trial counsel’s reference to s44(2) towards the end of the lengthy passage set out in par 42 above suggests that it was her intention to seek to invoke s44(2)(b). But there is nothing in the transcript or counsel’s affidavit to support this. It is true that counsel was interrupted by the trial judge twice when she was endeavouring to inform him of what she was seeking to cross-examine or question the witness about. But I read these interrupted submissions as counsel’s endeavour to tell his Honour about her intended line of questioning. Despite the passing reference to s44(2), counsel neither embarked upon nor foreshadowed an attempt to satisfy the trial judge that the written statement of the complainant, par 40 in particular, would be admitted into evidence (cf s44(2)(b), discussed above). 
     
      
    64 Ground 4 addresses the trial judge's refusal to direct the jury that defence counsel had not acted improperly in her manner of cross-examination of Ms Singleton. Having failed to have the jury discharged, counsel asked his Honour, ""to at least indicate to the jury that it was something which the defence counsel was lawfully entitled to do, albeit if your Honour is not of the view that it was done in the proper fashion"". 
     
      
    65 The appellant submits that there was every risk that the jury would conclude that his counsel was attempting to trick the trial judge by not informing him what she was doing, and giving the false impression that she was using the witness’ statement rather than someone else's. This would colour the jury’s assessment of the client's credibility. 
     
      
    66 The remarks in the absence of the jury (Tr p117-8) that are set out above show that the judge held a firm view that counsel had acted improperly. This confirms the impression one gets from reading remarks such as ""oh come on"" in the earlier passage in the presence of the jury.  
     
      
    67 It may well be that his Honour was also annoyed because he perceived (probably correctly) that counsel was intending to go beyond asking the witness if she adhered to her testimony after privately examining par 40. Had his Honour not leapt in, counsel may well have revealed to the jury the nature and contents of the document being used to confront the witness. To have done so without first attempting to satisfy the court as to its admissibility would have been a serious breach of s44(2)(b)’s implicit requirement that the court must first be satisfied before the cross-examiner takes that step. It is possible that counsel never intended to do so or that she was ignorant of that requirement until the discussion in the absence of the jury. What we know is that she did not attempt to satisfy the court as to the admissibility of par 40.  
     
      
    68 Counsel was, however, within her rights in showing the document to the witness without first getting permission from the judge or informing the judge what she was doing. She should not have been criticized for going that far. 
     
      
    69 The appellant referred to the observation of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Randall v The Queen [2002] 1 WLR 2237 at 2242-3: 
     
      
       
        
        It is the responsibility of the judge to ensure that the proceedings are conducted in an orderly and proper manner which is fair to both prosecution and defence. He must neither be nor appear to be partisan. If counsel misbehaves he must at once exert his authority to require the observance of accepted standards of conduct. He should not disparage the defendant in the course of the evidence. Nor should he disparage defence counsel, since jurors inevitably tend to identify clients with their counsel. Sometimes a trial judge may have briefly to check or rebuke counsel. If however he has occasion, in any serious or sustained manner, to criticise the conduct of the defence case or to criticise or rebuke defending counsel, it will usually be prudent for the judge to do so in the absence of the jury and he should ensure that his disapproval of or irritation with counsel does not affect the jury's judgment. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    70 The appellant accepts that the present case was nothing so extreme as that considered in Randall. Nevertheless, it is submitted that the judge erred in failing to direct the jury that counsel had not acted improperly or proceeded in a way in which she was not lawfully entitled to proceed and that, in any event, it was completely irrelevant to their determination what view they had of counsel or of the manner in which counsel acted. 
     
      
    71 For reasons already given, I would not endorse what the judge did. He should not have criticized counsel in front of the jury insofar as she was proceeding in accordance with s44(3). But I would not hold that any miscarriage ensued. There is a difference between unappealing judicial behaviour and appealable judicial behaviour (Dovade Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Group (1999) 46 NSWLR 168 at 192 [107], Barbosa v Di Meglio [1999] NSWCA 307 at [12]). Judges should be paragons of correctness and fairness, but not every departure will constitute an appealable miscarriage of justice. Mistakes are made by all participants in a trial, but juries are directed to attend to the evidence and the formal directions of the judge. Even an unmerited display of judicial displeasure will not invariably cause a miscarriage. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The trial judge erred in excluding evidence as to why the appellant answered ""Yes"" when asked by the police ""Is the dress you made your ex-wife J M put on on Monday?""  
       
      
    72 The complainant testified that the leggings she was wearing got torn at the front during the incident. (They were later repaired by her friend Donna Singleton.) The complainant said that the appellant went and got a denim dress for her to wear. It was in a bottom drawer underneath his wardrobe. She put the dress on but it did not fit. She asked him what size it was and he said ""a size 12”. He took it back and then got the boob tube which she put on. She also took her leggings off and put on a pair of the appellant’s tracksuit pants that he handed her (Tr p18. See also p102).  
     
      
    73 A search of the appellant's home found the dress which the complainant later identified in court. The appellant produced it to the police when asked about it during a search under warrant two days after the alleged assault. He agreed that it was the dress he had asked his ex-wife to put on on the previous Monday (Ex C6, the video of the execution of the warrant). 
     
      
    74 When interviewed by the police the same day, the appellant gave the following answers: 
     
      
       
        
        Q17. Do you agree that I showed you a search warrant to search your premises for a blue denim dress? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q18. And I also handed you an occupier’s notice in relation to that search warrant? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q19. And shortly after that you took myself and the police assisting me to your bedroom where you removed a blue denim dress from a bottom wardrobe drawer in your bedroom? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q20. And you agreed that that dress was one that you had asked your ex-wife J… M… to put on on Monday afternoon the 30th of April year whilst she was at your home? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q21. And you also agreed that she was at your home that afternoon to have coffee. 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        
       
      
    75 The defence case was that the dress had belonged to the complainant when they were married. The complainant denied this, saying that the dress was always too small for her.  
     
      
    76 This issue about the size of the dress was not nearly as significant as its location in the appellant’s bedroom. The complainant's version was that the assault occurred within the appellant's home. She was indeed cross-examined on this basis (see Tr pp84, 88, 95 , 96, 99). After her evidence was completed and she was stood down there was a short adjournment. Upon resumption, defence counsel sought and obtained leave to resume the cross-examination, putting to the complainant that she spoke to the appellant on the verandah at the house and never went inside the premises on that day. The complainant's answer was: ""We did go inside. We weren't speaking out on the veranda at all."" 
     
      
    77 The appellant's evidence was that the complainant arrived in a distressed state saying that she had been to her mother’s grave. She only stayed for a few minutes. She left when he told her to leave because he didn’t want to put up with her crying the whole time (Tr p151). She did not come into the house at all on the day in question. The conversation took place as he sat half in and half out of his front door. No assault occurred. 
     
      
    78 As regards the denim dress he said that he produced it to Detective Imeson from the bottom of his wardrobe in answer to the search warrant.  
     
      
    79 The appellant gave the following evidence in chief (Tr pp147-8): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. You were asked a question about the denim dress? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember what that question was? 
         
        A. Whether it was the dress that I made her wear that day. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when they said “that day” did the police give you a date? 
         
        A. Yes 30 April. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did you say when they asked you that? 
         
        A. Did I say? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. I said “Yes”. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did you mean when you said “Yes”? 
         
        A. I meant that – I’d been in touch with J… and told her I’d found it after I’d been able to empty my camphorwood box out. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. All right, if I could stop you there. When did you telephone her and tell her that? 
         
        A. A week or two prior to her coming for coffee. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And where was the camphorwood box? 
         
        A. In the loungeroom. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And how long had that been there? 
         
        A. It had been there for about three and a half years. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And can you describe to the court how it was that you came to come across the denim dress? 
         
        A. I had a TV on the camphorwood box. The TV blew up, so we got rid of the television which made it accessible for me to get in to the camphorwood box, and then I wasn’t sure how much old stuff was in the box, but when I opened the box, I seen it and I thought, well I’ll get that out and give that back to J….. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What else was in the box? 
         
        A. Oh, just, I had a pot plant in there, a floodlight, other bits and pieces, trinkets and books. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you recognize that dress? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you tell the Court how it was that you came to have that? 
         
        A. When we first separated, I threw J…. out, pretty much, because there was a lot of problems going on, and she took what she wanted to take at the time and left and went – came back to Tamworth, and everything that was left, I just packaged up and put in the camphorwood box until I found somewhere else to live. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And had you seen your ex-wife wearing that dress at any stage? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
      
    80 Later in his evidence in chief there was the following passage (Tr pp159-60 ):  
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. In relation to the denim dress, you’ve already given some evidence about your knowledge of that denim dress? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you suggest that you asked the complainant to try that denim dress on the day that she came over? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you indicate to the police -- 
        
       
       
        
        OBJECTION. CROSS-EXAMINATION. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’ve indicated that you gave a certain answer to the police when they asked you a question about the denim dress? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, no, he hasn’t given any such answer at all. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What was the question? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: “You’ve indicated you gave a certain answer to the police when you were asked a question about the denim dress.” 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes he did; he indicated that early in his examination-in-chief, if I’m not mistaken. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Q. Why did you give the police that particular answer? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well, he’s already given his answer to that, once. You’ve asked him before, so once again you’re starting to get in the realms of cross-examining him. No, he gave his answer to that before. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Q. Did you understand the question when it was asked? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Really, you know better than that. That is a leading question that you know you shouldn’t have asked, and you know that counsel has been objecting and you’ve decided that you will get it out. I reject that. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: May it please the Court, your Honour. I don’t seek to mislead the court in any way. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well, you deliberately asked that question and you know you shouldn’t have. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Q. Could you describe how it was that the officer asked you that question that day? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m sorry, I don’t understand that question. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: Did you have any difficulty hearing it? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No? And you agree that you had assisted the police in trying to find that denim dress? 
         
        A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    81 The complainant's evidence about the discussion relating to the denim dress assumed significance at the trial because it obviously took place inside the home, whereas the appellant's evidence was that the complainant never went inside on the day in question. The location of the denim dress in the appellant’s bedroom tended to corroborate the complainant's version and contradicted the appellant's version in a material respect. 
     
      
    82 Both on the occasion of his arrest at his home and in the subsequent interview at the police station, the appellant agreed that the dress was one that he had asked the complainant to put on whilst she was at his home. These in effect were admissions that the complainant had entered the house and that some conduct had taken place inside that possibly had a sexual connotation. The appellant’s admissions were plainly inconsistent with the defence case. The trial judge summed up accordingly (SU 17 and 26-27). 
     
      
    83 It was clearly open to the defence to seek to explain these damaging admissions. But defence counsel was not entitled to cross examine her client over objection from the Crown prosecutor. When, in the second passage, she asked her client why he had given the police the answer that he did, the trial judge rejected the question on the basis that it had already been put. To ask the same question again was cross-examination in the circumstances. That was the ruling, and in light of it the judge was in my view perfectly entitled to take strong objection to the ensuing question ""did you understand the question when it was asked?"". 
     
      
    84 The issue raised in this ground of appeal is whether the appellant had in truth already answered the question as to why he had told the police that the dress was the one that he had asked the complainant to put on on the previous Monday whilst she was at his home. When one turns to the earlier passage at Tr pp147-8, the furthest the examination in chief had gone was to ask the appellant what he meant when he said ""yes"" to the police questions. At page 147 he said ""I meant that I’d been in touch with [the complainant] and told her I’d found it after I’d been able to empty my camphorwood box out."" The ensuing answers elaborated on the discovery of the dress and the arrangements to return it to the complainant which were made a week or two prior to her coming for coffee on the day of the alleged assault. 
     
      
    85 The questioning in the earlier passage did not explore whether the appellant had misunderstood the police questions the answer to which contained the significantly damaging admissions. 
     
      
    86 Senior counsel for the appellant submits that simply because a question had been previously asked and answered, this is not a proper basis for refusing to permit a question unless the inference is drawn that the repeated asking of the question suggests to the witness that the answer first given was not the one desired by counsel. Whether or not this is a full statement of the relevant principle, it is open to a trial judge to prevent counsel examining a witness in chief from assuming the role of cross examiner once objection is taken (see Evidence Act, s37). The learned trial judge formed this opinion when he intervened during the second passage. Unfortunately, the factual basis for such intervention was falsified when one looks at the questions and answers in the earlier passage. 
     
      
    87 The real issue is whether the rejection of this evidence caused a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    88 Trial counsel said this in relation to Ground 5 in the affidavit read on the appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        I had instructions that the appellant did not dispute that he answered affirmatively in response to the question that was asked of him by the police, namely: “Is this the dress that you asked your ex wife to put on on Monday?” However my instructions were that the appellant intended to convey by that answer that he did have a conversation with the complainant about the blue dress when she came to his house on the day of the allegations, he did ask her if she wanted the dress and that he tried to give her the dress. It was my instructions that he misunderstood the question and did not intend to agree with the proposition that he asked the complainant to wear the dress on that day. 
        
       
       
        
        I also had instructions that the accused had been woken by the police when they arrived that morning, that as a paraplegic man he has difficulties functioning in the morning and he was doing his best to assist the police which resulted in him agreeing with a proposition without carefully considering the detail of the question. 
        
       
       
        
        At the time that his Honour disallowed the question I asked the appellant namely: “Why did you give the police that particular answer?” His Honour made certain comments which I felt implied to the jury that the line of questioning, and the manner in which the initial question was asked, were both improper. This was particularly so when his Honour said: “Really you know better than that.” 
        
       
       
      
    89 From this it emerges that the defence case at trial was to be that there was discussion “at the house” about the blue denim dress. But the complainant’s evidence that the appellant asked her to put the dress on while she was inside the house and after the assaults had occurred was to be vigorously disputed. The appellant’s answer to question 20 in the ERISP contradicted the defence case in an important particular. It also undercut a key plank in the defence case, namely denial that the complainant ever entered the house on the day in question. 
     
      
    90 According to the affidavit of the appellant’s counsel, the appellant wished to say in effect that he had not understood the question and that he had overlooked the damaging barb in its tail which ascribed the dress as the one that he had asked the complainant to put on the previous Monday. 
     
      
    91 The defence should have been permitted to lead this evidence, leaving it to the jury to evaluate its cogency. It is doubtful whether an attempt to explain the matter would have advanced the defence case, but that was a matter for the jury. 
     
      
    92 His Honour’s rejection of the opportunity to advance this explanation cannot therefore be described as harmless. I shall deal later with its impact when considering the proviso. 
     
      
    93 Ground 5 is established. 
     
      
       
      Ground six: The trial judge erred in his directions to the jury regarding the evidence of Dr Kennedy. 
       
      
    94 Dr Kennedy was the first doctor to examine the complainant after the alleged assaults. He examined her on 30 April 2001. There was evidence from two of the police officers that they had attempted that day to arrange for the complainant to be examined by a doctor specially trained in sexual assault examinations (Tr pp126, 136). Their evidence, by implication, was that Dr Kennedy was not perceived as qualified in this way.  
     
      
    95 Dr Kennedy gave evidence that he had conducted a detailed examination of the complainant's vulva, anus and peri-anal area. He twice emphasised that he had conducted only an external examination involving ""lying down and observation from the outside only"" (Tr p32. See also p34 ). He observed bruising on various parts of the body including the left buttock and areas of tenderness and contusion under the pubic hair above the vagina (p31). Under cross-examination, he agreed that no external injury to the anal area and no anal tear were observed. He was asked whether he would have been in a position to observe a tear and he answered ""yes. Unless it was an internal tear, because as I said I didn't do an internal rectal examination, it was merely an external observation"" (p34).   
     
      
    96 In re-examination the following evidence was given (Tr p40): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. You were asked a number of questions about your examination of the anus, I think when you were giving evidence in chief, you indicated that you observed the anus from a distance of some 30 or 40 centimetres, is that correct? 
         
        A. That's correct. 
         
         
        Q. And the anus, the anal sphincter, is a muscle which basically continues in circle, is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And the examination that you conducted was simply an external examination from a distance of some 30 centimetres or so? 
         
        A. With some gentle separation of the buttocks -yeah. 
         
         
        Q. You'd expect a forensic examination to involve a more searching examination? 
         
        A. One could use a thing called a proctor scope, so a little clear plastic thing a bit like a vaginal speculum to look inside. 
         
         
        Q. And that will show not just the external surfaces visible to a naked eye I should say, but also the internal surfaces of the-- 
         
        A. The anus and rectum. 
         
         
        Q. Of the anus and rectum? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
      The evidence was not referred to in submissions on the appeal. 
       
       
        
       
      
    97 Dr Grotowski who examined the complainant on 3 May 2001 observed an anal tear. Dr Grotowski testified that ""you need to actually look specifically for [an anal tear] by stretching the skin”. ""Possibly"" it would not be found by a doctor ""unless specifically look for"" (Tr p4). 
     
      
    98 The defence case was that the jury should have a doubt as to whether the anal tear was caused by the appellant and that they should take into account the possibility that it was self-inflicted after the first medical examination. 
     
      
    99 In his summing up the trial judge told the jury (SU 15): 
     
      
       
        
        Now Dr Kennedy did not do a full sexual assault examination. He was not a sexual assault doctor apparently. He was a male, so he did a physical examination. He detailed material that he saw. It is clear some of the material that the second doctor, Dr Grotowski saw, he did not note."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    100 The appellant accepts that there was nothing inaccurate in these directions. 
     
      
    101 Earlier (SU 11) the trial judge had told the jury that Dr Kennedy  
     
      
       
        
        was not doing a sexual examination as the doctor later was, he was doing a physical examination and he saw that she had these bruises on the breasts. That she had the bruises in the vulval area, one on her shoulder and he said they were consistent and could have been caused in the way that she told him they were. 
        
       
      
    102 Defence counsel objected to these aspects of the summing up (SU 30-32). She asked the trial judge to tell the jury that Dr Kennedy had conducted a detailed forensic examination and she objected to the judge’s implicit distinction between a sexual examination and the examination conducted by Dr Kennedy. The following exchange occurred (SU 31): 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What are you asking me to do? 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: To indicate to the court that Dr Kennedy did conduct a thorough examination of the genital --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I never suggested he didn’t conduct a thorough examination. 
        
       
       
        
        FRANCIS: From my appreciation of how your Honour summed up to the jury, that is the -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well it can be noted. 
        
       
       
      
    103 The appellant submits that the directions were unbalanced. I disagree. The evidence supported such a distinction being drawn by the trial judge in his summing up. His Honour did not suggest that Dr Kennedy’s examination was less than thorough as far as it went. 
     
      
    104 Dr Kennedy’s evidence in re-examination set out above supports the very distinction to which his Honour was adverting. 
     
      
    105 That evidence also explains why there was no miscarriage stemming from the trial judge’s refusal to redirect the jury in the two ways sought by trial counsel, namely by telling the jury that Dr Kennedy had conducted a “detailed forensic examination” or by indicating that he did conduct “a thorough examination of the genital [area]). 
     
      
       
      The proviso 
      
    106 The Crown submitted that, if any of the grounds were made out, the appeal should nevertheless be dismissed because no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. 
     
      
    107 In light of the appellant’s success on Ground 5 only, the question this Court must answer is whether - if the explanation of the appellant’s misunderstanding of question 20 in the ERISP had not been excluded - the jury would inevitably have found him guilty. Unless that question can be answered in favour of the Crown the Court must conclude that the appellant lost a chance of acquittal that was fairly open to him and must uphold his appeal (Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365; Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at 632[123], 662[229]). 
     
      
    108 The wrongfully excluded evidence went to an issue touching the defence attack on the complainant’s credibility. This was the central issue in the trial. Even if this attack would, in my view, still have been likely to fail if the appellant had been allowed to try to explain his damaging admission, I am unable to conclude that a conviction would have been inevitable. 
     
      
    109 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      2. Conviction and sentence set aside. 
       
       
      3. Order new trial. 
       
      
    110 JAMES J: I agree with the President that for the reasons given by his Honour the third, fourth and sixth grounds of appeal should be rejected but the fifth ground of appeal should be upheld, that the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should not be applied in favour of the Crown and that, accordingly, the appeal against conviction should be allowed and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
    111 I have, however, reached a different conclusion from the President with respect to the first ground of appeal. In my opinion, the first ground of appeal should be upheld. As I am in a minority in considering that the first ground of appeal should be upheld and as all members of the Court are agreed that the appeal should be allowed in any event, I will be succinct in stating my reasons for upholding the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    112 In my opinion, the question which defence counsel asked the complainant “and at the time that you were legally married to him you indicated to him, didn’t you, that you had spoken to a solicitor from Legal Aid and that they had indicated to you that you weren’t entitled to any of his money but you loved him anyway?” was not “left hanging”. Although the trial judge did not say in as many words that he rejected the question, I consider that a fair reading of the trial transcript at pp96-98 which is set out in par 19 of the President’s judgment, and of the trial transcript at pp200-201 recording a discussion between the trial judge and defence counsel, indicates that his Honour did reject the question and made a ruling that defence counsel would not be permitted to ask any further questions about a claim by the complainant to a share of the appellant’s accident compensation monies. 
     
      
    113 I am, accordingly, of the opinion that the trial judge did cut short a line of possible cross-examination of the complainant about whether she had a motive to fabricate a false allegation of sexual assault. Defence counsel referred at the trial to fabrication of the complaint of sexual assault and the possibility of the complainant receiving compensation as being live issues at the trial. In par 9 of her affidavit filed in the appeal trial counsel indicated the sort of questions she would have asked the complainant, if the question which the trial judge rejected had been allowed and if she had been permitted to pursue the proposed line of cross-examination. 
     
      
    114 My conclusion that the first ground of appeal, as well as the fifth ground of appeal, should be upheld strengthens my further conclusion that the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should not be applied in favour of the Crown. 
     
      
    115 DUNFORD J: I agree with Mason P.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Dunford J. 
     
      
    2 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence by Jessi O’Brien for the manslaughter of her daughter Kudaratilaal O’Brien, known as Laali, who died of malnutrition on 8 February 2000 in Queensland, aged 14 months, following her conviction by a jury in the District Court at Port Macquarie and the sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years imposed by his Honour Judge Garling. 
     
      
    3 The deceased was born to the appellant and her de facto husband, Peter O’Brien, on 10 December 1998. She had two older sisters, Levy who was born in 1996 and Andashair born in 1998, both of whom have always been healthy. Although the appellant gave birth to the deceased at home unassisted, as with her other births, she attended the surgery of Dr Paul Webster with the deceased briefly on 15 December 1998 as a formality for registration of the birth, and again on 26 February 1999 in relation to a swelling on the child’s upper lip. 
     
      
    4 Narina Rawson-Harris, Peter O’Brien’s daughter from a previous relationship, who had lived with her father and the appellant in Woolgoolga from 1993 to 1996 saw the appellant, her father and the three children in the main street of Bellingen in October 1999 when she noticed the deceased was quite still. She again saw them in Bellingen in December 1999 when she noticed that Laali was again very still and that her skin was saggy with quite a green colouring. She told the appellant and her father that she thought the child looked ill and that she needed some conventional help, to which the appellant replied, “Don’t you think I know she looks ill”.  
     
      
    5 Ms Rawson-Harris told them that there was talk around the town of the child’s condition and that to her knowledge welfare was going to be called. She told them to get some help, i.e. to see a doctor, and asked them had they been doing enough. 
     
      
    6 On 18 January 2000 the Department of Community Services (DOCS) in Coffs Harbour received a notification regarding the physical welfare of the deceased and on 28 January, Richard Lewandowski, a district officer of DOCS stationed at Port Macquarie, went to the appellant’s home at 1 Toorak Court, Port Macquarie. The door was answered by Peter O’Brien. Mr Lewandowski identified himself and asked to see the child. Mr O’Brien refused and threatened him, whereupon Mr Lewandowski telephoned the police for assistance and, accompanied by Detective David Richards and Constable Ozimek, returned to the premises.  
     
      
    7 After speaking with Detective Richards, Peter O’Brien called to the appellant to “bring the baby out”. Mr Lewandowski said that the deceased appeared very jaundiced, very thin with no skin tone, pale and did not appear attentive. The police were of the same view. Mr Lewandowski asked a number of questions about the child and asked the O’Briens to take her to a doctor. Eventually the appellant went inside and returned a short time later saying that she had made an appointment to see Dr Webster the following day.  
     
      
    8 On Saturday, 29 January she attended Dr Webster’s surgery with her eldest daughter Levy and the deceased, whilst Mr O’Brien waited nearby. Dr Webster did not fully examine the child, but his immediate impression was that she was severely malnourished, thin, her bones were visible on the parts that he could see, it was obvious that her body weight was very low for her age, she was jaundiced and weak, making relatively little movement for a baby of that age and was not inquisitive or active. Dr Webster took a history from the appellant and indicated to her that the deceased was very sick and should be taken to hospital for investigation and treatment.  
     
      
    9 The appellant said she did not want the deceased to have blood tests because it was against her and her partner’s religious beliefs but she wanted to take her to a naturopath. Dr Webster advised against that course of action, as he did not believe that a naturopath would have the expertise to treat the child and said that she could suffer mental impairment if she was not appropriately treated.  
     
      
    10 Whilst the appellant was present Dr Webster telephoned the Accident & Emergency Department at Port Macquarie Base Hospital to inform them that the deceased would be brought there that day. Mr Lewandowski gave evidence that he was aware that Dr Webster had later made a follow-up call to the hospital and, on discovering that the appellant had not attended with the baby, had telephoned the DOCS after hours emergency line. 
     
      
    11 Upon leaving the doctor’s surgery the appellant joined her husband, and that afternoon the family left Port Macquarie and travelled to Queensland. The following day, Sunday 30 January they attended Ms Claire Brassard, an unregistered naturopath, at Ormeau in Queensland. Ms Brassard examined the deceased and saw that she was jaundiced, her stomach was swollen and her liver enlarged. She was breathing with difficulty, was very lean with little muscle tone and her teeth had deteriorated.  
     
      
    12 Ms Brassard said that after examination of the child she discussed the question of hospitalisation with the appellant and offered to drive her to the hospital in order that the child might be rehydrated, but the appellant told her that she was opposed to treatment of that kind and as a consequence Ms Brassard proposed naturopathic treatment for two days, and suggested that failing any improvement the child would be hospitalised. The appellant denied that Ms Brassard had suggested hospitalisation or had offered to drive her there. Ms Brassard then provided naturopathic treatment to be administered orally and said she would see the child the following Tuesday, 1 February.  
     
      
    13 She then arranged for the appellant and her family to stay with a friend of hers, Bronwyn Mele, at a remote property where they arrived late that evening. The following morning (Monday) Mrs Mele saw that the child was thin with lose skin, a greyish colour and during the morning she asked, “Is it an option to go to hospital?”, to which the appellant replied, “Not at the moment”. Mrs Mele assisted the appellant in administering the naturopathic substances to the deceased over the following week.  
     
      
    14 Mrs Mele gave evidence that Mr O’Brien was adamant that the child was not be hospitalised, that he openly expressed his views on the subject on three or four occasions, that the appellant appeared subservient to his domination and nodded her agreement. 
     
      
    15 It appears the child rallied for a couple of days and when Ms Brassard saw her on Tuesday 1 February she noticed that the baby was more alert and her colour was better, but she was concerned that she had lost her ability to swallow and vomited what she had taken. She explained that in hospital the baby would be rehydrated with intravenous fluid, but the appellant shook her head and said “no”. 
     
      
    16 The child then deteriorated and on Sunday 6 February Ms Brassard was called. She arrived at the Mele property at about 9pm when she observed the deceased was distressed, her breathing was really bad, and her skin was white.  
     
      
    17 On February 8 at about 1pm Ms Brassard saw the child again, she was yellow and her breathing was very short. She told the appellant, “She’s on her way out, she’s dying, there’s nothing more that we can do”. The appellant told her that she had stopped the treatment on Sunday 6 February. Ms Brassard said that she told her that “There could still be time to go to hospital for you if you don’t want to get into trouble”. The appellant denied that she said this although she conceded (T 154) that some reference was made to hospital that day. The child died shortly before midnight on 8 February.  
     
      
    18 Early the following day the appellant and the rest of the family headed back towards Port Macquarie, but were stopped near Coffs Harbour by police who had been alerted to their disappearance. They were taken to Coffs Harbour Police Station and interviewed separately.  
     
      
    19 In her interview the appellant said that she did not think that there was any need for the child to have medical attention although she was not as robust as her sisters, but had grown at the same rate until she was about 6 months old. She claimed that as a member of the Sikh religion it was her belief that her children should not be infused with fluids or have artificial substances injected into their bodies, and accordingly blood tests could not be done as that was sacrilegious.  
     
      
    20 She said they left Port Macquarie to seek a second opinion and it was a joint decision by her and her husband to do so, although they did not feel their child was at risk so long as she stayed with them. She said that while she was in Dr Webster’s surgery she wanted to take the child to hospital, but after speaking to her husband her opinion changed because of the beliefs she held. She claimed that at no time did Ms Brassard say the child needed to go to hospital or obtain medical attention.  
     
      
    21 After separating from her husband on 31 March she arranged to take part in a further recorded interview on 13 April 2000 in the presence of her counsel and her solicitor.  
     
      
    22 In that interview she said that fear of her husband governed most of her actions and speech, that she had been subjected to extreme physical violence at times and there was also severe psychological and emotional abuse and restriction of personal liberties and freedoms. She had been isolated from friends and family, and it was fear of reprisal that prevented her from bringing this to the attention of the authorities. She said that when speaking to her husband after seeing Dr Webster, he said to her, “You’re not taking her to hospital, I’ll tell you that right now”.  
     
      
    23 She agreed that it was no part of the Sikh religion not to take a child to hospital or have treatment, but that it was her husband’s belief, and that Ms Brassard had voiced adamant opposition to hospitals. When she became aware that the child was dying she decided not to go to hospital because she did not want her to die away from her, but in her arms.  
     
      
    24 She said that she lied in the first interview at her husband’s direction and that, whilst her husband did not physically threaten her after she had seen Dr Webster and reported his advice, she was nevertheless controlled by fear because violence and threats had occurred often enough for her to respond by submission. She maintained that her fear of him prevented her from doing what she knew was right. She suggested the naturopath as a second opinion and that Ms Brassard’s phone number had been given to her by her brother some time earlier because her brother knew she was trying to find someone her husband might approve of taking the child to. 
     
      
    25 Dr Duflou, forensic pathologist, carried out the post mortem and concluded that the child had died of malnutrition. At the time of autopsy she weighed 5.44 kg, about 55% of what her weight should have been. It was his opinion that it would have taken a number of months for her to have become that thin, and her condition was treatable.  
     
      
    26 Dr Barry King, a forensic dentist, gave evidence that while the deceased’s teeth had followed a normal path of ruption and were consistent with her age, they were deteriorated possibly from demand breast feeding, and feeding for prolonged periods of time.  
     
      
    27 It was the Crown case that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter of the deceased child by reason of her gross (criminal) negligence. The Crown alleged that she breached her duty of care to the child by a combination of acts and omissions, particularly failing to take the child to hospital when advised by Dr Webster that it needed urgent medical treatment, removing the child from New South Wales and the jurisdiction of DOCS who insisted that she be medically examined, failing to have regard to Dr Webster’s advice that alternate treatment, such as from a naturopath, was not acceptable, not affording the child proper treatment when she got to Queensland by taking her to a hospital there, and when she knew the child was dying, even then omitting to take her to hospital.  
     
      
    28 The appellant gave evidence that since she became pregnant with their first child in 1989, Mr O’Brien had become controlling, irritable, verbally abusive and physically violent. He verbally belittled her on occasions when they lived at Woolgoolga, he pushed her against a wall holding onto her throat in front of his daughter Narina, on another occasion he punched her in the back of the head because she took too long to get out of the car, on other occasions hit her with a broom or kicked her on the ground, and once held an axe to her nose until it bled.  
     
      
    29 She said that when the deceased became ill she tried to reason with her husband but he would not allow her to seek help and she did not take the deceased to hospital herself out of fear. She said that after seeing Dr Webster she told her husband that if they did not take the deceased to hospital then DOCS would take her from them in the hope that this would convince him to take her to hospital, but he was insistent that the child not go to hospital, and that was why they went to Queensland.  
     
      
    30 After her arrest DOCS had become involved with her and the children and so at the end of March 2000 she felt able to leave, because she then had their protection and assistance, whereas previously she was afraid to leave because he told her that, although she could go, she could not take the children and he hardly ever let her out of his sight. She also said that on occasions over the previous years Peter O’Brien had threatened to kill her if she left him and took the children with her. Her evidence was consistent with her second recorded interview.  
     
      
    31 The other evidence called in the defence case was that of Dr Olaf Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist. He did not find the appellant suffered any kind of psychiatric disorder but his opinion was that her situation fitted what is called the “battered wife syndrome” which is a state in which women who are subjected to severe abuse, particularly within a domestic relationship, form a kind of helplessness and inability to initiate action to leave that situation. He thought that her responses around the time of the baby’s illness were characteristic of the kind of behaviour one would expect to see in a person with battered wife syndrome in that she accepted the decisions made by her husband despite having reservations about them. She was under her husband’s control. 
     
      
    32 There was no issue in the trial that the appellant had failed to take proper steps for the welfare of the child, that her failure to do so had materially contributed to the child’s death and that such failure amounted to gross negligence. The only issue fought at the trial was the question of duress, that is, whether the Crown had negatived the suggestion that at the time she failed to take those steps she was acting under duress induced by fear of her husband.  
     
      
    33 In summing-up, his Honour gave general directions concerning the functions of the jury, their responsibilities and the onus of proof, and then turned to the elements of the crime of manslaughter (SU 7), which he explained (SU 7-11) and then he summarised the evidence relating to those elements, in particular of failure to take the child to hospital or provide proper medical treatment for her (SU 12-19).  
     
      
    34 He then (SU 20-24) gave appropriate directions on the law relating to duress referring to the objective and subjective elements of the test and how the Crown could negative duress and explained to the jury that they had to have regard to the effect of the threats at the time of the acts giving rise to the offence and this raised the issue whether the appellant had a reasonable opportunity of withdrawing from the scene or otherwise rendering the threats ineffective. 
     
      
    35 Following this, after a dissertation on the assessment of witnesses, his Honour went on (SU 27-37) to summarise the appellant’s evidence in relation to that issue, particularly the way she had been treated over the years by Mr O’Brien which she said led her to fail to act in the manner she did and the reasons why she did not take opportunities that were apparently open to her to leave the relationship and seek hospital treatment for the deceased, and then he summarised parts of Dr Nielssen’s evidence (SU 37-38). At SU 40 he briefly summarised the submissions of counsel as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown say to you, look, those first lots of elements we have proved to you beyond reasonable doubt. And they say to you that you will not be satisfied about the duress, we have negatived that, because in short there were a number of different things she could have done to get help for her baby. 
         
         
        On the other hand, it is said to you that it is just not so and you could not be satisfied of that, and that when you look at all the evidence you will see how she was under the domination of Mr O’Brien, that is how she acted, that is why she acted that way. There is clear duress here. I am not summing up everything they said to you. They went into it in great detail, but they are matters that you have got to consider.” 
        
       
      
    36 No applications were made at the end of his Honour’s summing-up for further directions.  
     
      
    37 Shortly after the jury had retired his Honour realised that he failed to direct the jury that the appellant’s good character could be taken into account on the question of credibility as well as on the question of guilt, and indicated he would recall the jury to give that direction, and in the mean time he had received a question from the jury inquiring as to the time frame within which they should consider the appellant’s actions.  
     
      
    38 After discussion with counsel his Honour recalled the jury to court and, after giving them the further direction on good character, answered their question as follows (SU 45-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is argued on behalf of the accused that as a result of the cumulative effects of Peter O’Brien’s conduct since 1993, and continuing up until the death of Laali, which results in the evidence you heard from Dr Nielssen today, what is known as the “battered wife syndrome”. As a result of that it is argued she was unable to withdraw. 
         
         
        The Crown argues that she had a number of opportunities to withdraw after the visit of Mr Lewandowski and the police up to the date of the death of Laali and argues that there is no evidence of actual physical violence after the visit to Dr Webster from that time up until the death of Laali. I hope that answers your question.” 
        
       
      
    39 The first ground of appeal which related to an application to adduce fresh evidence related to the “battered wives syndrome” was not pressed. 
     
      
    40 The second, third and fourth grounds of appeal may be conveniently dealt with together. They were as follows: 
     
      
      2. The trial judge failed to direct the jury that the evidence of battered wives syndrome was relevant to the defence of duress. 
       
      3. The trial judge failed to direct the jury as to how the evidence of battered wives syndrome might apply to their determination of whether the Crown had negatived duress. 
       
      4. The trial judge’s summing-up on the evidence of battered wives syndrome was inadequate 
      . 
       
      
    41 As already noted, his Honour directed the jury on the nature of duress, and then explained how the Crown could negative duress either by showing that the appellant was not acting (or failing to act) as she did by reason of a threat, expressed or implied, of death or reasonably serious physical harm (the subjective test), or by showing that her actions or lack of action was not the response of a hypothetical person of ordinary firmness of mind and will, of the same sex and maturity as the appellant and in the circumstances in which she found herself (the objective test). 
     
      
    42 The main ground of complaint about the summing-up, as I understand it, is that his Honour did not, after describing the subjective test, summarise those parts of Dr Nielssen's evidence which were relevant to the subjective test, and then after describing the objective test direct their attention to those parts of Dr Nielssen’s evidence which were relevant to that test and how the hypothetical person in the same circumstances, i.e. a battered wife, would have acted as to withdrawing from the relationship etc. The submission was that Dr Nielssen’s evidence should not have simply been summarised in globo as it were, but that his evidence about the battered wife syndrome should have been expressly and separately related to each of the tests by which the Crown could negative the defence of duress. 
     
      
    43 Although it is undoubtedly the duty of a trial judge in summing up to relate the different pieces of evidence to the different issues in the trial: R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105, this was a “single issue” trial and that single issue was duress. The evidence of Dr Nielssen about the battered wife syndrome was relevant to both the subjective and objective tests and there was no need to divide it up in a way which had not been suggested by either counsel in their addresses: Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75, 197 CLR 316 at [59] – [60]. 
     
      
    44 This was so particularly when the extracts of Dr Nielssen's evidence which were quoted to the jury (at SU 37) clearly went to both the subjective test and the objective test: cf R v Runjanjic (1991) 56 SASR 114 at 120. 
     
      
    45 It was apparent to the jury that Dr Neilssen’s evidence about the battered wife syndrome and its effect on the appellant went to the issue of duress; and to try and divide it up into sub-issues as suggested by the appellant’s submissions would, in my view, have only tended to confuse the jury, If anything further were needed to draw the jury’s attention to the battered wife syndrome and its relevance to the defence of duress, which I doubt, it was to be found in his Honour’s brief summary of the defence argument at SU 40 and in his answer to the jury’s question at SU 45, where express reference was made to Dr Nielssen’s evidence, the battered wife syndrome and the appellant’s capacity or otherwise to withdraw from the relationship.  
     
      
    46 The further objection to the summing-up in relation to Dr Nielssen’s evidence is that although parts of it were quoted to the jury, no reference was made to a number of specified questions and answers. 
     
      
    47 A trial judge is not required to read or summarise the whole of the relevant evidence to the jury which has already heard it all from the witnesses, but merely to present a balanced summary of the salient parts which is fair to both sides: Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 560-561. If counsel at the trial considers that an important part of the evidence has not been drawn to the jury’s attention, he can and should draw it to the judge’s attention. If he or she does not do so Rule 4 applies, one of the objects of which is to prevent mistrials on account of matters which could have easily been cured at the trial: R v Button & Griffen [2002] NSWCCA 159, 129 A Crim R 342 at [34]-[35] quoting Mahoney JA in R v Jeffrey (unreported - CCA - 16 December 1993) at 6-7, and McHugh J in Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37, 196 CLR 297 at [72]. 
     
      
    48 The evidence of Dr Nielssen, although important, was comparatively short, and in my opinion was sufficiently and fairly summarised by the trial judge. Some of the questions and answers not repeated in the summing-up were merely elaboration of general propositions of the doctor which had been summarised, and one answer in particular at T 172 L 25 which it is claimed should not have been omitted had been substantially paraphrased by the appellant’s trial counsel in his final address (T 182 L 23). 
     
      
    49 It is true that his Honour, apart from summarising Dr Nielssen’s evidence on the nature and possible effect of the battered wife syndrome focussed his evidence on the capacity of the appellant to withdraw from the situation; but this had been the emphasis given to the doctor’s evidence in Defence Counsel’s final address in response to the Crown’s submission that, being an intelligent, articulate person, the appellant had a number of opportunities to extricate herself from her situation and obtain treatment for the child. 
     
      
    50 Grounds 2, 3 and 4 have not been made out. 
     
      
    51 Ground 5 was “The trial judge failed to direct the jury on the lies told by the accused in her first record of interview with police following her arrest.”  
     
      
    52 In her second recorded interview, the appellant admitted that she lied to police in her first interview and said that it was because she was under the influence and domination of her husband, who had told her what to say in the interview. The fact that the appellant told the police deliberate lies was the first issue the Crown addressed to the appellant in cross-examination in seeking to undermine her evidence that her husband had threatened to kill her, and in his final address the Crown submitted to the jury that by her own admission she was a woman capable of telling lies (T 177). His Honour referred to the fact that she admitted telling the police lies and said she had done so under her husband’s influence and that fact was something the jury should “weigh-up” when considering her evidence (SU 26 and 33). 
     
      
    53 It was submitted that in these circumstances there was a risk of the jury misunderstanding the significance of the appellant’s lies, and a direction should have been given as suggested in Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28, 200 CLR 234 at [23] to the effect that the telling of lies went only to the issue of the appellant’s credibility, and the fact that she told lies could not be used by the jury as evidence of her guilt of the offence charged.  
     
      
    54 Although the appellant had given evidence in chief, repeating what she had said in her second recorded interview, of Peter O’Brien’s domination and physical emotional abuse of her over the years, including a number of assaults, it was only in cross-examination that she claimed he had ever threatened to kill her; and although Dr Nielssen found her articulate and out-going when he interviewed her, he had no note of her ever claiming there had been a threat to kill her, from which he inferred that no such complaint had been made to him.  
     
      
    55 It was in this context and in the overall context of her claim that she was dominated, influenced and generally threatened and physically abused by her husband, that the Crown made the submission to the jury that, based on her first recorded interview, she was a person who was capable of lying. It was never suggested by the Crown Prosecutor or by his Honour that the fact that she had lied in her first recorded interview could be used as evidence of guilt, or that it went to any issue other than her credibility as a witness.  
     
      
    56 In those circumstances I see no risk that the jury could have misused the evidence, and neither apparently did defence counsel at the time, as no further direction was sought. Accordingly I do not see that there was any need for the direction which it is now submitted should have been given. This ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    57 Ground 6 was “The trial judge’s direction under s 165 of the Evidence Act concerning the evidence of Mrs Brassard was inadequate”. 
     
      
    58 Ms Brassard gave evidence that when she first saw the appellant and the child late on Sunday 30 January and observed that the child was obviously ill, she asked the appellant why she did not want to go to hospital and told her that she would go with her to Southport Hospital, the closest hospital about 45 minutes away by car, as she knew people there and that the Hospital would investigate and rehydrate the baby. When the appellant explained she did not wish to go to hospital, Ms Brassard claimed she said, “We will try for two days and if that doesn’t work would you promise me that we will go to hospital?” (T 61) 
     
      
    59 She saw the child again and said she spoke with the appellant about taking the deceased to hospital on Tuesday, 1 February, but again the appellant said “no”. She saw the appellant and the deceased again on Tuesday, 8 February at about 1pm when the child was yellow and her breathing was very short and she told the appellant, “She’s on her way out. She’s dying. There’s nothing more we can do” (T 72), and she also said, “It could still be time to go to hospital for you if you don’t want to get in trouble” (T 73).  
     
      
    60 In cross-examination she agreed that on 30 January (Sunday) she said she would persist in the treatment for two days and if that didn’t work the appellant would have to promise to take the child to hospital, and she thought it was on the Tuesday (1 February) that she said she would assist by driving them to the hospital.  
     
      
    61 She agreed that nowhere in her statement made on 13 February did she make reference to wanting the appellant to promise that if treatment was not successful in two days she would go to hospital, and similarly the suggestion of going to hospital, on 1 February was not mentioned in any of her statements (T 70). She agreed that the first time she had told anyone that she volunteered to take the appellant to hospital was on the morning of the trial in a conference with the Crown Prosecutor.  
     
      
    62 The appellant in her cross-examination denied that the question of taking the child to hospital had been discussed on 30 January but said it was raised by Ms Brassard on the Tuesday 1 February at Bronwyn Mele’s house, when she asked whether the appellant would like to have the child tested at hospital but did not offer to drive her. The next mention of hospital was on 8 February when she said, “Do you want to go to hospital, it’s too late” (T 157).  
     
      
    63 In summing-up his Honour said (SU 39): 
     
      
       
        
        “There is the evidence given by Ms Brassard that she offered to take the accused to hospital. That is hotly contested, and it is hotly contested because you will recall that she was asked about when she first told anyone about that evidence, she having given statements to police way back when this first occurred, and she agreed that that did not appear in any statement. 
         
         
        It was put to her the first time she ever said that was either on the morning she gave evidence or in the witness box, and I think in the end there was not much doubt about it. 
         
         
        I have got to say to you that that sort of evidence, that part of the evidence, that sort of evidence, may well be unreliable because it is evidence, you may very well have expected, of such importance that she would have put it in one of her statements and told the police about it at an earlier time, and so you should treat it on that basis.” 
        
       
      
    64 It was submitted that this warning was insufficient to comply with the requirements of the Evidence Act 1995, s 165(2)(b)&(c) in that, whilst his Honour correctly pointed to the fact that the witness had not told police in her earlier statements that she offered to drive the appellant and the child to the hospital, he should have informed the jury that a possible reason for the alleged “recent invention” may have been a desire on her part to shift all responsibility for the child’s death to the appellant and to deflect it from herself as a person who was treating the child; and furthermore, that his Honour failed to warn the jury of the need for “caution” in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
     
      
    65 There was a request from defence counsel for a warning under the section in relation to Ms Brassard’s evidence (T 94) because her offer to take the child to hospital was not included in any of her statements, and also on the ground that she may have been seeking to protect herself, being an unregistered naturopath practising in Queensland. Immediately before the summing-up there was further discussion about the proposed warning (T 188), but the substance of the discussion is not recorded.  
     
      
    66 The suggestion that the jury should have been warned that the witness may have fabricated this piece of her evidence because of a desire to shift all responsibility for the child’s death to the appellant and thus deflect it from herself as a person who was treating the child though unregistered, was not a suggestion that was made to the jury in defence counsel’s closing address, and indeed could not have been put to the jury in that form because such motivation for fabricating the evidence had not been put to the witness in cross-examination.  
     
      
    67 Although there was not a strict compliance with s 165(2) his Honour warned the jury that it may be “unreliable” and told them one reason why it might be unreliable. He did not expressly use the word “caution”, but told them that they should “treat it on that basis”. In my view in the circumstances of this case that was a sufficient warning and in the context would have conveyed to the jury the need for caution in accepting such evidence.  
     
      
    68 In any event, whether or not the witness had offered to drive the appellant to the hospital was not a major issue in the trial. The appellant had made it perfectly clear to Ms Brassard and also to Mrs Mele that she was not prepared to take the child to hospital, and the non-availability of transport to get to the hospital was not suggested by her as a reason for not doing so.  
     
      
    69 No objection was taken at the trial and accordingly Rule 4 applies. Insofar as there was any deficiency in his Honour’s warning it was minor, and not such as could have led to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    70 Ground 6, like the other grounds of appeal, is not made out and the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    71 In sentencing the appellant, after reviewing the facts of the matter and noting that the jury had excluded duress, his Honour concluded that she did suffer the “battered woman syndrome” but that she knew the child was very ill, her condition was deteriorating and that she needed medical and hospital treatment, but she failed to act on that advice, that she assisted her husband in leaving the State and the jurisdiction of DOCS by agreeing to take the child to Ms Brassard against the advice of Dr Webster, that whilst she was in Queensland she had the opportunity to seek assistance, including hospital assistance, but failed to do so, and that she was responsible for her child’s death, although she was to a degree under the domination of her husband. His Honour also took into account the fact that she had agreed to give evidence against Mr O’Brien in his coming trial and that, having regard to the nature of the offence, there was the possibility that she might serve her sentence on protection.  
     
      
    72 Having regard to these and other relevant matters his Honour found that special circumstances existed and imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, indicating that on account of her offer for assistance he had reduced the sentence by approximately 30%, that is from 7 years to 5 years.  
     
      
    73 It is submitted that his Honour erred in sentencing in two respects. Firstly, it was submitted that the discount for her assistance to the authorities by providing information and offering to give evidence against her husband should have been greater than 30%; and secondly, that fresh evidence was available to show that there was not only the possibility of her spending her sentence on protection, but that she is in fact spending her sentence on protection as a result of accepting the advice of her counsel to seek protection, which advice was given after his Honour had sentenced her.  
     
      
    74 I am not persuaded by either of these submissions. A discount of 30% for assistance to the authorities is a reasonably generous discount, and it is necessary to bear in mind the provisions of s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides that in relation to the reduction of penalties for assistance, the lesser penalty must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. This was a very serious offence. The appellant allowed her 14 months old, helpless and defenceless child to die. She was the child’s mother, the person from whom above all others, the child was entitled to expect nurture, care, sustenance and protection, and she failed the child in her most important duty, with fatal results. I cannot see how a sentence of any less than that imposed by his Honour could be regarded as reasonably proportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.  
     
      
    75 The evidence which was tendered as fresh evidence on sentence, was to the effect that after the applicant had been sentenced, her counsel advised her to apply to go on protection, that she accepted his advice and was placed on protection. This evidence however all related to matters that occurred after sentencing. His Honour adverted to the possibility that she may serve the sentence on protection, but her acceptance of her counsel’s advice and the giving of that advice only arose after the sentencing was complete.  
     
      
    76 It was therefore not evidence which could have been placed before his Honour if it had been known, as it related to matters which at that stage had not occurred. In any event, his Honour took into account the possibility that she may serve the sentence on protection, and that possibility later became a reality.  
     
      
    77 For these reasons I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    78 I propose the following orders. 
     
      
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
       
      3. Appeal against sentence dismissed. 
       
      4. Conviction and sentence confirmed. 
       
      
    79 SMART AJ: I agree with Dunford J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 LEVINE J: I have read the judgment of Hidden J in draft. I agree that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed for the reasons his Honour states. 
     
      
    2 However, whilst I agree that leave to appeal against sentence be granted, the sentence originally imposed being manifestly excessive, I am unable to agree with Hidden J as to the sentence to be imposed in lieu of that imposed by Howie J. 
     
      
    3 For the reasons stated by Smart AJ I agree that the appropriate head sentence is one of 22 years and non-parole period is one of 16 years and 6 months.  
     
      
    4 Accordingly, I agree with the orders as proposed by Smart AJ. 
     
      
    5 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Martin Marino Toki, was tried before Howie J and a jury for the murder of his partner, Pauline Anne Croarkin at their flat at Surry Hills in January 1999. He was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-four years with a non-parole period of eighteen years. He appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    6 The principal issue at the trial was whether it was the appellant who had caused the death of the deceased. However, if the jury were satisfied that it was, there was also an issue as to whether he had any of the states of mind requisite for murder. In addition, evidence was called on the question of substantial impairment within the meaning of s 23A of the Crimes Act, and provocation was left to the jury. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    7 I shall turn in a moment to medical evidence bearing upon the appellant’s mental state at the relevant time. Otherwise, a sufficient summary of the case for present purposes is to be found in his Honour’s remarks on sentence (at pars 4-20): 
     
      
       
        
         
        On 17 January 1999 ambulance officers, who had been summoned by two telephone calls made by the prisoner, attended a flat in Phelps Street, Surry Hills where the prisoner was residing with the victim, his de facto wife. The ambulance officers arrived at the premises at about 12.30 pm. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim was found lying naked on the floor covered by a sheet. She was in a state of decreased consciousness and suffering from multiple injuries. She had a bleeding wound to the back of her head. There was significant bruising over her arms and legs and she had sustained numerous fractured ribs. It was apparent that she was suffering the effects of a brain injury and was convulsing. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner was present and told the ambulance officers that the deceased had suffered a fit while having a shower. He said that both he and the deceased had taken ecstasy the night before and they had reacted badly to it. The prisoner was apparently suffering from abdominal pain and on occasions could be heard retching in the bathroom.  
        
       
       
        
        Shortly after the deceased was removed to the hospital the prisoner spoke to Constable Agnew. He told the officer that he was with the deceased at a house the previous night and they had been given ecstasy mixed with a white powder. He left those premises after an argument but the deceased remained because she was in his words “pretty wasted”. The prisoner came home but returned in the morning to take the deceased home. He had cut his thumb when he broke the window in the front door of the premises because he said the occupants would not let him inside. He said that when they arrived home the deceased was all right for a while, but then she ”went all crazy”. She was coming off the drug and was in pain. The prisoner said he also did not feel well and they both got into the shower. The deceased then had a fit and fell on top of him, hitting her head as she did. 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner was later himself conveyed to hospital because of his complaints of pain to his abdomen. An examination of the prisoner did not reveal any significant injury or illness and he was discharged. Immediately thereafter he was arrested by police and taken to Surry Hills Police Station where he was interviewed. He substantially repeated the account he had previously given to Constable Agnew although in more detail. He denied that he had assaulted the deceased in any way and maintained that she had injured herself when falling in the shower. 
        
       
       
        
        The deceased died at about 3 am on 18 January. When the prisoner was informed of this fact he was so distressed that the custody officer at the police station obtained the assistance of the crisis centre at St Vincent’s Hospital to tend to him. 
        
       
       
        
        The premises, which the prisoner had visited with the deceased on 16 January, were in Crown Street, Surry Hills about 350 metres from the flat in Phelps Street. Ms Ferry and Mr Craft lived there together. The prisoner and the deceased had met these two persons, with whom they were casually acquainted, at a local hotel during that afternoon. After having consumed a substantial amount of alcohol, the four decided to go to the premises at Crown Street so that the two men could watch wrestling on television and the females could chat together. They purchased some more beer on the way. 
        
       
       
        
        The four arrived at the premises at about 5.30 pm. They sat in the lounge room in front of the television drinking beer and talking. At about 7 pm the prisoner suddenly stood up and facing Ms Ferry and the deceased who were talking on a lounge, he said “Don’t talk about my relationship”. He then angrily left the premises. The deceased remained behind at the flat. 
        
       
       
        
        About an hour later the deceased asked whether she could make a telephone call and was shown by Ms Ferry into the bedroom. Records show that two phone calls were made from the Crown Street premises to the flat in Phelps Street one just before and one just after 8 pm. There was other evidence before the jury that proved that the prisoner was at those premises sometime shortly after 7 pm.  
        
       
       
        
        About five minutes after the deceased had entered the bedroom to make the telephone call, Ms Ferry entered the room and found the deceased in a distressed condition. She asked Ms Ferry if she could have a safe house that night, as she did not want to go home. Ms Ferry sought to comfort the deceased and they sat talking and drinking beer until the deceased fell asleep some time before midnight. Later Ms Ferry and then Mr Craft went to sleep in the bed alongside the deceased.  
        
       
       
        
        In the early hours of 17 January Mr Craft and Ms Ferry were awoken by the sound of smashing glass. A short time later the prisoner came into the bedroom. Mr Craft, Ms Ferry and the deceased were together in the bed, naked. The prisoner told the deceased to get dressed because they were leaving. The deceased got out of bed, dressed and then left with the prisoner. She was not seen again until the ambulance officers attended at Phelps Street. 
        
       
       
        
        The deceased died from an injury to her head that caused bleeding within her brain. Dr Botterill, who conducted an autopsy on the deceased, summarised his findings as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “In plain terms autopsy findings included numerous extensive bruises over the body and the limbs, a collection of blood over the right side of the brain, many broken ribs with a collection of blood in the right chest cavity. The bruises present over the body were both days old and more recent. Some of the patterned bruises, particularly over the lower limbs, were suggestive of use of a rod like implement, the remaining bruises might be the consequence of other blunt force injury.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The doctor found the deceased had 79 injuries of which 12 were consistent with having been caused by medical intervention. There was substantial fresh bruising over the whole of the deceased’s body. Some of the bruising was consistent with knuckle marks and some with finger grips. Bruising to the back of her hands and arms were consistent with defence wounds. She had a major wound to the back of her head and a laceration to her chin. There were 11 fractured ribs. 
        
       
       
        
        Some of the bruises to the left leg and buttock of the deceased were consistent with having been caused by a piece of wood that was found in the flat at Phelps Street. Photographs of this object appear to show a bloody handprint upon it. Analysis of the blood on this item was consistent with it having come from the prisoner. The prisoner was right-handed and was bleeding from his right thumb after he broke into the Crown Street premises. 
        
       
       
        
        There was evidence that attempts had been made to clean up the flat at Phelps Street before the ambulance officers arrived. There were bloodstains on the wall, which appeared to have been wiped, and there was blood on a sponge found in a sports bag. Bloodstained clothing was found in a pillowslip in the kitchen. 
        
       
       
        
        In short the evidence revealed overwhelmingly that the prisoner beat the deceased to death in the flat in Phelps Street some time after they returned there from Crown Street. In light of the extent and nature of the injuries she sustained, I believe that the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner intended to kill her. This is notwithstanding the obvious remorse shown by the prisoner when the ambulance officers arrived and his endeavours to assist her once he had come to his senses and realised what he had done. 
        
       
       
        
        These events have to be seen in the context of the relationship between the prisoner and the deceased existing at the time of her death. They entered into a de facto relationship in mid 1996. From that time until a few months before her death the deceased had on numerous occasions suffered injuries at the hands of the prisoner. Either as a result of these injuries or fearing that the prisoner would assault her, the deceased at various times sought shelter with friends, her family in England or at a woman’s refuge. However, the prisoner always attempted to find her and she always returned to live with him shortly after leaving him. Notwithstanding the attacks upon her, the deceased refused to seek assistance from the police and on at least one occasion lied to the police about who was responsible for the injuries. 
        
       
       
       
      
    8 On the issue of substantial impairment senior counsel for the appellant at the trial, who did not appear in this Court, called Dr Thomas Clark, psychiatrist. Dr Clark diagnosed the appellant to be suffering from temporal lobe syndrome, also known as focal epilepsy, on the basis of a number of symptoms described by the appellant when furnishing his history. These included such things as blackouts, headaches, bed-wetting and the experience of curious smells, as well as a history of unpredictable and impulsive behaviour, exhibiting a “short fuse”.  
     
      
    9 Dr Clark explained that people with this condition can experience “complex partial seizures”, which impair their capacity to control “rage or violence”. The seizures can also disturb their consciousness of their surroundings and their own behaviour, leading to impaired memory of what occurred during the seizure. Generally, he explained that the temporal lobes are the areas where emotions are coordinated, and the syndrome which he described gives rise to abnormal emotions and can lead to temporary outbursts of violence. 
     
      
    10 The doctor found some support for his diagnosis in an MRI scan which had been supplied to him, although he said that he would defer to the opinion of a neurologist in the interpretation of that scan. The Crown called a neurologist, Dr David Gillies, who disagreed with Dr Clark’s interpretation of the scan and considered his diagnosis of temporal lobe syndrome to be “doubtful”. The Crown also called Dr Chiu Lung Wong, psychiatrist, who had taken a detailed history from the appellant and who also disagreed with Dr Clark’s diagnosis.  
     
      
    11 It must be said that, even accepting Dr Clark’s diagnosis, there was a paucity of evidence that the appellant was suffering a seizure at the relevant time.  
     
      
       
       
      Directions to the jury 
       
      
    12 In summing up, Howie J referred to this medical evidence only in connection with the defence of substantial impairment, which was put on the basis of an abnormality of mind impairing the appellant’s capacity to understand events and to control himself: s23A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. On the question whether the appellant had any of the states of mind necessary to establish murder, intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm or reckless indifference to human life, his Honour told the jury that they could have regard to the evidence of his emotional state at the time and evidence suggesting that he was affected by a drug. However, he directed the jury that the medical evidence was irrelevant to that issue.  
     
      
    13 What his Honour said was this: 
     
      
       
        
        For the purposes of determining this issue of intent, namely whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the accused caused the injury which led to the death of the deceased, he intended to kill her or do her really serious bodily injury, you should put out of your minds the psychiatric evidence about the accused suffering an abnormality of the mind which is said to have substantially impaired his ability to control himself. That evidence is of course principally relevant to your consideration of the defence of substantial impairment. You consider that defence only once you come to the view that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did murder the deceased, and that he did so with one of the states of mind necessary for the charge of murder. 
        
       
       
      While his Honour did not expressly refer to reckless indifference to human life in that passage, the jury would no doubt have understood that the medical evidence was also irrelevant to that question. 
       
      
    14 It is this direction which gives rise to the only ground of appeal against conviction.  
     
      
       
       
      Appeal against conviction 
       
      
    15 Mr Zahra SC, for the appellant, argued that this direction was in error, relying upon the decision of the High Court in Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 500. It appears from the transcript that his Honour determined that the direction was appropriate, with the concurrence of counsel then appearing for the appellant, in reliance upon R v S [1979] 2 NSWLR 1. No reference was made to Hawkins, either by his Honour or by counsel. This is perhaps not surprising because, despite the importance of the issues with which it was concerned, Hawkins appears to have received very little curial attention in this State. The Crown prosecutor before us, who also did not appear at the trial, told us that he could find no decision of this Court in which it had been applied. 
     
      
    16 Nevertheless, the Crown prosecutor did not deny that evidence of mental disorder may be relevant to intent. So much was assumed in R v Gosling [2002] NSWCCA 351 and, for the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to revisit R v S or to plumb the depths of the High Court’s reasoning in Hawkins. The Crown prosecutor’s submission was that, in the circumstances of this case, the medical evidence had little or no bearing on the question of intent or reckless indifference and that, in any event, the direction complained of could not have given rise to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    17 In my view, that submission is sound. Dr Clark’s evidence could have been no more than peripheral to the question of intent or reckless indifference. The absence of evidence that the appellant was undergoing a seizure at the relevant time is consistent with the fact that he did not suggest any significant impairment of memory when he spoke to the police. Rather, he gave an exculpatory account of how the deceased had suffered her injuries and the central issue in the case was whether he had caused her death. One can readily understand that counsel representing the appellant at trial was content to confine the medical evidence to the issue of substantial impairment, relying upon Dr Clark’s evidence primarily to demonstrate and to explain the appellant’s impulsivity and lack of self-control.  
     
      
    18 Although no redirection was sought by counsel at trial, the issue is an important one and I would not apply rule 4. However, in the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that his Honour’s direction was in error. In any event, even if Dr Clark’s evidence might have had some bearing upon intent or reckless indifference, I am satisfied that the failure to give such a direction could not have given rise to any substantial miscarriage of justice. The Crown case on murder was a strong one. It was well open to the jury to reject the appellant’s exculpatory account and to conclude that he had killed the deceased with one of the states of mind requisite for murder. It is highly improbable that anything in the evidence of Dr Clark, which stood alone and was contradicted by the evidence of two other experts, would have created a reasonable doubt about the mental element of that crime. 
     
      
    19 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.  
     
      
       
      Appeal against sentence 
      
    20 As I have said, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-four years with a non-parole period of eighteen years. At the time he was sentenced, he was serving a sentence for an unrelated matter, which had been backdated to the date of his arrest for the murder. The non-parole period in respect of that sentence expired on 18 March 2001, but he remained in custody awaiting trial for the murder. Accordingly, his Honour directed the sentence for the murder to commence on 18 March 2001.21 His Honour found that the killing was done in anger and was not premeditated. He also found that the appellant regretted what he had done, that he contacted the ambulance service out of concern for the deceased’s well being, and that his grief over her death was genuine. He accepted that there was a loss of self-control on his part, such that the level of violence which he inflicted upon her was greater than he had ever exhibited towards her before.22 On the other hand, his Honour was satisfied that the appellant was not under the influence of ecstasy at the time of the killing and he rejected Dr Clark’s diagnosis of temporal lobe syndrome. The appellant was examined for the purpose of sentence by Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist, who provided a report. Dr Allnutt found the appellant to be suffering from a type of psychosis characterised by auditory hallucinations, which responded to anti-psychotic medication. While having regard to this evidence on the question of sentence, his Honour was satisfied that the appellant was not suffering from any such condition prior to the murder and that it afforded no explanation of his violent conduct then or, indeed, on earlier occasions.23 His Honour had regard to the fact that the killing was not an isolated incident of violence, but was the culmination of a pattern of violent behaviour towards the deceased. In addition, his Honour was concerned that the appellant’s criminal record demonstrated that his resort to violence was not confined to that relationship. Apart from offences of dishonesty and drug offences, that record includes a number of entries for violence, some of them quite serious. He was sentenced to imprisonment for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm in 1991, for robbery, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and related offences of violence in 1994, and for robbery in company in 1999.24 It was that last sentence which he was serving when he was dealt with for the murder, and it must be added that he was on bail in respect of that offence at the time of the killing. Clearly, his criminal antecedents did nothing to assist his case on sentence. 
     
      
    25 The appellant was thirty-two years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty-six. His personal background is unremarkable and need not be recited, except to note a history of alcohol and drug abuse since his teenage years. Dr Allnutt reported that in the weeks leading up to sentence, while taking medication, his behaviour had improved and he appeared more receptive to assistance and guidance, displaying more insight into his problems of aggression and substance abuse. While having regard to that evidence, his Honour considered the appellant’s violent behaviour to be of continuing concern, particularly if he entered into another intimate relationship upon his release. 
     
      
    26 All these were matters properly to be weighed in the sentencing process. The offence was undoubtedly a serious one of its kind. Although it was spontaneous, this was a brutal attack accompanied, as his Honour found, by an intent to kill. It was perpetrated by a man with a history of violence towards the deceased and others, at a time when he was on bail in respect of another serious offence, and whose prospects of rehabilitation are uncertain. 
     
      
    27 Notwithstanding these features, however, I am persuaded that the sentence is excessive and calls for this Court’s intervention. The Crown prosecutor and Mr Zahra provided us with schedules of cases of murder in the setting of an intimate relationship, both in this Court and at first instance. I put to one side three entirely exceptional cases in which sentences of life imprisonment were imposed: Street (CCA, unreported, 17 December 1996), Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448, Miles [2002] NSWCCA 276.  
     
      
    28 In two cases Greg James J sentenced the offenders to imprisonment for thirty years: Birac [1999] NSWSC 61, Bond [2000] NSWSC 1059. In the first of those cases the killing was premeditated. The offender, who stabbed his second wife to death, had previously been convicted of the malicious wounding of his first wife. His Honour fixed a minimum term of twenty years. In the second case the killing was not premeditated but the offender, who also fatally stabbed his partner, had a substantial criminal record and was on parole at the time for the manslaughter of another woman. A sentence of thirty years was also passed in Berger (Finlay J, unreported, 21 March 1995), in which the offender was on parole at the time of the killing for the manslaughter of his former partner and her daughter in circumstances which his Honour found to be similar to those of the murder for which he stood for sentence. 
     
      
    29 Several of the cases can also be put aside as they involved multiple killings. In almost all of those the offender killed his partner and one or more children, and sentences ranged from twenty-one years: Cikos [2001] NSWSC 35 (Dunford J) to twenty-six years: Park (Sperling J, unreported, 3 August 2000). Otherwise, sentences ranged from fourteen to twenty-four years, the majority of them being less than twenty years. In most of the cases the offender had little or no criminal record. 
     
      
    30 Three of these cases involved sentences of twenty-four years. In Chetcuti (CCA, unreported, 24 December 1993) the offender murdered his estranged wife to prevent her pursuing a property claim in the Family Court. The killing was brutal and premeditated. In Barry [2000] NSWCCA 138, the offender went to the home where his estranged wife was living, in breach of an apprehended violence order. There he killed her and also inflicted a serious wound upon his twelve-year-old stepdaughter. The twenty-four year sentence embraced the criminality of the murder and the malicious wounding with intent of the stepdaughter. In Keir [2000] NSWSC 111, the offender killed his wife in anger because she had had an affair. Adams J found that he did not intend to kill her, but that his violence was “calculated” and was the product of his “arrogant, controlling behaviour” towards her. In what his Honour described as “a chilling degree of remorseless callousness”, he then buried her body and claimed that she had left him.  
     
      
    31 Generally speaking, other cases in which sentences of twenty years or more were passed involved killings which were premeditated or were particularly brutal. Examples of the former are Corrigan (Finlay J, unreported, 15 April 1993) – twenty-one years, Whitmore (CCA, unreported, 23 July 1998) – twenty years, and Matheson [2001] NSWSC 332 (Howie J) – also twenty years. Examples of the latter are Herring (Badgery-Parker J, unreported, 4 December 1995) – in round figures twenty-two years, and Everett (CCA, unreported, 13 December 1995) – twenty-one years. In the first of those two cases, the offender struck his wife on the back of the head and held her under water in their swimming pool until she drowned. In the second, the offender doused his wife with petrol and set her on fire.  
     
      
    32 It appears to me that, with the possible exception of Keir, a pattern of sentencing emerges from these cases from which it can be said that it is only in an exceptional case that a sentence in excess of twenty years has been passed where the killing was not premeditated. It is in the light of that pattern that I am satisfied that the sentence of twenty-four years in the present case is excessive. Were it not for the appellant’s history of violence towards the deceased, his criminal record and the fact that he was on bail at the relevant time, I would have considered a sentence of less than twenty years appropriate. In so saying, I do not overlook the ferocity of the attack which led to her death. In the light of those aggravating features, however, I think that a twenty year sentence is called for. The application of the usual statutory proportion would lead to a non-parole period of fifteen years. I believe that any lesser term would fail to reflect the applicant’s criminality, and it would still leave a substantial period during which he would be eligible for conditional liberty. 
     
      
    33 I would grant leave to appeal against the sentence and would allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence passed by Howie J and I would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for twenty years, to date from 18 March 2001, with a non-parole period of fifteen years.  
     
      
    34 Since preparing this judgment in draft, I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Levine J and Smart AJ. I note that their Honours would allow the appeal against sentence but would substitute a sentence higher than that which I propose. I have given their Honours’ views careful consideration, but my assessment that a sentence of no more than twenty years is called for remains unchanged.  
     
      
    35 SMART AJ: I agree with Hidden J for the reasons which he has given that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. I also agree that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    36 As to the application for leave to appeal against sentence I have found the analysis of the cases contained in the judgment of Hidden J to be helpful. It is unusual to impose a sentence in excess of 20 years where the killing was not premeditated, unless the circumstances of the killing were very bad or there are other aggravating features. 
     
      
    37 In the present case this combination of circumstances must be borne in mind: 
     
      
      (a) the killing was a very brutal one, as the injuries detailed in the remarks of the sentencing judge established, and 
       
      (b) the applicant’s history of violence towards the deceased, and 
       
      (c) his criminal record, and 
       
      (d) the fact that he was on bail at the time. 
       
      
    38 That combination, and particularly the factors mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) leads me to the conclusion that the correct head sentence is one of 22 years and the correct non-parole period is one of 16 years and 6 months. A lesser non-parole period would not adequately reflect the grave criminality involved in this crime. 
     
      
    39 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal against conviction dismissed 
       
      (2) Leave to appeal against sentence granted 
       
      (3) Appeal against sentence allowed; sentence quashed  
       
      (4) In lieu of the sentence imposed the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 22 years starting on 18 March 2001 with a non-parole period of 16 years 6 months expiring on 17 September 2017 on which date the applicant would become eligible for release on parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CARRUTHERS AJ: Muammer Demiroz (also known as Paul Demiroz and to whom I shall refer as the appellant) appeals against his convictions at the Penrith District Court on 7 June 2002 upon two counts of aggravated break, enter and steal pursuant to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (hereinafter the Act) and one count of drive vehicle taken without consent of owner under s 154A(1)(b) of the Act. 
     
      
    2 On 3 June 2002 the appellant was arraigned at the Penrith District Court before his Honour Judge Viney QC and a jury of twelve upon an indictment containing three counts in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1) That he on or about 10 May 2001 at Lidcombe in the State of New South Wales in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he knew that persons were present in the dwelling house at the time, did break and enter the dwelling house of Joseph Lee situated at 34 Dudley Street and while in the said dwelling did steal certain property, namely a black handbag containing credit cards, cheque books and other personal items; a set of keys and a 68 centimetre Sony television, the property of Joseph and Cam Lee. 
        
       
       
        
        2) That he on 10 May 2001 at Lidcombe in the State of New South Wales in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that he knew that a person was present in the dwelling house at the time did break and enter the dwelling house of Joseph Villegas situated at 294 Vaughan Street and while in the said dwelling did steal certain property, namely a Tanada brand acoustic guitar, a Sony DVD player, a Hanimex tripod; a Canon video recorder and a polaroid Joy Cam in a carry case the property of Joseph Villegas. 
        
       
       
        
        3) That he on or about 10 May 2001 at Lidcombe in the State of New South Wales did drive a conveyance, namely a Toyota Tarago registration number AEI 85S knowing that the said conveyance had been taken without the consent of the owner.” 
        
       
      
    3 On 7 June 2002 his Honour sentenced the appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        In respect of each of counts 1 and 2 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for eight years to commence on 8 March 2002 and to expire on 7 March 2010. A non-parole period of five years was specified to expire on 7 March 2007. 
         
        In respect of count 3 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a fixed term of three years to commence on 8 March 2002 and to expire on 7 March 2005. 
        
       
       
      Thus, all sentences were to be served concurrently. 
       
      
    4 There are two grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The trial miscarried by reason of the learned trial judge failing to direct the jury in relation to the dangers of identification evidence as required by s 116 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
         
        2. The trial miscarried by reason of the learned judge failing to direct the jury in accordance with s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995. 
        
       
      
    5 The prosecution case may briefly be stated as follows. At the time of the alleged offences the appellant was living by himself at 2 Queen Street, Auburn. The prosecution alleged that on 10 May 2001 the appellant drove a Tarago van, stolen between 4 pm and 5 pm the previous day, to Dudley Street, Lidcombe, where, between 10 pm and 6 am, he broke into the premises at 34 Dudley Street and placed the stolen goods in the van, which he had earlier parked in Dudley Street. (Counts 1 and 3.) 
     
      
    6 In respect of count 2, it was alleged that the appellant broke into the premises at 94 Vaughan Street at about 5 am by cutting the fly screen around a door allowing the latch to be opened, whereupon he stole a number of items, which he then placed in the Tarago van still parked in Dudley Street. All items were recovered in the stolen van after the appellant’s arrest.  
     
      
    7 The Crown case in relation to both counts 1 and 3 was a circumstantial one, relying in large part upon the evidence in respect of count 2. 
     
      
    8 Indeed, the trial was conducted upon the agreed basis that, in the circumstances of this case, a finding of guilt in respect of count 2 would necessarily result in a finding of guilt in respect of counts 1 and 3.  
     
      
    9 The principal Crown witnesses were Errol Singh, AZ, and his father, BZ. 
     
      
    10 It is relevant to note that the appellant is a tall, well-built man with a moustache. Dudley Street has been described in evidence as a busy, main road carrying a lot of traffic. 
     
      
    11 AZ gave evidence that in May 2001 he was living with his parents and siblings at XX Vaughan Street, Lidcombe. He gave evidence that in the early hours of 10 May he was asleep in his bedroom when he was awakened by the noise of his dog barking. He said he looked out of his window. His evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did you see? 
         
        A. I saw a man with a big build walking past our place looking at our property. He had a camera and a tripod in his hand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now you said the man was a big build, did you see what clothes he was wearing? 
         
        A. Yes, he was wearing dark black clothes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now you said he was looking at your property, can you describe what you actually saw him doing? 
         
        A. Well basically he was sort of like in a hurry, had the camera, had a camera and the tripod on his hand and he was looking around continuously like at our window and around our property, I guess to see if anyone was seeing him or something and --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Don’t see what you think the man was thinking. 
         
        A. Okay. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just describe what you can see? 
         
        A. Sorry. Basically I saw him looking at our property continuously and he was walking towards Dudley Street.” 
        
       
       
      Dudley Street runs at right angles to Vaughan Street. Vaughan Street runs east/west. Dudley Street, therefore, runs north/south. 
       
      
    12 The witness lost sight of the man. However, he spoke to his father who was already awake, and whose bedroom also faced Vaughan Street. They both looked out the window and AZ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “... after a couple of minutes later we saw the same man walk back.” 
        
       
      
    13 He was walking from the Dudley Street corner towards Oxford Street which also runs at right angles to Vaughan Street. Thus, it also runs north/south. Apparently the AZ residence is located in Vaughan Street between the intersections of Dudley Street and Oxford Street. AZ’s evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you saw him walk past the front of the house, again how much of the man were you able to see, could you see head and shoulders, could you see the whole body? 
         
        A. I can see the whole body. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At that stage could you see if he was carrying anything? 
         
        A. Yes, he didn’t have anything at that stage. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How quickly was he moving when you saw him walking back? 
         
        A. It wasn’t that quick, it was just like a stead (sic) pace, he was just walking but he looked suspicious. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Once you saw the man go past did you lose sight of him? 
         
        A. When he walked past I lost sight of him, but then I went into my Mum’s room, my Mum’s bedroom and from there I could see him, basically -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did you see him? 
         
        A. He was basically in my neighbour’s property along the driveway and walking towards the back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the neighbour whose property you say you saw him walking down, what number in the street is that? 
         
        A. Probably number 94. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That was number 94 that he was walking down, and do you know who lived in umber 94? 
         
        A. Yes, my neighbour and Joseph on the bottom level. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now you say you saw the man, you say, on the driveway walking towards the back of the house, is that where you saw him? 
         
        A. Yes, I saw the man walk through the gate along the house property towards the back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As he got to the back of number 94 were you able to see where he went? 
         
        A. No, basically once he went over the boundary he just turned in so I can’t see nothing after that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say he turned in did he go further towards the rear of the 94 yard? 
         
        A. Well basically he was in the rear of the property and just turned left towards the door. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After you’d seen the man go down the side in number 94, did you do anything after that? 
         
        A. Talked to my Dad. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where were you when you talked to your Dad? 
         
        A. Went back to his room. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So that was facing Vaughan Street? 
         
        A. Vaughan Street. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After you’d spoken to your father did you see anything else? 
         
        A. After that we looked outside the window again and we seen the same man walking past with a guitar, a black guitar bag in his hand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what sort of pace was the man walking at then? 
         
        A. He was like average, like slightly fast but not too fast, but he was walking. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you notice anything else about the man, the way he was looking or where he was looking? 
         
        A. Well basically again he was looking at our property again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At that stage was your dog doing anything? 
         
        A. Yes, the dog was continuously barking the whole time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where was the man when you first saw him with the guitar? 
         
        A. Basically I seen him come out of the neighbour’s property. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when he came out of the neighbour’s property which direction did he go in? 
         
        A. He was going towards Dudley Street. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you lose sight of him – were you able to see him as he walked -- 
         
        A. Towards Dudley Street?” 
        
       
      
    14 AZ then gave evidence that he went outside his family residence and waited for his father to come out. They both then ran up the street towards the Dudley Street intersection. 
     
      
    15 His evidence then continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And did you see the man when you were running with your Dad? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did you see him? 
         
        A. Basically he went into his van. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What does the van look like? 
         
        A. What does the van look like? 
         
        A. It was a blue Tarago van. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And once you saw the man get into the blue Tarago van what did you do then? 
         
        A. We ran after him, the window was slightly open and basically we were screaming at him to come out of the car. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Once you’d yelled at him to come out of the car was it just you yelling that? 
         
        A. I was yelling most but my Dad was yelling as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. From the time you wee yelling at the man in the van did anything else happen? 
         
        A. Well basically we got into a – basically, he didn’t want to come out of the car, he was leaning onto the other side, as if he wanted to, I guess, run away from the other side. And at that time someone else came up as well, and basically we’re trying to get him out of the car, we got into a scuffle and tried to throw like a punch through the window and tried to block it, we got into a scuffle, eventually he came out of the car, and at that time we were screaming, yelling, just in self-defence, basically.” 
        
       
      
    16 After some discussion his Honour granted AZ the benefit of a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act which granted him privilege in respect of self incrimination in other proceedings. AZ then gave evidence that he and his father dragged the man out of the driver’s cabin of the van and subdued him on the ground outside the van, that is to say, on the roadway.  
     
      
    17 Other residents in the district came out to the scene and shortly thereafter the police and an ambulance arrived. 
     
      
    18 AZ was asked in chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you first saw the man inside the van are you able to describe what clothing or anything else he was wearing?” 
        
       
       
      He responded: 
       
       
        
        “He was wearing big black clothes, like they were black. I remember outside he had a glove, he had gloves on his hands.” 
        
       
       
      They were described as “like thick working gloves”. 
       
      
    19 AZ was further asked in chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you first saw the man walking down Dudley Street – sorry, down Vaughan Street, how clearly were you able to see him? 
         
        A. I mean it’s pretty clear because my bedroom is not that far away from the fence so it’s maybe like four or five metres away from the fence and it’s fairly clear because it’s bright, it’s like the day time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How close was the man to the fence-line? 
         
        A. Maybe like forty – thirty/forty/fifty centimetres away from the front fence, just along the footpath. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Your bedroom window is that – if you’re standing in your bedroom would you be street level or would you be higher than the street? 
         
        A. I’m higher than the street. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is there any front fence or anything that blocked your view of the man when he was walking along Vaughan Street? 
         
        A. No there isn’t, our fence is only a low fence, our front fence, maybe a maximum of one metre high and it’s just a metal fence like nothing in the way of my view.” 
        
       
      
    20 And further he said in evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. At that stage were you able to see – or what of the man’s face were you able to see as he walked past? 
         
        A. Basically I could see his face because it was looking at our windows, so at that time I remember he had a moustache and like – and then I could see his side face that was all, like when he was walking, so I could see his face.” 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say the man walked back from Dudley Street across the front of your property, what of his face were you able to see at that stage? 
         
        A. Basically like along the side of his face again and like I said every now and then he was looking at our property, at our windows and that, so I could see like the front of his face and the side of his face. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you went round to your mother’s window that you said looks across to number 94 that’s on the side of the house, what were you able to see of the man’s face then? 
         
        A. Basically I could see the side of his face and as he was walking up towards the back of the property just basically the back of him, like the back of his head. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Looking from your mother’s bedroom window across to number 94 is there any fence in between the two properties? 
         
        A. There is a fence but it’s not that high but you can see, like it’s not that high, it’s (sic) doesn’t obstruct anything like – like you can, if anyone wants to walk through that property you can see him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is your mother’s bedroom floor height higher than the ground level there? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When the man – you next saw him on Vaughan Street with the guitar, what of his face were you able to see then? 
         
        A. Sorry, what? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you saw the man again with the guitar? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you able to see his face then? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How much of his face did you see at that stage? 
         
        A. Basically the same as before, like I could see his side of his face and as I said he was always looking at our property and I could see his face from the front. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you went out onto Vaughan Street you’ve said that you could see the man with the guitar and he was around about number 98? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. From the moment you saw him at the front of 98 until the man was inside the Tarago van, did you lose sight of him? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    21 I interpolate here that evidence was given that the appellant was severely injured when he was overpowered by AZ and others (upon the mistaken belief, the appellant claimed, that he was the thief). Indeed, the appellant was required to spend six days in Westmead Hospital as a result of the injuries inflicted upon him. In cross-examination of AZ most of the questions were directed to the overpowering (to use a neutral term) of the appellant. 
     
      
    22 BZ gave evidence that he was awoken in the early hours of 10 May by the barking of the dog. He looked out the window of his bedroom. He said he saw someone walking in front of his house away from Dudley Street. He lost sight of him but some time after, he said, “I saw the same person taking something with three legs.” The interpreter added after that “like a tripod”. At that stage, according to BZ, he was walking towards Dudley Street. His evidence in chief continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you see anything of the man’s face as he was walking past then? 
         
        A. His face was not covered. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you able to see a side view, a front view or a back view of his head? What did you see? 
         
        A. Side of his – left side of his head. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The – if I can ask you about the lighting in front of your house that morning, what was the lighting like? 
         
        A. Very big lighting, large. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was the light source? 
         
        A. The council lights.” 
        
       
      
    23 The witness said his son then came into the room and they both looked out the window and saw “that person outside was coming back”. 
     
      
    24 BZ then saw the man walking from Dudley Street and he was not carrying anything. 
     
      
    25 BZ’s evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And what’s the next thing that you saw or did?” 
        
       
      
    26 He then said he went out into the street with his son and they went towards Dudley Street. As they approached Dudley Street he saw a Kombi van under a tree about four houses away from the corner. He said “I saw the person who was carrying the guitar at the steering wheel of that vehicle”. 
     
      
    27 BZ then went up to the vehicle and grabbed the man by the right shoulder. The man resisted. The man was wearing a very large glove and he was trying to start the car. “Somehow the door opened and I pulled him out”. He then gave evidence of how the man was overpowered on the roadway. 
     
      
    28 During the course of his evidence in chief BZ gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. At this stage I’d like to ask you about when you first saw the man walk past your bedroom window, how much of his face were you able to see at that time? 
         
        A. From – well this side, all of this side, right side because of the lights. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Once the man – you said the next thing you saw him walking back with the thing with the three legs, how much of his face could you see? 
         
        A. *All(?)* He was holding it in his left hand and he was just walking, looking, on the footpath, walking. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But how much of his face were you able to see? 
         
        A. Well I wasn’t looking just to see his face. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you saw the man walk back from the direction of Dudley Street after you’d seen him with the three-legged thing, were you able to see his face then? 
         
        A. Yes, I saw his face. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How much of his face did you see then? 
         
        A. From this to this side. From here, up to this side. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you suggesting only a profile view? 
         
        A. Just because he was walking, sort of looking like this and he had his hand in his pocket and he was walking, sort of walking this way and I saw. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you saying it’s just a profile view of the man that you only see the side of his face? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you saw the man walk back going towards Dudley Street carrying the guitar, how much of his face did you see at that stage? 
         
        A. Well when he was walking back to other side, I saw the side of his face that I did not see when he was walking the other way. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you notice what the man was wearing on that morning? 
         
        A. I wasn’t aware of it.” 
        
       
      
    29 Again BZ’s cross-examination was mainly directed to the injuries inflicted upon the appellant during the course of the overpowering process.  
     
      
    30 Mr Errol Singh gave evidence that on the morning of 10 May 2001 he was living at Unit 4, 33 Dudley Street, Lidcombe. The front of the townhouse in which he lived, however, faced Vaughan Street. 
     
      
    31 It was necessary for Mr Singh to commence work early and about 5 am he was out the front of his home putting on his work boots and warming up the engine of his car. He was facing Vaughan Street. His evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. While you were there did you hear or see something? 
         
        A. Yeah I heard noises from across the road – double storey house and the dog was barking, it had been barking for a little while and that was pretty unusual for that time in the morning so I was just watching out, putting my shoes on and then I heard a noise coming through the side there and didn’t take much notice ‘cause the guy that lives there usually comes back home late sometimes, I think he was a security guard or something so – but I never saw his car or anything there. So I was just watching and then saw a gentleman walk out, come out of there with a guitar suitcase and that was strange, so -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now from what you saw of the man who had the guitar in the case, what did he look like? 
         
        A. A big guy, dark hair, he had a moustache. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he look like the guy who lived in that house to your knowledge? 
         
        A. No no.” 
        
       
      
    32 Mr Singh said that the man was walking in the direction of Dudley Street.  
     
      
    33 Mr Singh’s evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Once you’d seen the man walk out with the guitar, did you see anything after that? 
         
        A. Well I was just watching his – he started to walk out pretty fast and at that time, neighbours’ house, the double storey house. The lights went on and they came running out, yelling out ‘Thief’ and then by that time, the gentleman started running. They started chasing him and I just put me shoes on and took off after as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say the neighbours came out and started yelling ‘Thief’. Did you recognize the people that came out and started yelling? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who was that? 
         
        A. Well I didn’t know their names at that time. I know their names now. It’s AZ and his family, his father and that. They came out. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. whereabouts was the man when you saw AZ and his father and that come out? 
         
        A. With his – he walked across past their house and was just, at that time everything just happened, he walked and they came running out and sort of started chasing them and then I knew there was something wrong, so I put me shoes on and took off as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So at the time when you saw them come out and start chasing, how far had the man gone with the guitar? 
         
        A. He was – they came out and he was virtually at the corner there, just starting to turn the corner. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At that stage, to put your shoes on, did you lost sight of what was happening? 
         
        A. Yes I did, yeah.” 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Singh said that he ran out to the corner and he was asked whether he could see where AZ was or the man with the guitar. His evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Whereabouts were they? 
         
        A. They were up the top of the street, up the top of the street, probably about 20 metres up, something like that and they were sort of struggling. There was a few other people there as well and they were just like having a – just trying to grab him or, you know, put him to the ground or something like that. Just wrestling with him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you saw them with the man on the street, did you see if there were any vehicles near where they were? 
         
        A. There were vehicles there. I don’t – because it just happened so quick. There was cars – because we live on a main road, so the cars were going by, so yeah.” 
        
       
      
    35 Mr Singh said that he walked about twenty metres along Dudley Street and saw a group of persons who had “the guy ... on the middle of the road on the floor”. It is clear from the context that Mr Singh was using the word “floor” to refer to the roadway. 
     
      
    36 He was asked whether he saw “how the guy went down to the floor”, and he replied, “No, not really”. 
     
      
    37 I cannot discern from Mr Singh’s evidence that at any stage he actually saw a person being dragged out of the van. 
     
      
    38 During the course of his evidence in chief Mr Singh said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You said that the man that was on the ground was the same man that you’d seen carrying the guitar? 
         
        A. Yeah, definitely. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How confident are you of that? 
         
        A. Definitely. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why do you say that? 
         
        A. Because I saw his face. I saw him, saw his face because he came out – I didn’t see – I couldn’t see his face as he was coming out of the house, but once he got onto the footpath where the light was, saw him. Definitely it was him. He was a big guy and – yeah.” 
        
       
      
    39 Finally, in relation to the Crown case, it should be noted that there was no fingerprint evidence linking the appellant to the van or the stolen property. The expert evidence was to the effect that no fingerprints were located on the stolen goods or the Tarago, but that smudge marks were found, consistent with a trace left by a glove. A yellow glove, which the appellant admitted he wore, was found near the van. 
     
      
    40 The appellant gave evidence that he left home between 4 and 4.30 am on the morning of 10 May 2001 as he wished to go for a walk, to take his dog for a walk and to pick up some cigarettes, and milk from a local newsagency. 
     
      
    41 He was walking towards Lidcombe along Vaughan Street and came to the intersection of Vaughan and Dudley Streets. He was walking on the footpath. He stopped on the corner and patted his dog who was a puppy. He said that he hard some noises, people talking, and he turned around and noticed there were two people talking beside a van. They were yelling and talking loudly. He noted the younger one had a bat in his hand. He then said that these two men attacked him and that he was struck by the bat. He then gave evidence of being assaulted at some length, the police arriving and being taken by ambulance to Westmead Hospital. He said that he was wearing gloves on the morning because it was cold and recognised the glove, to which I have already referred, as one of the gloves which he was wearing. He said that he has not seen his dog since. 
     
      
    42 For present purposes I do not think it is necessary to refer to any of the other evidence that was led in the case. No admissions were made by the appellant to police officers. The addresses by counsel were apparently not recorded.  
     
      
    43 I respectfully agree with counsel for the appellant before this Court that whilst the Crown relied upon other circumstantial evidence, the principal issue in the trial was whether it was the appellant who was the man observed by the relevant witnesses in Vaughan Street carrying stolen objects.  
     
      
    44 Indeed, his Honour said very shortly after he commenced summing-up: 
     
      
       
        
        “The crucial question in regard to each charge is ‘Was it the accused?’. The Crown has to prove it was the accused and prove that beyond any reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    45 His Honour gave the jury a standard direction on circumstantial evidence. His Honour summarised the evidence and the submissions of counsel for the Crown and counsel for the appellant. No re-directions were sought by either counsel. 
     
      
    46 As is clear from the grounds of appeal which I have set out above, the focus of the appellant’s case before this Court is the fact that his Honour gave no directions or warnings to the jury as to the dangers of identification evidence. I emphasise that counsel at the trial for the appellant sought no such direction. Nevertheless, it is necessary for this Court to determine firstly whether such a direction should have been given and, if so, what are the consequences of his Honour’s omission to give such a direction. 
     
      
    47 In the seminal identification case Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555, the High Court stressed that the seductive effect of identification evidence has so frequently led to proven miscarriages of justice that courts of criminal appeal and ultimate appellate courts have felt obliged to lay down special rules in relation to directions which judges must give in criminal trials where identification is a significant issue. 
     
      
    48 In a joint judgment (Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron & McHugh JJ) the Court said at 561-2: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whatever the defence and however the case is conducted, where evidence as to identification represents any significant part of the proof of guilt of an offence, the judge must warn the jury as to the dangers of convicting on such evidence where its reliability is disputed. The terms of the warning need not follow any articular formula. But it must be cogent and effective. It must be appropriate to the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the jury must be instructed ‘as to the factors which may affect the consideration of (the identification) evidence in the circumstances of the particular case’. A warning in general terms is insufficient. The attention of the jury ‘should be drawn to any weaknesses in the identification evidence’. Reference to counsel’s arguments is insufficient. The jury must have the benefit of a direction which has the authority of the judge’s office behind it. It follows that the trial judge should isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance which may reasonably be regarded as undermining the reliability of the identification evidence.” (Citations are not quoted.) 
        
       
      
    49 It is, with respect to the arguments on behalf of the Crown to the contrary, my firm view that the instant case is one where evidence as to identification of the appellant represented a significant part of the proof of guilt of the offence. It is abundantly clear from the aspects of the evidence to which I have referred that the common law principles relating to identification evidence were relevant. 
     
      
    50 When enacting the Evidence Act 1995, the legislature was alive to the importance of identification evidence and the corresponding dangers to which it can give rise, when it enacted s 116 of that Act. This section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “116(1) If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting the identification evidence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in so informing the jury.” 
        
       
      
    51 This provision is couched in stronger terms than the common law as expounded in Domican. It applies immediately identification evidence has been admitted. I do not accept a submission that was put before this Court on behalf of the Crown, that the statutory phrase “if identification evidence has been admitted” is intended to be confined to the case where there has been a contest as to whether evidence is admissible as identification evidence and subsequently admitted (over objection) as identification evidence. It is, in my view, relevant to every situation where evidence of identification is led before the jury. 
     
      
    52 It is obvious from the terminology of s 116 that the judge has no discretion as to whether he or she should caution the jury in relation to identification evidence, once identification has been admitted. The caution is mandatory. 
     
      
    53 Of course, decisions which have been given on the common law are of assistance in determining the content of the directions to be given in accordance with the statute: see R v Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414. 
     
      
    54 Nevertheless, by reason of the application of s 166, the legislature further acknowledged the dangers of identification evidence by enacting s 165(1)(b) of the Evidence Act which categorises identification “evidence as evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”. Strictly s 165(1)(b) does not apply to the instant case because there was no request by either party to warn the jury that the identification evidence may be unreliable. 
     
      
    55 It was necessary for the judge in the instant case to explain to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Why there is a special need for caution – why identification evidence in general may be unreliable, thus explaining why there was a special need for caution: see  
        Clarke 
         at 428; and  
        
       
       
        
        2. Why the specific identification evidence before them may be unreliable, by pointing out particular matters which may cause it to be unreliable. 
        
       
      
    56 It was inherent in the instant case that the identification evidence was of crucial importance to the Crown, because it was argued on behalf of the appellant, that AZ and BZ falsely sought to identify the appellant as the thief because they were concerned for the consequence of their having been involved in a serious assault upon the appellant. Insofar as Mr Singh’s evidence was concerned it was argued by the appellant that it was a case of mistaken identification. 
     
      
    57 It is interesting to note that no attempt was made by the Crown to obtain “in court” identification of the appellant by these three important Crown witnesses.  
     
      
    58 It was argued on behalf of the Crown before this Court that it was not suggested that the witnesses had made a mistake. In effect, it was argued, the witnesses were not purporting to identify the appellant in the usual sense. The Crown case was that the person who was in the vehicle was necessarily the same person who had been seen shortly before by the witnesses. If the appellant was the man in the van then the evidence was overwhelmingly the case, it was argued, that the appellant was the thief. 
     
      
    59 In short, the identification of the appellant as the man in the Tarago was based upon the assertion that the person removed from the van was the same person who was restrained and handed over to the police. It was argued that this issue did not depend upon identification evidence. 
     
      
    60 However, as was pointed out in argument, it must not be overlooked that AZ and BZ were the only two witnesses who deposed that the appellant was the person whom they removed from the driver’s seat of the van. They can get no support from the evidence of Mr Singh in this regard. 
     
      
    61 Therefore, as the evidence of the appellant was that he was never in the van a crucial issue of credit arose between the appellant and AZ and BZ. Thus the significance of the identification evidence cannot be dismissed lightly. In the context of the present case, one must bear in mind that: 
     
      
       
        
        “... the adequacy of a warning in an identification case must be evaluated in the context of the evidence in the case. But its adequacy is evaluated by reference to the identification evidence and not the other evidence in the case. The adequacy of the warning has to be evaluated by reference to the nature of the relationship between the witness and the person identified, the opportunity to observe the person subsequently identified, the length of time between the incident and the identification, and the nature and circumstances of the first identification - not by reference to other evidence which implicates the accused: see  
        Domican  
        at 565.” 
        
       
      
    62 I have already noted that there is a distinction between the requirements of the common law as expounded in Domican and those of the relevant legislation. This is because s 116(1) required that the direction must be given, whenever identification evidence has been given as distinguished from the common law requirement that a warning had to be given only where the identification evidence represented a significant part of the proof of the guilt of the accused. 
     
      
    63 I am satisfied therefore that regrettably his Honour (in the absence of assistance from counsel) overlooked the mandatory requirements of s 116 of the Act and omitted to give the jury appropriate directions and warnings. An error of law has been established. This raises the question then whether the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912, should be applied. 
     
      
    64 In R v Bruno, (CCA, unreported, 19 June 1997) this Court (Gleeson CJ, Powell JA, Studdert J) declined to apply the proviso in a case not unlike the present. 
     
      
    65 The present case was a strong Crown case. However, one could not conclude that the omission to give appropriate identification directions and warnings did not deprive the appellant of a chance which was fairly open to him of an acquittal: see Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493, per Fullagar J at 514. If the appropriate identification directions and warnings had been given, the possibility existed, in my view, that the appellant may have not have been convicted. 
     
      
    66 Accordingly I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The appeal be allowed. 
         
        2. The convictions be quashed. 
         
        3. That there be a new trial on all counts. 
        
       
      
    67 SHELLER JA: I agree. 
     
      
    68 HIDDEN J: I also agree. 
     
      
    69 SHELLER JA: The orders, therefore, will be as Carruthers AJ proposed.

     ANTHONY JOHN MELCHERS v REGINA 
     
     
      
    FACTSThe appellant was convicted of manslaughter. Patten DCJ sentenced him to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years three months to be served by way of periodic detention. The appellant appeals against the conviction. The respondent appeals against the sentence.HELD The appeal against the convictionA. (per Ipp JA, Buddin J agreeing, Smart AJ dissenting)(i) The jury’s verdict of guilty was unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence. The evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies and displays inadequacies to such an extent that it lacks probative force and, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted: See M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494.B. (per Ipp JA, Buddin J and Smart AJ agreeing)(i) The sudden rapidity with which the jury changed from being unable to reach a unanimous decision to being able to reach a unanimous decision is not suggestive of a miscarriage of justice. It is not unusual for a juror, or jurors, to experience a sudden change of mind. The mechanism of a jury to some degree depends on this phenomenon.(ii) The trial judge did not err in directing the jury that where there was a close relationship between a witness and the appellant this might be a warning for the jury to be cautious. In context, the direction was innocuous and could not have had any significant effect in the jury.The appeal against the sentence A. (per Ipp JA, Buddin J agreeing)(i) Given the conclusion that the verdict was unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence, the appeal against sentence does not need to be dealt with for two reasons. First, the appropriate sentence would have to be considered against a notional set of facts, which would be undesirable. Second, it would be inappropriate to express a view as to whether the sentence imposed by the trial judge was appropriate or too lenient.B. (per Smart AJ)(i) Due to the unusual facts, there being a single unexplained punch not necessarily intended for the deceased, it was within the sound exercise of the judge’s sentencing discretion to impose a sentence of three years imprisonment and order that the sentence be served by periodic detention with a non-parole period of two years three months.

     ANTHONY JOHN MELCHERS v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 IPP JA: On 13 August 2002, after a trial, the appellant was convicted of manslaughter. Patten DCJ sentenced him to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years three months to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    2 The appellant appeals against the conviction on three grounds. The respondent appeals against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. I turn to the appeal against conviction.  
     
      
    3 The first ground of appeal is that the verdict was unreasonable and inconsistent with the evidence. The test to be applied in such circumstances was authoritatively stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in their joint judgment in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492 to 493. Speaking of cases where what is in question is whether a verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, their Honours said (at 493): 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a Court of Criminal Appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the Court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.”  
        
       
       
      They explained further (at 494-495): 
       
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a Court of Criminal Appeal that the Court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the Court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to the lead the Court of Criminal Appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the Court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. … In doing so, the Court is not substituting trial by a Court of Appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the Court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it is open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty”. 
        
       
      
    See also MFA v The Queen (2002) 193 ALR 184 at 190. 
     
      
    4 The charge of manslaughter related to the death of Desmond Levy (the deceased). The deceased collapsed and died at a party at the Woy Woy Masonic Hall on the night of Saturday, 28 April 2001. About 200 persons were present at the party. It seems that alcohol was available free of charge to the guests and many imbibed to a considerable extent. It was a noisy and lively affair. There was music, dancing and floor shows, including a performance by a stripper. 
     
      
    5 At about 11 pm the appellant and the deceased were standing close to each other. A third person, Mr Kevin Craft, was also standing nearby. The deceased fell to the ground in circumstances that were in dispute. He suffered a subarachnoid haemorrhage, which caused him to die probably within minutes.  
     
      
    6 It was the Crown case at the trial that, immediately before the deceased fell to the ground, the appellant punched him to the head and this punch caused the deceased’s death. The appellant denied that he had punched the deceased. 
     
      
    7 Several witnesses testified as to what occurred at the party. Only one, Mr Craft, asserted that he had seen the appellant punch the deceased. 
     
      
    8 Mr Peter Leach said that he did not see what happened to make the deceased fall to the floor. He was cross-examined about a statement he had made to the police. The following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You go on at paragraph 9 to say, just to put that in context, you bumped his right side or right arm, ‘I said ‘Oh sorry mate’, and as I did Tony sort of turned to his right and looked at me. He said something like ‘You’re right mate’”. And then you say ‘As Tony turned back around to his original position, his right elbow seemed to come in contact with Des’? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well as I said, that was my presumption because I, I didn’t actually see it. As I had moved away and heard the sound, knowing that Des had been standing right next to him on that side on his right side, and having turned back that way, I presumed that he must have bumped him. That was it”. 
        
       
       
      The references to “Tony” were to the appellant and to “Des” were to the deceased.  
       
      
    9 Later, Mr Leach conceded that in his police statement he had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was no force used by Tony when he made contact with Des” 
        
       
       
      and, 
       
       
        
        “There did not appear to be any malice in the action”. 
        
       
      
    10 Mr Leach’s explanation that he had “presumed” that the appellant had bumped the deceased, but that he had not seen him do so, is difficult to accept in the light of his statements that there was no force used by the appellant when he made contact with the deceased and that there did not appear to be any malice in his action. His evidence lends some support to the proposition that the appellant did not punch the deceased but, rather, bumped or pushed him.  
     
      
    11 Ms Jacklyn Collits was a guest at the party and knew the appellant, the deceased and Mr Craft. She testified in her evidence in chief that she saw the appellant elbow the deceased on the chest. According to her this occurred when the appellant walked past the deceased. She said that the appellant elbowed the deceased with his left elbow and the deceased fell backward, Cora Craft [Mr Craft’s wife] caught him, and then, “when Cora tried to help him to get up, he fall [sic] forward, and then he slipped his foot, his right foot because the floor is wet”. She said that she was about seven to eight metres away when she observed these events.  
     
      
    12 The Crown sought and was granted leave to cross-examine Ms Collits as an unfavourable witness. It was then put to Ms Collits that the appellant punched the deceased, but she denied this.  
     
      
    13 Miss Lovely Rose Lord was also at the party. She was aged 14 years. She testified that she saw the deceased hit his head on a wall and slip on the floor. She said that the floor was wet. The Crown sought and obtained leave to cross-examine Miss Lord as an unfavourable witness. She accepted that she had told the police that the deceased had slipped and fallen and when asked if his body had struck anything she replied to the police, “[n]o he didn’t hit anything except the floor”. She said that she did not see the appellant hit the deceased.  
     
      
    14 Ms Maria Lord, the mother of Miss Lovely Lord, was also a guest at the party. She testified that she saw the deceased slip on some beer or water. She said that her attention was drawn to the deceased as he was looking at her and she thought that he wanted to dance with her. She was interested in doing so and she said, “I was looking back at him as well”. She said that she was 10 to 15 metres away when the deceased fell. 
     
      
    15 Ms Gregoria Yerro was the appellant’s girlfriend and a guest at the party. She said that she saw the deceased “sort of slipping”. He was then two feet away. She did not see what caused him to slip. 
     
      
    16 The evidence of Mrs Cora Craft should also be noted. She heard a bang, she turned around and saw the deceased in a sitting position on the floor, she took him under the arms and tried to help him. She did not see the deceased hit his head against anything and she did not see what had made him fall to the floor. She said that when she heard the bang she had been dancing with her husband.  
     
      
    17 There were other witnesses who saw the deceased fall but did not see what caused him to fall. 
     
      
    18 In summary, some of the abovementioned evidence was to the effect that the deceased had elbowed or pushed the deceased in a manner that was not hard thereby causing him to fall, and some was to the effect that the deceased had slipped and fallen. According to this testimony, the deceased’s injuries were explicable by his fall. This evidence was contrary to the Crown case that the appellant’s injuries were caused by a punch. 
     
      
    19 The Crown accepted that the elbowing or pushing described would not fall within the ambit of unlawful and dangerous acts and would not ground liability for the offence of manslaughter. 
     
      
    20 I now turn to the evidence of Mr Kevin Craft himself. Mr Craft had known the appellant for about six years prior to the death of the deceased. The appellant said that bad feeling had existed between them for some years. He told Mr Leach at the party, before the deceased was injured, that he and Mr Craft hated each other and that it was a “long-standing thing”. Mr Craft said that their relationship had cooled since 1998 but gave the impression that they remained reasonably friendly. 
     
      
    21 At a stage prior to the performance of the stripper, an argument ensued between Mr Craft and the appellant and the appellant punched Mr Craft on his face. Mr Craft did not retaliate. By then both men had had a number of beers and, according to Mr Craft, while both were affected by alcohol, neither was drunk. 
     
      
    22 About two and a half hours later, after the performance of the stripper, the incident occurred that led to the death of the deceased.  
     
      
    23 According to Mr Craft’s evidence in chief, he was then standing about a metre and a half away from the deceased, who was on his left. Mr Leach was further to the left of the deceased and the appellant was to the left of Mr Leach. Mrs Cora Craft was on Mr Craft’s right.  
     
      
    24 Mr Craft said that he saw the appellant “come across with his arm raised”. He said he could see the appellant’s fist, which was clenched. He then saw “the deceased’s head go to the side”. Later he said that he saw the deceased’s head move towards his right shoulder. The next thing he saw the deceased on the floor “and he looked purple”. He did not see the deceased actually fall. He said that he did not see the appellant’s fist connect with the deceased. At another point in his evidence in chief, Mr Craft said that he saw the appellant’s arm coming across “towards [the deceased] and me”. After he saw the deceased’s head move, the next thing he observed was the deceased on the ground with Mrs Cora Craft next to him, attempting to assist him. He said that at the time there was music and people were dancing. The strobe lights of the disco were on. 
     
      
    25 It is to be noted, at this stage, that in order to see what had occurred Mr Craft would have had to look to his left (as the deceased and the appellant were standing to his left). 
     
      
    26 Mr Craft said that, at the time, he “had considerable alcohol in me”. He had consumed about 10 to 15 middies of beer by then. He said that the appellant did not appear to him to be intoxicated. This was contrary to the evidence of the appellant and others. There was a considerable body of evidence to the effect that at this stage the appellant was very drunk. 
     
      
    27 Mr Craft, then, in the course of his evidence in chief, testified as to a conversation he had with the appellant. In March or April of 2002 Mr Craft saw the appellant at the Woy Woy Leagues Club. The appellant said that he wanted to talk to Mr Craft and they went to sit at a table together. According to Mr Craft the appellant said to him “[d]o you want to change your statement”? Mr Craft refused. 
     
      
    28 The Crown obtained leave to cross-examine Mr Craft. The Crown prosecutor put to Mr Craft that in the police statement he had said, in effect, that the appellant had hit the deceased “hard”. The prosecutor put to Mr Craft that by that statement Mr Craft was inferring that he had “seen the hit”. Mr Craft replied, “I’ve had time to think about it and it’s gone through my brain and through my brain and through my brain. All I remember is I’ve looked that way, I’ve seen Tony coming across, then I’ve seen [the deceased’s] head go and I honestly could not say that I seen the hit. I know I’ve said it [before]”. 
     
      
    29 The prosecutor then asked Mr Craft questions about a conference that had taken place about a week previously between the prosecutor and Mr Craft. The prosecutor put to Mr Craft that Mr Craft had told him that the appellant’s punch had caught the deceased on the left side of his face and the appellant’s fist was clenched. Mr Craft was asked this question: 
     
      
       
        
        “But you saw it connect”. 
        
       
       
      And he replied: 
       
       
        
        “Oh yeah definitely”. 
        
       
       
      Mr Craft acknowledged that the prosecutor had correctly recounted what he had said. When asked to explain the change in his testimony, in a long and rambling reply Mr Craft said that when he had seen the prosecutor he had “just tried to stick to what I’d said”, but after leaving the prosecutor and thinking about what had occurred he could not say that he had seen the fist connect. He said that, as he could not “picture anything as far as the hit,” he was “better off telling the truth now”. 
       
      
    30 The prosecutor later put to Mr Craft that he had said to Constable Coleman: 
     
      
       
        
        “He hit him, I saw him hit him”. 
        
       
       
      Constable Coleman replied: 
       
       
        
        “Who hit him, what did you see?” 
        
       
       
      It was put to Mr Craft that he answered this question by saying: 
       
       
        
        “Tony, Tony hit him”. 
        
       
       
      When asked whether he could remember giving these replies to Constable Coleman, Mr Craft said: 
       
       
        
        “I can and I can’t really. That’s what I was saying yesterday, I know what I think I seen but over the period of time I’m not sure, I’m really not sure”. 
        
       
       
      He then said that it was possible that he saw the fist connect. 
       
      
    31 The prosecutor pursued this line of questioning and put to Mr Craft that Constable Coleman asked him to tell her what had happened and he replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Tony hit me, he was then walking past and he bumped into Tony, Tony hit him and he fell on the floor”. 
        
       
       
      Mr Craft said he could remember telling Constable Coleman this.  
       
      
    32 I interrupt this account of Mr Craft’s testimony to note that Constable Coleman gave evidence and confirmed the various conversations between herself and Mr Craft which I have set out above and which were put by the prosecutor to Mr Craft. 
     
      
    33 Mr Craft was cross-examined by counsel then appearing for the appellant. It was put to Mr Craft that in a statement he had previously made to the police he had said that, immediately prior to the incident, when he was standing with the deceased next to him, he was looking towards the stage in the hall “watching the girls dancing”. From a plan that became an exhibit at the trial it became apparent that Mr Craft must have been looking towards his right as the stage was in that direction. As previously noted, however, the deceased and the appellant were on his left and Mr Leach was standing between the deceased and the appellant. Mr Craft would have had to look left to have seen the incident. 
     
      
    34 Mr Craft was cross-examined as to how he was able to see the deceased if he was looking at the stage. He said that he turned his head because he must have seen some movement out of the corner of his eye and it was then that he saw the appellant’s arm. He could not say that there was anything in particular that attracted his attention. He did not mention that the appellant was moving towards the deceased. 
     
      
    35 It then emerged that, in his police statement, Mr Craft had said that Mr Leach was standing about 1.5 metres away from him (to his left) and the appellant was standing about 1 to 1.5 metres to the left of Mr Leach. In other words, the appellant was between two and three metres from Mr Craft, and not 1 to 1.5 metres as Mr Craft originally testified. Mr Craft then indicated where the appellant was standing and that distance was estimated by the trial judge as being “more like four metres”. Mr Craft agreed with this. 
     
      
    36 Mr Craft accepted that from the position in which the appellant was, some four metres away from the deceased with Mr Leach, a big man, between the appellant and the deceased, to make contact with the deceased the appellant would have had to move. Mr Craft then said that he saw the appellant “coming across”.  
     
      
    37 Mr Craft accepted that his powers of observation were affected by the alcohol that he had consumed and he agreed with the proposition that “even today you can’t trust your own recollection of the events”. 
     
      
    38 Later, in his cross-examination, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. It’s troubled you for some time hasn’t it as to whether or not you saw the accused strike Mr Levy, it’s troubled you in your mind and your conscience hasn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes”. 
        
       
      
    39 Thereafter, when Mr Craft was cross-examined about his evidence that the appellant asked him to change his statement it was put to him that he did so on the basis that Mr Craft had made it clear that he was unsure as to what he had said was in fact what he had observed. Mr Craft replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “That could have been the reason”. 
        
       
      
    40 Mr Craft, from a reading of the transcript cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be regarded as a satisfactory witness. His evidence was internally inconsistent in regard to material matters. His evidence as to whether he had seen the appellant’s fist strike the deceased differed from what he had earlier told the police and subsequently the prosecutor. His memory on this important issue was plainly unreliable. His account of where the appellant was standing in relation to Mr Leach, the deceased and the appellant, and where Mr Craft was looking immediately prior to the incident, raised questions as to the likelihood of him seeing the incident at all. Mr Craft’s version that he gave to Constable Coleman was entirely different to the version he gave in Court. It will be recalled that the version he gave to the constable was that, firstly, the appellant hit him, that is, Mr Craft. The deceased then walked past and bumped into the appellant. The appellant then hit the deceased who fell to the floor. Additionally, on several occasions, Mr Craft conceded that he was uncertain as to what he had seen and he accepted that he, himself, did not trust his own recollection. 
     
      
    41 The Crown led evidence as to what the appellant had said after the party on 29 July 2002. Mr Brian Smith testified that the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was only a push, we are mates, you have to back me up”. 
        
       
       
      In a tape of an intercepted phone call that took place on 2 May 2001 between Mr Smith and the appellant, the appellant said that he could not remember whether he had hit the deceased and said that he thought that he had pushed him. In a later conversation between the two, Mr Smith told the appellant that the police had said that the deceased had died from a severe hit to the head. The appellant’s response was: 
       
       
        
        “Fair dinkum”.  
        
       
       
      Mr Smith later asked the appellant whether he had hit the deceased. The appellant replied: 
       
       
        
        “I must of. No, unless he hit the ground”. 
        
       
       
      When Mr Smith later said to the appellant that he must have “given him a decent hit”, the appellant replied: 
       
       
        
        “Dunno. Not sure”. 
        
       
      
    42 On 29 April 2001 (the evening after the incident), Detectives Nugent and Hill asked the appellant some questions about the incident. Detective Hill said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Anthony mate you assaulted someone at the Masonic Club last night”. 
        
       
       
      The appellant said: 
       
       
        
        “Yeah, I remember that, Kevin [Craft], it’s a thing that goes back years”. 
        
       
       
      Detective Nugent said: 
       
       
        
        “Mate, I’ve also been told you assaulted another fellow there”. 
        
       
       
      The appellant said: 
       
       
        
        “Oh, did I?” 
        
       
       
      Detective Nugent said: 
       
       
        
        “Yeah, a bloke called Desmond Levy”. 
        
       
       
      When Detective Nugent told the appellant that the deceased had died and asked whether he, the appellant, knew anything about that, the appellant replied the negative. Detective Nugent said: 
       
       
        
        “Mate, I’ve been told you punched Des”. 
        
       
       
      The appellant said: 
       
       
        
        “I pushed him because he was harassing my wife”. 
        
       
       
      Detective Nugent said: 
       
       
        
        “Harassing Jeannie was he?” 
        
       
       
      The appellant answered: 
       
       
        
        “Yes”. 
        
       
      
    43 In a video taped interview the appellant was asked if he had punched Mr Craft and he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I may have done so”. 
        
       
       
      Later he said: 
       
       
        
        “It’s all pretty vague to me to be honest”. 
        
       
       
      He was asked if he remembered pushing the deceased and he replied: 
       
       
        
        “Not really, no”. 
        
       
       
      He was asked if he recalled punching the deceased and he said that he “did not recall doing that”. 
       
      
    44 When seen in context, the statements made by the appellant during these conversations are equivocal and do not add materially to the strength of the Crown case. 
     
      
    45 The Crown also relied on the evidence of Dr Oettle, an experienced forensic pathologist who had examined the deceased. Dr Oettle found a bruise measuring about 40 mm by 30 mm behind the attachment of the left ear. He said that the bruising was consistent with the use of a fist. The bruise had been caused by a blow delivered with a “quite marked” degree of force. Dr Oettle, in chief, expressed the opinion that the bruise could not have been caused by the deceased hitting his head on a flat surface such as a wooden floor. He was of the opinion that the deceased died from a subarachnoid haemorrhage resulting from a blow to the head. A subarachnoid haemorrhage is “a bleeding over the surface of the brain”. He did not look for the source of bleeding. 
     
      
    46 In cross-examination, Dr Oettle recognised that it was possible that the subarachnoid haemorrhage was caused by a “fall over backwards” and, indeed, by a wide range of “seemingly innocuous activities”. He said that his view of the mechanism of death (a blow to the head where the bruise was found) was “a reasonable probability”.  
     
      
    47 Dr Du Flou gave expert evidence on behalf of the appellant. Dr Du Flou was the acting clinical director of the Department of Forensic Medicine. He agreed that the cause of death was a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but said that such a haemorrhage could have a number of causes. These included a blow to the side of the head or neck, bleeding from a vertebral artery (such as from a berry aneurism) or from an impact resulting from the deceased’s fall to the ground. According to Dr Du Flou the bruising to the deceased’s head could have been caused by the deceased hitting his head in the course of his fall.  
     
      
    48 Dr Du Flou testified that the failure to determine the site of the bleeding meant that it could not be said with any reliability that death was due to a basal subarachnoid haemorrhage due to trauma. He said that such a conclusion could not be arrived at without seeing the injury to the blood vessel. Without this material one could only make a “supposition, possibly an educated guess”. 
     
      
    49 The dispute between Dr Oettle and Dr Du Flou was an important part of the trial. In the course of their deliberations, the jury requested the transcript of the evidence of Dr Oettle. It is apparent from their decision that they preferred Dr Oettle’s evidence to that of Dr Du Flou. It is difficult to determine the basis for this preference. It is true that Dr Oettle examined the body of the deceased while Dr Du Flou did not. This, however, should not have played a significant part in the decision as the fact that Dr Du Flou had not seen the body did not mean that he was not qualified and able to express a sound opinion on the issue. On a reading of the testimony of the two pathologists involved, there is little, if anything, that could be said to lead to a conclusion that the opinion of one is more cogent or more persuasive than that of the other.  
     
      
    50 There was some evidence led by the Crown to the effect that Mr Craft might have been jealous of the deceased, because earlier on the evening of the party the deceased had been dancing with his wife. This evidence was not particularly strong and did not impress the trial judge. He said, in the course of his sentencing remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        “The motive for the prisoner’s sudden assault upon the deceased remains unexplained. Indeed, the blow may have been intended for someone else. His evidence was to the effect that he could not remember what occurred. Possibly the prisoner in his alcoholic state magnified out of all proportion a sense of grievance arising from the fact that earlier in the evening the deceased made a wholly innocent approach towards his girlfriend which she properly treated as a joke and conveyed to the prisoner”. 
        
       
      
    51 The appellant testified that due to the extent of alcohol that he had consumed he could not remember what had happened. He could not remember any argument with the deceased, he did not recall pushing the deceased and, as I have mentioned, denied that he had punched the deceased. 
     
      
    52 In essence, the jury were faced with the evidence of Mr Craft seen against the testimony of the other eye-witnesses, the evidence of what the appellant said after the incident, and the conflicting expert evidence.  
     
      
    53 One argument, advanced by the Crown, is that the view of Dr Oettle could be regarded as the foundation of the jury’s decision. On this basis, once the jury had decided that they preferred the evidence of Dr Oettle to that of Dr Du Flou, they would inevitably accept that the deceased died as a result of a blow to the head. The only explanation for such a blow was that given in the course of Mr Craft’s evidence, namely, that the appellant aimed a punch at the deceased and thereafter the deceased fell to the ground and died. 
     
      
    54 There are, however, major difficulties with this argument. Firstly, Dr Oettle’s opinion was expressed in terms of the bruise he found being “consistent with” a blow to the head. He did not in terms say that the bruise had been caused by a blow to the head. Secondly, Dr Oettle said that the cause of death which he propounded was a “probability”. He was not prepared to attach a greater degree of certainty than that. Thirdly, he recognised the possibility that the subarachnoid haemorrhage was caused by another mechanism, including a backwards fall. Fourthly, as senior counsel for the respondent accepted, the substantial reason for the jury’s preference for Dr Oettle must lie in reasons of demeanour. Particularly when it comes to expert evidence, when there is little otherwise to chose between the probative force of the conflicting views expressed, demeanour can be a dangerous basis for deciding which opinion is correct. 
     
      
    55 Accordingly, I do not accept that the jury’s preference for Dr Oettle can anchor the Crown case in the way suggested. Undoubtedly, the jury’s preference for Dr Oettle must be given significant weight, but without reasonably reliable evidence which established that the appellant punched the deceased, Dr Oettle’s evidence cannot carry the day. 
     
      
    56 Accordingly, the lynch pin of the Crown case was the testimony of Mr Craft. As I have mentioned, he was the only witness who asserted that the appellant had punched the deceased. Without his testimony, the Crown could not establish its case.  
     
      
    57 But, as I have said, Mr Craft’s evidence was quite unsatisfactory. I have referred to the matters that indicate it to be materially unreliable. Even without the evidence of the other eye-witnesses, there would have to be grave doubts, on his testimony, as to whether the appellant punched the deceased. In my opinion, a reasonable jury could not have relied on Mr Craft’s testimony to establish the appellant’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    58 To paraphrase the joint judgment in M v The Queen at 494, the record itself contains discrepancies and displays inadequacies to such an extent that it lacks probative force such as to lead me to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted. 
     
      
    59 Although it is strictly speaking unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal and the appeal against sentence I shall, briefly, refer to them. 
     
      
    60 The second ground of appeal on which the appellant relied was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The circumstances under which the jury returned a verdict of guilty indicate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  
        
       
      
    61 The jury retired to consider its verdict on Friday 9 August 2002 at 2.40 pm. The jury separated at about 3.54 pm and recommenced deliberations on Monday 12 August 2002. At about 12.35 pm the jury sent the judge a note which read: 
     
      
       
        
        “We are unable to come to a unanimous decision.” 
        
       
       
      Patten DCJ then gave the jury a direction in accordance with  
      Black v The 
        
      Queen 
       (1993) 179 CLR 44 (at 50 to 52). At 12.40 pm the jury returned to further consider their verdict. At about 3.40 pm the jury sent the judge another note which read: 
       
       
        
        “We’re are unable to make a unanimous decision”. 
        
       
       
      Patten DCJ remarked: 
       
       
        
        “Subject to me questioning them about that I think they have probably deliberated long enough and I ought to discharge them”. 
        
       
       
      Neither counsel objected. The jury returned to Court at 3.40 pm. His Honour asked the foreman if more time would enable the jury to resolve the situation. The foreman said that it might. The judge decided not to discharge the jury and permitted them to separate. On Tuesday 13 August 2002 the jury retired to consider its verdict further. Their deliberations endured virtually the whole day until shortly before 4 pm when the jury sent Patten DCJ a note stating that they were unable to come to unanimous decision. The judge observed: 
       
       
        
        “Subject to what the foreman said I think they should be discharged”. 
        
       
       
      Both counsel agreed. Before the jury could be brought in, the foreman sent the judge a further note. This read: 
       
       
        
        “We the jury have come to unanimous [sic].” 
        
       
       
      The note had the time 4.05 pm written on it. At 4.08 pm the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 
       
      
    62 Mr Stratton, who appeared for the appellant, accepted that Patten DCJ had made no error in his directions to, and treatment of, the jury. He did not submit that the jury had not been free to deliberate without pressure being placed upon them. He submitted merely that the sudden rapidity with which the jury changed their minds is suggestive of a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    63 I do not accept the submissions advanced on the appellant’s behalf in regard to the second ground of appeal. It is not unusual for a juror (or jurors) to experience a sudden change of mind. The mechanism of a jury to some degree depends on this phenomenon. I see nothing sinister in what occurred. 
     
      
    64 The third ground of appeal was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that where there was a close relationship between a witness and the appellant ‘it might sound a warning bell, a warning that you should be cautious’”. 
        
       
      
    65 It was argued on the appellant’s behalf that this direction could have an unfairness to the appellant as it tended to detract from the weight of the evidence, particularly of his girlfriend Ms Yerro. I am not persuaded by this submission. As I have mentioned Ms Yerro did not see what caused the deceased to slip. She did testify that the appellant was severely intoxicated at the time of the incident involving the deceased, but I do not think that that evidence was of significant moment. There was ample evidence to the same effect. In context, the direction was innocuous and I do not think that it could have had any significant effect on the jury. 
     
      
    66 For two reasons I do not propose to deal with the appeal against sentence. Firstly, in view of the conclusion to which I have come as regards the verdict, the appropriate sentence would have to be considered against what I would regard as a notional set of facts, and I think that is undesirable. Secondly, having concluded that a verdict of acquittal should be entered, I think it inappropriate to express a view as to whether the sentence imposed by the trial judge was appropriate or too lenient.  
     
      
    67 For the reasons I have expressed in regard to the first ground of appeal, I would uphold the appeal, set aside the verdict of the jury and in lieu thereof order that the conviction be quashed and a verdict of acquittal be entered. 
     
      
    68 BUDDIN J: I agree with Ipp JA. 
     
      
    69 SMART AJ: The facts and the issues are set out in the judgment of Ipp JA. It is clear from the matters referred to in his judgment that it was not reasonably open for a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt based on the evidence of Mr K Craft alone. The primary question which arises is whether there was any supporting evidence which, when taken with the evidence of Mr Craft, was sufficient to enable a jury, acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt of the manslaughter of Desmond Levy (the deceased). That leads on to the ultimate question whether on the whole of the evidence it was reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt. 
     
      
    70 In the context of the primary question the evidence of the very experienced forensic pathologist, Dr T H G Oettle requires detailed consideration. He carried out the post mortem examination. It was his opinion that the cause of death was a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage resulting from a head injury caused by a blow to the head. Dr Duflou, a forensic pathologist thought that the cause of death was a subarachnoid haemorrhage but that it was not possible to go further and say definitely that it was caused by trauma.71 The initial post mortem examination was carried out on 29 April 2001 commencing at 11am, about 12 hours after the death of the deceased. Two days later Dr Oettle carried out a further post mortem examination. He found there was an area of recent bruising measuring 40mm wide by 30mm with the front limit of the bruise about 40mm behind the attachment of the left ear, that is the bruise was at the base of the skull and at the top of the neck at the back on the left side. The top of the bruise was level with the hole in the middle of the ear. It was just underneath the curvature of the skull. There was bruising in the superficial tissues and bruising in the muscle underlying that area. The bruising was recent. Dr Oettle thought that from the external appearances blunt force was applied and noted that it was sufficient force to cause a bruise in muscle underlying the skin. Blunt force does not leave a detailed injury on the skin such as comes from a spanner or a hammer or a corner of a table. There is a generalised area of bruising. The depth of the bruising into the muscle was deep, about 2½ to 3cms from the surface of the skin. The bruise was consistent with the use of a fist.72 Dr Oettle said that the degree of force necessary to cause such bruising would be quite marked. He estimated that the bruising would have been caused within about 24 hours of death. He did not think that the bruising could have been caused by the deceased hitting his head on a flat surface such as a wooden floor because of the shape of the head and the shoulders behind. The bruise was in the curve from the back of the head to the shoulders.73 Dr Oettle said that on 29 April 2001 he observed a recent subarachnoid haemorrhage rising up from the base of the brain. This was extensive and coming up on both sides and in the front of the brain. He did not see the artery which ruptured but the results of the cascading blood. Dr Oettle did not find the source of the bleeding nor did he look for the vessel which ruptured. It was not possible to see the vessels because they were smothered in blood. The vessels lie under the arachnoid membrane so the whole of the base of the brain was covered with blood. The brain was put into formalin and fixed and sent to the Neuropathology Department of Sydney University. The doctors in that Department would look for a tear in any vessel.74 Dr Oettle said that a sudden and unexpected movement of the head causes one of the arteries to close. This stops the blood flowing through that artery. This created a shock wave which moved and ruptured a vessel. The degree of force generated causes a sudden backward movement of the head. The doctor thought that there was a correlation between the bruising and the traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. There was no way the bruising could have been caused by the post mortem examination. The doctor gave detailed reasons for this conclusion. He said that no alcohol was found in the blood of the deceased. This meant that if the deceased had had any alcoholic liquor he had metabolised it all by the time he died.75 At the conclusion of his evidence in chief Dr Oettle affirmed that the cause of death was the traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage and that the trauma associated with that was a blow to the head.76 On the evidence of Mr Craft and the evidence in chief of Dr Oettle the jury would reasonably have been able to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty as charged.77 However, the appellant placed considerable reliance on the evidence elicited in cross-examination. Dr Oettle agreed that his preferred finding was that death was caused by a blow to the head or neck resulting in the rotation of the head. Dr Oettle agreed that another possible cause was vertebral artery dissection with basal subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by another mechanism, including a fall over backwards. Dr Oettle agreed that a subarachnoid haemorrhage had been known to happen in chiropractic manipulation, childbirth, turning the head suddenly, callisthenics, painting a ceiling and a large range of seemingly innocuous activities. He further agreed that in a percentage of these cases no definite predisposing factor has ever been determined.78 Dr Oettle agreed that in some instances with this cause of death a tear of a blood vessel at the base of the brain had occurred, most commonly the inter-cranial segment of one of the vertebral arteries, in other cases there have been injuries involving the extra-cranial segments of the vertebral or carotid arteries. There was no examination of the extra-cranial segments of the vertebral arteries of the deceased. Dr Oettle did not regard such an examination as necessary as there was no injury to the neck other than at the base of the skull. So, he thought that the injury to the extra-cranial vertebral arteries and to the carotid arteries is a possibility that has happened in other circumstances, but it was not a possibility which applied in the circumstances of the present case. He was not aware whether there was a partial tear of the vessel nor whether there was any pre-existing disease of the vessel wall. He rejected the proposition that without further tests involving the extra-cranial segments of the arteries and the wall of the blood vessel the mechanism of death which he advanced could not be elevated above the level of a possibility79 Dr Oettle insisted that the cause of death specified by him was a reasonable probability. He said that if you do not find an aneurism which has burst an artery the source of the escaping blood must be the result of a laceration or a defect in them, a tear.80 Dr Oettle said that there was no evidence of an extra-cranial rupture and no injury to the neck other than high at its junction with the base of the skull. If there had been an extra-cranial rupture there would have been some evidence of it for a certain length of the vertebral arteries.81 Dr Oettle agreed that a natural disease process can lead to rupture of a blood vessel over the base of the brain and a subarachnoid haemorrhage. This can happen with a range of diseases and in some instances death will result. It manifests itself as a defect in the wall of the blood vessel with localised expansion of the vessel lumen, that is the inside diameter of the vessel. Any activity which raises blood pressure, including strain and stress, can increase the chance of rupture.82 Dr Oettle said that while he was aware that people all over the world have said that aneurisms may be so small that they have been destroyed in the process of bleeding, he found it difficult to believe. He did not accept the proposition that if no site of bleeding was identified this subarachnoid haemorrhage may have been due to the rupture of an unidentified aneurism. He said that the aneurisms he had seen had been very easily identified. He had not come across an unidentifiable aneurism in over 40 years experience.83 Dr Oettle agreed that each of the mechanisms of, firstly, a blow to the head or neck resulting in the sudden rotation of the head, secondly, vertebral artery dissection with basal subarachnoid haemorrhage and, thirdly, a subarachnoid haemorrhage due to rupture of a blood vessel over the base of the brain as a result of a natural disease process, could provide extensive bleeding over the undersurface of the brain.84 Dr Oettle said that he did not know whether there had been a rupture of the vertebral artery. The artery ruptured might have been one of the little arteries that branch off immediately after the vertebral artery fuses to form the basilar artery. There were a variety of areas where it might have occurred, but he thought it would be the intra-cranial segment of either one of the vertebral arteries or one of the other arteries.85 Dr Oettle rejected the proposition that he should have ascertained if there was a prior dissection of the blood vessel extra-cranially in the neck. His reason for that rejection was that there was no injury around the neck. If there had been a pre-existing disease of the wall of the blood vessel he would have expected that to have shown up in other vessels, more particularly in the intra-cranial portion where the majority of lacerations occur.86 Dr Oettle said that the source of the bleeding was inside the skull, not outside rising up. The majority of the blood was in the subarachnoid space and the vertebral arteries in the cervical spine are well outside the arachnoid. A minimal amount had gone down into the spinal canal. Dr Oettle said that he was not aware of the site of the rupture being located, but added that in the majority of traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhages the site of the rupture is not determined. If it is, that is a bonus.87 Dr Oettle thought that it was estimated that in ten per cent of post mortem cases or more where the cause of death was thought to be as a result of a catastrophic rupture leading to a subarachnoid haemorrhage the presumed aneurism may never be found. However, he did not accept the suggestion in the present case that a possible cause of death was an unidentified aneurism. He remarked, “I am not quite sure why it wasn’t identified if it was an aneurism and it was there”88 Dr Oettle said that a berry aneurism is relatively rare. It can occur when a trivial amount of force is applied to a condition such as blood pressure.89 It was suggested to Dr Oettle that various other tests and examinations could be, and should have been, carried out to eliminate possibilities other than the cause of death which he suggested. He disagreed.90 Counsel for the appellant put to Dr Oettle a number of possible ways in which the bruising at the back of the skull not far from the left ear might have occurred apart from the application of blunt force by a fist or similar method, but Dr Oettle rejected these suggestions. He also rejected as a possibility that the bruising located may not relate to the cause of death at all.91 Dr Oettle said that the location of the bruising meant that because the head is eccentrically held, the head was able to be swung and moved. Dr Oettle said that he had seen similar haemorrhages with each of a slap on the face, a punch to the face, a punch to the back of the head, and a punch to the side of the neck near the ear. He added, “the mechanism seems to be that the head rotates unexpectedly and you get a sudden closure.”92 In re-examination Dr Oettle stated that the vessels outside the skull could not be a source of the bleeding because if they are outside the arachnoid they will not bleed into the arachnoid, they bleed outside it. If the tear had been outside the skull, there would have been evidence of bleeding outside the skull and there was no evidence of bleeding outside the skull other than in the bruised area.93 I have summarised the evidence of Dr Oettle at length because of its importance. Further, because of the manner of expression and the complexity of the matters covered it is not easy to follow. When the jury retired they sought a copy of the transcript of his evidence.94 When Dr Oettle’s evidence is analysed it seems to support the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) Blunt force of sufficient strength was used to cause recent bruising at the base of the skull on the lefthand side in the superficial tissues and deep into the underlying muscle 
       
       
      (b) that bruising relates to the cause of death. It is not possible that it does not relate to the cause of death 
       
       
      (c) it was a reasonable probability that the mechanism of death was a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage 
       
       
      (d) other possibilities or scenarios which may apply in other circumstances could safely be rejected in the present case. That included a fall over backwards. There were no other realistic possibilities 
       
       
      (e) With a sudden unexpected punch the head rotates unexpectedly and there is a sudden closure of the artery leading to the haemorrhage 
       
       
      (f) the present case has the hallmark of a sudden rupture of a small vessel at the time of the injury occurring and it follows the pattern of every other traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. 
      
    95 Having dismissed the other possibilities as unrealistic there remains the reasonably probable cause of death of traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage and no other. The trauma involved was the application of blunt force to which the bruise on the left hand rear of the skull at its base is testimony. A punch is capable of inflicting the blunt force. The evidence of Mr K Craft is that the appellant threw a punch. That connected with the deceased.96 The evidence of Dr Oettle was in part supported by Dr R S Pamphlett to whom the brain of the deceased was sent. Dr Pamphlett holds the postgraduate degree of Doctor of Medicine and Fellowships of the Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. He is a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney and a senior academic consultant at Prince Alfred Hospital. He specialised in neuropathology and neurology. For the previous 15 years he had been engaged in the examination of brains that had been forwarded to him. On 19 June 2001 he conducted an examination of the brain identified as that of the deceased.97 On examination of the brain there was a large amount of haemorrhage over the external surfaces of the brain in what has been called the subarachnoid space. This was over the sides of the brain, especially the left section, and underneath the brain.98 Dr Pamphlett said that the most common cause of subarachnoid haemorrhage is due to trauma. Where there has not been trauma the most common cause is a ruptured aneurism or blow out on the vessels at the bottom of the brain. Aneurisms virtually only occur there.99 Dr Pamphlett explained that the arteries had been extracted from the brain and carefully examined. No aneurisms could be identified. All aneurisms can be seen with the naked eye. Aneurisms are usually above one centimetre when they rupture. They can rupture when they are smaller, but that is fairly uncommon. There was no evidence of an aneurism.100 Dr Pamphlett said that he and his assistants did not locate the source of the bleeding. There was no evidence of vascular disease in any of the areas that they looked at.101 In cross-examination Dr Pamphlett said that it was possible for a ruptured aneurism to blow away the rest of the aneurism. This would leave a reasonably sized hole about the point of explosion and you would usually see that.102 Dr Pamphlett stated that Greenfield Neuropathology, a textbook, mentions that the cause of 10 to 15 per cent of spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhages is not found and that it postulates that a small aneurism has burst. It Is only a postulate because the aneurism is not found. Dr Pamphlett said that that could happen on a small blood vessel on one of the branches of the vertebral artery, that is deep within the clot. The vessels have to be pulled out of the clot and it is possible that a small aneurism could be missed there. Dr Pamphlett said that such an aneurism, if it ruptured, would theoretically be capable of causing death.103 On the Crown case, a jury acting reasonably was entitled to find the guilt of the appellant had been established beyond reasonable doubt. They would have been entitled to rely on the 40 years of experience of Dr Oettle and the reasons he gave for rejecting the other possibilities.104 It is necessary to turn to the evidence of Dr J Duflou, forensic pathologist. He has been a medical practitioner since 1982. He holds the postgraduate degree of Master of Medicine in forensic pathology and is a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. He was a specialist forensic pathologist, He was the Acting Clinical Director of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Glebe and Clinical Senior Lecturer in the Department of Pathology at Sydney University. He commenced employment with the Division of Forensic Medicine in 1988 and worked with Dr Oettle as the Acting Director until 1993. Dr Duflou became the Deputy Director during that time.105 Dr Duflou said that the cause of death was bleeding over the surface of the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage). Dr Duflou detailed a number of mechanisms which could cause this. First, there was a traumatic basal subarachnoid haemorrhage due, for instance, to a blow to the side of the head or neck. In this there is a tearing of a blood vessel at the base of the brain or within the neck structures itself causing a collection of blood at the base of the brain and this causes death. Secondly, there are circumstances, on occasion, where following a fall over backwards a person can sustain injury to his neck structures. Thirdly, there is a range of natural disease processes where a person has a weakness in the blood vessel in the brain and it bursts. He instanced a berry aneurism.106 Dr Duflou said that the difficulty with Dr Oettle’s examination and report was that there had not been a detailed examination of the blood vessels and the bony structures within the neck. The vertebral arteries can be damaged and can tear and this can cause bleeding. He added that scientific papers tend to indicate that it is now more commonly thought that vertebral artery trauma occurs in the neck structure rather than within the head itself.107 Dr Duflou stated that it was very important to try and identify the site of the bleeding. He detailed a series of steps and procedures which he believed should be taken after the brain is removed from the skull. Failure to do so might result in a failure to discover the cause of the haemorrhage. Not only could a natural disease process be identified which may have caused the death but it cannot be said that death was due to a traumatic basal subarachnoid haemorrhage if the injury to the blood vessel cannot be seen. It cannot be elevated above a possibility.108 As to the bruising Dr Duflou thought that the first possibility was that the deceased was struck a blow to the part of the head where the bruising was located The second possibility was that if there has been bleeding from a vertebral artery, especially within the neck, there can be blood oozing out into the soft tissues and into the muscles of the neck. The vertebral artery is a blood vessel under quite significant pressure and, if there is damage to that blood vessel, blood can push into the surrounding tissues and manifest as a bruise. Thirdly, the bruise may have happened as the deceased fell to the ground. A bruise need not necessarily happen at the exact site of the impact, 
     
      
    109 The fourth possibility was rough handling during the attempted resuscitation. The fifth possibility was that the bruise was caused during the post mortem examination. 
     
      
    110 Dr Duflou was referred to the evidence of Ms Lord that the deceased stepped on a wet patch on the floor and struck his head against a wall. Dr Duflou believed that would be capable of causing the bruising, depending on exactly how it happened. An examination of bruising can indicate the severity of a blow, but not necessarily. The amount of bruising is not a good indication of the amount of force used. 
     
      
    111 Dr Duflou stated that one of the features that is not uncommon in a traumatic basal subarachnoid haemorrhage is a small break in the first or second vertebral body. There was no examination of the spine to ascertain if there was such a break. 
     
      
    112 According to Dr Duflou, in known non-traumatic incidents where there has been no violence, and a person has sustained a subarachnoid haemorrhage, no abnormality will be found in the blood vessels in 10 to 20 per cent of cases. He thought that unless the pathologist can establish the site of the bleeding, a mechanism cannot be attributed to that bleeding. Dr Duflou stated that there are many reasons why a person can have bleeding within the spinal column and within the vertebral arteries. If the spinal column is not examined in this type of case a firm view as to why the person has died cannot be formed. 
     
      
    113 Dr Duflou stated that in the majority of cases where a person has died of a berry aneurism and the brain is examined properly, the berry aneurism will be found and a rupture in that aneurism (typically the top blows off) will be identified. In between 10 and 20 per cent of cases the aneurism is never found. 
     
      
    114 Dr Duflou commented that punches to faces and necks are common. The number of cases of vertebral artery tears is very small. There are possibly one or two per year in this State resulting in death. The amount of force required to cause such a tear is not great. The chances of a punch causing a vertebral artery tear are very low. 
     
      
    115 In cross-examination Dr Duflou stated that it is known that when a person is stressed he is more likely to rupture an aneurism than otherwise. An altercation could cause stress. Dr Duflou agreed that it would be a coincidence if a berry aneurism causing death occurred at the very time the deceased was said to have been struck with a blow, but it would not be unheard of. This assumes that there was a blow. An aneurism would be less likely if the blow came unexpectedly to the back of the head. Although Dr Oettle looked for and did not find another natural cause, Dr Duflou still viewed it as a reasonable possibility when the site of the bleeding had not been located. Dr Duflou agreed that the bruise was consistent with a blow to the back of the head. 
     
      
    116 Dr Duflou agreed that in relation to what was found he was somewhat at a disadvantage as he did not conduct the post mortem examination and that Dr Oettle was in the best position to make an assessment of the internal examination. 
     
      
    117 Dr Duflou did not accept that the amount of bruising was a good indication of the amount of force applied. It could have been caused by a rotation of the head with a twisting motion with the tearing of the muscle or tissue. Another option was contact with the floor. 
     
      
    118 Dr Duflou said that if the source of the bleeding was outside the skull, the blood inside the skull must have come up into the skull from a rupture down in the neck somewhere. As it was a very extensive subarachnoid haemorrhage this would mean that a significant amount of blood came up from the neck and into the base of the brain. 
     
      
    119 Dr Duflou accepted that Dr Oettle looked at the neck. Dr Duflou did not accept that there was no evidence of haemorrhage in that area. He maintained that arguably there was because the photograph of the back of the neck shows bleeding into the structures there, that is the bruise. That is not a convincing argument. 
     
      
    120 Dr Duflou agreed in general terms with Dr Pamphlett that aneurisms occur in a very restricted area of the brain, that is, at the base of the brain. 
     
      
    121 Despite Dr Pamphlett taking out all the arteries at the base of the brain, examining them all and finding no aneurisms in the area where they occur, Dr Duflou maintained that an aneurism was a reasonable possibility. He thought that a natural disease process of those blood vessels was a reasonable possibility. 
     
      
    122 The jury would have been entitled to proceed as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) It was accepted by the three doctors that the deceased had died of a basal subarachnoid haemorrhage. The issue was whether it was traumatic. 
      
     
     
      
      (b) The most common cause of subarachnoid haemorrhage is due to trauma 
      
     
     
      
      (c) Where there has not been trauma the most common cause is a ruptured aneurism. Aneurisms virtually only occur at the bottom of the brain. All aneurisms can be seen with the naked eye. The arteries were extracted from the brain and carefully examined. There was no evidence of an aneurism in the present case. It has been postulated that the cause of 10 to 15 or 20 per cent of spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhages is not found. It is only a postulate because the aneurism is not found. It is possible that a small aneurism on one of the branches of the vertebral artery may be missed. Theoretically such an aneurism, if ruptured, was capable of causing death. The implication was that this was most unlikely. Dr Duflou accepted that if a blow to the back of the head was unexpected stress and a consequent aneurism would be less likely. 
      
     
     
      
      (d) In the light of the evidence of Drs Oettle and Pamphlett there was no reasonable possibility of an unidentified aneurism causing death in the circumstances of the present case. 
      
     
     
      
      (e) It did not accept the evidence that the deceased had been elbowed or pushed and that caused him to fall, nor the evidence to the effect that the deceased has slipped and fallen. 
      
     
     
      
      (f) There was no realistic possibility that the bruise at the base of the deceased’s skull was caused by his hitting his head on the wall or the floor. 
      
     
     
      
      (g) There was no realistic possibility of the deceased sustaining the bruise during the resuscitation attempts or during the post mortem examination. 
      
     
     
      
      (h) Blunt force of sufficient strength was used to cause recent bruising in the superficial tissues and deep into the underlying muscle and that bruising relates to the cause of death, 
      
     (i) It accepted these opinions of Dr Oettle that: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) it was not necessary to locate the site of the bleeding; indeed in the majority of traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhages the site of the rupture is not determined. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (ii) it was not necessary to make a detailed examination of the blood vessels and the bony structures within the neck as there was no injury to the neck other than at the base of the skull. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (iii) If there has been a pre-existing disease of the wall of the blood vessel it could be expected to have shown up in other vessels especially in the intra-cranial area. There was no evidence of a pre-existing disease 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (iv) the source of the bleeding was inside the skull, not outside, rising up. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (j) Dr Duflou was at a disadvantage not having conducted the post mortem examination and Dr Oettle was in the best position to make an assessment of the internal examination. 
      
     
     
      
      (k) it accepted that there was a reasonable probability that the mechanism of death was a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage. There were no other realistic possibilities. 
      
     
     
      
      (l) the present case has the hallmark of a sudden rupture of a small vessel at the time of the injury occurring and follows the pattern of every other traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage . 
      
     
     
      
      (m) When the accepted medical evidence was taken with other acceptable evidence, the Crown had proved its case. 
       
      
    123 It was for the jury to consider all the medical evidence and decide upon the medical evidence which it accepted. Assessment by a jury of competing medical evidence is an exacting task but one which is frequently undertaken. This was a case in which the jury had to consider whether the “possibilities” advanced by the appellant were realistic possibilities, or, in the circumstances of this case, possibilities which could not be classed as reasonable. In such a situation the jury may well have relied on the deep well of experience from which Dr Oettle could draw and the assessments he made from conducting the post mortem examinations. At the trial the Crown relied heavily on Dr Oettle’s evidence. The jury was entitled to take the view that the evidence of Dr Duflou did not cause it to have a reasonable doubt. They may have thought that the various alternative possibilities he raised were unrealistic in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    124 It was reasonably open to the jury to accept the medical evidence relied upon by the Crown and in conjunction with the other acceptable evidence, especially those parts of the evidence of Mr K Craft which it accepted, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. 
     
      
    125 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    126 I agree with what Ipp JA has written on the second and third grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    127 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    128 I turn to the Crown appeal against sentence. This must be determined on the basis of the facts found by the trial judge. The Crown stressed the denunciatory role of sentencing, the high value which is rightly placed upon human life and the gravity of the crime of manslaughter. The Crown acknowledged that manslaughter covers a wide variety of penal consequences. The Crown did not suggest that the judge had made any identifiable error of law or fact. The Crown case was that the sentence was so inadequate that it bespoke error. The Crown submitted that a sentence falling short of fulltime custody failed to provide specific and general deterrence, failed to express the community’s denunciation of such conduct and failed to recognize the seriousness of unlawfully taking human life. The judge gave weight to these factors. 
     
      
    129 The facts of the case were unusual. There was a single punch, the reason for which is unexplained. It may not have been intended for the deceased. A sentence of three years imprisonment was well within the sound exercise of the judge’s sentencing discretion. Similarly it was within that discretion to order that the sentence be served by periodic detention with a non-parole period of two years three months. The reasons given by the judge for the sentence imposed evince no error. They were sound. 
     
      
    130 The Crown appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

     REGINA v DOMINIC JOSEPH GALATI 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Dominic Joseph Galati has applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 29 August 2002 by his Honour Acting Judge Shillington.  
     
      
    2 His Honour sentenced the applicant for four offences, namely (1) supplying a prohibited drug methylamphetamine on 16 October 2001, the quantity of the drug being 22.75 grams (2) supplying a prohibited drug 3.4 methylenedioxy methylamphetamine on 16 October 2001, the quantity of the drug being 19.04 grams (3) supplying a prohibited drug methylamphetamine on 17 January 2002, the quantity of the drug being 36.88 grams (4) supplying a prohibited drug methylamphetamine on 17 January 2002, the quantity of the drug being one gram. 
     
      
    3 In sentencing the applicant for the first offence the sentencing judge took into account thirteen other offences consisting mainly of offences of possession of prohibited drugs or possession of a prohibited weapons, such as a knuckle-duster or handcuffs. 
     
      
    4 For each of the first two offences his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 18 January 2002, the sentences to be served concurrently. For the third offence his Honour imposed a sentence of three years, with a non-parole period of one year commencing on 18 January 2003. For the fourth offence his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 18 January 2003. The sentences imposed amounted overall to sentences totalling four years, with a non-parole period or fixed terms of imprisonment totalling two years. All the offences were offences under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for fifteen years and/or a fine of $220,000.  
     
      
    5 In order properly to understand the grounds of appeal relied on, it is appropriate to set out a short chronology of events. On 16 October 2001, after police surveillance of premises occupied by the applicant at Manly, a search warrant was obtained and executed. The drugs the subject of the first two offences and the drugs and items which were the subject of many of the offences taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the first offence were found during the execution of the search warrant. 
     
      
    6 On the same day the applicant was arrested and bail was refused. However, on 6 December 2001 the applicant was granted bail and on 11 December 2001 the applicant was released on bail. He had been in custody one month and twenty six days.  
     
      
    7 On 17 January 2002 another search warrant was executed at the same premises. The drugs the subject of the third offence were found during the execution of this search warrant, as was a ring which a purchaser had used to pay for the actual supply of a prohibited drug which was the subject of the fourth offence. Other items were seized which were the subject of some of the offences taken into account in sentencing the applicant for the first offence. It will be apparent that the third and fourth offences were committed while the applicant was on bail for the first two offences. The applicant was arrested on 17 January 2002 and he remained in custody until he was sentenced by Acting Judge Shillington on 29 August 2002. 
     
      
    8 On 9 April 2002 the applicant entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court and he was committed for sentence. On 29 August 2002, because there was some defect in the committal documents, the applicant was formally arraigned before Acting Judge Shillington and when arraigned he entered pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    9 In his remarks on sentence Acting Judge Shillington concluded that the applicant had been conducting a business of selling drugs from the premises at Manly. His Honour noted that the applicant had a lengthy criminal history, with convictions mainly for the possession and sale of drugs but also for offences of dishonesty and violence. His Honour referred to parts of a pre-sentence report. At the time of sentencing the applicant was a single unemployed man, thirty five years old. He had had what was described as a “fragmented” work history. He had had problems with addiction to drugs and alcohol from the age of seventeen. The applicant was described as immature and evasive, familiar with the criminal justice system, somewhat fragile, yet unwilling to accept responsibility for his own self-management and drug addiction. I will refer to other parts of his Honour’s remarks on sentence later in this judgment. 
     
      
    10 Counsel for the applicant relied on two grounds in support of the challenge to the sentences imposed by his Honour, namely that (1) the sentencing judge erred in failing to discount the applicant’s sentences for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty (2) the sentencing judge erred in failing to demonstrably take into account the applicant’s pre-sentence custody from 16 October 2001 to 11 December 2001. I will deal with each of these grounds in turn.  
     
      
    11 (1) the sentencing judge erred in failing to discount the applicant’s sentences for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    12 It is clear that his Honour was mindful that the applicant had pleaded guilty to all the charges. At the beginning of his remarks on sentence his Honour said that the applicant had entered pleas of guilty to the four charges. Later in his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is to be noted that the prisoner entered his plea of guilty to these matters before the Local Court so that he should be regarded as someone who has entered his pleas at the earliest possible opportunity”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    13 Counsel for the applicant referred to what was said by the Chief Justice, with the concurrence of all the other members of a five judge bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal, in the guideline judgment on pleas of guilty R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, especially at para 160 where the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court should adopt the following guideline applicable to offences against State laws: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence in so far as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant – contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value – but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last-mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, for example, assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate.  
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount”. 
        
       
      
    14 Counsel then relied on R v Lloyd (2003) NSWCCA 49, a decision of a two judge bench of this Court (O’Keefe J and Bell J) which was an application for leave to appeal from sentences passed by the same sentencing judge.  
     
      
    15 In Lloyd the sentencing judge had said in his remarks on sentence that the applicant had entered pleas of guilty at the earliest possible opportunity but had then said nothing further in his remarks on sentence about the pleas of guilty. At paras 21 and 22 of his judgment, with which Bell J agreed, O’Keefe J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am conscious of the fact that not quantifying the extent of reduction in sentence by reference to the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty does not necessarily involve an error ( 
        Regina v Thomson and Houlton 
         (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 401-402;  
        Regina v Deluca 
         [2002] NSWCCA 446), nonetheless, where there is no reference, either express or implied, to a discount for a plea of guilty, the absence of any quantification may tend to confirm that no discount has been given. 
        
       
       
        
        In the present case, the absence of any reference to the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty entered by the Applicant and the absence of any quantification, together with the length of the sentence imposed, lead to the conclusion that the utilitarian value of the pleas was not given effect to by the judge. This is an error, and in my opinion the second challenge to the sentences is made out”. 
        
       
      
    16 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that the present case was similar to Lloyd and that there should be a similar result. His Honour had not referred to the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. His Honour had not quantified any discount he had allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and the sentences his Honour had imposed were expressed in round figures, which suggested that no discount had been allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    17 It was further submitted that in the present case, having regard to the time at which the pleas of guilty had been entered, an appropriate discount for the pleas of guilty would be twenty per cent. 
     
      
    18 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that it was quite clear from the remarks on sentence and from what had been said in the proceedings on sentence that the sentencing judge was aware of the pleas of guilty. The only point, or at least the principal point, of his Honour noting in his remarks on sentence that the applicant should be regarded as having entered his pleas at the earliest possible opportunity, a finding which might in fact have been unduly favourable to the applicant, was the relevance of that finding to a quantification of the discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    19 It was submitted by the Crown Prosecutor that the Chief Justice had made it clear in Thomson & Houlton that, while sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the discount they are allowing for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, it is not essential for them to do so. 
     
      
    20 Reliance was sought to be placed by the Crown Prosecutor on the decision of a two judge bench of this Court, Greg James J and Carruthers AJ in R v Phillips; R v Simpson (2002) NSWCCA 167 which was another appeal from sentences passed by Acting Judge Shillington. It was pointed out by the Crown Prosecutor that in R v Phillips; R v Simpson a similar ground of appeal had been rejected. However, in that case his Honour, after being specifically asked by counsel for one of the prisoners (Simpson), to quantify the discount for the plea of guilty said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She gets in effect the maximum remission or reduction in the sentence by reason of her plea of guilty"". 
        
       
      
    21 Carruthers AJ who delivered the principal judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal inferred that this remark also applied to the other prisoner, Phillips. In other words, R v Phillips; R v Simpson was a case in which the sentencing judge did quantify the discount he was allowing for the pleas of guilty, by saying that he was allowing a maximum discount. 
     
      
    22 The principal submission made by the Crown in the present application was that it could be inferred from the moderate length of the sentences imposed by his Honour that his Honour had in fact taken into account the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty and had allowed a significant discount for them. 
     
      
    23 It is clear that it would have been desirable for his Honour to have quantified the discount he was allowing for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. However, his Honour was clearly mindful of the pleas of guilty and that they had been entered, according to his finding, at the earliest available opportunity and I have concluded that, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences and the offences to be taken into account, the finding that the applicant was carrying on a business of drug dealing, the important circumstance of aggravation that offences three and four were committed while the applicant was on bail for the first two offences and that they were offences of a similar sort committed at the same place as the first two offences, the further circumstance of aggravation not expressed adverted to by his Honour in his remarks on sentence that the applicant was on a recognisance when he committed all of the offences and the absence of any favourable subjective circumstances, the sentences imposed by his Honour by their leniency do disclose that his Honour in fact allowed a significant discount for the pleas of guilty. I would reject the first ground of appeal.  
     
      
    24 (2) the sentencing judge erred in failing to demonstrably take into account the applicant’s pre-sentence custody from 16 October 2001 to 11 December 2001.  
     
      
    25 As I have previously indicated, the applicant was in custody from 16 October 2001 to 11 December 2001, a period of one month twenty six days, which was exclusively referrable to the first and second offences. The applicant was in custody again from 17 January 2002 to the date of sentencing. The sentencing judge clearly allowed for the second period of custody, by making the sentences he passed for the first and second offences commence from 18 January 2002.  
     
      
    26 It was conceded by counsel for the applicant that in his remarks on sentence his Honour had said at p 4: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have taken into account in proposing the sentence which I propose a short term of imprisonment before he was released on bail on 11 December of last year being a period of approximately two months”. 
        
       
      
    27 However, it was submitted that, notwithstanding what the sentencing judge had said in his remarks on sentence about taking the first period of custody into account, the sentences he had imposed did not demonstrate that he had in fact taken into account the first period of custody.  
     
      
    28 Counsel for the applicant referred to s 24(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which provides that in sentencing an offender a Court must take into account the time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence. Reference was also made by counsel to s 47(2)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, under which a Court may direct that a sentence of imprisonment be taken to have commenced on a day before the day on which the sentence is imposed, and to s 47(3), which provides that in deciding whether or not to make a direction under s 47(2)(a) the Court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody for the offence. 
     
      
    29 Counsel for the applicant referred to a decision of a three judge bench of this Court in R v Howard (2001) NSWCCA 309. In R v Howard the applicant before being sentenced had been in custody for two discrete periods of ten days and one month five days. In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge expressly stated that he had taken into account the second period of one month five days but made no mention of the first period of ten days.  
     
      
    30 Wood CJ at CL, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, said at para 24 of his judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this regard it was the case that the applicant had spent ten days in custody between the time of his arrest, on 30 January 1997, and the date when he was granted bail on 10 February 1997, and a further period of one month and five days in custody between 10 May and 15 June 1998, totalling in all one month and fifteen days. His Honour made no mention of the first period of ten days, but expressly stated that he had taken into account the second period of one month and five days. It is, however, submitted that the sentence being expressed in round terms of seven years six months with a non parole period of five years six months, it did not demonstrate any such allowance, since one might reasonably have expected that it would either have been backdated, as is permissible:  
        MacDonald 
         NSWCCA 12 December 1995 and S47(2)  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        , or to have been reduced at the other end”. 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour proceeded to say in para 25:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not clear why the two periods of pre sentence custody were not demonstrably reflected in the sentencing order. In my view, error did occur in this respect, having regard to the provisions of S24 as well as S47(2) and (3) of the Act, and to the principles and practice discussed in  
        McHugh 
         (1985) 1 NSWLR 588;  
        Deeble 
         NSWCCA 19 September 1991, and  
        English 
         (2000) NSWCCA 245. Although I otherwise consider the sentence appropriate, in the absence of any statement or reason for not backdating for the periods in question or for reducing the sentence from the other end, I am of the view that the Court should intervene to adjust them accordingly”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    32 Wooc CJ at CL proceeded to hold that the appeal should be allowed, to the extent of backdating the commencement of the sentence by one month fifteen days, that is for the total of the two periods of presentence custody. 
     
      
    33 In R v McHugh, one of the cases referred to by the Chief Judge at Common Law in Howard, Street CJ said at p 590 to 591:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is desirable sentencing practice that, where there has been a period of pre-sentence custody exclusively referable to the offences for which sentence is being passed, the commencement of the sentence (and the non-parole or non-probation period) should be back-dated for an equivalent period. This is to be preferred to a process of assessing the proper sentence (and non-parole or non-probation period) and allowing, as it were, a discount in consequence of the pre-sentence custody. The desirable practice will promote the accuracy of the record, preventing there being a hidden factor affecting the length of the custody involved in consequence of the sentencing order”. 
        
       
      
    34 In R v Phillips; R v Simpson, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal to which I have already referred, a further ground of appeal was that the sentencing judge had erred in failing demonstrably to take into account the applicant Simpson’s pre-sentence custody. In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge said that he had taken into account the period of pre-sentence custody Simpson had served. However, the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge commenced from the date on which the judge made his sentencing order and the sentence imposed was in round figures of four years. At para 61 of his judgment Carruthers AJ, with whose judgment Greg James J concurred, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I would respectfully agree with the submission of Mr Dhanji, counsel for Ms Simpson, that the approach recommended in  
        McHugh 
         and followed in  
        Howard 
         should be adopted by this Court in the instant case. One significant reason is that it would make clear to the applicant, Ms Simpson, that a specific identifiable allowance was made for the thirty three days in question”. 
        
       
      
    35 It was submitted by the Crown Prosecutor before this Court that the sentencing judge had expressly adverted to the period of pre-sentence custody in his remarks on sentence; that, while there is a legislative requirement that a sentencing judge must take into account a period of pre-sentence custody referrable to the offence, there is no legislative requirement that the sentencing judge take a period of pre-sentence custody into account by backdating the commencement of the sentence; that the Chief Judge at Common Law in his judgment in Howard had left open the option of taking a period of pre-sentence custody into account by “reducing the sentence from the other end”, that is by imposing a shorter sentence which would expire earlier; and that in the present case it could be inferred, from what was submitted to be the leniency of the sentences imposed, that the sentencing judge had adjusted downwards the sentences he would otherwise have imposed so as to take account of the applicant’s first period of pre-sentence custody.  
     
      
    36 In my opinion, the second ground of appeal should be allowed. It is true that, while a sentencing judge is required to take a period of pre-sentence custody into account, it is not obligatory for the sentencing judge to take the period of pre-sentence custody into account by the means of backdating the commencement of the sentence and that in Howard the Chief Judge at Common Law left open the option of reducing a sentence to be imposed so as to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody. However, in the present case, I consider that, notwithstanding the sentencing judge’s assertion in his remarks on sentence that he had taken into account the first period of presentence custody, the first period of presentence custody is not demonstrably reflected in the sentences which were imposed. The first two sentences, on which the other two sentences depend, were made to commence from 18 January 2002, a commencement date which would allow only for the second period of pre-sentence custody. The sentences which were imposed were for round periods of whole years, which tends to militate against any conclusion that an irregular period of one month and twenty six days was really taken into account.  
     
      
    37 Although I have concluded that it can be inferred from the leniency of the sentences imposed that his Honour allowed a significant discount for the pleas of guilty, I am not satisfied that it can be inferred from the length of the sentences imposed that his Honour in fact made a further allowance for the first period of pre-sentence custody of one month and twenty six days.  
     
      
    38 In my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal against the sentences imposed by Shillington AJ should be allowed. I do not consider that the appeal should be dismissed on the ground that no lesser sentences would be warranted in law. It is accordingly necessary to re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
    39 I have referred to the objective facts of the offences and the subjective circumstances of the applicant. In re-sentencing the applicant I take into account some evidence tendered on the hearing of this application about the applicant’s conduct while he has been in custody. I take into account the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. For the same reasons as were given by his Honour in his remarks on sentence I would find special circumstances. I have concluded in the exercise of my own sentencing discretion that the sentences imposed by his Honour were sentences of a length appropriate to impose, apart from the failure demonstrably to take into account the first period of pre-sentence custody. In re-sentencing the applicant, I would adopt the same pattern of sentencing as his Honour did. I would make the sentences for the first two offences commence from 23 November 2001, so as demonstrably to take into account the first period of pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    40 I would propose the following orders: leave to appeal granted, appeal against sentences allowed; sentences imposed by Shillington AJ on 29 August 2002 quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences should be imposed. For the offence charged in the first count a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 23 November 2001; for the offence charged in the second count a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 23 November 2001; for the offence charged in the third count a term of imprisonment of three years with a non-parole period of one year commencing on 23 November 2002; for the offence charged in the fourth count a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 23 November 2002. I further propose that an order be made directing the release of the applicant on parole on 23 November 2003. 
     
      
    41 SMART AJ: I agree. 
     
      
    42 JAMES J: The orders of the Court will be the orders proposed by me.

      10827/03 - LACHLAN WILLIAM BLACK v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS and HER WORSHIP, MAGISTRATE SYLVIA EMMETT 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Lachlan William Black (the plaintiff) and Jerome Ta’ala are charged with murdering Mark O’Callaghan and Tamika McKenzie. Both killings are alleged to have taken place on 28 May 2002 in the general area of a housing commission complex at Sutherland. Application was made by them, whom I shall refer to jointly as the Local Court defendants, that certain intended witnesses for the prosecution who had made written statements be directed to attend for cross examination at committal proceedings pursuant to s48E of the Justices Act 1902. Unless otherwise stated, section references are to that Act. A direction must be given if the relevant parties consent thereto (s48E (1A)) but if consent is not forthcoming, as is the present case, there is restriction viz: 
     
      
       
        
        “48E (2) In any other circumstances, the Justice or Justices may give the direction only if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in the case of a witness in proceedings that relate to an offence involving violence who is the alleged victim of the offence – the Justice or Justices are of the opinion that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in any other case – the Justice or Justices are of the opinion that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence. “ 
          
         
        
       
      
    2 Where a direction is given, cross examination is limited to the matters which have been the basis of the reasons for giving the direction (s41(10)) and it is appropriate practice to specify the “areas” in respect of which cross examination is to be permitted.  
     
      
    3 Cross examination of seven nominated witnesses was sought on behalf of Ta’ala. These were either residents of or visitors to the complex. One of the seven (Brennan) has now also been charged with the murder of Ms McKenzie and a written submission on behalf of the Crown states “he is no longer a prosecution witness” and, I would therefore infer, it is not intended to tender his statement in the committal proceedings against Ta’ala and the plaintiff. A submitting appearance in the usual form has been filed on behalf of the second defendant. The learned magistrate directed that, with the exclusion of Brennan, the remaining six witnesses may be cross examined as to their respective observations of alcohol and drugs consumed by Ta’ala and the plaintiff and their observations of physical manifestations and conduct by them on 28 and 29 May, and that five of the six witnesses may be cross examined as to their own consumption of alcohol or drugs on those dates. Ta’ala has not joined in the present proceedings.  
     
      
    4 The same direction in respect of the same witnesses was made in respect of the plaintiff’s application but a direction for the attendance of nine further witnesses (seven residents of or visitors to the complex and two police officers) was refused. Expansion of the permitted areas of cross examination of the six witnesses directed to attend was also refused. 
     
      
    5 No appeal lies to this Court authorizing review of or rehearing on the merits of the decision of the Local Court. As Howie J stated in McKirdy v McCosker 2002 127 A Crim R 217 @ 218: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question for this Court is not whether the magistrate was wrong in refusing to give the direction sought, even if this error involved a misconstruction of the section, but whether he failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon him by the section or so misconceived the nature and extent of the jurisdiction or the manner in which it was to be exercised that his purported exercise of the jurisdiction was in truth no exercise at all:  
        Ex parte Hebburn Ltd; Re Kearsley Shire Council 
         (1947) 47 SR (NSW) 416 @ 420;  
        Saffron v DPP (NSW)  
        (1989) 16 NSWLR 397 @ 418. There will be a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction under the section if the magistrate has applied the wrong test in determining whether a witness should be called.” 
        
       
      
    6 The summons by which the proceedings were instituted seeks an order pursuant to s75 of the Supreme Court Act (declaratory relief), alternatively s69 of that Act (proceedings in lieu of former prerogative writs) and, again alternatively, s65 of that Act (commanding fulfilment of a duty) requiring the second defendant to determine the plaintiff’s application under s48E according to law and directing that some sixteen nominated witnesses (fifteen, if Brennan is excluded) attend to give oral evidence at the committal hearing when its date has been fixed. None of the provisions of the Supreme Court Act appealed to would authorize this Court to give a direction as latterly claimed as that would amount to a purported exercise of a discretion by this Court on the merits of the application which is the province of the Local Court. The statement of grounds accompanying the originating process and the submissions made in support of them (including an additional ground sought to be relied upon) assert a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction and the matter can be dealt with accordingly. That failure may be demonstrated by the application of an incorrect test or a misunderstanding of the nature of the opinion the magistrate must form in order to determine whether to give a direction and, if so, in what terms: J.W. v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWSC 1244.  
     
      
    7 There is no dispute that the provision applicable to the learned magistrate’s determination was s48E(2)(b), that is, “substantial reasons why, in the interest of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence.” The requirement to determine “substantial” reasons contrasts with the requirement to determine “special” reasons as required by s48E(2)(a). The former expression has been described as “obviously wider” : R v Kennedy 1997 94 A Crim R 341 @ 353 fn 37. To establish substantial reasons, it is not necessary that a case be exceptional or unusual: per Hidden J in R v Losurdo 1998 101 A Crim R 162 @ 166 as approved per the Court of Appeal 1998 44 NSWLR 618 @ 623. 
     
      
    8 In Losurdo the Court of Appeal also indicated express agreement with remarks by Studdert J in Hanna v Kearney [1998] NSWSC 227: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be useful for me to make the following additional observations in the context of the present applications, although I emphasise that I am not intending what I am about to state to be treated as an attempt to state all factors that may be relevant to these applications or other applications under s48E: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Section 48E(2)(b) plainly has as a primary aim the limitation of the time occupied in committal proceedings. Such proceedings are not to provide the opportunity for a full dress rehearsal for the trial. Cross-examination is to be eliminated unless it is required in the interests of justice for reasons that are reasons of substance. 
        
       
       
        
        2. There can be no rigid or exhaustive definition of what constitutes  
        ‘substantial reasons’ 
         and it would be undesirable to attempt to give one. Relevant issues inevitably vary from case to case. However, any statement served has to be considered with reference to the issues it addresses and the change to which it relates. The application to cross-examine requires identification and consideration of the objective of the cross-examiner, and the framework of the prosecution case. To require a witness for cross-examination without a definite aim but in the hope of eliciting some evidence that might prove useful to the defence would not constitute  
        ‘substantial reasons’ 
        . It is for the applicant to clearly define the purpose or purposes of the cross-examination which he seeks. 
        
       
       
        
        3. It would be wrong to limit  
        ‘substantial reasons’ 
         to situations where cross-examination is likely to result in the discharge of the defendant or to establish grounds for a no bill application. Equally it would be wrong to limit  
        ‘substantial reasons’ 
         to situations where cross-examination is likely to substantially undermine the credit of an important witness.  
        ‘Substantial reasons’ 
         may well be found elsewhere. 
        
       
       
        
        4. On any application under s48E the fundamental objective of committal proceedings must be borne in mind, namely the objective of facilitating a fair trial in the event that the person charged is committed and later stands trial. This may mean that there are substantial reasons for requiring a witness for cross-examination for a proper understanding of the nature of the prosecution case or for an understanding of the basis of a relevant opinion held by a witness. I do but give those instances, I certainly do not intend them to be exhaustive. 
        
       
       
        
        5.  
        ‘Substantial reason’ 
         may be shown for cross-examination where this may lead to the narrowing of matters in dispute: see  
        Goldsmith v Newman 
         (1992) 59 SASR 404 @ 411. This is a consideration of particular importance where the prospect exists of a lengthy trial, as it does in the present cases.” 
        
       
      
    9 Helpful although the foregoing analyses are, and accepting that in the present context “substantial” reasons may be demonstrated at a lower threshold than “special” reasons, it remains the situation that the word “substantial” has a somewhat ephemeral quality. That circumstance has been recognized in connection with the appearance of the same word in legislation such as the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Commonwealth) s45B. In Tillmann’s Butcheries v A.M.I.E.U. 1979 42 FLR 331 Deane J commented that “substantial” was not only susceptible of ambiguity; it was a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision. In O’Brien Glass v Cool & Sons 1983 77 FLR 441 Fox J observed that the legislature had “chosen a word of intractably indefinite import and much must be left to individual assessment”.  
     
      
    10 Those observations should be borne in mind when considering the challenges to the determination of the Local Court. I turn to the specific grounds.11 Ground 1: 
     
      
       
        
        “Her Worship erred in finding that although each of the areas sought to be cross-examined upon was ‘capable of amounting to substantial reasons’, it was necessary for Her Worship to determine ‘whether or not there is anything on the face of each of the statements to which each area applied for is relevant and the omission of which would visit an unfairness on the defendants amounting to a sufficient level as to provide substantial reasons why the cross-examination should be allowed’.” 
        
       
      
    12 The ground includes some quotations from the second defendant’s reasons. The impression I have gained is that the transcription has been taken from sound recording and some further punctuation in the reasons as a whole might assist in clarification. 
     
      
    13 Her Worship stated that each of the areas applied for was capable of amounting to substantial reasons. It was submitted that having been so satisfied “the test in s48E was made out”. The submission is rejected. It does not follow that circumstances capable of amounting to substantial reasons are in fact substantial reasons. Part of the quoted statement was introduced by the words “what I need to examine” but I do not consider that a test of necessity was being articulated rather the processes of reasoning which were being applied were being exposed as she determined whether there were in fact relevant substantial reasons. Nor was an additional test of “unfairness” being applied. Her Worship had just made express reference to the remarks of Studdert J in Hanna as above recited and stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I read those as if they were set out, those identified in the written submissions by the parties”, 
        
       
       
      The reference to unfairness was no more than a different articulation of the objective mentioned by his Honour of facilitating a fair trial. 
       
      
    14 This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    15 Ground 2: 
     
      
       
       Her Worship erred in holding that before finding substantial reasons for allowing cross-examination of witnesses it was necessary for Her Worship to be satisfied that there was ‘any substantial discrepancy, uncertainties or untruths patent on the face of the statements such as would allow cross-examination of these witnesses in the areas sought on the basis of the existence of substantial reasons’. 
       
      
    16 As the written submissions of the plaintiff recognize, the partial quotation of reasons expressed in the ground should conclude with the additional words “beyond the orders I have already made”. Her Worship’s expression does not convey any application of a wrong test but rather identifies reasons advanced on behalf of the plaintiff, which she was rejecting as constituting substantial reasons for extending the permissible areas of cross examination of the witnesses who were already required to attend. As I have noted, the structure of her reasons was to deal with Ta’ala’s application and, insofar as she ruled in favour of his application, she simply ruled likewise on the plaintiff’s application. The partial quotation in the ground, with the completion noted above, was immediately followed by a statement which makes plain what she was dealing with when she said:  
     
      
       
        
        “accordingly in relation to the application of (the plaintiff) to cross examine the abovenamed persons on areas beyond the orders already made” 
        
       
       
      and she continued with reference to the submissions of the plaintiff and the counter submissions of the Crown.  
       
      
    17 I do not conclude that the learned magistrate applied any wrong test. 18 Ground 3: 
     
      
       
        
        Her Worship erred in adopting the Crown submissions that inconsistencies between Crown witnesses did not provide substantial reasons for requiring a witness for cross-examination at committal, on the basis that ‘Almost every criminal prosecution involving civilian witnesses includes some degree of inconsistency between the witnesses and it is indicative of the witness having provided his or her own subjective account rather than having colluded with others.’ 
        
       
      
    19 This quotation is directly from the Crown written submissions. Her Worship made two references to the adoption of Crown submissions, the first in relation to the extension of the areas upon which witnesses whom she directed attend could be cross examined and the second in relation to additional witnesses sought by the plaintiff but not sought by Ta’ala. In dealing with the first matter she did include in her remarks some issues which could not have been the subject of testimony by the witnesses who were to be called, in particular the voluntariness of the recorded interview and the witness re-enactment. Her reasons in full context were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Accordingly in relation to the application of Mr Black to cross-examine the above named persons on areas beyond the order already made I have had regard to and considered the oral and written submissions made on behalf of Mr Black and those made in response by the Crown in respect of reliability and credit, motive, inconsistent statements of individual witnesses, statements inconsistent with other witnesses, the mental health of Mr Black, the voluntariness of the recorded interview and the witness re-enactment. I agree with the reasons identified in the written submissions of the Crown which I adopt and I am not satisfied that substantial reasons exist to warrant the extension of the orders already made in respect of the areas of cross-examination of each of those named persons. Those reasons identified by the Crown would form part of the reasoning process of my judgment and simply because of their length I don’t set them out in full this morning. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, in respect of the applications of each of the additional witnesses to those already identified, namely, Williams, Knight, Hoffman, Snook, Wright, Tutaki, Detective Sergeant Hutcheson and Constable Currey, and in respect of each area of cross-examination sought I have had regard to and considered the oral and written submissions of each of the defendants and the Crown. I agree with the reasons identified by the Crown in their written submissions, which I adopt, and I am not satisfied there are substantial reasons to grant any further application in respect of cross-examination of those witnesses identified on any area. Accordingly I make the same orders in respect of the application by Mr Black under s48E in relation to the identity of witnesses and areas of cross-examination for which leave is granted as I have made in respect of the application for Mr Ta’ala.” (Spelling of some surnames has been corrected). 
        
       
      
    20 The Crown submission merely pointed to a common feature of evidence in criminal cases and impliedly invited Her Worship to find that in this case the circumstances did not demonstrate substantial reasons for the orders being made. 
     
      
    21 The plaintiff has expressly submitted, “for the present case, the relevant test is whether the justice is of the opinion that there are ‘substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the witness should attend to give oral evidence’.” 
     
      
    22 The submission repeats the terms of the statute. Her Worship’s reasons included negative findings in those terms. That those findings were elaborated and an observation in submissions of the Crown adopted, is not a demonstration that some wrong test has been applied. 
     
      
    23 Ground 4: 
     
      
       
        
        Her Worship erred in adopting the Crown submission that although there were ‘clear issues in relation to the admissibility of the ERISP given the defendant’s request for legal representation’, there was no benefit in cross-examining the police officer who interviewed the Plaintiff. 
        
       
      
    24 Again, as stated, the quotation in the ground is extracted from the Crown written submissions which were in broad, but unqualified, terms adopted in the learned magistrate’s reasons. 
     
      
    25 It is true that, as submitted on behalf of the Crown to this Court, the basis for an argument that the ERISP is inadmissible appears in the ERISP itself. But there are other considerations which potentially might be taken into account as to whether the record would in fact be admitted. The Crown submission asserted the irrelevance of what the detective thought about the propriety of continuing his questioning in the particular circumstances. The detective’s state of mind is relevant to predictable need for a trial judge to exercise discretion under s138 of the Evidence Act. In particular s138(3)(e) of that Act directs that there be taken into account, where there is impropriety or contravention of Australian law, whether such was deliberate or reckless.  
     
      
    26 Such an issue is conformable with concepts expressed in Losurdo by Hidden J which were endorsed by the Court of Appeal. His Honour had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…. It may be appropriate to cross-examine witnesses at committal with an eye to the exercise of a discretion by a trial judge, even though the magistrate has no such discretion: particularly in a case, such as this, where the rejection of the evidence at trial may be fatal to the Crown case. In this regard it should not be forgotten that a properly conducted committal can benefit the prosecution as much as the defence. Cross-examination about a matter giving rise to discretionary rejection might elicit material in support of an objection and assist to bring the relevant issues into focus. Equally, it might establish that there is no foundation for such an objection.” 
        
       
      
    27 The submission by the Crown to the Local Court which was adopted as Her Worship’s reason did not extend beyond the bare statement which is paraphrased in the ground.  
     
      
    28 I emphasize again that the jurisdiction of this Court is not to determine whether any ruling in the Local Court was correct or erroneous, but on this matter it appears that what occurred was no more than the adoption of a rhetorical statement and in my view it constituted a failure to exercise jurisdiction to such an extent that it must be concluded that the purported exercise did not amount to requisite exercise at all. There is no indication that relevant issues for cross examination were addressed appearing either in the reasons delivered or the incorporated written submission. 
     
      
    29 Ground 4 is made out.  
     
      
    30 Ground 5: 
     
      
       
       Her Worship erred in adopting the Crown submission that Constable Currey should not be required for cross-examination because ‘this cannot constitute special reasons’. 
       
      
    31 At the conclusion of written submissions concerning a re-enactment of certain events viewed by Constable Currey, there appeared “this cannot constitute special reasons but is rather a matter of submission as to admissibility or weight”. This is obviously a mis-statement as the test before the Court concerned “substantial” reasons. I am satisfied that the mis-statement caused no error on the part of the learned magistrate even though she expressed a general adoption of Crown written submissions. The transcript of her reasons extends over four pages, the first full page being devoted to outlining what was being sought by the Local Court defendants. In the succeeding three pages Her Worship used the expression “substantial reasons” on nine recorded occasions. Apart from the instance pointed to the same expression appears throughout the Crown submissions. I am not persuaded that at any time she applied a test of requiring “special” reasons to be demonstrated. 
     
      
    32 Ground 5A:  
     
      
       
        
        The learned magistrate erred in adopting the Crown’s submission that there is a presumption against calling witnesses. 
        
       
      
    33 There is of course no legal presumption but this Crown submission was no more than an advocate’s articulation of observations of the Court of Appeal in Losurdo @ 203, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before we conclude we wish to emphasise that nothing we have said is intended to undermine the effect of s48E(2)(b). The hurdle it presents may not be as formidable as that presented by s41E(2)(a) but nevertheless it raises a barrier which must be surmounted.” 
        
       
      
    34 Ground 6: 
     
      
       
        
        Her Worship erred in not permitting cross-examination of the witnesses as sought in the submissions of the Plaintiff’s solicitor. 
        
       
      
    35 It is conceded that this is a collation of previous grounds but two additional matters were canvassed in respect of which there was a further concession that they could not in isolation be relied on as separate grounds.  
     
      
    36 The first is an observation that there are seventy statements in the prosecution brief; the plaintiff sought to cross examine sixteen witnesses but only six witnesses were directed to attend for that purpose and only on the limited issues earlier mentioned. It is submitted that “the result suggests that appropriate tests have not been applied”. I do not perceive that such a suggestion derives from those statistics. 
     
      
    37 The second contrasts two full days of argument with the comparative brevity of the second defendant’s expressed reasons. The economy was obviously achieved by the avoidance of mere recitation of Crown submissions with which she was wholly in agreement. It is submitted that it does not appear that individual attention was given to each of the witnesses in respect of whom direction was sought. What does appear is that this conclusion is invited to be drawn from an absence of verbosity. As can be seen in the schedules annexed to the affidavit in support of the summons, there was, in any event, a discernible pattern to the applications in very many cases and no criticism should be directed against avoidance of unnecessary repetition. I do not conclude that requisite attention was not paid to the plaintiff’s requests.  
     
      
    38 Save Ground 4, none of the grounds has been made out. I agree with the Crown submission that the terms in which relief is sought in the summons are somewhat unclear, however, s69 of the Supreme Court Act permits an order in the nature of mandamus where there has been jurisdictional error: cf Wade v Burns 1966 115 CLR 537. Ground 4 discloses a matter in appropriate category. 
     
      
    39 I order that the matter be remitted to the Local Court to reconsider in accordance with these reasons whether a direction be given for Detective Hutcheson to attend for cross examination. 
     
      
    40 Save that order, the summons is otherwise dismissed and the stay of proceedings ordered on 7 April 2003 is discharged.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Dowd J, and generally with his reasons. I also agree with the remarks of Barr J. 
     
      
    2 In the course of his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge said this: 
     
      
       
        
        38 Although there had been mention during the course of the judgment in R v Thomson and Houlton of situations where the late entry of pleas was or may have been influenced by the attitude of the prosecuting authorities - see [20] and [29], no separate consideration was given to that factor. Where the Crown accepts a plea to a lesser charge in full satisfaction of an indictment including a higher charge, a benefit is necessarily conferred on an offender even without any grant by a court of the normal discount for a plea. When one has regard to the rationale for that discount it does not seem to me that the rules or extent of the discount which apply in other situations should necessarily apply. I do not, of course, suggest that the sentence should reflect any component because the offender might have been guilty of the higher charge. I merely suggest that the interests of the courts do not require that the discount be as great or, at times, that it should exist. After all, the primary function of the punishment is to deal with the offender's criminality.  
         
         
        39 The topic is not one where precise quantification of benefit to the system or even to the particular trial is practical or, in most cases, even possible. Nor is it possible to compare in quantitative terms the saving in resources and cost resulting from a plea with a reduction in sentence measured either in years or percentage. Furthermore, the benefit to the justice system resulting from any plea is not restricted to the particular trial or offender. Some of that benefit lies in the message it sends to other offenders having the choice of pleading guilty or not guilty. 
         
         
        40 I am not persuaded that this was a case where the Crown case was particularly complex albeit there must have been a strong attack on Mr Rossinski's credibility and perhaps the credibility of others. I take the view that, even if their pleas were not associated with the dropping by the Crown of the more serious charges, I would not allow more than a 20% discount for their pleas. In arriving at that conclusion, I am in part influenced by what I see as the appropriate result of the proceedings. Having regard to the magnitude of the Prisoners' criminality their punishment should be no more lenient than it will be. Because I am of the view, arising from the history and timing of events that the prisoners in fact received other benefits from their plea, i.e. that the chance of their being convicted of being accessories to murder was removed, - and certainly, the onus being on the prisoners, I am not persuaded to the contrary - I favour a somewhat lower discount. 
        
       
      
    3 In my opinion, the amount of any discount to be allowed by reason of the utilitarian benefit of a plea of guilty should not be reduced on the ground that the plea was offered in association with the abandonment by the Crown of a greater charge; and if in such a case the plea is offered as soon as the Crown indicates willingness to accept a plea to the lesser charge, it should be regarded as being made at the earliest opportunity. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with the presumption of innocence of the greater charge, which in those circumstances must stand unaffected. 
     
      
    4 However, the utilitarian discount is a recognition of advantages to the administration of justice that actually flow from a plea of guilty. By reason of statutory provisions applying in New South Wales, in this State it is not given merely on the basis that the offender’s culpability is mitigated by demonstration of willingness to facilitate the course of justice: R v. Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300, distinguishing Cameron v. The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 382. 
     
      
    5 If a plea is entered a long time after a person is first charged, but at a time when a lesser charge is substituted for a greater charge, the advantages to the administration of justice are less, even though the plea may have been made at the earliest opportunity. There is in any event no entitlement to a 25% discount; and the fact that in this situation there are less advantages to the administration of justice can justify a smaller discount. 
     
      
    6 This approach may mean that in some cases an offender may obtain a lower discount just because the prosecuting authorities initially brought a greater charge than that ultimately pursued, so that the delay in the plea of guilty was not the offender’s fault. But this is consistent with the nature of the discount as being at least in part a recognition of practical advantages, and not merely a recognition of mitigation of culpability.  
     
      
    7 I think the sentencing judge may also have been in error in referring to the strength of the Crown case. That can be relevant to the question of whether a plea of guilty is indicative of remorse or otherwise mitigating of culpability, but it is not relevant to the discount to be given by reason of the advantages actually flowing to the administration of justice. 
     
      
    8 However, in my opinion, the discount given in this case, namely 16.7%, was entirely appropriate, and for that reason the first ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    9 The resulting sentence and non-parole periods were appropriate. The difference between the applicant’s sentence and that of his co-offender was justifiable in that the sentencing judge explicitly found that the applicant had not demonstrated contrition, and also explicitly found, having regard to a favourable pre-sentence report, that Mr. Refai may be able to lead a crime-free life. I am not satisfied that the difference between the two sentences is indicative of error. 
     
      
    10 DOWD J: This is an application by Mohamed Dib to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed by Hulme J on 18 December 2002 after the entry of a plea of guilty on 11 September 2002 to a charge of Accessory after the Fact to Malicious Wounding with Intent to do Grievous Bodily Harm, in breach of s33 and s350 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    11 The date of the offence was between 17-19 October 1998. The sentence of imprisonment was imposed of three years and four months with a non-parole period of two years, both to commence on 15 July 2001. The applicant had been arrested on 2 August 2000. Bail was refused. Conditional bail was granted on 11 August 2000 but the applicant was taken into custody on 26 November 2000 for breach of a Community Service Order and has remained in custody since that time. For some months of that time in custody, the applicant was serving sentences for other matters. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
      
    12 The two grounds of appeal were, first, that the sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the appropriate discount to be applied for the applicant’s plea of guilty and, secondly, that the sentencing judge failed to take into account parity between the applicant and the co-offender. 
     
      
       
      Summary of the facts on which the charge was based 
      
    13 On Saturday 17 October 1998 the victim Edward Lee travelled with Peter Son, Daniel Son and Michael Rhee at about 7:15pm to Telopea Street, Punchbowl. Daniel Son telephoned the premises that the group were to visit to ascertain the number of the house, the driver having parked the car further up the street. The group alighted and walked towards a group of between seven to ten male persons, one of whom said to Peter Son: 
     
      
       
        
        What the fuck are you looking at? 
        
       
      
    14 Daniel Son entered the discussion and one of the group of seven to ten, Ahmad Dib, pushed Peter Son in the chest who took a step backwards and struck Ahmad Dib, the brother of the applicant, causing him to fall to the ground unconscious. Peter Son was then attacked by the group of seven to ten. His brother Daniel Son attempted to provide assistance. There was a general fight in which several people were seen to inflict blows, including the victim.  
     
      
    15 The applicant’s brother, Moustapha Dib went to his house, obtained a knife and stabbed Edward Lee in the back and in the chest. The victim was able to get into the car and the other people from the car extricated themselves from the attack by other members of the group in Telopea Street and went back to the car which drove off. Guns were fired at the vehicle, a bullet lodging in the vehicle’s doorframe.  
     
      
    16 An eye witness who knew Moustapha Dib said that Moustapha Dib said: 
     
      
       
        
        I just clicked. 
        
       
      
    17 Lee died as a result of the two deep stab wounds. Shortly after the stabbing Moustapha Dib and the applicant were at premises at Punchbowl and an associate present heard the applicant say: 
     
      
       
        
        Don’t worry, it’s done, how are we going to fix it? 
        
       
      
    18 One of the co-accused with the applicant, Mr Kanaan, received a telephone call during which he was heard to say, according to the Summary of Facts, “Drama at Telopea Street, someone got knocked”. It was claimed on behalf of Mr Kanaan that the last word used was “knifed”. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that he was content to proceed on that basis. Half an hour later there was another call following which Mr Kanaan, a Mr Rossinski and others left Surry Hills and travelled to Bondi Beach where they met with a number of males including the two Dib brothers and Mr Refai. Mohamad Dib told the group of the incident in Telopea Street. He said there were some Asians there, a fight occurred, and another of his brothers had been knocked to the ground. Upon seeing this, Moustapha Dib ran to a house, grabbed a knife, (returned) and then stabbed one of the Asians. 
     
      
    19 Mr Kanaan and Mr Rossinski then made a number of telephone calls and there was also discussion about the best way of setting up an alibi. After what would seem to have been some significant consideration in that regard, an idea involving Hamilton Island was abandoned and the discussion turned to the topic of getting the Dibs to Queensland and organising a vehicle and clothes. Mr Rossinski offered suggestions on ways to strengthen this alibi by arranging for friends in Queensland to book a motel room and order food under the Dib’s name and keep the receipt and a decision was made that Mr Refai would drive Moustapha and Mohamed Dib and a fourth person to Queensland in a borrowed vehicle which had Queensland number plates. 
     
      
    20 At some stage the group left Bondi Beach and went back to Surry Hills. There Mr Kanaan and Rossinski were involved in collecting $1,000 and providing it to Mohamed Dib. Clothes were also obtained and the four persons departed for Queensland. 
     
      
    21 These last three paragraphs are taken from the Remarks on Sentence of the learned sentencing judge. His Honour noted that there was little evidence to show how Refai, the applicant’s co-accused, became involved and nothing to indicate that he was more than a chauffeur. 
     
      
    22 On 20 October 2000 a search warrant was executed at Telopea Street where the applicant told a police officer that he, the applicant, and Moustapha had left for Queensland at about 6pm the previous Friday. Mobile telephone records contradicted this assertion. His Honour found that a great deal of time was expended in checking out the alibi. 
     
      
    23 The applicant and his co-accused, Kanaan and Refai, were committed for trial on 17 December 2000 on a number of charges, one of which was that of being an Accessory after the Fact to Murder. They were arraigned on 1 February 2001. The trial of the three charged with Accessory after the Fact to Murder and that of Moustapha were listed to commence on 9 September 2002. There were applications to defer, but the matter was listed for hearing and the jury was empanelled on 11 September 2002.  
     
      
    24 On 11 September the Crown advised that it wished to present an indictment against those three charged with Accessory after the Fact to Murder with the lesser offence of Accessory after the Fact to the Malicious Wounding of Edward Lee by Moustapha Dib with Intent to do Grievous Bodily Harm. All three pleaded not guilty to the more serious charge but guilty to the lesser charge, the Crown accepting those pleas of guilty to the lesser charge in full satisfaction of the indictment. 
     
      
    25 The trial of Moustapha Dib was then twice commenced but did not proceed to verdict. Since then Moustapha Dib has pleaded guilty to manslaughter but had not been sentenced at the time of the sentencing of the applicant. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - That the Sentencing Judge erred in the assessment of the appropriate discount for the plea of guilty 
      
    26 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the discount which was eight months on a starting point of four years was 16.7%, it being conceded that such a discount was within the range indicated in R v Thomson and Houlten (2000) 49 NSWLR 383.  
     
      
    27 The applicant’s submission was that the discretion of the learned sentencing judge miscarried in his approach to the timing of the plea on the basis that the original charge carried a maximum penalty of twenty five years and it was only on 11 September that the Crown charged the alternative to which the applicant immediately entered a plea and this was at the first opportunity. I agree with that submission. 
     
      
    28 Hulme J said that the discount for a plea of guilty would not be as great in a case where it involves a plea to a lesser charge as to where it involves a plea to all charges brought by the Crown and that he was, therefore, reducing the discount because of this fact and the benefits that the applicant’s co-offenders received from the plea, that is, the removal of the chance of their being convicted of the more serious charge.  
     
      
    29 I do not agree that the discount should be reduced by reason of is a benefit in the acceptance of a plea to a lesser charge. A person in the position of the applicant comes with a presumption of innocence and no assumptions can be made as to the basis for the acceptance of the plea. The plea should be treated as one made at the earliest opportunity (Cameron v R (2002) 76 ALJR 382, R v Atkinson [2001] NSWCCA 135).  
     
      
    30 The reference by his Honour to the Crown case and any suggestion of examination of the strength of the case is inappropriate (R v Lo [2001] NSWCCA 271, R v Gorgievski [2002] NSWCCA 45). 
     
      
    31 It was submitted by the Crown, and I agree with this submission, that his Honour was not bound to grant a discount of 25% that being the maximum indicated discount (R v Thomson supra). It was submitted by the Crown that it was open to his Honour to take into account that the plea was to an alternative to a more serious charge. 
     
      
    32 As I have indicated, the reasoning of his Honour was, in my view, in error. The plea was clearly entered at the first opportunity. I consider, however, that the plea was entered on a very serious charge and without any indication of remorse, as the applicant did not adduce evidence which so indicated, and the discount which his Honour did grant was not only within range of what his Honour was entitled to provide but was appropriate in the circumstances. 
     
      
    33 In this light, not only the head sentence but a sentence with a two year non-parole period was, in the circumstances of such a serous offence, appropriate.  
     
      
    34 I am not, therefore, of the view that some sentence other than what was imposed, should have been passed, and thus this ground fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – That the applicant has a legitimate grievance arising from the disparity between the sentence imposed on him and that imposed on the co-offender Refai 
      
    35 The co-accused, Refai, received a sentence of two years which was wholly suspended. 
     
      
    36 The applicant contends that Hulme J regarded the objective seriousness of the offence of the applicant and Refai as equal, although concedes that his Honour indicated there is little evidence that Refai was more than a chauffeur although his Honour later said that the carrying out of that plan persisted over a period of days.  
     
      
    37 It is also put on behalf of the applicant that the moral turpitude of the applicant was less because of his relationship to his brother, relying on R v Farroukh (NSWCCA, unreported, 29 March 1996) where Gleeson CJ held, with which judgment Hidden J and I concurred: 
     
      
       
        
        There is, however, a wide variation in the possible degrees of moral culpability of persons convicted of this offence. The present was not a case, as sometimes occurs, where an accessory after the fact has been personally involved in a criminal enterprise, although the involvement falls short of participation as a principal, or where an accessory is associated with criminal elements and has become accessory by reason of that association. … 
        
       
      
    38 The learned sentencing judge noted that the applicant was pulling his brother away from Mr Lee. It is put that Refai had no such fraternal attachment. Hulme J also submitted that there was not much to be said for the applicant in terms of mitigation and, in contrast, said that personal deterrents should be an important factor for Refai. It was submitted that the learned sentencing judge considered Refai’s prospects of rehabilitation, although not high, were better than those of the applicant. It was submitted that Hulme J related his finding that the applicant lacked contrition as a significant part of the offence the applicant committed.  
     
      
    39 The applicant, in short, submitted there was no basis for a different approach between Refai and the applicant. They were of similar age and similar criminal record.  
     
      
    40 The applicant conceded that Refai had a positive pre-sentence report based on conduct while on bail, but submitted that the applicant was deprived of such an opportunity by being held on remand for more than five hundred days prior to sentence.  
     
      
    41 The applicant’s case is that there is a justifiable sense of grievance at the disparity between the two sentences particularly as the time served by the applicant was harsh because he was on remand, as the judge found when finding “special circumstances” for reducing the non-parole period.  
     
      
    42 The respondent submitted that any disparity was within his Honour’s discretion and it is not shown that his Honour was in error in failing to reduce the sentence because of the harsh conditions.  
     
      
    43 This court’s power is set out in Lowe v The Queen (1994) 154 CLR 601. In my view, it has not been shown that justice has not been done. Any reduction of the presently imposed sentence would be manifestly inadequate for the offence. There is nothing shown by the applicant to warrant a lesser sentence in law: s6 (3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    44 Notwithstanding evidence given before this court by the applicant that he had thought his plea of guilty had expressed his remorse, it was clear that his Honour, at the time of passing sentence, took into account a serious offence which, on the evidence available to him, indicated a lack of remorse or contrition. 
     
      
    45 The much more favourable pre-sentence report of Refai, which partly resulted from his performance on bail is, in a sense, unfair but it is nonetheless a factor which the judge was entitled to take into account. 
     
      
    46 The improved prospect of rehabilitation is a factor which, in part, explains the difference between the two sentences. 
     
      
    47 Additionally, a suspended sentence is, nonetheless, a serious sentence and may have serious consequences for a person if a further offence occurs.  
     
      
    48 In my view, no disparity has been shown other than what is within the discretionary powers of the learned sentencing judge and this ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
    49 I would, therefore, propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. That leave to appeal be granted: and 
       
      2. That the appeal be dismissed. 
       
      
    50 BARR J: I agree generally, for the reasons given by Dowd J, that leave to appeal should be granted and that the appeal should be dismissed. I agree with the remarks of Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    51 I wish to add some remarks about the proper approach to appeals against the asserted severity of sentences based on errors identified in the remarks of sentencing judges. 
     
      
    52 Sentencing is an intuitive process in which the judge identifies, considers and weighs a large number of disparate features, some of which make for a more severe sentence and some for a less. It is ordinarily appropriate for the judge to make known such of the features as have affected the resulting sentence and to say how important the judge thinks they are. But that is not to say that a judge can or should try to give a precise value to such features so as to synthesise a sentence as though performing a mathematical exercise. 
     
      
    53 The value to be attributed to a particular feature of a case cannot be assessed without having in mind all the other features in the case, favourable and unfavourable. Sometimes a preponderance of favourable features will result in any one of them receiving less weight than it might have received in the absence of the other favourable features. An example is the credit that must be given to an offender who has provided or undertaken to provide assistance to the authorities. The legislation provides, as the common law before it provided, that there is a limit to the value that may be given to such a combination of features. The resulting penalty may not be disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 23(3); R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243. 
     
      
    54 In a similar way different features which each entitle an offender to a less severe sentence may have overlapping effects, with the result that the appropriate total allowance will be less than the sum of the parts: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 per Gleeson CJ at 230-234. 
     
      
    55 Even though a sentencing judge is encouraged to quantify the discount allowed for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, the features identified by Gleeson CJ remain and sentencing remains an intuitive process, with the result that there may be an element of arbitrariness in a sentencing judge’s quantification of the discount allocated to that feature and/or in the impact that that feature has on the result. It follows that if on appeal an offender demonstrates that a sentencing judge has made an error of a few percentage points in a stated discount the Court may not regard its power to re-sentence as enlivened. The answer to that question may depend on whether a just result has been achieved overall in the sentence appealed from. 
     
      
    56 In my opinion the sentence imposed by his Honour was appropriate. I am of the view that no less severe sentence is warranted in law: Criminal Appeal Act s 6(3).

    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused were indicted that between about 1 January 2001 and 6 August 2001 they conspired between themselves and other persons to import a commercial quantity of cocaine. There were three named persons with whom the accused are alleged to have conspired, being Jaimie Giraldo Rincon, Govert van Bommel and Wouter van Bommel. I will refer to these persons as the Colombians. The Crown alleges that the Colombians and a fourth person, Adolfo Zapata, all entered the conspiracy in Colombia and were participants throughout the period alleged in the indictment until the Colombians were arrested in early August 2001. Zapata was permitted to leave Australia shortly before those arrests were made. 
     
      
    2 The Crown case is that two of the Colombians, that is Rincon and Govert van Bommel, left Panama in a yacht, The Flaning, with 120 kilograms of what they believed to be cocaine. The third person on the boat was Zapata, who on the Crown case was in charge of the delivery of cocaine from Panama to persons in Australia. The third named person, Wouter van Bommel, travelled to Australia by air and was to help organise persons in this State to meet The Flaning off the coast of New South Wales and transfer the drug to another boat for transportation to shore. The Crown case is that The Flaning was to arrive at an area in international waters off Port Macquarie where it was to be met by Lawrence and Wouter van Bommel in a rigid inflatable boat purchased by Lawrence for that purpose. This rendezvous was to occur some time after 19 June 2001. 
     
      
    3 The Crown alleges that the accused Cornwell, Diez, Lawrence, Bolus, Brokenshire, McDougall and Norris, whom I shall call the New South Wales participants, were all involved in the conspiracy up until this point in time. It is not necessary for present purposes to indicate the roles, which the Crown alleges, were played by each of those persons in the conspiracy up until that date. However, on 19 June NCA agents and police intervened and arrested Lawrence, Norris and Wouter van Bommel in the belief that they had travelled to meet The Flaning and had received the drugs from it. There is no evidence of the involvement of any of the New South Wales participants in the conspiracy thereafter except for some evidence that might suggest that the accused Lawrence was still interested in the importation. 
     
      
    4 Shortly after 19 June the persons on The Flaning learned that the situation was not suitable for their arrival in Australia as planned. On one view of the evidence, Zapata was told by some person in authority in Colombia to dump the drugs into the sea. The Crown asserts that the better view of the evidence is that Zapata was informed that it was for him to decide what course should be adopted, and he determined not to jettison the drugs but to attempt to complete the importation. The Crown case is that to this end The Flaning travelled to a location called Kelso Bank, about three hundred miles off the coast of Queensland, where the drugs were placed by the crew in containers and sunk on to the shelf, which was only 20 metres below the surface. On the Crown case the crew hoped that, after they reached Southport, Zapata could organise the recovery of the drugs to be taken into Australia and hence they could be paid what they were owed for their part in the venture. 
     
      
    5 According to the Crown case this is what occurred and Zapata made contact with persons who were in control of the importation and indicated to them what course he had adopted. Eventually the accused Francis and Dicecco became involved through the agency of a person in Manila in an attempt to recover the drugs. These persons I shall refer to as the Victorian participants. Francis met with Zapata and Rincon in Sydney where he received charts, a GPS, and information to assist him in finding Kelso Bank and to recover the drugs. Wouter van Bommel was once more recruited to assist in this task. He travelled to the north of this State with Francis and they there met up with Dicecco, who had brought a boat with him from Victoria. Dicecco and Wouter left Coffs Harbour in the boat to travel to Kelso Bank but made it no further than Byron Bay where they called off the venture as the boat proved inadequate for the task. Shortly after their return to Coffs Harbour they, the Colombians and the New South Wales participants, were arrested. 
     
      
    6 At the end of the Crown case a submission was made that I should direct verdicts of acquittal in respect of each accused on the basis that the evidence in the Crown case gave rise to two conspiracies rather than the one conspiracy alleged in the indictment. A submission was made that after 19 June the alleged conspiracy involving the New South Wales participants, the three Colombians and Zapata, had come to an end and a new conspiracy involving the three Colombians, the Victorian participants and Zapata commenced. The argument was that as the evidence in support of the charge gave rise to two different conspiracies, none of the accused could be convicted on the counts in the indictment. 
     
      
    7 I rejected that submission. It was my opinion that, provided the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crew of The Flaning had not jettisoned the drug but had proceeded to Kelso Bank intending to complete the importation into Australia, there was a single conspiracy to import the cocaine from The Flaning revealed by the evidence in the Crown case. It was my tentative view that it was not open to the jury to conclude that there was any other conspiracy arising from the evidence. However, it was not necessary to determine that issue in deciding the fate of the application for verdicts by direction. 
     
      
    8 The evidence has now been completed and addresses will shortly commence. The issue has now been raised again, not in order to seek directed verdicts, although defence counsel do not accept that I was correct in the view that I formed, but rather for me to indicate how I will direct the jury on the question of the consequence of a finding by them that they are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the drug was placed on Kelso Bank for importation into Australia. Such a possibility might arise either because there is a reasonable possibility the drugs were dumped at sea, or because there is a reasonable possibility that they were imported into Australia by The Flaning's crew. 
     
      
    9 There may be other inferences arising from the evidence that the jury will have to consider in determining whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs were placed on Kelso Bank for importation into Australia. There is precious little, if any, evidence that the cocaine was not placed on Kelso Bank, as Govert and Rincon said it was. But defence counsel intend to submit to the jury that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the account of the Colombians in this and in other respects, such was their lack of credibility. On that basis I am prepared to leave it open to the jury to conclude that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs were placed on Kelso Bank for importation into Australia, notwithstanding what appears to me to be strong evidence that The Flaning did in fact go there. So strong is that evidence that the only suggestion that was made to the members of the crew who gave evidence, that is Rincon and Govert, during cross-examination of them by the nine defence counsel, was that they did in fact visit that spot but left no drugs there. There has on this and other matters been, in my view, somewhat disconcerting reticence by most counsel to squarely and fairly put matters to witnesses that are apparently going to be the subject of address. 
     
      
    10 Be that as it may, the issue will be left to the jury and the question then arises as to what is the consequence if the jury are left with a reasonable doubt as to whether the drugs were placed on Kelso Bank for importation into Australia. The submission made on behalf of the New South Wales participants is that all accused should be acquitted because there would be the reasonable possibility of two different conspiracies arising on the evidence and encompassed by the charge, that is one before 19 June and one after that date. The submission is that unless the jury can be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a meeting of minds by all the conspirators, or as was put to me today by Mr Hogan, that there was an awareness by all the conspirators of the existence of the role being played by others in the conspiracy, the Crown case cannot succeed on the basis of the conspiracy alleged in the indictment. Those appearing for the Victorian participants, that is Mr Cooley and Mr Hogan, submit that at least their clients should be acquitted because they would not be party to the conspiracy alleged in the indictment. 
     
      
    11 It was submitted on behalf of Francis and Dicecco that the jury should be directed that there could be further possibilities open on the evidence relating to Kelso Bank. When police and NCA agents went to that location on 6 August after the arrest of the accused there was no sign of the drugs or the containers in which the crew of The Flaning allegedly placed them. It is suggested that one inference open is that Zapata arranged independently for some other persons to retrieve them despite the apparent evidence that he had contacted his superiors to notify them that they were there. In all of the conversations recorded after the crew arrived in Australia there does not seem to me to be any firm inference that Zapata did not believe that at the time he was dealing with Francis that the drugs were on Kelso Bank. 
     
      
    12 In my view it is not a matter of available inference open to the jury but simply idle speculation that some other person retrieved the drugs at Zapata's instigation. It seems to be no more open on the evidence than the possibility that the drugs were taken off the bank by natural forces. One could possibly speculate about other explanations for the disappearance of the drugs at some time before 6 August if in fact The Flaning's crew had placed them there. It is at least equally open that some other person who was acting as a participant in the conspiracy recovered the drugs after the failed attempt by Dicecco. However, it will ultimately be a matter for the jury as to what reasonable inferences are open on the evidence before them and what the meaning of those inferences will be to the conspiracy alleged by the Crown. 
     
      
    13 I am prepared to accept for present purposes that, if on a trial for a charge of conspiracy, the evidence before the jury indicates a reasonable possibility that more than one conspiracy arises and that both conspiracies could be included within the terms of the count in the indictment, that the jury should acquit all the accused. This is referred to in Canadian cases as the defence of multiple conspiracies, see for example R v Bengert (No 5) (1980) 53 CCC (2d) 481. In effect such a finding would be that that jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were all party to the single conspiracy charged in the indictment and so could not be found to have conspired with one another to commit that offence. Because each conspiracy came within the scope of the offence charged the jury could not say which conspiracy was being alleged by the Crown. 
     
      
    14 Before me the argument is that, if the jury concluded that there were two conspiracies revealed in the evidence, one occurring before 19 June and one after that date, all accused must be acquitted in accordance with what has been decided in cases like Bengert. It is argued that, although all accused might have been found beyond reasonable doubt to have been guilty of the two conspiracies revealed by the evidence, the jury could not determine to which of the two conspiracies the charge related. The jury could not determine whether in this case the charge related to the conspiracy involving the New South Wales participants or the Victorian participants. The argument is that this issue could not be decided simply by reason of the fact that the former group were participants in a conspiracy at an earlier time than the latter group. 
     
      
    15 Initially I was attracted to this argument and had indicated a preliminary view that I would direct the jury that if they were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs were placed in Kelso Bank for later importation, the jury should acquit all accused. However, I have finally determined, not without some considerable thought about the matter and some very helpful submissions made by all counsel in this matter, that this is not the correct approach to take in this particular case. I have in fact been confirmed in that view by the decision of Bengert. That case seems to me to be an example of a problem that arises when the Crown elects to frame a conspiracy in general terms extending over a lengthy period and involving a number of persons, each acting in an agreement with themselves in the wider conspiracy alleged. Similar considerations arose in R v Greenfield [1973] 1 WLR 1151, Saffron v The Queen (1988) 17 NSWLR 395 and Caratti v The Queen (2000) 22 WAR 527. 
     
      
    16 In Bengert the conspiracy charged was the importation of drugs over a period of two years. The evidence revealed that within the general agreement to import drugs there existed a number of subsidiary agreements each involving the importation of drugs by using a different stratagem. The question ultimately left to the jury was whether the evidence revealed a single conspiracy as alleged in the charge or the smaller discrete conspiracies each involving an agreement to import the drugs in a particular way. The jury convicted all accused and it was held that there was no error in the way the issue was left to the jury. 
     
      
    17 As I have already indicated the count before me alleges that the accused conspired between themselves, with the Columbians and other unnamed persons. Those persons include Zapata, a person in the Philippines, who on the Crown case recruited Francis and Dicecco, and sundry other persons in Columbia and Panama who were either principals or instrumental in the proposed importation. The Crown case is that all accused were participants in a conspiracy to import the drug arriving from Columbia on The Flaning. The conspiracy alleged necessarily involved the Columbians and they are named on the indictment. Apparently the particulars furnished by the Crown asserted this to be the fact and that is how the Crown opened the case to the jury. The Columbians gave evidence to that effect. It may be the case that another essential person in the conspiracy alleged by the Crown was Zapata, but the resolution of that question does not seem to me to advance the argument in the present case. 
     
      
    18 Of course it is not asserted that each and every accused actually came to an agreement with the Columbians that the drug on The Flaning should be imported into Australia. But that is, in my view, irrelevant to the proof of the charge, generally or in respect of any particular accused. The Crown case is that the Columbians remained participants in that conspiracy until their arrest. They were participants when, on the Crown case, each of the accused participated in the conspiracy no matter when it was that a particular accused entered into the enterprise to import the drugs. Each accused conspired with the Columbians named in the indictment either directly, as in the case of Diez and Francis, or indirectly, as in the case of Bolus and McDougall. In some cases the Crown case is that the accused conspired with Wouter van Bommel as well as with one or more co-accused. 
     
      
    19 Thus the Columbians are central to the allegation contained in the charge in the indictment. The Crown allegation is based upon an acceptance by the jury that the Columbians were members of a conspiracy to import cocaine into Australia and, if the jury were left in any doubt about that matter, notwithstanding that such a proposition was never put to any of the witnesses, the accused would all be acquitted. However, in my view if the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Columbians were participants in such a conspiracy and if the jury are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crew of The Flaning placed the drugs on Kelso Bank intending that it be imported into Australia, then there is but one conspiracy arising on the facts of the Crown case and this is the one alleged in the indictment. 
     
      
    20 However, if there is a reasonable possibility that the crew of The Flaning did not leave the cocaine on Kelso Bank for importation into Australia, it follows that there is a reasonable possibility that, when the Victorian participants came onto the scene, the Columbians were no longer conspiring to import cocaine. This is because there is a reasonable possibility either that they jettisoned the drug and thus frustrated the original conspiracy, or that they actually imported the drug themselves, in which case the conspiracy had been completed. On either scenario, when the crew arrived in Southport and led others to erroneously believe that the drugs were at Kelso Bank, any agreement that they thereafter entered with any persons could not have been for the importation of drugs. It was a scam of some sort and designed to obtain money on the basis of holding out that the drugs were in existence on the ocean floor when they were not. At that stage there were no drugs to import and the Columbians knew that to be the case. 
     
      
    21 Although it may be that on the Crown case the Victorian participants believed that there were 120 kilograms of cocaine from The Flaning on Kelso Bank and intended to recover and import it, any conspiracy to do so could not involve the Columbians. Any charge alleging that Francis and Dicecco either between themselves or with others conspired to import the cocaine from The Flaning after 19 June 2001 could not allege that the Columbians were participants in that conspiracy. They were not. If the drug had either been thrown away or imported by the time the Victorians came onto the scene, then it follows that the Columbians never intended that an agreement to import drugs would be carried through. It was impossible for them to do it. 
     
      
    22 It may be the case that Francis and Dicecco could conspire between themselves or with other persons to import drugs even though those drugs did not the exist, see R v El Azzi [2001] NSWCCA 397. But the evidence in this matter could not lead to a finding that the conspiracy entered into by Francis and Dicecco with the Columbians was a conspiracy that was impossible to perform, that is that it was a conspiracy falling within the class of cases where the conspiracy would not be an illegal one. In my view the law now is such that arguably the only basis upon which an argument such as found favour in Nock v DPP [1978] AC 979 would be available is if the conspiracy agreed to by the participants in the conspiracy was to do an act which in fact was not illegal. If the act agreed to and intended to be performed was in fact an illegal act, it does not matter that the act could not be completed for some reason unbeknown to persons entering into that agreement. However, I do not have to determine what is the present state of the law in relation to a conspiracy to do the impossible. In my view there is no factual situation that can arise in the present case which would permit such an argument to be raised with the jury. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion on the assumption that it is open to the jury to conclude that the conspiracy involving the New South Wales participants concluded sometime about 19 June either by reason of the fact that the crew either jettisoned the drugs or imported them, any conspiracy thereafter is not a conspiracy falling within the scope of the indictment. The Columbians were not thereafter participants in the conspiracy alleged and, therefore, Dicecco and Francis should be acquitted. However, there does not seem to me to be any legal difference between a finding that the New South Wales participants were not members of the conspiracy after 19 June and a finding that any of the accused might not have been members of the conspiracy at that date because they had completed the task assigned to them and no longer wished to participate in it. I do not believe that there is any basis upon which the jury can acquit any of the New South Wales participants simply because the conspiracy in which they were involved may have concluded on or about 19 June and did not involve Francis or Dicecco. 
     
      
    24 I should add that during argument I was asked to reconsider the decision I had reached that it was not open to the jury to find that another conspiracy arose on 19 June even though they found that the drugs were retained by the crew of The Flaning and placed at Kelso Bank for importation into Australia. In the course of that submission I was referred to the decision of Caratti v The Queen and most recently the decision of Regina v Griffiths [1966] 1 QB 589. I do not find that the statements of principal recited in either of those cases or the factual circumstances there considered bear on the present facts. I am unpersuaded that I am wrong in the view I have expressed and I intend to direct the jury accordingly.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MEAGHER JA: I ask Barr J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: The applicant Sidney Son Kim seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. He pleaded guilty to the following charges: 
     
      
       
      1. On 1 October 2001 at Campsie he broke and entered the dwelling house of Li Ping Liu, Ying Li, Yun Zhou and Yu Juan Liang and committed a serious indictable offence therein, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Yu Juan Liang and at the time of breaking and entering was armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a long-barrelled firearm; 
       
       
      2. At the same time and place, when armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a long-barrelled firearm, he robbed Yu Juan Liang of property, namely a mobile telephone and a quantity of jewellery. 
       
      
    3 The applicant requested the sentencing judge to take into account the following offences, namely - 
     
      
       
      1. At the same time and place, when armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a long-barrelled firearm, he robbed Yun Zhou of certain property; and 
       
       
      2. At the same time and place and in the same circumstances he robbed Li Ping Liu of certain property. 
       
      
    4 On 30 August 2002 Woods QC DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for twelve years for each offence, both sentences to run concurrently, and fixed a non-parole period of eight years. His Honour took into account one of the scheduled offences in imposing each sentence. 
     
      
    5 About a month before 1 October 2001 the applicant was invited to take part in the breaking and entering of premises at Campsie. He knew that he would be carrying out the operation in the company of another young man and that they would be armed with a firearm and a knife. He did not know any of the persons to be held up and robbed but he knew that the person who wanted the job done had a grudge against a woman, one of the intended victims. He knew that she was to be assaulted. He accepted the offer immediately upon a promise of payment of $1,000. 
     
      
    6 The premises concerned was a rooming house where several families or individuals lived. The applicant and his co-offender went there in the daylight to have a look at the premises. They decided it was then too busy and that they had better do their job at night. They selected dark clothing to wear, including beanies by which they disguised their faces. They equipped themselves with a .22 rifle and a long kitchen or butcher’s knife. The applicant at all times held the rifle. It contained no firing mechanism. 
     
      
    7 The applicant and his companion entered the house at 8:20 pm and confronted four adults and the five year old daughter of one of them. The applicant was armed with the rifle and his companion with the knife. They ordered the occupants not to move and told them that they were the police. They said that they were looking for a woman who lived at the address. They did not name her but described a vehicle that they said she drove. Those present denied knowing such a woman, though it appears that the woman the offenders were inquiring about may previously have lived at the house. They ordered the occupants to surrender their mobile telephones and wallets. That was done. They forced one of the occupants, Mr Zhou, to write down the personal identification number of his credit card. The applicant stood guard over those present while his accomplice moved throughout the rest of the house, checking each room. When that man returned he picked out Miss Liang, perhaps believing her to be the woman about whom they had been told. He took her into another room while the applicant stood guard over the other occupants. He pushed her onto a bed, ordered her to remove her clothing and, when she refused, slashed her outer and undergarments. He cut her chest with the knife. He tied her wrists with cable ties. He stole her necklace and bracelet. 
     
      
    8 Between them the applicant and his companion stole the jewellery I have mentioned, mobile telephones, credit cards, money, a DVD player and a ring. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was first linked to the attacks when he used one of the stolen mobile telephones. Police arrested him, took him to the police station and interviewed him. He told the police the name and mobile telephone number of his co-offender and of the commissioner of the offence. 
     
      
    10 The applicant was nineteen years and three months of age at the time of the offences. He was born in Australia. His upbringing was unremarkable and he was in good health. Before leaving school in October 2000 he committed an offence on another student. He disingenuously described the offence to a psychiatrist, Dr Benjamin, who provided a report for the sentencing judge on behalf of the defence, as an assault. In fact it was demanding property with menaces with intent to steal. A magistrate took a very serious view of this, the appellant’s first offence, and ordered him to perform two hundred hours’ community service. The appellant was subject to that sentence when he committed the offences the subject of this appeal. 
     
      
    11 The first ground of appeal complains that his Honour failed to take into account the applicant’s co-operation and assistance to the police. Notwithstanding that he named his co-offender and principal, it is submitted, the sentencing judge failed to give weight to those matters. 
     
      
    12 It is not surprising that his Honour did not mention the assistance pointed to. Although the solicitor who appeared for the Crown on sentence appeared to agree that the co-offender and the principal had been correctly named, there was no suggestion that anyone had been charged in relation to these matters. All his Honour was told was that the co-offender had been charged over an unrelated matter and there was no suggestion that the applicant was in any way responsible for telling the police about that. Furthermore, the statement of facts put before the sentencing judge and not challenged by the defence stated that enquiries were continuing into the identity of the accomplice and the principal. 
     
      
    13 His Honour gave judgment ex tempore. He acknowledged the plea of guilty, which he took to be evidence of remorse, and made express allowance for it. It must have seemed probable to his Honour that the assistance the applicant was giving to the police was of limited value and was properly to be seen as no more than a working-out of the confession of guilt. In my opinion that was a legitimate way of making a modest allowance to which the applicant was entitled by reason of the information given. 
     
      
    14 It is submitted that his Honour erred in making no finding as to the extent of the applicant’s assistance, but I would reject that submission. It would not have been possible on the material before his Honour to make any assessment beyond what was set out in the statement of facts. 
     
      
    15 The next ground of appeal is that the length of the sentences itself implies error. His Honour said that but for the plea of guilty he would have sentenced the applicant to fifteen years’ imprisonment. The submission is that that starting point was too high. Reference has been made to Judicial Commission statistics for offences pursuant to ss 112 and 97 Crimes Act 1900, the two sections under which these charges were laid. Each offence attracted a maximum sentence of twenty-five years’ imprisonment. Reference has also been made to individual cases. 
     
      
    16 The Court has pointed on a number of occasions to the difficulty of gauging the appropriateness or inappropriateness of one sentence by reference to the facts and sentence of another case. There is a well-known difficulty, too, on literal reliance on sentence statistics, especially in appeals against sentences for multiple offences and where other criminality has been taken into account. I do not think it necessary to repeat the considerable detail of the very helpful submissions made in this regard but merely observe that in none of the cases cited in particular or, so far as I can tell in the cases included in the statistical material, have the relevant sentences been imposed for two offences committed during the period of a sentence for demanding property with menaces 
     
      
    17 It seems to me that these offences were very serious ones of their kind. First, the applicant was a man who had no interest in the grudge between the principal and the intended victim but hired out his services for money. Offences accompanied by such a degree of callousness are often reckoned to fall into the worst category of cases or a category close to it. The applicant had experience in standing over people. The offences had seriously aggravating features. They were carried out in company and with the use of weapons. Actual injury was inflicted. The victim impact statement of the unfortunate woman who was wounded showed that ever since the attack she had had difficulty sleeping, suffered irregular periods, had borne for six months the marks left on her wrists by the cable ties with which she had been trussed up and underwent depression and frequent panic attacks. 
     
      
    18 The offences were committed at night and involved the invasion of a private home when it was intended the occupants should be present. They were well planned, with the selection of disguise and the wearing of rubber gloves which would make the offenders difficult to identify. 
     
      
    19 In my view the sentencing judge was well justified in describing the circumstances of the offences as a matrix of horror calling for severe condemnation. In my view the selection of a starting point of fifteen years, given the leniency involved in making the sentences concurrent, was within the range of his Honour’s proper sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    20 I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    21 MEAGHER JA: I agree. 
     
      
    22 DOWD J: I also agree. 
     
      
    23 MEAGHER JA: The orders of the Court will therefore be the orders proposed by Barr J.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 14 August 2002, I delivered judgment on the claim for principal relief in the proceedings and for the reasons given in that judgment, ordered that the conviction of the plaintiff and the sentence passed upon him be quashed. This judgment should be read in conjunction with that. 
     
      
    2 The appropriate further order to be made in consequence of that decision remained the subject of argument. The outstanding matter came before me for hearing on 15 May 2003 following the parties filing extensive written submissions. 
     
      
    3 It was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that I should enter a verdict of acquittal or dismiss the information and on the part of the defendant, that the matter should be remitted to the original magistrate to re-hear. 
     
      
    4 To determine what course should now be taken, it is necessary that I have regard to the nature of the proceedings as they were before me and as they were before the magistrate. Although I have dealt with those matters in my previous judgment, it is necessary I refer shortly to the context. 
     
      
    5 The proceedings before me were brought by way of an appeal to the Supreme Court under Part 5 of the Justices Act 1902 from the determination of a magistrate in the Local Court convicting the plaintiff of an offence of aggravated indecent assault. That offence is an offence under s.61M(i) of the Crimes Act 1900 capable of being dealt with on indictment and when dealt with on indictment is punishable by a maximum sentence of imprisonment for seven years. 
     
      
    6 Since it is an indictable offence, there is no statutory or legal bar to the informant laying a fresh information and proceeding to the prosecution of the matter anew, the conviction having been quashed, unless an order having the effect of an acquittal or a dismissal of the information upon its merits occurs, even in the absence of my making an order remitting the proceedings. 
     
      
    7 It is that consideration which underlies the submission of the plaintiff that an acquittal or its equivalent, a dismissal of the information (which order is applicable to matters dealt with summarily in the Local Court) should be entered. 
     
      
    8 The appellant succeeded before me on the basis that the learned magistrate had erred in law in taking an approach to the consideration of the evidence at the hearing which was contrary to that approach the High Court had held in Robinson v. The Queen (1988-89) 180 CLR 531 was necessary. I held that the magistrate had inverted the onus of proof contrary to that provided for by s.141(1) of the Evidence Act 1995. In addition, I held, that the magistrate had erred in reasoning upon a basis that attributed to the plaintiff’s daughter and the defendant a high motivation to lie said to have arisen from his and her awareness of the consequences of a finding of his guilt. 
     
      
    9 I did not determine that there was no or insufficient evidence to support the conviction. 
     
      
    10 Section 109 of the Justices Act 1902 provides the powers that I might exercise sitting as the court in determining the appeal. Section 109 is as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Supreme Court may, after hearing an appeal, determine the appeal by dismissing the appeal or by doing any one or more of the following:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) confirming, quashing, setting aside or varying the conviction, order or sentence appealed against or any part of it, 
        
       
       
        
        (b) increasing or reducing the sentence appealed against, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) making such other orders as it things just, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) remitting the matter to the magistrate who made the conviction or order, or imposed the sentence, to hear and determine the matter of the appeal.” 
        
       
      
    11 It becomes necessary to consider whether s.109(a) or s.109(c) is so wide as to permit in the circumstances that I will refer to shortly, the making of the order sought by the plaintiff or whether the matter as sought by the defendant should be remitted in accordance with s.109(a). 
     
      
    12 In that regard, I turn at this point to consider whether, if a remitter is to be ordered, s.109(d) requires the matter to be remitted to the magistrate who made the conviction. On its face and considered on its own, it does so. However, s.114 provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        If the Supreme Court remits a matter to a magistrate under this Part and the magistrate who made the original conviction or order, or imposed the original sentence, has ceased to hold office as a magistrate or is for any other reason unable to continue to hear and determine the remitted matter, the matter is to be dealt with by another magistrate nominated by the chief magistrate.” 
        
       
      
    13 It is clear that s.114 is sufficiently wide as to embrace the circumstance in which a magistrate is unable to continue to hear and determine the matter as the magistrate has already made findings which have to be set aside, as this magistrate has, such that the magistrate would be unable to come to the case without a reasonable observer concluding the magistrate had pre-judged the questions of fact it was necessary to determine. In Noble v. DPP & Ors (2000) 118 A. Crim. R. 305, Smart, AJ. concluded, in similar circumstances, that a matter required re-hearing before a different magistrate and posed the relevant test as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
         “On the basis that both the appellant and fair minded members of the public might reasonably apprehend or suspect that the magistrate had pre-judged or might pre-judge the case, given that: the magistrate had already found the offence proved; such finding entails the acceptance of the evidence of the main Crown witness to a high degree and proof of each of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt; …” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour referred to the decision of the High Court in Webb v. Hay (1994) 181 CLR 41. 
     
      
    15 In Downes v. DPP [2000] NSWSC 1054, Studdert, J. declined to make an order remitting the matter for hearing before another magistrate holding that the matter should be returned to the magistrate before whom it had originally come to as “it has not been suggested that the magistrate from whose decision this appeal has been brought … is for any reason unable to continue to hear and determine these matters upon their being remitted”. Contrary to the submission of the respondent, I see nothing in that decision which cuts down the effect of what was referred to by Smart, AJ. in Noble (supra). 
     
      
    16 However, upon my reading of s.109(d) and s.114 of the Justices Act 1902, I am unable to accept the approach of Smart, AJ. which it seems to me elides impermissibly the interaction of the two sections. Section 109(d) leaves no option but to remit the matter, should it be remitted, to the magistrate “who made the original conviction”, although it would seem appropriate that, to avoid the ill to which Smart, AJ.’s judgment in Noble (supra) is directed, that the remitter be accompanied by an order under s.109(c) ordering that magistrate not to hear, re-hear or continue hearing the remitted matter as being unable to continue for the legal reasons given by Smart, AJ. Such an order would have the effect of triggering s.114 to enable the Chief Magistrate to designate another magistrate to hear the remitted matter. Such hearing would be by way of a re-hearing, of necessity. 
     
      
    17 Although it was submitted on behalf of the defendant that s.109(d) envisaged only a remitter to the magistrate who made the conviction and that it only envisaged that the magistrate would continue to hear the matter, it is apparent that the errors of law to which s.104 is addressed might well have so pervaded the entire hearing of a matter as to require that matter to start anew and before another magistrate. This, in my view, should the matter be remitted, is one of those cases, and, indeed, it is for that reason, in particular, that I would be of the view that, were the matter to be remitted, it would require re-hearing before a new magistrate. 
     
      
    18 I do not accept the submissions of the defendant that s.109(d) should be construed so narrowly. There is nothing in the legislative history of the section or its predecessors to warrant such a course. 
     
      
    19 Although the submissions referred to the Parliamentary debates and to various extraneous materials, there is nothing to which my attention has been drawn that assists that submission. Nor is there anything by way of prior authority, directly applicable, nor in the legislative history or the debates or in the extraneous material, which assists on the question of whether an acquittal might be ordered. 
     
      
    20 With that in mind, I return to the plaintiff’s submission that an order of acquittal or the like should be made, in lieu of remitting the matter. It was submitted that the power of the court to make “such other order(s) as it thinks just” (s.109(c)) was wide enough to permit of such an order. It was further submitted that the circumstances warranted the making of such an order in the proper exercise of a discretion conferred by that section. It was submitted that in that context the court should adopt an approach analogous to the jurisprudence applied by the Courts of Criminal Appeal in respect of the common form Criminal Appeal Statutes in consequence of the finding of a miscarriage of justice where those statutes grant power to the court to order a new trial. 
     
      
    21 I was referred to the judgment of Kirby, J. in Dyers v. The Queen [2002] HCA 45:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The view has sometimes been expressed in this court that, following a finding of a material misdirection of law there is only one order that may be made, namely the order quashing the original conviction and providing for a new trial. However, that opinion is incompatible with the sources of this court’s powers, its character as a court, and with the practice of the court in particular cases, some of which I have mentioned. 
        
       
       
        
        An order for a re-trial must be sustained, in the particular case, by the applicable facts and law and by a judicial consideration of justice. If an order for re-trial may be withheld because it would permit the prosecution to present a different case, it may be withheld in other circumstances where justice equally requires that course. In disposing of an appeal such as this, this court is not confined to correcting errors of law. More than 80 years ago, in  
        Hargan v. The King 
        , Isaacs, J. pointed out that the ‘greatest innovation’ made by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) was to permit scrutiny of criminal convictions by a broader standard than ‘error in strict law’. This is not, therefore, a case analogous to appellate correction confined to error of law alone. The court has the whole matter before it. It has large powers under the Constitution and the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) that include the ordering of a new trial, where the discretionary considerations suggest that that be done. 
        
       
       
        
        Where an appellate court has not accepted an argument that a verdict is unreasonable, but has found a material error of law, the proper order is normally to provide for a re-trial. Where the prosecutor’s discretion is exercised in favour of a re-trial, such an order permits a verdict to be taken from a jury accepted as representing the community. This is why, normally, it is left to the Director of Public Prosecutions to evaluate the competing considerations for and against a re-trial. 
        
       
       
        
        This said, an order for a new trial remains ‘within limits, a discretionary remedy’. It is no less so in criminal appeals, although the considerations of the public interest involved in criminal proceedings are somewhat different to those in civil cases. It is a judicial act and therefore not an automatic or unthinking one.” 
        
       
      
    22 Those remarks have to be understood in the context of the powers of the High Court under the Constitution and the Judiciary Act 1902 (Cth) and the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Statutes to which I have referred. 
     
      
    23 In New South Wales, the relevant provision is s.8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.” 
        
       
      
    24 A considerable jurisprudence has arisen concerning the application of that provision. It is clear that it confers upon the court the wide discretion to which Kirby, J. refers. It is clear that where there is insufficient evidence at the original trial, there should be no order for a re-trial: King v. The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423. Nor should there be a new trial if the accused would be tried on a case which is substantially different or of which he had been substantially acquitted at the previous trial: Regina v. Wilkes (1948) 77 CLR 511; Parker v. The Queen (1997) 186 CLR 494. 
     
      
    25 The extent of the discretion was emphasised and the criteria on which it should be exercised examined in DPP (Nauru) v. Fowler (1984) 154 CLR 627. 
     
      
    26 The section specifically requires the court, before determining there should be a new trial, to consider the nature of the miscarriage of justice detected and to consider it in the context of all the relevant circumstances that might speak for or against a new trial. The essential issue turns on whether that miscarriage can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order. The section casts an onus on the prosecution to persuade the court to make such an order as otherwise s.6(2) would require an acquittal to be entered. These provisions are markedly different from those in Part 5 of the Justices Act 1902. The current state of authority on the application of s.8(1) indicates that in ordinary circumstances, having regard to the public interest in indictable matters being determined by the tribunal of fact, be it judge, magistrate or jury, to which the trial of the issues of fact in such matters has been confided by the legislature, there should be a re-trial: Regina v. Ward (1981) A. Crim. R. 171. 
     
      
    27 Although s.109(c) is in terms which do not reflect s.8 of the Criminal Appeal Act, it is apparent that those terms are very wide and, indeed, appear to me wider in ambit than the provision of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 although the policy considerations applicable to the application of s.8(1) might apply to the application of s.109(c). 
     
      
    28 But the two sections are different in nature, since the concept underlying s.8(1) and s6(2) favours an order of acquittal unless a new trial is a more adequate remedy, and that concept does not inform or underlie the construction of the Justices Act 1902 provisions. For these reasons, I am not persuaded that I should take an approach to the application of s.109(c) as I would if applying s.8(1) or s.6(2), although I might apply similarly the same policies. However, I consider it will be useful if I proceed to consider the application to the facts of this case the submitted analogy with those policies in mind. 
     
      
    29 It was submitted before me that the evidence given at the hearing was “not sufficiently cogent to justify a conviction”. It was, however, conceded that there was a sufficiency of evidence for a case to answer, although it was submitted that any conviction resulting from the re-hearing on similar evidence “would be necessarily unreasonable and would necessitate a further appeal to the District Court”. 
     
      
    30 It is not necessary for me to set out in detail what the evidence was. It is apparent that there was evidence which, if considered on the tests appropriate for a no case submission and on the basis of those appropriate to the consideration of whether a verdict found in reliance upon it were to be overturned as incapable of acceptance, would meet those tests. But for my part, I regard the prosecution case, from a reading of the written materials and after having the benefit of the various submissions, as a case that is not at all strong. Indeed, the account of the complainant is one that I find singularly unpersuasive, notwithstanding the fact of the early complaint. 
     
      
    31 The magistrate’s rejection of the defence case and the evidence of the defendant and his daughter was explicable on the basis of the error made as to the onus and standard of proof which I detected and explained in my earlier judgment. In my view, putting aside that error, the defendant’s case, when one takes into account the onus and standard and the evidence given by the defendant and his daughter, including the cross-examination, was quite strong, but not reasonably incapable of rejection, considering the prosecution evidence. In that circumstance, I do not see that the legislature has confided in me, sitting as the Supreme Court of New South Wales under Part 5 of the Justices Act 1902, a power myself to hear and determine the conflict of evidence upon the transcript and counsels’ submissions as might be done by a Court of Criminal Appeal determining whether a conviction is unsafe and unsatisfactory instead of hearing the evidence as a magistrate would. 
     
      
    32 Even in the context of determining whether a matter is unsafe and unsatisfactory, ie., whether a conviction “should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence” (s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act), it is necessary to have regard not only to the fact that the trial tribunal of fact had been entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence but also the fact that that body had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses and thus was in a much better position to evaluate the testimony of those witnesses: see M v. The Queen (1984) 181 CLR 487. In that decision, the High Court also held:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty (at 495).” 
        
       
      
    33 If I were to come to the conclusion that the court of trial acting in accordance with the law, directing itself appropriately, as is required by the general law and the Evidence Act 1995, particularly s.165, and applying the proper standard and onus of proof would be unable to hold that the accused was guilty, then I consider that it would be incumbent upon me to make such other order as the court thinks just and myself to dispose finally of the case. Or, if there was some matter of oppression or some such matter as would warrant a stay of the proceedings, some such order as would have the effect of preventing a re-trial might need to be made. But I do not consider either apply here. 
     
      
    34 Accepting that s.109(c) confides in the court a discretion and assuming that discretion might be so wide as to permit orders as sought to be made in the exercise of discretion, that discretion is to be exercised according to principle and recognising the public interest in the tribunal to which the trial of such issues has been confided determining the facts of such a serious allegation. 
     
      
    35 This is not to say that there are other discretionary considerations that should be taken into account. The plaintiff submitted that there were some 11 such considerations. They are set out in the plaintiff’s further submissions as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The unlikelihood of any re-hearing resulting in a conviction due to the weakness of the prosecution’s case. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The relatively minor nature of the alleged assault being a fleeting touch on the outside of clothing. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The public interest in avoiding the need for children to appear in court a second time and to further undergo the ordeal of cross-examination. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The impact of delay on memory and accuracy of evidence in circumstances where two major witnesses are children, aged 12 and 10 at the time of the alleged offence, and who will this year turn 15 and 13. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The public cost and inconvenience in circumstances of a weak prosecution case. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The private cost of a further hearing which is unlikely to be recovered in a matter which is unlikely to succeed. 
        
       
       
        
        7. There is no issue of the usurping of jury function. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The unfairness in further proceeding with a matter unlikely to be successful which, had it been properly investigated from the outset, would have been unlikely to proceed. 
        
       
       
        
        9. Father Dennis Alan, one of the plaintiff’s witnesses on character, is now deceased. 
        
       
       
        
        10. Whatever the outcome of these proceedings, the allegation will be reviewed by the Department of Eduction and Training and if appropriate evidence were available would result in disciplinary proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        11. It is contrary to a judicial consideration of the interests of justice that this matter should not be finally disposed of in this court.” 
        
       
      
    36 I understand most of the matters to which the plaintiff has referred, although I am unable to understand what is embraced in the matter numbered 11 otherwise than as a general submission that it is open to a judge to exercise a discretion in favour of the plaintiff and that it is contended that the discretion should be so exercised so as to require final disposition in this court. 
     
      
    37 Even recognising that it is submitted that the assault is of a relatively minor nature and the unlikelihood, in my view, of a conviction occurring in the event that the matter were to be re-heard in accordance with the law, I do not consider that the possibility that the matter might be determined against the plaintiff when properly considered to be so negligible as to say, even having regard to the discretionary considerations, that, applying principles analogous to those developed under the jurisprudence as to re-trials applying s.8 of the Criminal Appeal Act, that there should not be a re-trial in this case. 
     
      
    38 However, I take into account in reaching that view the concession by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the Director at a re-hearing would not seek to use s.38 of the Evidence Act in respect of the evidence of the defendant’s daughter, and that the Director is prepared to pay the costs of the plaintiff thrown away by reason of the aborted Local Court proceedings, to be agreed by the parties or assessed by the magistrate who hears the matter after remission. I note also that the Director will pay the costs of the plaintiff of these proceedings. 
     
      
    39 I have come to this view with considerable reluctance because I apprehend there are weighty considerations against the re-hearing of the matter, not the least being the delay since the complaint was laid, occasioned by the aborted hearing and the appeal process and that the case concerns what appears to me, on the material before me, to be a weak prosecution case in respect of a matter said to have arisen by a touch on the outside of clothing. I am concerned also as to the effect of the delay on the consideration of the evidence at trial and, that it will in particular, be necessary for any magistrate, should the matter be re-heard, to have regard to the effect of the decisions of the High Court in such matters as Longman v. The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79; Crampton v. The Queen (2000) 75 ALJR 133 and Doggett v. The Queen (2001) 75 ALJR 1290: see Regina v. WRC [2001] NSWCCA 210. 
     
      
    40 Having regard to all these matters, it is a decision to which the Director might come that no re-trial be sought. That is a matter entirely for the Director. However, in my view, since I am unable to say that a further prosecution, even having regard to the discretionary matters, should not be brought, I would, even applying the s.8(1) test, by analogy allow a new trial. 
     
      
    41 I therefore order that the matter be remitted to the magistrate who made the order and I further order, having regard to the matters to which I have earlier referred, that that magistrate is unable to continue to hear the matter. I order that the defendant pay the plaintiff’s costs of these proceedings and the costs thrown away by reason of the original proceedings before the magistrate having had to be set aside. Those latter costs are to be agreed between the parties. 
     
      
    42 In the event that the matter does not proceed for any reason, I reserve leave to the parties to obtain a costs assessment.

     REGINA v William Benedict O’DRISCOLL 
     
     
      
       
      The Appellant was convicted on two charges of defrauding the Commonwealth and sixteen charges of “structuring” transactions pursuant to s31(1) of the  
      Financial Transaction Reports Act 
       1988 (Cth). That Act imposes reporting obligations on cash dealers in respect of cash transactions involving the transfer of $10,000 or more. Under s31 of that Act, it is an offence to be a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions for the sole or dominant purpose of evading the reporting requirements imposed upon cash dealers. The jury accepted that the Appellant had participated over a number of years in a scheme to defraud the revenue by paying the wages of workers in the construction industry in cash. The structuring charges of which the Appellant was convicted were the result of his cashing multiple cheques for amounts less than $10,000 at the same time. The Appellant appealed against his conviction.

      A. 
       
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Hulme J and Carruthers AJ agreeing) 
       
       
      In order to make out the requirement of two or more non-reportable cash transactions, a tribunal of fact must find an intention on the part of a person to engage in cash transactions in amounts less than the figure identified in the legislation as significant. The same series of events can lead to both a single reportable transaction and a number of non-reportable transactions. [38], [50], [52], [126]

      (per Hulme J, Spigelman CJ and Carruthers AJ agreeing) 
       
       
      The Appellant was not party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions when presenting multiple cheques to be cashed at the same bank on the same day. It is not possible to attribute to the Appellant or the bank officers an intention to engage in a cash transaction with respect to each individual cheque. [49], [50], [122], [133]

      C. 
       
       
      (per Spigelman CJ, Carruthers AJ agreeing) 
       
       
      Evidence of unexplained wealth was admissible in the Crown case in chief on the issue of whether the Appellant was the controller of the scheme. However, as the evidence permitted to be adduced by cross-examination was of low prominence in the trial and the Appellant rejected the opportunity to reopen his evidence in chief, his Honour did not commit an error of law, nor was there a miscarriage of justice.

      His Honour did not err in allowing the Crown to call a case in reply. A combination of the Crown’s reasonable lack of suspicion that evidence would be adduced on the matter on which evidence was led in reply until the defence case and the comparative insignificance of the evidence meant the requisite exceptional circumstances for permitting such a course existed.

     REGINA v William Benedict O’DRISCOLL 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant stood trial before his Honour Judge Blackmore SC and a jury on two charges pursuant to s29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) of defrauding the Commonwealth (Counts 1 and 2) and twenty charges of “structuring” transactions pursuant to s31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (the “FTR Act”) (Counts 3 to 22). A jury returned guilty verdicts with respect to the fraud charges and with respect to sixteen of the twenty structuring charges (Counts 7 to 22).  
     
      
    2 The sentences for Counts 7 to 17 were made concurrent with the sentence for Count 1 in the Indictment. The sentences for Counts 18 to 22 were made concurrent with the sentence for Count 2 in the Indictment. The first ground of appeal before this Court relates only to the offences under the FTR Act. There would be no practical significance for the sentence actually to be served unless an appeal were allowed on sentence. During the course of oral submissions, Ms E Fullerton SC, who appeared for the Appellant, sought to add an appeal against sentence, if Ground 1 were upheld. 
     
      
    3 The second and third grounds of appeal relate to the convictions for defrauding the Commonwealth. They do not concern the structuring counts. 
     
      
       
      Background Facts 
       
      
    4 The conduct of the Appellant, which was accepted to have occurred by the jury beyond reasonable doubt, involved the participation by the Appellant in a scheme to defraud the revenue by the payment of wages to workers in the construction industry in the form of cash.  
     
      
    5 The Commonwealth has sought to protect the revenue, relevantly, by the enactment in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) of a special system, known as the Prescribed Payments System (PPS). Under the PPS employers in the construction industry are required to deduct tax from payments made to workers or contractors either at the top marginal rate or, if the worker was registered under the PPS system, at a rate of 20 percent. These deductions are not required to be made if the contractor has had issued to it a Deduction Variation Certificate from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Such a variation operates to reduce the rate of taxation to be deducted, in some cases to nil. A variation may be made where, for example, the contractor satisfies the ATO that persons would be unlikely to earn sufficient taxable income to warrant a 20 percent withholding.  
     
      
    6 Each of the fraud charges related to the operation by the Appellant of one of two companies, each of which pretended, during the period of one of the two charges, to be a labour hire company. The mechanism for perpetrating the fraud was that employers of workers in the construction industry would pay to the sham labour hire company the gross wages due to workers by way of a lump sum cheque. The operator of each company would then bank the cheque, cash it and pay the workers their wages, or return the funds to the employer for payment to the workers, without deducting tax but after deducting a commission for itself, generally, of seven percent. 
     
      
    7 On the Crown case the scheme was operated in two distinct phases through two different companies. For a period of some two years commencing in 1995 the scheme operated through Star Suppliers Pty Ltd (“Star”). From 1997 the scheme was operated in the name of A-Quip Hire Pty Ltd (“A-Quip”). Count 1 related to the former and Count 2 to the latter. 
     
      
    8 The Crown case was that the Appellant controlled and directed each of these companies. The Appellant’s case during the trial was that his actions were carried out at the request of a man named Patrick Finbarr O’Donovan. That included pretending, at O’Donovan’s suggestion, to be either O’Donovan himself or a John Finbarr O’Neill. 
     
      
    9 The Crown case was that: 
     
      
    · In the case of each company the Appellant had adopted an assumed name – O’Donovan in the case of Star and O’Neill in the case of A-Quip – and opened bank accounts in the companies’ names. 
     
      
    · In each case he had filed a false application with the ATO and was issued with a nil variation certificate for purposes of the PPS. 
     
      
    · In each case cheques were deposited in the bank accounts of the two companies, generally from businesses involved in the building and construction industry. 
     
      
    · The cheques deposited over a period of twenty four months in the case of Star amounted to $13,030,097 and in the case of A-Quip to $3,371,959. 
     
      
    · In each case the funds once cleared were withdrawn from the respective accounts in cash, in sums under $10,000 with the consequence that the bank did not observe the reporting provisions of the FTR Act. 
     
      
    · In each case the Appellant had issued false or blank invoices purporting to represent work carried out by Star or A-Quip on behalf of the business. The invoices were in the dollar amounts received by the Appellant but, because of the nil variation certificate, there was no need for the businesses to remit PPS to the ATO.  
     
      
    · The amount of each cheque usually represented the amount owed by the employer business to its sub-contractors but, on occasions, additional amounts were paid. When that occurred, in effect, the Appellant acted as a cheque cashing service by paying the amounts of the cheque, less a commission, to the owner of the business in cash. On that basis the business obtained the amount on the invoice as a tax deduction but kept the cash received, in effect, tax free. 
     
      
    10 The Crown case established that the specimen signature for the account holders in the name of either O’Donovan or O’Neill was in fact written by the Appellant. Similarly, the signatures on the hundreds of cheques used in the operation of the scheme in the name of either O’Donovan or O’Neill were also generally written by the Appellant. The Appellant did not contest that he had completed, signed and cashed the cheques. He was identified in court by a number of bank officers who had come to know him as a regular customer and as either O’Donovan or O’Neill. The Appellant’s case was that the transactions were implemented at the request of O’Donovan. 
     
      
    11 In the case of most withdrawals, cheques were drawn on the accounts each in an amount less than $10,000, even though there were multiple cheques cashed at the same bank at the same time, or at different banks on the same day. A sample of these transactions were identified to form the twenty “structuring” counts against the Appellant. The Appellant was in fact acquitted of four of the structuring counts but no issue of inconsistency in verdicts has arisen on the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    12 The first ground of appeal is that his Honour erred in failing to find that there was no case to answer with respect to the structuring charges. That application was made with respect to Counts 3 to 22 and is now relevant to Counts 7 to 22. This ground involves the meaning of the word “transactions” in s31(1) of the FTR Act. 
     
      
    13 The FTR Act is directed at regulating the cash economy, which permits both tax evasion and money laundering. Section 4(1) of the Act states that the principal object of the Act is to facilitate the administration and enforcement of taxation laws. Section 4(2) indicates that a further object is to facilitate the administration and enforcement of laws of the Commonwealth other than taxation laws. Furthermore, information collected for purposes identified in ss4(1) and (2) is, pursuant to s4(3), able to be made available to State authorities to facilitate the administration and enforcement of laws of the State. 
     
      
    14 The central operating provision of the Act is an obligation upon a “cash dealer”, relevantly in the present circumstances a bank, involved in a “significant cash transaction” to prepare a report of the transaction and communicate the information in the report to the Director of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. 
     
      
    15 Section 3 of the Act contains definitions. There is no relevant definition of “transaction”. Section 3 does contain the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “’cash transaction’ means a transaction involving the physical transfer of currency from one person to another. 
        
       
       
        
        ‘non-reportable cash transaction’ means a cash transaction: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to which a cash dealer is a party; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that is not a significant cash transaction or is an exempt cash transaction. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        ‘significant cash transaction’ means a cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value.” 
        
       
      
    16 Part V of the Act is concerned with Enforcement. One of its provisions is s31 creating the offence of which the Appellant was convicted. Section 31 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person commits an offence against this section if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person is a party to 2 or more non-reportable cash transactions; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) having regard to: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              (A) The value of the currency involved in each transaction; 
               
              (B) the aggregated value of the transactions; 
               
              (C) the period of time over which the transactions took place; 
               
              (D) the interval of time between any of the transactions; 
               
              (E) the locations at which the transactions took place; and 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) would not give rise to a significant cash transaction; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iv) would give rise to exempt cash transactions. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            … 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person who commits an offence against this section is punishable, upon conviction, by imprisonment for not more than 5 years.” 
        
       
      
    17 The purpose of this section is as set out by Doyle CJ in Question of Law Reserved (No 2 of 1998) (1998) 101 A Crim R 317 at 319: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the Act imposed no controls upon a person engaging in a cash transaction, it would be relatively easy to evade the operation of the Act. All that one would have to do would be to split a transaction up into a number of transactions involving the physical transfer of currency of less than $10,000 in value. It is no doubt, to deal with such evasion that Parliament enacted s 31, …” 
        
       
      
    18 The phrase that falls to be construed in s31 is: “2 or more non-reportable cash transactions”. That terminology of “non-reportable” emphasises that the dominant provision or provisions – of which s31 is a reciprocal – is the creation of the obligation to report. 
     
      
    19 Part 2 of the Act provides for Transaction Reports. It includes in Div 1, provision for Cash Transaction Reports by cash dealers. Section 7 provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Where a cash dealer is a party to a significant cash transaction, the dealer shall, before the end of the reporting period:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) prepare a report of the transaction; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) communicate the information contained in the report to the Director;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          unless:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the transaction is, at the time when it occurs, an exempt transaction; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the transaction is, at the time when it occurs, eligible for exemption and becomes, before the end of the reporting period, an exempt transaction; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) the cash dealer is an approved cash carrier.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The report shall be prepared in the approved form, contain the reportable details of the transaction and be signed by the cash dealer or otherwise authenticated by the cash dealer in a way approved by the Director.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In this section:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘reportable details’, in relation to a transaction, means the details of the transaction that are referred to in Schedule 1.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 Division 3 is a parallel scheme with respect to Reports of International Funds Transfers. Division 2 contains a scheme for Reports of Suspect Transactions. Division 1A is a scheme for reports about Transfers of Currency and Div 1B is a scheme for Cash Transaction Reports by Solicitors. 
     
      
    21 The submissions on this ground of appeal focused, by way of example, on the count in which the Appellant had negotiated seven cheques for an aggregate sum of $56,905, in which each cheque was for less than an amount of $10,000. Ms Fullerton SC directed the Court’s attention to the requirement of s31(1)(a) that there be at least “two or more non-reportable cash transactions”. She submitted that although there were seven separate cheques, there was in fact only one cash transaction and that transaction was “reportable”. The single transaction was reportable under s7 of the Act, not as a “suspect transaction” reportable under s16. 
     
      
    22 Ms Fullerton submitted that s31 would prohibit the conduct of the person who cashes multiple cheques for less than $10,000 at different bank branches on the same day, or at the same branch, but at different times of the day. When such conduct occurs, a single bank officer cannot know that a cash transaction in excess of $10,000 has been made and accordingly cannot prepare a report of the transaction pursuant to s7. The position is otherwise, she submitted, where, as in the present case, a group of cheques, which together add up to more than $10,000 are presented to the same bank teller at the same time. 
     
      
    23 The relevant offence under s31(1) is to be found in the concluding words of s31(1)(b)(ii) and (iii) to the effect that having regard to the identified matters, it would be reasonable to conclude that the “transactions” were conducted in a particular “manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring … that the currency … was transferred in a manner and form that … would not give rise to a significant cash transaction.” 
     
      
    24 One issue before the Court is whether or not an occasion on which multiple cheques are presented on a single occasion is a single “cash transaction”, so that the requirement that there be “2 or more cash transactions” within s31(1)(a) is not satisfied. 
     
      
    25 The Crown submission to this Court, as before his Honour, was that the presentation of each cheque constituted a discreet transaction. It submitted that the word “transaction” should be understood as a “piece of commercial business done”. (See R v Ditfort (1987) 28 A Crim R 392 at 393-395; see also on appeal (1991) 91 ATC 4431 at 4434). That replaces one general term with another. Which, one asks rhetorically, is the relevant “piece of business”? Is it cashing each cheque or the cashing of a series of cheques? 
     
      
    26 The thrust of the Appellant’s submissions are, in substance, directed at the obligation in s7 upon a cash dealer to report a “significant cash transaction”. If, as the Appellant now submits, such a transaction can comprise a series of cheques cashed on a single occasion, then there was an obligation upon the bank to prepare a report of the transaction.  
     
      
    27 The report pursuant to s7 has to contain the “reportable details” identified in Schedule 1 of the Act. I do not find anything in that schedule which assists in determining the construction issue that has now arisen. Suffice it to say that the obligation to report contains a wide range of specific matters, including relevantly the following in clause 6: 
     
      
       
        
        “For any cheque or banker’s draft involved in the transaction: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the name of the drawer of the cheque or banker’s draft; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the name of the payee, the favouree or the beneficiary of the cheque or banker’s draft (if any); and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the name and branch of the financial institution or foreign financial institution on which the cheque or banker’s draft was drawn, and the country in which the branch is located.” 
        
       
      
    28 On one view, the identification of “any cheque” may suggest that a transaction can comprise more than one cheque. Alternatively, the word “any” should be understood in the sense of “if any” so that a specific obligation applies only in a case when a cheque was involved in the relevant transaction. In this regard the details, including those required by clause 6, are equivocal on the issue of construction which has arisen. 
     
      
    29 The word “transaction” is not a term of art. (See Bendir v Anson [1936] 3 All ER 326 at 330.) In a taxation context the word has been applied to a series of steps linked together to “attain a definitive objective”. (Palmer v Commissioner of Taxation [1976] WAR 37 at 41; approved Palmer v Commissioner of State Taxation (WA)  (1976) 136 CLR 406 at 412.) 
     
      
    30 The statutory scheme was considered by this Court in R v Narayanan [2002] NSWCCA 200. In that case a cash dealer was prosecuted for contravention of s31(1) of the FTR Act. The practice of the company was to ask a customer with respect to a transaction involving $10,000 or more whether they wished to have a cash transaction form to be completed under the FTR Act. If they did not wish that to occur then a higher rate of foreign exchange would apply to the transaction. The cash dealer would then split the application for traveller’s cheques into smaller parcels not exceeding $10,000 each. 
     
      
    31 Counsel for the Appellant submitted that there had been no offence committed under s31 on a similar basis to that submitted in the present case. There was not, counsel there submitted, “two or more non-reportable cash transactions” within s31(1). There was in fact only one transaction which was a reportable transaction. 
     
      
    32 Hodgson JA, with whom Barr and Greg James JJ agreed, rejected the submission on the basis that the fact that a series of events may involve a reportable cash transaction did not necessarily mean that those events did not also give rise to a number of other cash transactions which are not reportable (at [52]-[58]). His Honour gave the example at [54] of an individual applying for traveller’s cheques in his own name and three fictitious names. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[54] … In my opinion, these events can be regarded as amounting both to one significant cash transaction, and also as four transactions, none of which is a significant cash transaction. Although the same parties are involved in all four transactions, and only one sum of money is handed over, the parties to the transaction by their conduct manifested an intention that there be four transactions. In those circumstances, in my opinion a characterisation of the events as one transaction is true as a matter of substance, and characterisation of the events as four transactions is also true as a matter of substance; and these two characterisations are not inconsistent.” 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour emphasised the significance of what the parties “intended at the time of their dealings with each other” and concluded that the jury should have been directed in those terms. It was necessary to find that the intention was that there be a number of separate transactions (at [57]). 
     
      
    34 In this Court, both Ms E Fullerton SC and Mr Staehli, who appeared for the Respondent accepted that this reasoning was applicable to this case. Accordingly, the same set of circumstances could have given rise to an obligation to report under s7 on the part of the bank and a contravention of s31 on the part of the Appellant.  
     
      
    35 Ms Fullerton relied on that part of the reasoning of Hodgson JA which emphasised the need to identify the intention of the parties as at the time of the transaction. She conceded that this point had not been taken at the trial and applied for leave under r4. The Crown did not oppose leave being granted.  
     
      
    36 Of particular significance is the reasoning of Hodgson JA, with reference to the facts in Narayanan, when his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[59] … It could be said that, in those circumstances, a finding as to the relevant intention was inevitable. However, the misdirection concerned a point which was well and truly taken at the trial, and it did concern an essential element of the offence with which the appellants were charged. I do not think the direction can be treated as immaterial; so that if the appeal is to be dismissed, it can only be by application of the proviso.” 
        
       
      
    37 The application of the proviso was dealt with by his Honour in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “[78] I consider first the misdirection concerning the requirements for a s. 31(1) offence. In relation to counts 51 and 52 in my opinion the misdirection could not conceivably have made a difference. There was undisputed and overwhelming evidence that both (the customer) and (the cash dealer) intended that there be five parcels of travellers cheques, in different names, for each of which an appropriate part of the totality paid was to be attributed, and thus that there should be five non-reportable transactions (with a view if possible to avoiding there being one significant transaction). The knowing participation of Narayanan 
          
        in this intention and transaction depended on precisely the same evidence as his knowing participation in the writing up of the transactions. Similar comments apply to counts 53 and 54. 
        
       
       
        
        [79] As regards counts 39 and 40, the position is not so clear. A reasonable inference was available that George requested that the dealing be treated by SEF as seven transactions, each below $10,000.00; but the evidence was that US$40,000.00 in cash was handed over in exchange for a total of $64,400.00 and the only evidence that there were seven transactions in fact were the subsequent computer entries. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that a correct direction may not reasonably have led to a different verdict.” 
        
       
       
      In the event the appeal against conviction was allowed with respect to Counts 39 and 40 only.  
       
      
    38 In the absence of any submission to the contrary on the part of either party, this Court will follow its own prior decision. On the basis of the reasoning in Narayanan, some form of intention to engage in “transactions” in amounts less than that identified in the legislation as “significant” must be determined by the tribunal of fact. Furthermore, this Court will proceed on the basis that the same series of events can lead to a conclusion that there was both a single reportable transaction and a number of subsidiary transactions, each of which was not reportable.  
     
      
    39 In order to apply the reasoning of Narayanan to the facts of this case it is necessary to refer in some detail to the evidence relating to the respective counts on which a conviction against the Appellant was recorded. 
     
      
    40 With respect to the counts of which the Appellant was convicted all but one shared the following characteristic. The Appellant obtained monies from two different banks on the same day on the basis of a series of cheques drawn on each of the respective banks. In all cases the total value of the cheques exceeded $10,000 from both banks, but no individual cheque exceeded $10,000. In the one exceptional case the total value of the cheques drawn on one bank did not exceed $10,000 but the total value of the cheques cashed on that day from another bank did exceed $10,000.  
     
      
    41 The original submission of the Appellant was that it could not be said that there was more than one transaction on any day which was not reportable. In all but the exceptional case this was because both sets of transactions with the banks constituted a single transaction each of which was a significant cash transaction. In the exceptional case where one bank did not provide cash in excess of $10,000 there was also no offence because in that regard there were not two non-reportable transactions. There was one non-reportable transaction and one reportable transaction. 
     
      
    42 The transactions under consideration in the present case were numerous, occurring over a long period of time involving a number of different bank officers from a number of different banks. The counts related to a selection of the numerous transactions. It is understandable that the recollection of the bank officers as to the precise modus operandi was not identical although certain broad themes emerged from the evidence.  
     
      
    43 The basic themes were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) The Appellant would telephone the bank in advance nominating a total amount of cash in order to ensure that the bank had enough to give to him. 
         
         
        (ii) The Appellant would also usually specify the denominations he wished, the number of $100 notes, the number of $50 notes, etc. 
         
         
        (iii) Cheques were drawn to the total value he had nominated, on some occasions those cheques were signed in the presence of bank officers. 
         
         
        (iv) The Appellant would also specify that the cash should be bundled together in what the Crown referred to as “sub-bundles” into other amounts, some exceeding $10,000 and some not, which is the form in which he would take the cash from the bank. 
         
         
        (v) In the majority of cases there was clear evidence on the back of each cheque in his own handwriting as to the quantum of these sub-bundles. These related to Counts 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 18. In the case of the other counts the amounts identified in his handwriting on the back of one of the cheques was a break-up of the denominations only and not into any such sub-bundle. In one case where there was no such annotation. 
         
         
        (vi) The sub-bundles, where specified, bore no relationship to the face value of any cheque. 
        
       
      
    44 The overall circumstances, particularly the telephone call in advance of each visit to the bank nominating the total amount of cash that would be required on a particular occasion, establishes on the basis of “undisputed and overwhelming evidence”, to use Hodgson JA’s formulation from par [78] of Narayanan as quoted above, that on each occasion there was a reportable cash transaction, save in the case of the visit to one of the two banks the subject of Count 14. In the case of the other bank, the subject of that count, the total amount did exceed $10,000. 
     
      
    45 I note that no submission was put suggesting that anything turned on the particularisation of the counts when cheques were presented to two different banks on the one day (namely Counts 7, 12, 14, 18, 21 and 22). Nor did anything turn on the peculiarity of Count 14 where only a single cheque was presented on one bank and a dozen cheques presented on another bank on the same day. 
     
      
    46 Since writing the above, I have read the judgment of Hulme J in draft. His Honour concludes that there was not, in any case, more than one cash transaction and distinguishes Narayanan on its facts. 
     
      
    47 I note that the Crown has never relied on the “sub-bundles” as constituting “2 or more cash transactions”. In any event, on a number of occasions, a sub-bundle exceeded $10,000. The Crown case was that each cheque when presented was exchanged for cash and that each such exchange constituted a cash transaction. 
     
      
    48 In Narayanan, the cash flow was, in effect, in reverse. It was the cash dealer who supplied the cheque and received the cash from a customer. Nevertheless, the exchange said to constitute the relevant “transaction” was essentially the same. The issue to be determined in the present case is whether it can be said, as Hodgson JA said in Narayanan at [78], that “an appropriate part of the totality paid was to be attributed” to each parcel of travellers cheques. 
     
      
    49 I agree with Hulme J that that was not the case here. No “part” of the cash was ever “attributed to” an individual cheque. 
     
      
    50 The separate bundles of cash in Narayanan were equivalent to the sub-bundles in the present case, not to the individual cheques. None of the sub-bundles, nor any other aspect of the exchange, turned on the presentation of multiple cheques. No one ever dealt with any of the cheques individually. It cannot be said that each cheque was presented for payment. To apply the definition of “cash transaction” in s3 of the Act, there was never “a transaction involving the physical transfer of currency” in the amount of the face value of any cheque. 
     
      
    51 In Narayanan, similarly, no one dealt with individual travellers cheques. The Court’s reasons focused on each “parcel” of travellers cheques. 
     
      
    52 No doubt, the Appellant was exploiting knowledge that it was the practice of the banks with which he dealt to treat each cheque as a separate transaction and to ignore the substance of the overall transaction for purposes of the FTR Act. That fact is not material to the determination of the offences with which he was charged. 
     
      
    53 Nor can it be said that the purpose of the Act is in any way defeated by this interpretation of s31. The scheme, after all, did involve reportable cash transactions. 
     
      
    54 The convictions on the FTR Act charges should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    55 The Appellant contends that his Honour erred in allowing the Crown to cross-examine the accused in an unfair manner, namely, by splitting his case. Ms Fullerton informed the Court that this ground of appeal was relevant only to the two counts of defrauding the Commonwealth. 
     
      
    56 During the course of his evidence in chief the Appellant gave evidence that he worked for O’Donovan as the principal of both Star Suppliers and A-Quip and had done so for many years. Two distinct lines of cross-examination arose in this regard. First, cross-examination based on the tax returns of the Appellant indicating no identification of O’Donovan or either of the companies as a relevant employer. During the cross-examination the Appellant stated that O’Donovan paid him in cash and those payments had not been declared for taxation purposes. Secondly, cross-examination about the financial circumstances of the Appellant. This included cross-examination as to how he had accumulated assets and, particularly, how he had been able to finance a home purchase and make repayments on his mortgage. 
     
      
    57 Objection was taken before the trial judge. His Honour referred to the relevant principles in Shaw v The Queen (1952) 85 CLR 365 and The Queen v Chin (1984) 157 CLR 671. Subsequently, the High Court has considered this matter in R v Soma (2003) 77 ALJR 849. 
     
      
    58 Before the trial judge, as in this Court, counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Crown was splitting its case. It was or should have been apparent to the Crown that the modest income declared for income tax purposes when contrasted with the improvement in the assets of the Appellant and his wife over the relevant period were probative of the case that the Crown alleged against the Appellant. 
     
      
    59 Before the trial judge, and in this Court, the Crown asserted that the questions complained of arose only out of the evidence by the Appellant that he had worked for O’Donovan. They did not arise in the Crown case. The detail of the taxation returns became significant only when the Appellant claimed to have been employed by O’Donovan for extensive periods, leading to the proposition that he was a mere employee doing what he was told. 
     
      
    60 In the course of his reasons for rejecting the application to restrict the Crown’s cross-examination his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “During the evidence of the accused he has given evidence that he was employed by a Mr O’Donovan for approximately the period 1989 to 1998. The Crown submitted that this was the first time that they became aware that this was what the accused’s line of defence was. There is nothing in the evidence that I have seen that countermands that assertion.  
        
       
       
        
        In cross-examination the Crown asked questions of how Mr O’Donovan paid the accused. The accused said that he was paid in cash. The Crown has apparently the tax returns for the accused which would appear to contain prior inconsistent statements with regard to both the accused’s employer and his method and quantity of payment. The Crown now would seek to cross-examine on those reports. 
        
       
       
        
        The defence accept that prior inconsistent statements with respect to the name of Mr O’Driscoll’s employer are relevant and prima facie admissible, but argue that the Crown should have predicted the nature of the defence being conducted by the accused and tendered them in chief and that to tender them now or even cross-examine on them is splitting the Crown case. 
        
       
       
        
        I disagree with that submission. To predict the nature of the defence in that manner might have led to the tender of a vast quantity of irrelevant material for the jury’s consideration. The accused has, as was his right, never divulged his defence before yesterday. Even in cross-examination of the Crown witnesses the precise nature of his defence was not divulged. I do not say that to criticise the defence. It is merely a fact. In my view the Crown are entitled to explore the answers given by the accused in chief and that must include an examination of the nature, amount, style and quantity of any such payments by Mr O’Donovan.” 
        
       
      
    61 His Honour went on to say, with respect to the second issue I have identified above: 
     
      
       
        
        “In similar vein the accused objects to any cross-examination by the Crown as to the accused’s financial circumstances. Hypothetical questions such as ‘where did you get the money to pay your mortgage payments?’ were posed. Apparently the Crown does propose to ask such questions. The accused points out that the financial circumstances were known to the Crown prior to the trial and that they could have sought to prove that he appeared to have the benefit of unidentifiable enrichment but chose not to do so. The Crown has responded by submitting that they did not know the nature of the defence in that they did not know that the accused would maintain that he was a labourer on the railways at night and that during the day he did errands for Mr O’Donovan. Given the nature of that work, the fact that he was able to pay off large sums of money from his mortgage, if it be a fact, is relevant to show that he was not in fact working as a labourer or an errand runner at all. Again I find that there is substance in the Crown submission. This is not a case where the Crown ought reasonably have anticipated the defence and therefore it is not a question of splitting the Crown case. The evidence is so intrinsically tied in with the accused’s defence that he worked as a labourer for Mr O’Donovan during the day that the questions are relevant to the fact in issue and are prima facie admissible.” 
        
       
      
    62 The written submissions in this Court put it this way: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown knew in advance that the modest income declared in tax returns could not have come close to funding the assets the appellant had accumulated. The Crown did not need to know what work the appellant did before adducing evidence of his significant and unexplained accumulation of assets. It was simply a means of adducing evidence which ought to have been lead in its own case and was unrelated to the defence case in any sufficiently material sense.” 
        
       
      
    63 During the course of oral submissions Ms Fullerton SC narrowed the focus to one particular aspect of the evidence adduced in cross-examination as constituting the splitting by the Crown of its case. She accepted that in the light of the evidence given in chief by the Appellant about his employment by O’Donovan, it was permissible for the Crown to seek to tender the income tax records as a prior inconsistent statement. Those records failed to identify O’Donovan as an employer. Nevertheless, she maintained the position that the Crown ought to have tendered in its case in chief these tax returns together with evidence of unexplained wealth to establish the proposition that it was the Appellant rather than anybody else who was the controller of the scheme. 
     
      
    64 The particular item of unexplained wealth on which she focused was the evidence that the Appellant had been able to obtain $200,000 from Ireland in order to acquire a house. She submitted that the combination of the low income suggested by the tax returns, the knowledge that $200,000 had come from the Bank of Ireland for the private purposes of the Appellant, together with the fact that, during the course of the scheme, drafts on the Bank of Ireland had been purchased in cash was evidence that was admissible to establish the basic Crown case as to the participation in, and the role of, the Appellant in the scheme. It should have been tendered in chief. She accepted that the drafts from the Bank of Ireland which were purchased in Australia were not directly referable to the single transaction of receiving $200,000 from Ireland.  
     
      
    65 The relevant cross-examination included the following (T673-677): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Where did that money come from? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well I had money in an account overseas. 
        
       
       
        
        Q I’m sorry? 
        
       
       
        
        A I had an account with some money in it and – overseas and I got a mortgage for the remainder. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was that money which you had put in that account from Australia? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes it would have been. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Had you done that using overseas bank drafts? 
        
       
       
        
        A I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q How much money did you draw from that account to help pay for the house? 
        
       
       
        
        A From memory about 200 maybe - $200,000. 
        
       
       
        
        Q $200,000 Australian dollars? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah $200,000 Australian dollars, around that figure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q That was money which you had sent to Ireland from money you had earnt in Australia was it? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah that’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Do you say do you that it was money that you’d earnt from Mr O’Donovan? 
        
       
       
        
        A That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Over what period of time had you sent it to Ireland? 
        
       
       
        
        A I suppose over a period of a number of years. Probably from about ’89 till 1998.” (T673-674) 
        
       
      
    66 The questioning went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Was that money in the Irish bank account an accumulation of cash drawn from the accounts of Star Suppliers and A-Quip Hire Pty Limited? 
        
       
       
        
        A This is drawn from A-Quip and Star Suppliers. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Yes. Did you take cash out of those accounts and send it to Ireland to be deposited into that bank account? 
        
       
       
        
        A I remember on one occasion I asked Mr O’Donovan would it be okay to get a bank draft and he said it was okay provided I gave him – I had cash at home that was in the house and I sent the bank draft then to a bank in Ireland. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Once? 
        
       
       
        
        A A couple of times.” (T677) 
        
       
      
    67 The Appellant also gave evidence that he kept a large amount of cash in his house, some in a wardrobe and some in the freezer. This, he said, was cash that he had earned for working for Mr O’Donovan over the years (T679). He also said that he had paid off a considerable amount of the mortgage within six months and that the cash to make those payments had also come from what he had earned over the years from Mr O’Donovan (T680). 
     
      
    68 Ms Fullerton submitted that the course of this cross-examination allowed this material to be brought out in a manner which put the Appellant in a bad light. The Appellant was denied the opportunity of presenting an explanation for the acquisition of the house in his own case in a manner which was less prejudicial. 
     
      
    69 It was a central part of Ms Fullerton’s submissions that the evidence as to limited earnings and the acquisition of a house with a cash transfer from Ireland was admissible in the Crown case. She submitted that this evidence was at least consistent with the Crown case that the Appellant controlled the scheme and this gave him access to significant amounts of cash, i.e. the 7 percent commission. 
     
      
    70 Mr Staehli submitted that the material was not admissible. He submitted that it was not capable of being tendered because of an inability to link the information of which the Crown did have knowledge in any relevant manner. He submitted, specifically, that it was not until the cross-examination that the Crown had any evidence that the bank draft that came from the Bank of Ireland to the Appellant, in order to pay a substantial proportion of the purchase price of a house, was his own money. No such link could be drawn from the fact that drafts in smaller and different amounts had, over a period of time, been sent from the account of the company to Ireland. This was in part because the company had engaged in activity other than the avoidance of the PPS scheme by means of payments of cash to workers. The amounts sent to Ireland could have been the property of the employers who had used the Appellant’s cheque cashing facility. 
     
      
    71 On the evidence available to the Crown, the companies were involved in a scheme of paying false invoices for contractors in the building trade. The Appellant had issued false or blank invoices purporting to represent work carried out by Star which, in some cases, represented an amount additional to the amount owed to the contractor. On those occasions the owners of the businesses were able to claim the amount of the invoice as a deduction whilst effectively having cash returned to them. On at least some such occasions, according to evidence available to the Crown, the cash of those owners was transferred to them by means of a bank draft drawn by the company Star and payable to Ireland.  
     
      
    72 There was, accordingly, Mr Staehli submitted, no inference available that amounts sent by the companies to Ireland by way of bank drafts could be said to be the money of the Appellant. Until the Appellant’s evidence in chief, the Crown could not establish that the money which came from Ireland and which was applied to buying the house had been the property of the Appellant. 
     
      
    73 Mr Staehli relied on the judgment of Lee J, with whom Carmichael and Lusher JJ agreed, in R v McMahon (NSWCCA, 23 June 1978, unreported). In that case the Crown tendered a significant quantity of money. The accused was charged with possession of drugs. Lee J held that possession of the sum of money had no relevance “to the charges that the appellant was facing”. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am unable to see how the fact that $2,595 was being carried by the appellant at the time the search was underway to determine whether he was in possession of any heroin, could have any probative value in relation to the issue of possession or no possession of the heroin the subject of the second count and this whether treated alone or in association with the evidence that the appellant was not in employment at the time … although unusual, it was not a state of affairs necessarily pointing to wrong-doing. The possession of the money could only be related to a possible trafficking in heroin or possession of heroin as a matter of pure speculation. There were many sources, legal or illegal – savings, sale of an asset, betting, stealing, robbery to mention some that come to mind – from which a man may have obtained such an amount of money, but no basis at all in my view to make a choice and relate the possession of the money to trafficking in heroin or the possession of heroin in the absence of some other evidence suggesting such a relationship. This was not a case of facts being proved from which an inference could be drawn that the money was related to trafficking in heroin, so as to permit that inference to be drawn if no explanation were put forward by the accused. At its highest the evidence of possession of the money could only be traded as raising a suspicion that it may have come from some dealing in heroin, but that suspicion was always a suspicion only and the money could equally have come from a number of other sources.” 
        
       
      
    74 Although Lee J did discuss both “possession” and “trafficking”, the case before him was one of possession only. The observations in relation to trafficking are obiter. This is of some significance as it is much clearer that unexplained wealth is not relevant to the issues posed by a charge of possession of drugs. 
     
      
    75 The judgment of Lee J was relied upon by the appellant in R v Edwards [1998] 2 VR 354. In that case the applicant was found guilty of a count of trafficking. One ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence that the accused had $3,050 in his possession. Eames AJA, with whom Hayne and Batt JJA agreed, distinguished McMahon albeit not on the basis that the counts in the case related only to possession.  
     
      
    76 His Honour did so on the basis that the evidence was admissible only with respect to one of the two counts and with respect to that count there was no other circumstantial evidence. His Honour noted that the possession of the large sum of money was able to be one element in a circumstantial case and that the mode of proof of a circumstantial case had been clarified by the High Court in judgments delivered subsequent to McMahon (i.e. Chamberlain v R (No 2) (1984) 153 CLR 521 and Shepherd v R (1990) 170 CLR 573). His Honour held that the discovery of such a sum of money was an item of circumstantial evidence which the jury could consider along with other circumstantial evidence on the charge before the court.  
     
      
    77 The reasoning in Edwards is, in my opinion, inconsistent with reasoning in McMahon insofar as that reasoning extends beyond a possession charge. In that respect McMahon was obiter and Edwards should be followed. (See also R v Campbell & Greig (1999) 109 A Crim R 174 esp at 180.) 
     
      
    78 A critical issue at the trial was whether or not the Appellant was conducting the scheme as a principal on his own account or, as he claimed, whether he was taking all steps at the direction of O’Donovan. In my opinion, the combined effect of the two items of evidence referred to in the course of these submissions, i.e. the tax returns showing little in the way of income and access for his own private purposes to a substantial amount of money transferred to him in a non-traceable manner was admissible evidence on this issue. The fact that drafts may have been sent from the company Star on account of one of the employer companies as part of the false invoicing scheme is not to the point. That circumstance does not suggest how any money would be transferred from Ireland to be used by the Appellant for his personal expenditure. It may be that a jury, properly instructed to the effect that, in a circumstantial case, there must be no reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence, may conclude that in the absence of evidence linking the flow of funds to Ireland to the defendant the Crown has not established its case. That, however, is a different proposition to that which arises on admissibility. 
     
      
    79 In my opinion, evidence of unexplained wealth was admissible in the Crown case in chief. 
     
      
    80 In R v Soma, supra at [11] and [14]-[15] the joint judgment in the High Court emphasised the need to identify which limb of the statutory jurisdiction of a court of criminal appeal is invoked. Two limbs of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 are relevant: 
     
      
    · “the wrong decision of any question of law” 
     
      
    · “there was a miscarriage of justice”. 
     
      
    81 The specific ground relied on is: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in allowing the Crown to cross-examine the accused in an unfair manner, namely by splitting its case.” 
        
       
      
    82 So expressed, the ground can be understood to invoke each of the two limbs of s6 I have highlighted. 
     
      
    83 In R v Soma, the joint judgment affirmed that, as a matter of practice and procedure, rather than of substantive law, there is a general principle or rule that “the prosecution must offer all its proof before the accused is called on to make his or her defence” ([29] and see [27]-[28]). There can, however, be departures from the general rule ([28]). 
     
      
    84 The rule is not a technical rule but is based on fairness (see e.g. Killick v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 565 at 569; R v Chin, supra at 686). Where an issue arises in the course of cross-examination, Dawson J in Chin at 686 posed the test in terms of whether: 
     
      
       
        
        “… its admission for the first time during cross-examination would unduly prejudice the accused, having regard to the obligation resting upon the prosecution to make its case known before the presentation of the defence case.” 
        
       
      
    85 What constitutes relevant unfairness or prejudice must depend on all the circumstances of a case. It is pertinent to consider the reasons why the Crown did not adduce the evidence in its own case. In Soma, for example, it was not a good reason that the Crown anticipated an objection may be taken to its tender. (See R v Soma (2001) 122 A Crim R 537 at [26] approved in the High Court at [31] and see at [12]-[13].) 
     
      
    86 In the present case, the explanation proffered was that the Crown was unaware that the $200,000 that came from Ireland was the Appellant’s own money, rather than a loan or gift or pre-existing capital. That, however, went to the weight of the evidence it could adduce, rather than to its admissibility. In the reasons I have indicated above, the evidence which the Crown was in a position to prove was admissible. It could not, in my opinion, be said that this evidence was “marginally, minimally or doubtfully relevant”. (See R v Chin supra at 676.9 per Gibbs CJ and Wilson J.) The combined effect of low income over a long period of time and access to substantial funds was probative of the Crown case. The amount of $200,000 was sufficiently large although, in the scheme as a whole, not patently so, to be relevant to the issue of whether the Appellant was the controller of the scheme. 
     
      
    87 I have indicated in par [64] above, the submission made for the Appellant as to the prejudice suffered during the trial. The issue arose before the relevant cross-examination occurred. His Honour’s judgment was given in anticipation of the line of cross-examination. At that stage the Appellant had been cross-examined on other matters for one afternoon (T439-482). 
     
      
    88 The next day Counsel for the Appellant identified the relevant prejudice as being the loss of the ability to give his own version of the facts in chief, rather than to give the appearance that he had been seeking to conceal it. His Honour thereupon gave counsel leave to reopen examination in chief (T527). Ms Fullerton rejected the opportunity to do that (T540). 
     
      
    89 Where, as here, an Appellant has been given an opportunity to substantially, if not completely, alleviate the unfairness involved in the Crown splitting its case, this is a material factor to consider in determining whether an error of law or a miscarriage of justice occurred. 
     
      
    90 This is reinforced by the comparatively insignificant, albeit not marginal, nature of the evidence that the Crown should have adduced in chief. 
     
      
    91 The significance of the evidence in the context of the Crown case on the two defrauding the Commonwealth counts appears from the summing-up of the trial judge. His Honour identified the case as almost entirely a circumstantial one and gave the appropriate direction to the jury as to how to approach such a case (T19). 
     
      
    92 His Honour also identified that the nature of the case was such that it was an essential requirement that the Crown establish that it was the Appellant who controlled and directed the affairs of the company (T33). He directed the jury that they had to be satisfied that he was controlling and directing the companies beyond reasonable doubt (T34). 
     
      
    93 His Honour then directed the jury that it had to be satisfied of intentional dishonesty and the elements of the offence about which he directed them (T35). 
     
      
    94 When his Honour came to summarise the evidence (T51) he did so by identifying matters in the following sequence: 
     
      
    · Incorporation of the companies and their application for tax file numbers and for deduction variation certificates, many of these documents were executed either in the name O’Donovan or O’Neill by the Appellant and in the case of the company A-Quip the accountant who conducted the incorporation identified the Appellant as using the name John O’Neill. The Appellant’s evidence had been that all of this, including the impersonation of a Mr O’Neill, had occurred at the direction of Mr O’Donovan. 
     
      
    · Various bank accounts were set up and bank officers identified the Appellant as the person whose name was Pat O’Donovan.  
     
      
    · A number of bank officers gave evidence of the accused’s modus operandi of obtaining cash on the cheques and using and occasionally in their presence signing the name O’Donovan to cheques. Bank officers identified the Appellant as the person who was known to them as Mr O’Neill with respect to the A-Quip company. Others identified him as O’Donovan in relation to the Star company. 
     
      
    · Various persons in the building industry gave evidence with respect to the cheques they had made up to Star or A-Quip and the way their employees were paid in cash. 
     
      
    95 His Honour gave the jury a direction not to use the evidence of the Appellant, that he had failed to declare income, for a tendency purpose (T90-91). 
     
      
    96 His Honour proceeded to summarise the evidence of the accused over some twenty pages of the summing-up (T92-114). His Honour referred to numerous aspects of the evidence but particularly focused on the existence, identify and conduct attributed to Mr O’Donovan. His Honour focused in detail on the examination in chief and gave a comparatively summary treatment of the cross-examination. In this respect also, however, the primary focus was on the alleged activities of O’Donovan. The evidence of which complaint is now made did not play a sufficiently prominent part in the trial for his Honour, in an otherwise comprehensive summation of the Appellant’s evidence, to refer to it at all. 
     
      
    97 In my opinion although the evidence adduced could not be dismissed as “marginally or minimally or doubtfully relevant” (see Chin at 676.9 quoted above), it was of such low prominence at the trial that, when combined with the offer rejected on behalf of the Appellant to avert the prejudice by reopening his evidence in chief, I have concluded that his Honour committed no error of law and there was no miscarriage of justice in permitting the cross-examination to occur.  
     
      
    98 In my opinion, this ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    99 The third ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to call evidence in reply. The evidence in reply related to an address in Crown Road, Queenscliff, which had been provided to the Australian Securities Commission as the registered office of Star. The effect of the evidence given in reply was that the address had no connection with the company. 
     
      
    100 During the course of the defence case a witness gave evidence that he had visited O’Donovan at “an apartment” in Crown Road, Queenscliff. Another witness who had resided at 72 Crown Road, Queenscliff was known to the Crown prior to the trial. The effect of this witness’s evidence was that the relevant apartment was occupied by a young couple, not a single man and the occupants were certainly not Irish.  
     
      
    101 The Appellant submitted that the evidence that was eventually led in reply should have been led in the Crown case because it established that the particular apartment used was not connected with the company.  
     
      
    102 The evidence was led without objection but a direction was sought that the jury be instructed to exclude the evidence from their consideration. In his judgment Blackmore DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The issue is who lived at a particular address. Who lived there was raised for the first time in evidence in the defence case squarely by Mr O’Driscoll himself. The Crown did not have evidence of who lived at that address or who stayed there, what they had was evidence of who the tenants were at a particular time. Clearly that evidence would not have illuminated the issue one way or the other, given the nature of the evidence given by the accused. The issue is connected with the defence case that Mr O’Donovan existed and was the one involved with Star Suppliers, which I have already ruled was not one the Crown could have reasonably anticipated as a defence, therefore, in my view the evidence is properly one to be led in reply and will remain before the jury.” 
        
       
      
    103 Nothing suggests that the Crown had any reason to suspect that any person would attempt to link O’Donovan with the premises used as the registered office of Star until such time as the evidence to that effect was adduced in the course of the defence case. This may not be enough, on its own, to establish the “exceptional circumstance” in which a Crown case in reply may be permitted. (See R v Chin, supra at 686.) However, when this is combined with the comparative insignificance of the evidence, which in the overall scheme of the Crown case borders on the trivial, the requisite circumstances can be seen to exist. 
     
      
    104 In any event, the Crown relied, in the alternative, on the proviso. If it were necessary to do so, this would be an appropriate case to apply it. 
     
      
    105 This ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    106 As noted above, Ms Fullerton sought to add an appeal against sentence during the course of her oral submissions if, as has proved to be the case, Ground 1 was upheld. Ms Fullerton acknowledged that this Court could proceed to re-sentence, but it did not have the evidence before the sentencing judge. Nor was she in a position to make submissions. 
     
      
    107 Ms Fullerton’s submission was that the sentencing judge took into account on the fraud counts the fact that they were perpetrated by means of the structured cash transactions and, for that reason, ordered concurrent sentences. She submitted that his Honour appears to have “factored up the seriousness of the fraud” in a manner, which would not be warranted if the conviction on the FTR Act offences were quashed. 
     
      
    108 The relevant passage appears at pp14-15 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence of 28 June 2002. His Honour had already outlined his reasons for the sentence he proposed to impose with respect to each of the two convictions under s29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). His Honour had also dealt with the factors relevant to the FTR Act offences. In the relevant paragraph, his Honour was dealing with the issue of whether or not he should wholly or partially accumulate the sentences under the FTR Act offences, with those for the Crimes Act offences. 
     
      
    109 The relevant passage is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner carried out those financial transactions as part of the scheme that he put in place to perpetrate the fraud on the revenue. Whilst it might be said that those transactions were not a necessary part of carrying out those frauds the fact that the transactions were carried in the way they were, as cash transactions for amounts less than $10,000, considerably diminished the likelihood of detection.  
        The offences were therefore an integral part of the fraud and I have taken that fact into account as part of the commission of the fraud itself. 
         In the circumstances, whilst there is reason to regard these offences seriously, as previously said, in my view there is also the potential for double punishment if I were to accumulate sentence with respect to those charges on the offences under s 29D, and in the circumstances of this case I do not propose to do so.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    110 Earlier in his remarks on sentence at p6, his Honour, when dealing with the seriousness of the fraud offences, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences reveal a pre-meditated scheme involving considerable planning which also involved the perpetration of very many criminal acts. The prisoner did not merely assist others to commit fraud, but provided a tax evasion service for which he was paid a commission. He provided blank and/or false invoices to conceal the fraud. He avoided the cash reporting provisions of the Financial Transactions Reports Act by making withdrawals under $10,000. He used false identities.” 
        
       
      
    111 It does appear that his Honour took into account, at least to some extent, the commission of the offences under the FTR Act. 
     
      
    112 As I pointed out in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [76]-[79], this Court’s jurisdiction turns on the formation of an opinion under s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. That section does not give this Court jurisdiction to quash a sentence merely “if it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process”. 
     
      
    113 The Appellant has not put on any submissions in this regard and should be given an opportunity to do so. It appears to me to be a matter that can be dealt with by way of writing, subject to any application to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal that an oral hearing occur. It will be desirable for the present bench to consider the sentence appeal, or at least two members of this bench should do so. It may be that when the submissions are filed, it will be appropriate for a direction to be made under s6AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    114 No appeal has in fact been lodged against sentence. The notice of appeal dated 2 December 2002, filed in the Court on 4 February 2003, is identified as one against “conviction only”. The Appellant should file a separate notice of appeal against sentence. The Court should make the relevant orders and give the necessary directions at this stage, although the parties will have liberty to apply to the Registrar of the Court to vary the orders and directions insofar as the Registrar is empowered to do so. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    115 The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal with respect to Counts 7-22 inclusive is allowed, the convictions quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
       
       
      2. The appeal is otherwise dismissed. 
       
       
      3. Extend up to a date 14 days after the making of these orders the time within which the Appellant may lodge a notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal against sentence. 
       
       
      4. Direct the Crown to file any written submissions within 14 days of the service upon it of the written submissions in support of the appeal. 
       
       
      5. Direct the Appellant to file any written submissions in reply within 14 days of being served with the Crown submissions. 
       
      
    116 HULME J: In this matter, I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice. His Honour has set out in detail the facts and relevant evidence, so it is largely unnecessary for me to do so.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      His Honour erred in failing to find that there was no case to answer with respect to the structuring charges, counts 3 to 22. (As the Appellant was acquitted on counts 3-6, the appeal is confined to counts 7 onwards.) 
      
    117 In my view the Appellant’s convictions on the charges that he  
     
      
       
        
        “was a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions and having regard to the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, it is reasonable to conclude that he conducted the transactions in a manner or form, for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction” 
        
       
       
      should be quashed. 
       
      
    118 Section 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act on which the charges were based directs attention to “cash transactions”, a term defined in s3 of the Act to mean “a transaction involving the physical transfer of currency from one person to another”. 
     
      
    119 If I present a bank teller with a $100 note, ask for and receive change in the form of (say) 30 two dollar and 40 one dollar coins, there is one cash transaction. Equally, if in lieu of the $100 note I present two $50, or five $20 notes, there is one cash transaction, not the number of transactions which happens to coincide with the number of notes presented. Similarly if I present a bundle of coins to a certain value and ask for one or more notes in lieu, it cannot seriously be suggested that there are a number of transactions corresponding with the number of coins presented or notes obtained. From each of the bank and myself there is one “physical transfer of currency from one person to another”. 
     
      
    120 If I asked the teller to change one $50 note into $2 coins and the other into 5 two dollar and 40 one dollar coins, it would be arguable that there were two transactions but for present purposes that says no more than that there is more than one way of achieving the same result. 
     
      
    121 As is outlined in paragraph 43 of the Chief Justice’s reasons, the general course of action pursued by the Appellant involved him in informing a bank of the total amount of cash required so that the bank could ensure the funds were available and then presenting a number of cheques in amounts totalling that sum. He would commonly specify the denominations in which he desired the money be supplied. Commonly he would also specify “sub-bundles” into which the money supplied was to be bundled although there was no correlation between the denominations or the sub-bundles on the one hand and the amount of any cheque on the other.  
     
      
    122 Given that the break down into denominations and sub-bundles, some of which exceeded $10,000, bore no relationship to the amounts of individual cheques, it does not seem to me possible to say that these breakdowns turned any occasion into more than one cash transaction any more than the examples I have given of the conversion of a number of notes into coins. Nor does it seem to me that the fact that on each occasion more than one cheque was presented makes each occasion in any meaningful way different from the presentation of a number of notes for cashing. On such occasions, one amount is tendered and one is received. On each occasion there is one “physical transfer of currency from one person to another”. 
     
      
    123 Nor do the remarks or decision in R v Narayanan [2002] NSWCCA 2000 require a different conclusion. In that case as an incident of their dealing both parties “by their conduct manifested an intention that there be” more than one cash transaction and there was “undisputed and overwhelming evidence that both (the customer) and (the cash dealer) intended that there be five parcels of travellers cheques, in different names, for each of which an appropriate part of the totality paid was to be attributed”.  
     
      
    124 Here there was no such manifestation. Certainly, the existence of a number of cheques on each occasion argues in favour of there being more than one transaction but one cannot ignore the fact that one is primarily looking at or for the number of cash transactions and on each occasion, one amount of cash was sought and one amount handed over. The fact that on any one occasion more than one cheque was presented does not of itself provide that manifestation any more than would the presentation of a number of notes by someone who wanted change. 
     
      
    125 Furthermore evidence from most if not all of the bank officers who were called makes it clear that the cash they were dealing with was treated by them as one amount. The sums on the cheques were added and the total checked against a count of the cash. Commonly, the amount was set aside prior to the Appellant’s attendance at the banks, before the cheques were seen or their individual amounts known to the banks (if indeed the cheques were even then in existence). 
     
      
    126 Whatever may have been the Appellant’s intention it is impossible to say that the bank officers who, between them, were on one side of each of the cash transactions, “by their conduct manifested an intention that there be” more than one cash transaction. Certainly on each occasion they knew that there was more than one cheque involved but that cannot be determinative of whether there is more than one cash transaction any more than their knowledge of more than one bank-note, simultaneously presented to be changed, can. The fact that the Appellant may have had some nefarious purpose in mind, even a purpose of avoiding the reporting requirements of the Act, does not change the character of the “cash transaction” which occurred from one such transaction into two or more. And the bank officers were never questioned to suggest they shared any such purpose. 
     
      
    127 Nor do I see how the receipt by a bank officer of a number of cheques (or bank-notes) can be regarded as a manifestation by the bank officer of an intention that there be more than one such item let alone, when a global sum of cash is handed over in return, more than one cash transaction.  
     
      
    128 It must be acknowledged that as part of the transactions which in fact occurred between the Appellant and the banks, prior to the handing over of the cash, both parties knew that a number of cheques were involved. Had there been evidence that in response the banks were providing cash in amounts corresponding to each cheque (and not just ensuring that the totals were the same) then a different conclusion would probably have been required. However, as I have indicated, both parties seem to have approached the cash handling part of the transaction as if either one amount was involved, or one amount broken up into bundles of amounts which did not permit of the conclusion that they were under $10,000 and so broken up so as to justify the conclusion that the transactions were conducted in that form “for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring or attempting to ensure that the currency … was transferred in a manner and form that would not give rise to a significant cash transaction”.  
     
      
    129 The circumstances were quite different from those in R v Naraynan which I have referred to above. 130 An argument similar to that which appeals to me was advanced by counsel appearing for the Appellant in support of a no-case submission but rejected, the trial judge responding by saying that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The cheque in each case is a demand made by the presenter of the cheque for payment. In each case full payment was provided following presentation of the cheque. The fact that cash was then accumulated by the bank into a lump sum to represent the total amount demanded by the various cheques presented by the accused, to my mind does not change the fundamental nature of the cash transactions involved, namely that each cash transaction took the same form of the presentation of a cheque and the payment of cash money in exchange for that cheque.” 
        
       
      
    131 His Honour’s statement that cash was “then accumulated” does not accord with the evidence. 
     
      
    132 When his Honour came to sum-up to the jury, he directed them that in respect of the counts under the Financial Transactions Reports Act, they had to be satisfied that the Appellant was a party to two or more non-reportable cash transactions but added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In this case the accused on the occasions alleged in the counts 3 to 22, presented a large number of separate cheques for amounts of less than $10,000. And they were presented at the one time to the bank and usually, he received in return a lump sum of cash money. That lump sum may have been broken down into small amounts at the request of the accused, but ultimately it was all handed over to him at the one time. In that regard I direct you that if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused presented those cheques to the banks in the manner outlined by the witnesses from the banks, and there really isn’t much of a dispute on the evidence that he did so, and that he received cash in return, then as a matter of law the cashing of those cheques, that is the provision of cash with respect of each individual cheque, even if those individual amounts were aggravated (sic) or joined together and handed over by the bank to the accused as a lump sum, that those individual cheques amounted in the case of their presentation to a non-reportable cash transaction. 
        
       
       
        
        Each time in effect, each time an individual cheque, even if it was handed over with a multiple of say 8 or 9 cheques together, each individual cheque amounted to a non reportable cash transaction.”  
        
       
       
      
    133 This direction was wrong. Whether, on each occasion, there was one or more than one cash transaction was a matter of fact, not of law. Furthermore, as I have indicated, I regard the totality of the circumstances on each occasion of the cashing of cheques as compelling the conclusion that there was only one cash transaction. 
     
      
    134 As I have said the convictions on counts 7 to 22 should be quashed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      His Honour erred in allowing the Crown to cross-examine the accused in an unfair manner, namely, by splitting its case.  
       
      
    135 As outlined to the jury in the Crown Prosecutor’s opening, the Crown case was that the Appellant had put in place a system so that workers in the construction industry did not pay tax on their earnings. The system involved employers of those workers paying the workers’ wages to 2 companies associated with the Appellant. The cheques in such payment were banked to a variety of bank accounts, the Appellant being involved in that activity, and he would then attend on the banks and by a number of cash cheques in individual amounts of less than $10,000 withdraw the proceeds and pay the workers. In the course of these activities he deducted a 7% commission. In these endeavours the Appellant used 2 companies, one set up using the name Patrick Finbar O’Donovan and the second set up using the name John Finbar O’Neill. The Appellant signed the companies’ cheques using these names and was known to the bank employees by them. According to the Crown opening, Mr O’Neill did not exist as a real person although Pat O’Donovan was the name of someone in the construction industry whom the Appellant had met. 
     
      
    136 However the possibility that someone else was involved was clearly raised during the Crown case. At a stage when there was discussion concerning the admissibility of bank records extending beyond the transactions the subject of the Financial Transactions Reporting Act charges, the following was said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: … they’re relevant … because they have been the subject of identification in the form of handwriting and in some cases fingerprints which, on the Crown case, go to show that it was the accused who was operating the account at all times or at least at other times other than the structuring charges and it foreshadows the potential defence which may or may not be forthcoming that there was someone else who was operating the account or something like that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It does seem to be a line of defence which is in the air.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    137 Furthermore, the involvement of a Mr Patrick O’Donovan was raised in the cross examination of Mr Brady, one of the employers who had paid money to the Appellant. It was suggested to Mr Brady that he had dealt with Mr Patrick O’Donovan dishonestly by way of obtaining a benefit in cash terms. Mr Brady responded by saying either that he didn’t recall ever meeting a Mr Patrick O’Donovan or denying he had ever met that person. Mr Brady said also that his only dealings with Star Suppliers, one of the two companies through which the activities, the subject of the charges were conducted, were with the Appellant. A number of other suggestions made by counsel for the Accused concerning dealings by Mr Brady with Mr O’Donovan were met with similar responses. Later, in an apparent attempt to stir Mr Brady’s recollection, the cross examiner provided a description of Mr O’Donovan and, met with responses similar to those previously given, suggested to Mr Brady that he was deliberately misleading the jury because he had a corrupt relationship with that person. Reminded also of evidence he had given that the Appellant informed him that there was an investigation on the way it was then put to Mr Brady that it was Mr O’Donovan and not the Appellant who had brought that matter to his attention.  
     
      
    138 Against this background, it was clearly relevant for the Crown to adduce evidence of the Appellant’s possession of funds not attributable to ordinary dealings. In that the Crown could show that the Appellant had received $200,000 and his tax returns showed insufficient income to account for that sum, the Crown was part of the way there. Was it necessary if this evidence was to be admissible for the Crown also to show that the $200,000 could not have come from some other source such as a loan, gift or inheritance? I confess that my initial reaction was that it was but on reflection I have concluded that it was not. The receipt of $200,000 is sufficiently unusual for the evidence to have some probative value, particularly in context of its recipient being someone who, as part of the transactions the subject of the charges, was dealing in large amounts of cash and who was remitting at least some money to Ireland, whence the $200,000 received by the Appellant came. (It may be acknowledged that the evidence in the Crown case of remittances to Ireland tended to indicate that these were on account of persons other than the Appellant but in the climate of dishonesty which the evidence revealed, I do not regard this as determinative of the issue of admissibility.) 
     
      
    139 Thus I agree with the Chief Justice that the evidence the subject of this ground was admissible in the Crown case in chief. 
     
      
    140 The Crown elected not to call the evidence. It was not a case where the Crown tried and it was ruled inadmissible at that stage. The relevant principle governing the question whether the Crown should have been permitted to adduce the evidence after the close of its case has been oft stated. For present purposes it is sufficiently stated in the following extract from the remarks of Dixon, McTiernan, Webb and Kitto JJ in Shaw v R (1952) 85 CLR 365 at 379-380, a passage quoted or summarised and accepted in Killick v R (1981) 147 CLR 565 at 568 and 575 and R v Chin (1984-1985) 157 CLR 671 at 676 and 684-685. (The principle was perhaps somewhat understated in R v Soma (2003) HCA 13; (2003) 77 ALJR 849 at [36] but their Honours in that case did not purport to qualify it.):- 
     
      
       
        
        “But the prosecution may not split its case on any issue… It seems to us unsafe to adopt a rigid formula in view of the almost infinite variety of difficulties that may arise at a criminal trial. It is probably enough to say that the occasion must be very special or exceptional to warrant a departure from the principle that the prosecution must offer all its proofs during the progress of the Crown case and before the prisoner is called upon for his defence… Further… the English cases make it plain enough that generally speaking an occasion will not suffice for allowing an exceptional course if it ought reasonably to have been foreseen. Again, it may be pointed out that even an unexpected occasion may be of such a nature that it would have been covered, had the Crown case been fully and strictly proved.” 
        
       
      
    141 I see nothing in the circumstances of the Appellant’s trial which comes close to fulfilling the description “very special or exceptional”. Nor was there anything in the evidence to which I have referred which was not foreseen, even if the further evidence of the Appellant that the money was in fact his was not something the Crown was otherwise in a position to prove in its case in chief. In these circumstances, the trial judge was, subject to one matter, in error in permitting the Crown to adduce that evidence in cross-examination of the Appellant. 
     
      
    142 I have said “subject to one matter”. The income tax returns were also relevant in response to the Appellant’s evidence of employment by Mr Donovan. Accordingly, as counsel for the Appellant conceded, they were admissible in the cross-examination of the Appellant. However the evidence of the receipt of the $200,000 was not. It follows that, subject to the application to the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, the appeal should be allowed.  
     
      
    143 However the case is clearly one in my view for the application of the proviso. It could not reasonably be thought that the Crown’s failure to call the evidence during the Crown case in chief bore on the decision of the Appellant to give evidence because not to do so meant that he was doomed. Nor was the wrongly admitted evidence or the way in which it was dealt with significant in terms of the effect of the cross-examination. And the Chief Justice has pointed out how insignificant was the attention given to the evidence which in my view should not have been admitted and the limited respect in which, during the course of his appeal, it was suggested the Appellant was prejudiced. 
     
      
    144 The Crown case was overwhelming. The Appellant’s case that he had, at Mr Donovan’s suggestion, opened bank accounts and signed the relevant documents to effect that in the latter’s name, signed Mr Donovan’s name to cheques on those accounts and also then adopted the name of Mr O’Neill for the purposes of the formation and then use of the second company, creating another signature for that purpose was laughable. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      His Honour erred in allowing the Crown to call a case in reply. 
       
      
    145 The evidence was led by the Crown without objection and, according to the written submissions for the Appellant, after the defence had had the opportunity of conferring with the witness. Four questions before the end of the witness’ evidence in chief counsel for the Appellant foreshadowed an objection to it but said that she would not interrupt the evidence at that stage. After the additional questions she requested a direction that the jury should disregard the evidence, an application the trial judge declined, taking the view that it was properly led in reply. 
     
      
    146 I do not need to decide whether his Honour was correct in that view. The relative inconsequential nature of the evidence, together with the absence of objection prior to or at the time of, the evidence being led, leads to the conclusion that his Honour did not err in refusing to give the direction sought. And even if that view be wrong, again it is a case where the proviso should be applied. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
      
    147 In sentencing the Appellant in respect of the first 2 counts, his Honour observed that he had taken into account that the fraud had been committed by illegal acts the subject of other counts on which the Appellant had been convicted. Whether in light of the decision in Pearce v R (1978) 194 CLR 610 his Honour should have done so, logically the conclusion at which I have arrived in respect of the first ground means that the sentences imposed may need reconsideration. However, no application for leave to appeal has been lodged, nor has the court been provided with much of the material appropriate in support of any such application. 
     
      
    148 I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    149 CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree with the Chief Justice.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONBRYSON J.27 JUNE 20032561/02 - MICHAEL BAR-MORDECAI v ALEXANDER HILLSTON 
     
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: I have made observations during the course of Mr Bar-Mordecai's submissions and I repeat that my view is that under Subs. 338(1)(c) of the Crimes Act I am the person designated to determine whether or not the court will grant leave to prosecute Mr Alexander Hillston for perjury as the plaintiff asks. 
     
      
    2 It is not to the point that Mr Bar-Mordecai has expressed the feeling that I am disqualified for bias, as the designation is that I am to make the decision. No doubt this is for substantial reasons as the judicial officer before whom perjury is alleged to have been committed is in a special position to come to a view as to whether or not there ought to be a prosecution, if the public authorities referred to, namely the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General do not so decide or have not been asked. 
     
      
    3 I do not think subsection (2), which refers to a situation which makes it impossible or impracticable for the judicial officer to deal with leave, applies. It is quite possible to apply to me and there is no impracticability about my coming to a view about whether, in relation to proceedings before myself, a prosecution ought to be instituted. 
     
      
    4 I should add that, as I have already said, in my view there is no substance in the contention that there was actual bias or apprehended bias in any of the matters to which the plaintiff refers. 
     
      
    5 It is inescapably necessary that a judicial officer to whom an application under Section 338 (1) is to be made should, if the proceedings went to judgment and were disposed of, have come to some findings and should have expressed views about the nature of the evidence which is said to be perjured. The fact that I came to views adverse to those implied by the contention that the evidence was perjured in various respects is an inescapable aspect of the proceedings. To my mind, the reasonable dispassionate observer would understand that this was so, and would not take any adverse view of my deciding the present proceedings. I am not prepared to disqualify myself from hearing these proceedings.  
     
      
    6 In the Second Further Amended Summons claim 1 a alleges that the offences include perjured evidence in Probate proceedings heard before Justice Einstein, similarly for claim 2 a, claim 3 and claim 4 a. 
     
      
    7 On 29 April 2002, Mr Justice Einstein refused, for reasons then stated, to hear the present application and referred the proceedings to Justice Windeyer who, as I understand, has not ever disposed of the present application, although his Honour has disposed of other applications for leave to prosecute for perjury. 
     
      
    8 Also claimed in the Second Further Amended Summons is leave to prosecute for perjury committed before the Medical Tribunal on a number of occasions. No reason appears why it would have been impossible or impractical to apply for leave to prosecute to that Tribunal. 
     
      
    9 When I asked the plaintiff to deal with the question whether the application for leave to prosecute for perjury before the Medical Tribunal could be dealt with by this Court he told me to the effect that he would not press on with that application. 
     
      
    10 As I told Mr Bar-Mordecai during the hearing, I have taken under consideration whether the present proceedings should be summarily dismissed as vexatious. I gave him the opportunity to deal with that consideration but he responded by going to detail, not all of it comprehensible, about his grievances with respect to some passages of Mr Alexander Hillston's evidence and what he would say was the weight of the evidence which he set against some passages of Mr Alexander Hillston's evidence. 
     
      
    11 In the present proceedings, which were commenced before Mr Alexander Hillston gave evidence before me in the Equity proceedings 3240 of 1998 and 1707 of 1999, there are some charges or purported charges of offences which have evolved as the subjects of applications for leave to prosecute for perjury since these proceedings began and are now expressed in the Second Further Amended Summons of 14 April 2003. 
     
      
    12 The charges in the summons, which have, evolved after these proceedings were pending for rather more than a year, are not expressed in any form which could be the subject of an informed or considered decision as to whether or not leave could be granted to prosecute for perjury. 
     
      
    13 The opening passages of the Statement of Charge identify several different proceedings or hearings in which perjury is alleged to have been committed. Then there are 19 paragraphs referred to as charges with allusions to matters which are in some way complained of. 
     
      
    14 What is complained of is not in any case expressed in terms of a recognisable indictment, draft indictment or otherwise usable charge of a criminal offence. It does not appear clearly and cannot be comprehended from the document, any of the charges, on what date, at what place, or in what proceedings perjury was committed; or what was the true state of facts against which the evidence alluded to ought to be set so as to show that it was perjured. 
     
      
    15 Similar observations should be made of other passages said to relate to false swearing or in some other way relate to a claim for leave to prosecute. There is simply not enough material on which the question whether a criminal prosecution ought to be launched can be addressed in a considered way. 
     
      
    16 Mr Bar-Mordecai has sought in response to questions from me to explain what underlay the charges and why they should not be treated as vexatious. His explanations, insofar as they can be followed, seem to me to be directed to contentions that in the case of each charge, if a correct view (and he challenged my conclusions) of the overall evidence were taken, it would appear that the evidence given by Mr Alexander Hillston was false. 
     
      
    17 As it is not specified in any clear way which of these charges relate to evidence before me, or when and how the evidence was given, it is very difficult to test these claims or to see what substance they have. It did appear clearly enough from what Mr Bar-Mordecai told me that he did not in any case seek to introduce any evidence which would establish in a clear or concrete way that the evidence was false, other than evidence which was put before me in the hearing of the equity proceedings or evidence which had earlier been given in the probate proceedings and was not put before me, although it could have been. I interpose that much of the evidence which was put before Justice Einstein in the probate proceedings was put before me. It would appear that Mr Bar-Mordecai is of the view that he should or could have put some further material before me. 
     
      
    18 What it is that is to be the subject of criminal prosecutions cannot really be identified. So far as I can follow his explanations what he seeks is to have a further trial on the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt of facts on which he has already failed on the test of a balance of probabilities. He does not seek this on any evidence which might be thought to establish objectively what the facts are, but on renewed consideration of material which he has already put forward for adjudication. 
     
      
    19 This is not the sort of material upon which a perjury prosecution could rationally be founded. Unless there were some objective material which showed, in a fairly clear way, that evidence given before me was perjured or was knowingly false swearing, I would think there could be no real prospects that prosecution would ever be submitted to a jury for decision. Simply to go again through material which has already been unsuccessful once is a hopeless proposition for a perjury prosecution. Not only hopeless, but manifestly and obviously hopeless, to the point that any person capable of objectivity would see that an application for leave to prosecute should not be made. 
     
      
    20 Plainly the legislature intended by Section 338 to impose controls over the commencement of prosecution for perjury so that they should not, as they perhaps otherwise readily could, become satellite litigation attending every hard fought contest on facts. 
     
      
    21 There is really no prospect that a judicial officer would grant leave to prosecute for perjury with respect to evidence which he had himself accepted, unless there were some objective reason for regarding the evidence as extremely unsatisfactory or suspect; simply to rehash the matter on what had already been heard and determined is not a request that can reasonably be made to a judicial officer. 
     
      
    22 Of course there may be cases where evidence is so unsatisfactory that a judicial officer would form a strong sense that a perjury prosecution should be initiated; that was manifestly not the case with me. 
     
      
    23 The terms on the charges as set out in the charges and Second Further Amended Summons, with rather more than a year's consideration, themselves appear to me to show the vexatious nature of the application. 
     
      
    24 The conclusion that they are vexatious is also supported by the consideration that the plaintiff is now, as he told me, bringing before the Court of Appeal contentions on the findings of fact which ought to be made in the equity litigation and he will be asking the Court of Appeal to upset certain of my findings. That is to say, at the same time as he is conducting the litigation in the Court of Appeal he is contemporaneously seeking to initiate prosecutions elsewhere on the same subject matter. This in my mind is a strong indication of the vexatious nature of the proceedings. 
     
      
    25 The entire absence of any further evidentiary material, apart from evidence which has already been submitted for adjudication, makes the vexatious character of the proceedings inarguably clear in my view. The charges put forward are simply impossible candidates for leave. I propose to dismiss the proceedings summarily. 
     
      
    26 I order the proceedings be dismissed with costs. That means appointment for hearing in October is vacated.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Adam Ronald Craft has pleaded not guilty to two charges, namely that on 23 May 2002 at Mayfield he murdered John William Barr and that on 5 June 2002 at Cessnock he inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Robert Gregory Manning with intent to murder him. 
     
      
    2 The accused has elected for trial by judge alone and the Crown has consented to that form of trial. I shall explain when I review the psychiatric evidence why I think it appropriate that the accused be tried without a jury. 
     
      
    3 The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did the acts which constitute the offences but he admits all the facts relied on, so there is no doubt about those matters. The accused contends that he is not guilty of any offence because at the time of the events giving rise to the charges he was mentally ill and therefore not legally responsible for his actions. He must prove that it is more likely than not that that was so. 
     
      
    4 The statement of the test for a defence of mental illness was propounded as long ago as 1843 in R v McNaghten. The question to be answered was whether the accused at the time the offence was committed was suffering from a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, so as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The law has been amplified in Australia in the present century and the test may be said to be whether the accused was able to appreciate the wrongness of the act that he was doing. If through disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. It may also be said that if a disease of the mind so governs the faculties that it is impossible to reason with some moderate degree of calmness about the moral quality of an act, the actor is prevented from knowing that what he does is wrong. 
     
      
    5 The accused was born on 16 March 1974. He was one of a family of three children whose parents separated when he was aged one or two years. He had no contact with his natural father until the age of fifteen or sixteen years. He was brought up by his mother and a de facto step-father who, it is alleged, sexually interfered with him and his brother. Following those events his mother left the step-father, taking the children with her. The accused gave evidence at the trial of the step-father for the reported sexual assaults. The step-father was acquitted and the accused is reported to have been devastated at the result. His mother noticed his becoming more erratic after the trial. He had conversations with himself during which he rambled incoherently. He told her about conversations he had had with his grandfather, who had then been dead for twelve years. After he finished high school he attended the James Fletcher Hospital at Newcastle and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Part of his treatment included fortnightly injections of an anti-psychotic drug. Over the four years immediately before the events giving rise to the charges he was not taking his medication as directed and he and his mother argued about the matter. 
     
      
    6 It appears from the reports of members of the accused’s family that he became fixated with his step-father and what he had done to him. He began when angry or agitated to accused people of being paedophiles. These accusations were unreasonable and included people he had never met, his natural father and even himself. 
     
      
    7 The accused began to use drugs at the age of fifteen or sixteen years. He first tried cannabis and over the succeeding years heroin, LSD, magic mushrooms, amphetamine and cocaine. He is a moderate social drinker of alcohol. 
     
      
    8 He was first diagnosed mentally ill in July 1994, when he was admitted to the Hunter Area Mental Health Service. He was suffering dysthymia, major depressive disorder and possibly personality disorder. In the following months he was again admitted to hospital. He had been homeless and had been destroying property at his mother’s house and threatening to kill himself. He had been drinking heavily. The final diagnosis was anti-social personality disorder and borderline personality disorder with alcohol abuse. 
     
      
    9 During the following year he was admitted to Morisset Hospital and the discharge summary reported a long involvement with counsellors and psychiatrists. He had problems with polysubstance dependence. The diagnosis was drug dependence and anti-social personality disorder. 
     
      
    10 Early in 1996 he was admitted to hospital again, accusing his step-father of abusing him. He was thought-disordered and manifested persecutory ideation and ideas of reference. The family reported a long history of odd behaviour and aggression. He was treated with anti-psychotics and responded. The diagnosis was schizophrenia and polysubstance abuse. A month later he was again admitted to hospital and was hearing voices and had suicidal ideation. He was admitted again a month later, having breached an apprehended violence order. He was angry with his family for previous abuse and had assaulted them. He was showing ideas of reference and auditory hallucinations of a persecutory nature. A final diagnosis was chronic schizophrenia, polysubstance abuse and anti-social personality disorder. 
     
      
    11 In March 1998 he caused a lot of damage at his mother’s flat and was again admitted to hospital. He reported hearing the voice of his dead grandfather. He was difficult to contain. The diagnosis was query psychotic disorder, query substance abuse and query anti-social personality disorder. 
     
      
    12 He was admitted to other mental hospitals several times more during that year. 
     
      
    13 In 2001 he was apprehended by the police when he was carrying a knife and threatening to kill someone. He told police that he was the son of God, that God had put stigmata on him and that the person he was going to kill was molesting children. He was thought-disordered and had limited insight. The diagnosis was query schizophrenia and query drug induced psychosis. 
     
      
    14 There is a report by a psychiatrist who interviewed the accused in November 2001 at Cessnock Correctional Centre. Dr Hinton believed that the accused was psychotic but thought it unclear whether there was underlying schizophrenic illness or whether the symptoms were the result of drug abuse. He thought that there was a personality disorder marked by poor impulse control, aggression and violence. He thought that the accused required ongoing anti-psychotic medication, drug and alcohol counselling and follow-up by a community mental health team when released from gaol. Dr Hinton was concerned about the risk that the defendant posed to his former girlfriend and those whom he perceived as paedophiles and to whom he had made explicit threats. 
     
      
    15 Not many days before the first of the events giving rise to the charges the accused was released from gaol in Queensland, where he had spent one month for assaulting police. He had been using intravenous amphetamines heavily. His mother was concerned about him. He appeared psychotic. He had been pointing to moles on his stomach, which he believed were signs of the cross and had religious significance, and spoke about hands and hearts which were rotating. He believed that he had a mission to spread the word of God. 
     
      
    16 The deceased, John William Barr, was forty-nine years old at the time of his death. When he was eighteen years old he suffered severe head injuries in a motorcycle accident and was rendered unable to work and had to go on to a disability pension. Following the death of his father he progressed from being a social drinker to an alcoholic and spent time in a number of institutions from time to time for treatment for alcoholism. He had several relationships with women and there could not be the slightest suggestion that he ever sexually interfered with children. He lived in premises at Mayfield rented from the Housing Commission and friends stayed there with him from time to time. One of those friends was the father of the accused, Mr Gordon Cram. 
     
      
    17 In April 2002 Mr Cram was staying with the accused in Bass Hill and on one occasion decided to leave after they had had an argument. Mr Cram found it necessary to summon the police for his own safety. The accused was calling him an alcoholic and a paedophile. Mr Cram is not a paedophile. 
     
      
    18 Mr Cram went to stay with the deceased. When he arrived there from work on 22 May 2002 he found the accused there, drinking alcohol with the deceased. Both seemed to have been smoking marijuana. On the following morning he told the accused that he should find somewhere else to live. 
     
      
    19 At about 12:30 pm on 23 May 2002 the accused attacked the deceased with a knife, putting a fifteen centimetre long transverse incised wound across the front of the throat. The wound produced major airway damage as well as damage to the jugular vein. The deceased was thereby rendered unable to breathe and bled to death. 
     
      
    20 The accused ran away from the premises but returned on the following day and was arrested by the police. He told them that he could not remember how he had cut the deceased’s throat but knew that he had done so in a fit of rage. He said that he had intended to kill him because of what he had done to young girls in the past. He was charged with murder and remanded in custody. 
     
      
    21 He was kept at Cessnock and a psychiatric registrar recommended that he be referred to the Community Mental Health Court Liaison Service for a mental health assessment. He was placed in a cell with another man, Robert Gregory Manning. At about 1:45 am on 4 June 2002 a nurse was summoned to the cell following the accused’s complaint of nausea. He was agitated. The nurse provided him with medicine and spoke to Mr Manning. Both were polite and there did not appear to be any problem between them. The nurse wondered whether the accused should be sharing a cell and asked another officer about it. It was ascertained that the accused had a phobia of paedophiles and that Manning was not a paedophile. Things were left as they were. 
     
      
    22 At 4:10 am on 5 June 2002 officers attended an alarm call from the accused’s cell. When they arrived Mr Manning was lying in the middle of the floor of the cell with blood around his head. The accused was present and kept repeating the words, “What have I done?”. Then he said, “I’ve killed him”. 
     
      
    23 Mr Manning was taken to Royal Newcastle Hospital and the following injuries were recorded - 
     
      
       
      1. A head injury involving the left frontal lobe together with extradural haematomas on the right temporal and right frontal areas as well as bilateral anterior cranial fossa fractures; 
       
       
      2. Facial injuries including an undisplaced fracture of the nasal bones and anterior/posterior ethmoidial complex and a minimally displaced tripod fracture of the right zygomatic arch. There was a fracture floor of the right orbit; 
       
       
      3. Neck injuries including undisplaced spinous process fractures of C7 and C5. 
       
      
    24 Mr Manning was still in a coma on 17 June. He has suffered a very severe head injury as a result of which he remains fully dependent. He will be left with permanent and severe disabilities as a result of his injuries. 
     
      
    25 The accused was taken to Cessnock police station where he was interviewed. He said that he had killed the man because he thought he was a paedophile, that he, the accused, had hearts in his hands, clubs, hearts, killer whales and a snake and a female and male killer whale. He felt that he was the chosen one from God to kill all paedophiles off the face of the earth. He described in detail how he caused injury to Mr Manning. He said that he choked Mr Manning, kicked him in the head and stomped on his head. He wrapped his head in a blanket. 
     
      
    26 The accused has been kept in custody ever since those events. On 16 July 2002 he was seen by a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore. Before Dr Westmore visited the place where the accused was being held he was made aware of the history of the case and, I think, of the accused’s personal history. The accused told Dr Westmore that he just heard voices telling him to go and kill John Barr. He said that the radio and television told him to kill him. He said that he only did it for the kids, that Mr Barr was a paedophile and had openly admitted the fact to him. He said that he, the accused, had been molested when he was a child and that he did not like paedophiles. When asked how he knew that Mr Barr was a paedophile he said that he told him that he was and the television and radio told him to kill him. He told Dr Westmore about the attempted murder of Mr Manning. He said that he strangled him first and jumped on his head because the voices on the radio told him that he was a paedophile too. He observed that straight after he had murdered a paedophile they had put him into a cell with a paedophile. It was a set up, he said. 
     
      
    27 Dr Westmore saw the accused again in January 2003. By that time the accused was being held at the Long Bay Prison Complex. He had been the subject of a continuing regime of psychiatric treatment. He had been taking high doses of anti-psychotic drugs at morning and at night. Speaking of the killing of Mr Barr the accused told Dr Westmore that he had heard voices on the television and radio. He said that he did not hear them any more because he had been taking his medication. He said that the voices that had told him to kill Mr Barr had been present for about twelve months before he had killed him. He said that he had not been taking his medication for a period of about five months before the homicide. 
     
      
    28 Statements elsewhere in the papers suggest that he had not taken medication for as much as eighteen months before that event. 
     
      
    29 He told Dr Westmore that he had been hearing voices for some considerable time and that the radio had been talking to him since he was twenty years old. 
     
      
    30 Dr Westmore thinks that the accused is fit to be tried. He understands what a criminal trial is designed to achieve, the roles played by the judge, the jury and counsel. The accused can answer the charges and instruct his counsel accordingly so as to make a defence. 
     
      
    31 Dr Allnutt, psychiatrist, saw the accused in March 2003 on behalf of the Crown. He, too, was supplied with documents setting out the history of the matter and had access to documents recording the psychiatric history of the accused. The accused gave Dr Allnutt a bizarre account of his thoughts and attitudes at the time leading up to the time of his killing Mr Barr. He said that he was hearing voices of what he described as “the human nation”, which was those people still alive on earth after he had slain all rapists, paedophiles and “rock spiders”. He said that the voices of the human nation hounded him because there were still some paedophiles left on earth. When he was at the house of the deceased the voices told him that he would have to kill Mr Barr in order to become a king. He had to leave the meal table because the voices were becoming intense. He went to lie down. He was distressed. He did not want to kill Mr Barr but he was a paedophile and he, the accused, had to go to gaol by killing a paedophile. He believed that when he got to gaol he would have another heart attack and would then have an opportunity to kill all the paedophiles in the gaol. He would be released after that, get a pardon from the Government and then be made king. He told Dr Allnutt that he was still waiting for that to happen. He said that he knew that it was wrong killing Mr Barr but he had to murder him because he, the accused, would have died if he had not. 
     
      
    32 Describing the attack on Mr Manning, the accused told Dr Allnutt that he thought that Mr Manning was a weirdo and that the voices of the human nation and voices from the television and radio told him that he was a paedophile and that he had to kill him. He believed that he had a microchip in his head and messages were being communicated to him by means of it by people around him. When he was in the cell with Mr Manning at night he continued to receive commands to kill. He obeyed the voices. 
     
      
    33 Dr Westmore is of the opinion that the accused was suffering from a schizophrenic illness, possibly of a paranoid type with a chronic course at the time of the events giving rise to the charges. He thinks that the accused also qualifies for the diagnosis polysubstance abuse. Schizophrenia is a disease of the mind. Dr Westmore believes that that disease would have totally deprived the accused of his capacity to know that he ought not to kill Mr Barr or attempt to kill Mr Manning. 
     
      
    34 Dr Allnutt thinks that the accused would fail an objective test of knowledge of wrongfulness of his acts. He thought it interesting to note that the accused might have felt personally reluctant to kill and to attempt to kill but noted that the possible reluctance was overridden by the delusional belief of the accused that there was external moral expectation that he behave in the manner in which he did. This was described by Dr Allnutt as delusional justification. Dr Allnutt thinks that there would have been a significant deficit in the capacity of the accused to integrate external and internal experiences and that his value system would have been substantially distorted by his delusional beliefs and would thereby have impaired his capacity to know the wrongfulness of what he was doing. 
     
      
    35 Both psychiatrists agree that the accused has the defence of not guilty on the ground of mental illness available to him. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion the accused has proved that at the time of the events giving rise to the charges he was mentally ill and is entitled to succeed in the defence of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. He must therefore be found not guilty of each of the charges. 
     
      
    37 Ever since the time of his arrest the accused has been treated with anti-psychotic drugs. Although some of the things he said to Dr Allnutt suggest that he is not altogether free of psychotic belief, the evidence shows that he is now much better than at the time of his arrest. He no longer appears to be in the acute phase of his illness. Accordingly, and in this respect I rely particularly on the opinion of Dr Westmore, no question arises whether the accused is unfit to be tried. He has demonstrated that he understands the trial process and the functions of those who take part in it and that demonstrates to the Court that he has the capacity to elect for trial by judge without a jury. 
     
      
    38 The evidence shows that the accused needs to be treated with anti-psychotic medication and that his treatment should be supervised by a psychiatrist. 
     
      
    39 It is necessary to say a number of other things. The events giving rise to these charges have been distressing and perplexing for the family of Mr Barr and for Mr Manning and his family and for the accused’s family and others who have been touched by these events. The sympathy of the Court goes out to the victims and all those who have been affected. 
     
      
    40 The statute which governs cases like this requires me to make an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice that will mean that the accused will be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990. A strict statutory regime will then come into effect. 
     
      
    41 The Mental Health Review Tribunal is a body of professional experts. Within 14 days after the verdict the Tribunal will commence a review of the case of the accused. When it has done its review the Tribunal will make a recommendation to the Minister for Health. That recommendation may be either unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. If the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release, it may make a recommendation as to his release. If it makes such a recommendation that will be considered by the Department of Health which in turn will advise the Governor-in-Council. The Governor-in-Council will then, in accordance with the recommendation and advice, either make an order for the detention of the accused or for his release, conditional or unconditional. The Governor-in-Council may only make an order for release where the Tribunal itself has recommended release. Assuming that no recommendation for release is made after the first hearing the Mental Health Review Tribunal can at any later time, and must at least once every six months, review the case of the accused. 
     
      
    42 After hearing the evidence at any later review, it must make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the continued detention, care or treatment of the accused or as to his release, conditional or unconditional. The Tribunal is not free at any such review to make a recommendation for release unless it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. Again following such a review and recommendation the matter goes to the Department of Health and the Minister advises the Governor-in-Council. Any recommendation so advised can be carried into effect only by order of the Governor-in-Council. 
     
      
    43 If the accused were at any time released back into the public on conditions and there were a breach of any of those conditions, the Governor-in-Council might order that the accused be apprehended and detained. Such an order would follow by reason of the practical consideration that if a person were released, the Department of Health would maintain a watch over his case with the assistance of a Community Health Centre, a private psychiatrist, or one of the other public facilities available. In other words, if a person is released conditionally back into the community, then the Department maintains a watch over him and a breach of any condition will lead to his being apprehended and detained once again. 
     
      
    44 The conditions which could be applied include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication and so on, to ensure that the accused was properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic patients. 
     
      
    45 The only manner in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient for the purposes of these provisions is when he is unconditionally released by the Governor-in-Council, or is released upon conditions which include a condition as to the time that his release should become unconditional. If that time expires, then his release becomes unconditional and he ceases to be a forensic patient. However, as I previously explained, the accused will never be released unless the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered. 
     
      
    46 I find that the accused is not guilty of either of the charges by reason of mental illness. I order that he be detained in the psychiatric ward of the hospital at Long Bay Correctional Centre or such other place as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 18 April 1994, in the District Court at Coffs Harbour, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of two offences alleged to have been committed at Bowraville near Coffs Harbour on 15 September 1992, namely: 
     
      
      (1) being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a firearm, robbing Stephen Randall Mulholland and Deborah Yvonne Mulholland of a sum of money, a quantity of cannabis leaf and a number of firearms; and  
       
      (2) having sexual intercourse with Deborah Yvonne Mulholland without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting.  
       
      
    2 He was sentenced to a substantial term of imprisonment, which was subsequently reduced on appeal to a total of 13 years imprisonment from 9 March 1993, with a minimum term expiring on 8 March 2003. 
     
      
    3 The appellant also appealed against conviction, and this appeal was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 20 June 1995.  
     
      
    4 On 9 June 1997, the appellant made an application under s.474D of the Crimes Act 1900, seeking a review of this conviction. This application was dismissed by Barr J on 29 August 2000. 
     
      
    5 On 12 June 2002, the appellant made an application to the Governor under s.474B of the Crimes Act, seeking a further review of his conviction. On 28 January 2003, the Attorney-General referred the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s.474C(1)(b) of the Crimes Act; and this is the matter I am now dealing with. Section 474L of the Crimes Act requires the Court to deal with this reference as if it were an appeal against conviction by the convicted person.  
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE AT THE TRIAL 
      
    6 The Crown case was that, on 15 September 1992, at around 9pm, Mr. and Mrs. Mulholland were victims of a home invasion committed by four men, during which time Mrs. Mulholland was also sexually assaulted.  
     
      
    7 At the trial, Mr. Mulholland gave evidence that four men entered his property via the kitchen, wearing balaclavas and holding firearms. They hurried into the lounge room. One of the men was holding a .357 Magnum revolver. Another man, on the Crown case, the appellant, looked familiar to Mr. Mulholland, who saw his skin through open stitching in the balaclava. His hair was receding and pulled back in a ponytail, and his teeth were broken with gaps. He was holding a .32 calibre pistol in his right hand, and .303 calibre rifle in his right hand. He was slouching and he walked in a loping style. 
     
      
    8 The men demanded money and drugs, and Mr. Mulholland was taken into the bedroom while it was searched, and he was later taken outside where he was forced to dig up a number of barrels. He was subsequently tied up in the lounge room, and asked about the whereabouts of his rifles.  
     
      
    9 Mr. Mulholland’s evidence was that he heard sounds from the bedroom suggestive of a sexual assault. Two men were keeping watch over Mr. Mulholland, demanding money and holding shotguns to his head. At one point, one of the men came out from the bedroom and slapped him in the face, saying “That’s for fucking a brother”. The man’s face was close up to him and Mr. Mulholland noticed six to eight weeks’ of growth on the man’s face, and that he had missing teeth. Mr. Mulholland’s evidence was that he recognised this man as the appellant. The fourth man then came out of the bedroom, and Mr. Mulholland was threatened. Threats were also made in respect of his children. Subsequently, the four men left the house. Throughout the incident, Mr. Mulholland had been physically assaulted and threatened, and several thousand dollars were taken as well as quantities of cannabis and four rifles: a single barrelled Boito shotgun, and single shot .22 calibre rifle, a ten shot .22 calibre rifle, and a ten shot pump action rifle.  
     
      
    10 Mr. Mulholland gave evidence that he had met the appellant once before, in early 1991. The appellant came to his property with another man, and they stayed for over an hour. The appellant had spoken to Mrs. Mulholland, who had been in the kitchen, and said something like “G’day darlin’, how you goin’ darlin’”. The appellant then had shoulder-length hair, which was receding, bad teeth, a slight pot belly and he walked with a slouch.  
     
      
    11 In cross-examination, Mr. Mulholland agreed he had made three statements to police: on 27 January 1993, and subsequently in February and April 1993. The first statement was deficient in detail and contained errors, mainly because he felt pressure: he said he had dropped off his children to school that morning and needed to pick them up that afternoon. He agreed that over time the level of detail in the statement increased. He also agreed that in taxation proceedings taken against him, he would have lied about money earned by him from his drug crops.  
     
      
    12 Mrs. Mulholland gave evidence that she had been in bed when she heard a scream, and she saw men in dark clothing and rifles inside the house. One of them came into the bedroom and told her “Shut up, darlin’, I’m not going to hurt you darlin’, everything’s going to be alright”. She heard the other men talking about drugs and money, and asking her husband where he kept the rifles. Her bedroom was searched, and one of the men went through her drawers and said “Why don’t you put these pretty things on”. This man had a ponytail. Mrs. Mulholland’s feet were tied with packaging tape, and her nightie was ripped off, and she was told to open her legs. At some point, one of the men forced her legs apart and put his gloved fingers in her vagina. Later, Mrs. Mulholland overheard the men make threats about her children, and she heard the man who sexually assaulted her hit her husband and say “That’s for fucking a brother”.  
     
      
    13 Mrs. Mulholland’s evidence was that, when the man in her bedroom had spoken to her, she recognised the voice, but at the time could not put a name to the voice. However, after the men had left, her husband said “It was the Heustons”, and Mrs. Mulholland immediately knew the man had been the appellant. She had previously met the appellant in the circumstances described by Mr. Mulholland in his evidence. She remembered his voice because the manner in which he spoke to her when she first met him was offensive to her.  
     
      
    14 Although both the Mulhollands received injuries, and although Mrs. Mulholland had to have a broken tooth attended to professionally, they did not report the matter to the police immediately, because of the threats that had been made to them. A week or so after the event, they did attend the rooms of a consulting psychologist, Mr. McCombie, and told him they had been robbed and that Mrs. Mulholland had been sexually assaulted, and they mentioned the Heustons. Later on, Mr. Mulholland realised that the police suspected him of cultivating and supplying drugs, and on 27 January 1993 he went to the police station, reported the attack and set about negotiating an indemnity from prosecution from drug offences in return for giving evidence against the appellant and the other two Heustons, whom he named as three of the attackers. He identified the appellant as one of the men who sexually assaulted Mrs. Mulholland.  
     
      
    15 A number of police officers gave evidence for the Crown, namely Detective Sergeant Stuart Ware, Detective Senior Constable David Minehan, Detective Senior Constable Michael Fabris, and Senior Sergeant Gordon Smith.  
     
      
    16 Sergeant Ware’s evidence was that he was present during a search of the property of the appellant’s brother (Eric Heuston) on 9 March 1993, where two barrels were removed from underneath thick grass. They contained a .357 Magnum replica revolver and six replica bullets in the chamber, and a box of 50 .32 calibre pistol cartridges and four balaclavas. The Magnum replica revolver was a silver revolver, which accorded with the description that had been given by Mr. Mulholland in his first statement on 27 January 1993. It contained some markings, which accorded with a more detailed description given by Mr. Mulholland in one of his later statements.  
     
      
    17 Senior Constable Minehan and Senior Constable Fabris gave evidence of conversations with the appellant on 9 March 1993, of which Minehan had taken notes in his notebook. Both of them attended the appellant’s house to execute a search warrant and Fabris cautioned him and asked if he would accompany them to his brother’s house, which he did. When they arrived, Fabris asked the appellant if he knew anything about the two kegs found in the yard, one of which had a silver Magnum pistol. The appellant said he did not know anything about them. The appellant was led to the area where the barrels were located. Fabris said that the kegs were found among the reeds and “You’re here most days, you would have seen the kegs”, to which the appellant replied “Yeah”. The appellant was asked what else had been in the barrel, and he replied “The silver replica pistol, the .32 pistol and the rifle which was shortened and came apart”. The .32 pistol and the rifle were not in the barrel, the appellant was asked if he knew where they were, to which the appellant said “I don’t know. Eric must have moved them”.  
     
      
    18 Fabris then brought up, for the first time, the home invasion and cautioned the appellant. The appellant was escorted to Kempsey Police Station where he refused to be electronically interviewed. Fabris told the appellant that Minehan would, in that case, continue to record their conversation in his police notebook. Fabris put the circumstance of the home invasion to the appellant who said “I just wasn’t there”. When asked if he knew Stephen Mulholland, the appellant said “No I’ve never met him”; and the same went for Deborah Mulholland. When asked where he had been on 15 September 1992, the appellant said “I really don’t know”. Minehan read the notebook entries to the appellant, who then signed it.  
     
      
    19 Fabris left the interview room to bring in an independent officer (Senior Sergeant Gordon Smith) who spoke to the appellant and verified the veracity of the interview. Afterwards Fabris asked the appellant a further question “Who owned the two barrels which were found at Eric’s property which had the guns in them”, and the appellant replied “We all do”.  
     
      
       
      THE DEFENCE CASE AT THE TRIAL 
      
    20 The appellant made an unsworn statement to the jury in which he said that he was not present at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Mulholland on the night of 15 September 1992, and that he had been in a darts competition. He had in fact never met these people and had never been to their property. He said that he had never had a pot belly nor a ponytail, and he had his front teeth removed on 19 June 1992. He had never used the expression “darling” towards women. He said that Fabris belted him when he denied being involved in the home invasion, and that he did not mention any guns to the police. He said that at the police station, he asked if the interview could be videotaped, and was told the machine was broken. The appellant saw Minehan writing in his notebook, and Fabris kept hitting the appellant until he would sign it, which he did because he was scared and he had had enough after five hours. He did not read the notebook before signing it. He had not complained to the independent officer because he simply did not believe he was truly independent of the others.  
     
      
    21 A number of the appellant’s acquaintances, and the appellant’s wife, gave evidence that the appellant was seen at the Macleay River Hotel on the night of 15 September 1992, although he did not appear to have been in the darts competition on that night. The appellant was not always clean-shaven. Sometimes he had a couple of days’ growth on his face, but not six to eight weeks. He had not been seen with hair down to his collar, in a ponytail, nor with a beer gut. There was nothing unusual about the way the appellant walked. He was not heard to use the word “darling”, although one acquaintance had heard him use that word occasionally.  
     
      
       
      APPEAL 
      
    22 After the appellant had been convicted on 18 April 1994, he appealed against his conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal, relying on four matters. First, it was contended that the trial judge was in error in leaving to the jury the evidence of Mrs. Mulholland as the identification of the appellant as the person who sexually assaulted her. Second, it was contended that the trial judge’s directions on the question of identification were inadequate. Third, it was contended that the judge should have warned the jury of the dangers of finding the appellant guilty on the basis of police evidence that he made admissions in police custody, where these were disputed and there was no independent corroboration. Finally, it was contended that the conviction was unsafe and satisfactory. As I have mentioned, that appeal was dismissed: R v. Heuston, Court of Criminal Appeal, 20/6/95 unreported.  
     
      
    23 The appellant also sought leave to appeal against his sentence, and that leave was granted and the appeal against sentence was allowed on 28 November 1995. The substituted sentence was one of four years fixed on count 2, from 9 March 1993 to 8 March 1997; and on count 1, a minimum sentence of six years from 9 March 1997 to 8 March 2003, and an additional term of three years from 9 March 2003.  
     
      
    24 On 7 June 1996, the appellant was sentenced on other matters, being given effectively eight years from 3 March 2003 to 2 March 2011, with a non-parole period of five years expiring 2 March 2008. An appeal against that conviction and that sentence was dismissed on 23 December 1996.  
     
      
       
      PREVIOUS APPLICATION 
      
    25 As noted earlier, in 1997 the appellant made an application for an enquiry pursuant to s.474B of the Crimes Act. This application was in relation to the convictions on 18 April 1994, and also the convictions that gave rise to the sentencing on 7 June 1996. The application was refused by Barr J on 29 August 2000.  
     
      
    26 In relation to the subject convictions, the appellant’s grounds were as follows. First, there was the alleged unreliability of the evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Mulholland: one aspect of this was Mr. Mulholland’s explanation of the deficiency of his statement on 27 January 1993 that he was in a rush to collect his children from Bowraville Central School, where enquiries now showed that the school term in 1993 did not commence until 2 February. Second, there was the material concerning honesty of police witnesses arising from the Police Royal Commission, in particular adverse comments concerning Detective Sergeant Ware and Detective Sergeant Fabris. Third, there was the failure of police to investigate relevant evidence, in particular, failure to investigate whether a Boito shotgun, found in the possession of other persons as a result of a suggestion by the appellant, was the one allegedly stolen from the Mulhollands. Next, there was the acquittal of Eric Heuston of charges concerning the same incident. Finally, the alibi evidence was relied on again.  
     
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    27 The appellant relies on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. There now exists fresh evidence that demonstrates the Appellant's convictions were a miscarriage of justice. 
         
        Particulars 
         
        as set out in the affidavits of David Phillip Barrow and David Alexander Wetmore:  
         
        (a) evidence from the Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service in 1996 of corrupt conduct on the part of Stuart Ware, an investigating police officer. 
         
        (b) evidence from an internal police investigation in 1999 (into Task Force Magnum) of the corrupt conduct of Michael Fabris, an investigating police officer. 
         
        (c) evidence from the Police Integrity Commission (Operation Florida) in 2000-2 of the corruption of investigating police, namely: 
         
          
          (i) Michael Fabris 
           
          (ii) David Minehan 
           
          (iii) Dennis O'Toole (the officer in charge of the matter) 
          
         
        (d) evidence of the failure of investigating police to investigate a relevant matter, namely: the location of firearms answering the description of those stolen from the home of the complainants in this matter and clothing consistent with that allegedly worn by the attackers at the home of Craig Goodwin. 
         
        (e) evidence that the Bowraville Public School term had not commenced, contrary to the evidence of the complainant Stephen Mulholland, which was relevant to his credibility. 
         
         
        2. The trial miscarried by reason of the trial judge's failure to direct the jury in relation to the significance of the delay in the making of the complaint by Stephen and Deborah Mulholland. 
         
         
        3. The submission to the jury by the Crown Prosecutor ‘Why would Mr and Mrs Mulholland falsely identify the accused?' occasioned a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
      EVIDENCE ON APPEAL 
      
    28 The appellant relied on material which had been put before Barr J, and also on material from a subsequent investigation by the Police Integrity Commission into the Major Crime Squad North, relating to all members of that squad, and in particular Detective Fabris and Detective Minehan. 
     
      
    29 First, there was evidence given before the Commission by a police officer under the code name M5. He gave evidence that when he joined the Armed Holdup Unit attached to the Major Crime Squad North in 1987, it was divided up into two teams of officers, both of which were under the direct supervision of Detective Senior Sergeant Dennis O’Toole. M5 was at the Chatswood Branch, working with Detective Fabris, who arrived there in about 1992, and Detective Minehan. M5 admitted that he had verballed suspects, planted evidence, prepared and used false statements for use in judicial proceedings, and committed perjury. He testified that the squad had a cache of weapons which were used for planting on suspects. They were items which had been seized from offenders but not declared as exhibits against those persons. There was also ammunition, balaclavas and other items. He said that the practice in the squad was, whenever there was an armed robbery, the witness’ statement would be looked at for a description of the weapons and a similar gun would be selected to “load up” suspects. He said that there were occasions when offenders were found with legitimate exhibits, and it was not necessary to use the illegitimate weapons. He said that Detective Minehan and another officer took a pistol to a job in Coffs Harbour, but did not use it because it was not required.  
     
      
    30 M5 said that the cache of weapons was not a secret among the members of the squad. All the members of the squad had some control over it and there was a master key. He said that after Trevor Haken rolled over during the Police Royal Commission, there was an attempt to “clean up the act a bit”. He had helped remove and dump illegal weapons in the Hawkesbury River in about August 1995. He gave evidence that after he told Detective Sergeant O’Toole that a suspect, M11, was not involved in certain robberies but possibly had a knowledge of them, Detective Sergeant O’Toole said “Well, you’re going to have to give him a gun”; and that took place at a later stage.  
     
      
    31 There was also very substantial material concerning Detective Fabris, which, by reason of the provisions of the Police Integrity Commission Act 1996, should not be set out in this public judgment. Suffice it to say that the material would show him to be a person prepared to commit perjury in criminal trials and to “verbal” and “load” suspects.  
     
      
    32 In addition, Detective Fabris was interviewed in relation to the applicant’s arrest in this matter. He admitted that a bag contained guns and balaclavas were taken from the office with a view to using them to incriminate the appellant, but he asserted that they were not used, and that the notes taken of the interview with the appellant, which the appellant signed, were genuine.  
     
      
    33 Detective Minehan gave evidence that he had served with the Major Crime Squad North for about five years, but denied any wrong-doing. He admitted the existence of a locker with guns in it, but asserted they were for “demonstration” purposes. He denied knowledge of the use of such weapons to load up suspects, and denied knowledge of any practice of verballing suspects. He denied any involvement in the dumping of weapons in the Hawkesbury River. He denied planting guns in respect of this case. 
     
      
    34 Detective Senior Sergeant O’Toole gave evidence that he was the supervising senior sergeant of the Armed Holdup Unit of Major Crime Squad North from 1989 to 1994. He too admitted knowledge of a cupboard with guns, but asserted they were for demonstration purposes. He denied any knowledge of planting guns on suspects involving officers of the Unit, and denied participation in that practice or in verballing. 
     
      
    35 Another former detective gave evidence under the name N1, asserting that Detective Sergeant O’Toole received stolen cash from a suspect, and told him he was there to look after the interests of the squad when it came to division of stolen money. He also said that all members of the team (including Detective Minehan) used weapons from the illegal cache of weapons to load suspects; that O’Toole had been involved with “load ups” with him; and that O’Toole’s job was usually to be the senior man who “oversighted the verbal or as the senior man and allegedly disassociated from the actual investigation, his evidence was to lend weight to what had happened”.  
     
      
    36 There were also affidavits from the solicitor and barrister from the original trial as to how they would have proceeded had this material been available to them. 
     
      
    37 The Crown called evidence from Senior Constable Walsh and Detective Sergeant O’Neill. Senior Constable Walsh was not a member of the Major Crime Squad North; and it was he who found the barrels in the grass at Eric Heuston’s place. Detective Sergeant O’Neill gave evidence that he saw Walsh locate the barrels and saw Detective Sergeant Ware open them, and remove inter alia the .357 Magnum replica and the box of .32 cartridges. Detective Sergeant O’Neill was cross-examined as to the practices of the Major Crime Squad North, including the existence of a stash of guns and their disposal in the Hawkesbury River. Detective Sergeant O’Neill denied any knowledge of these matters.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 1 
      
    38 Mr. Game SC for the appellant submitted that, had this material been available, Detective Fabris would have been exposed as a perjurer, who regularly verballed suspects and loaded them up. There would have been effective cross-examination of Minehan, O’Toole and O’Neill concerning the stash of guns, and the taking of guns to Coffs Harbour with the intention of planting them. In those circumstances, the material concerning Ware, relied on before Barr J, would have been of greater significance. There also would have been more significance in the failure of the police to pursue the question of the origin of the Boito shotgun.  
     
      
    39 Furthermore, Mr. Game submitted, there would have been a more effective attack on the Mulhollands, particularly in relation to the progressive improvement over time of their evidence, in relation to such things as the more precise identification of the silver Magnum replica pistol. Furthermore, the difficulty with Mr. Mulholland’s explanation of his first statement, referring to the need to pick up his children from school, would have had greater significance than appeared before Barr J.  
     
      
    40 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that no challenge was raised in relation to Sergeant Smith, and the appellant’s signature of the notes in the notebook disclosing his knowledge of the weapons was still powerful evidence against him, irrespective of any damage done to the credit of the other police officers. Furthermore, he submitted, the identification evidence of the Mulhollands was strong, and strongly supported the conviction of the appellant.  
     
      
    41 In my opinion, the effect of this new material would have been to permit a very powerful challenge to the police evidence. It would have been possible for the appellant to make out a strong case that the police officers involved from the Major Crime Squad North had taken weapons to Coffs Harbour with a view to planting them on the appellant, and a strong case that at least Detective Fabris was a person prepared to give perjured evidence, and to invent verbals and plant evidence. Although the signature by the appellant of the notebook, and Sergeant Smith’s evidence, and also the identification evidence of the Mulhollands, would still have amounted to strong evidence against the appellant, in my opinion there is a significant possibility that a jury, acting reasonably, would not have been prepared to rely at all on the police evidence, and would have been more sceptical of the other evidence; and for those reasons, would not have convicted the appellant. The possible severe discrediting of the police principally involved in the investigation and the arrest, coupled with the circumstance that the Mulhollands gave evidence by arrangement with the same police in return for an immunity for prosecution, would have been powerful considerations in the appellant’s favour.  
     
      
    42 Accordingly, in my opinion the appeal should be allowed on this ground. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 2 
      
    43 Mr. Game submitted that the appellant did not become aware of the allegation against him until nearly six months after the offence, so that he was severely disadvantaged in meeting the prosecution case. In particular, he was unable to call effective alibi evidence, or evidence in relation to the appellant’s appearance at the time. Furthermore, he was deprived of the ability to test the Mulhollands’ evidence concerning their injuries. He submitted that the jury should have been told of these disadvantages: R v. BWT (2002) 54 NSWLR 241.  
     
      
    44 For the Crown, it was submitted that the delay was insufficient in the circumstances to require a warning. The prosecution was equally disadvantaged by the delay, in relation to matters such as injuries and investigations at the scene of the offence. It was also submitted that to require a warning in such circumstances could tend to reward offenders who discourage victims to complain by making threats to them. 
     
      
    45 The question of whether in a particular case a direction or warning of the type discussed in BWT (generally called a Longman direction, after Longman v. The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79) is required, and what its content should be, can be very difficult. I expressed some views on this in WRC (2002) 130 ACrimR 89: I dissented in that case, but did so principally on the question whether rule 4 could be applied in the circumstances of the case. Indeed, otherwise I substantially agree with the discussion of the matter in WRC by the majority, Greg James J and Kirby J, except in so far as Kirby J at [141] disagreed with certain comments of Wood CJ at CL in BWT.  
     
      
    46 Longman directions have been required particularly in relation to charges of sexual offences, where there has been a substantial delay, generally many years, in making a complaint.  
     
      
    47 One example of a relatively short delay was Jones v. The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, where no Longman direction had been given, but the conviction was set aside by the High Court on the basis that it was unsafe and unsatisfactory, not on the basis of inadequate directions. In that case the complaint was made about four years after the earliest alleged offence and about three years after the last alleged offence. Gaudron J, McHugh J and Gummow J noted (at p.454) that: “In some cases – and we thought that this was one – the delay in making the complaint may be so long that it hampers an accused person’s right to defend himself or herself.” They continued (at pp.454-5): 
     
      
       
        
        As a result of the long delay in this case, the appellant's opportunity to obtain evidence refuting the circumstances of each alleged offence was significantly reduced. The appellant's and the complainant's movements on the day of the alleged incident concerning the third count were material facts. Proof of them would have gone far to support one or other of the opposing cases. Similarly, whether or not the appellant and the complainant were ever left alone after Saturday classes was a critical fact concerning the first count. Evidence that the appellant was left alone with the complainant would have been highly damning. But if the complaint had been made promptly and the appellant was innocent as he claimed to be, he may have been able to obtain evidence that, on each Saturday in February 1991, he had left the classes in the company of others. The possibility of finding a witness or witnesses with a clear recollection of the relevant days inevitably became more remote as the delay in making the complaint became greater.  
         
         
        The difficulty that the delay caused the appellant is illustrated by the concession of Ms Darvall that it was possible that there had been occasions when the appellant had not driven her home from Saturday gym classes in February 1991. Given the time that had elapsed since the alleged incident, her concession was inevitable. While her evidence indicated that the appellant almost invariably took her home from Saturday classes, the delay and its effect on her recollection forced her to concede that she may not have been present on one of the relevant Saturdays. As a result, the appellant may have been deprived of a cast iron alibi that would have brought about his acquittal.  
        
       
      
    48 Some of those comments are applicable to this case; but they were not made in the course of determining what, if any, direction was required.  
     
      
    49 Kirby J dissented in Jones; and he noted (at p.464) that: “The circumstances of this case fall far short of those in Longman v. The Queen, where the delay was of the order of 21 to 25 years.” 
     
      
    50 I find it difficult to determine whether a Longman direction was called for in this case. There was a delay of about four months in the making of a complaint, and of about six months before the appellant was notified of the complaint. He was thereby disadvantaged in the sense that he did not have the alibi evidence which he may have had if there had been no delay and if he was innocent. However, this does not appear to have been a case where there was any significant possibility that delay could have caused the prosecution evidence to give a misleading appearance of plausibility, which is in my view an important consideration in determining whether a Longman direction is required and what its content should be. In R v. WRC at [76], I said: 
     
      
       
        
        In each of the present cases, in my opinion the  
        Longman 
         direction that was called for was a warning to the effect that the evidence of the complainant and the principal supporting witness had to be considered with great care, and with the appreciation that this evidence may give a misleading appearance of plausibility, because of the lapse of time and because of the consequential disadvantages faced by the appellant in testing it and meeting it. The disadvantages should have been explained as including the difficulty of testing the evidence of the witnesses where the details could not be effectively explored, whether because of understandable lack of detail in the appellant's instructions, understandable lack of detail in the witnesses' answers, inability to test those answers against circumstances that could have been the subject of effective independent checking, or all of these matters; and as also including the difficulties of bringing forward independent evidence which could contradict the account given by the Crown witnesses and support the account given by the appellant. 
        
       
       
      That kind of warning was not called for in this case. 
       
      
    51 However, I think the better view is that, for abundant caution, a direction should have been given along the lines that, in deciding whether they have a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused, the jury should take into account the circumstance that, by reason of the delay in the making of the complaint, and in bringing it to the accused’s attention, the accused’s ability to challenge the prosecution case and to make out any positive defence was reduced; and in particular, although it was not possible to know just what evidence as to his whereabouts and activities at the time of the offence the accused might have been able to call if there had not been this delay, certainly the particular attack made by the prosecution on the alibi evidence that the accused in fact called, based as it was on delay, could not have been effectively made. 
     
      
    52 The determination of this appeal does not require a decision as to whether a Longman direction was required or as to its content. However, I am inclined to the view that the absence of such a direction would not in any event have justified the allowing of an appeal on this ground after such a length of time: cf. R v. Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 3 
      
    53 Mr. Game pointed out that in his summing up, the trial judge, while setting out submissions of the Crown Prosecutor, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown went on to deal with any motive that Mr. Mulholland or Mrs. Mulholland would have had for falsely identifying the accused and said “Well, why would he do that?”.  
        
       
      
    54 No objection was made to the Crown submission, and no direction was sought from the trial judge. A number of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal have disapproved of such a submission: R v. Uhrig NSWCCA 24/10/96; R v. E (1996) 39 NSWLR 450; R v. Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520. Mr. Game submitted that the effect of such a question is to invite the jury to speculate, it is unfair to the accused who is not in a position to see into the mind of the witness, and it could tend to suggest a reversal of the onus of proof.  
     
      
    55 In my opinion, the trial judge should have directed the jury to disregard that submission, and warned the jury against such speculation. However, particularly in circumstances where the matter was not raised at the trial, I do not think this would be sufficient to justify the allowing of an appeal on this ground after such a length of time: cf. Gregory. 
     
      
       
      APPEAL OR NEW TRIAL 
      
    56 Mr. Game submitted that the prosecution case was now very weak: the police evidence was now shown to be weak, and the identification evidence had always been weak, as contended in the earlier appeal, and in any event was now possibly subject to further attack associated with the attack now available on the police evidence.  
     
      
    57 In my opinion, the material relied on by the Crown, in particular the signed notebook, Sergeant Smith’s evidence, and the identification evidence, is sufficient to justify a new trial. There would be point in conducting such a trial, because I propose to act under the Crime Sentencing Procedure Act s.59 and back-date the other sentences, with the result that the appellant will have effectively served only a small part of his sentence for these very serious alleged offences.  
     
      
    58 In circumstances where a new trial is being ordered, no question arises as to the grant of a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967. 
     
      
    59 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Convictions quashed. 
       
      3. New trial ordered. 
       
      4. Sentences imposed on 7 June 1996 backdated so as to have commenced on 9 March 1993. 
       
      
    60 The result of Order 4 will be that the appellant will have completed those sentences on 8 March 2001, and can apply for bail in respect of the present matters. 
     
      
    61 SIMPSON J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    62 GREG JAMES J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 MASON P: This is an application for leave to appeal against a ruling made by Barr J. The applicant, Mr Kanaan, is due to be tried on serious offences commencing on 7 July next. Barr J is not the trial judge but he was the judge that heard and determined an application made by Mr Kanaan for permission to use as a McKenzie friend at the trial the services of a Mr Simpson. Mr Simpson is, we have been informed, presently on remand. He has a number of other convictions for criminal offences. 
     
      
    2 Barr J refused the application having ascertained from Mr Kanaan and from his former legal representatives that Mr Kanaan had a grant of legal aid; that with that grant he had retained solicitor and counsel but that he had decided to dispense with their services and to represent himself with the assistance, subject to the permission of the Court, of a McKenzie friend. Mr Kanaan gave Barr J his reasons for wanting to proceed that way. 
     
      
    3 It is not necessary to consider whether the ruling made by Barr J amounts to an order that is subject to a right to seek leave to appeal under s 5 F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Assuming it is, nothing that has been put to us in the written and oral submissions on behalf of the applicant indicates any basis for doubting the correctness of his Honour's conclusion or otherwise considering that it is appropriate for a grant of leave to appeal. 
     
      
    4 Accordingly, I propose that leave to appeal be refused. 
     
      
    5 DOWD J: I agree. 
     
      
    6 ADAMS J: I agree but I wish to add that this observation, in light of the possibility that the application might be renewed at trial. It seems to me that it would only be in extremely exceptional circumstances that the Court would give leave to a person to act as a McKenzie friend who had convictions for serious offences or was serving a sentence or in custody on remand for a serious criminal offence. 
     
      
    7 MASON P: I agree with the additional remarks of Adams J. 
     
      
    8 DOWD J:  As do I. 
     
      
    9 MASON P: The application for leave is refused.

      INTRODUCTION 
      
    2 Daryl Bruce Lewis (“appellant”) was tried on 21 February 2000 before Backhouse DCJ and a jury. He was charged with nine counts of assault, rape and indecent assault, as set out below, pleading not guilty to each count. The charges and maximum penalty were as follows; the actual sentence for each count is at [3] below:

         Maximum Penalty: 2 years imprisonment 
         
         
         Count 2: 
         Rape

    3 The complainants were two sisters and the events in question were said to have occurred between January 1975 and 31 March 1977 when the appellant was aged between 14 and 16. On 7 March 2000 the jury convicted on all counts. On 14 December 2000 he was sentenced as set out below.

    4 The first four counts relate to the complainant V who was born on 30 March 1961. Depending on the time when the relevant charged offence occurred, she was either just under 14 or between 14 and 16.  
     
      
    5 The remaining five counts relate to the complainant D who was born on 4 February 1964. She was the youngest of the three N sisters, the middle sister being M born September 1962 who gave evidence for the Crown but was not a complainant. D is the complainant in respect of Counts 5, 6 and 9 relating to allegations of indecent assault and Counts 7 and 8 relating to allegations of rape. She was at, or just under, the age of 12 years in relation to the earliest possible date of these alleged offences and 13 years of age in respect of their latest possible date. The appellant emphasises that these offences, which he denies, were alleged to have taken place when he and the two girls were all juveniles.  
     
      
    6 The sentences were imposed following a trial some twenty-four or so years after the alleged events took place. By the time of trial the appellant was around 40 years old. The effect of the accumulation of his sentence with a sentence he was already serving represents a minimum period of 14 ½ years imprisonment.  
     
      
    7 The appellant appeals against conviction. He also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The grounds of appeal on conviction are as follows:  
     
      
       
      (1) The trial miscarried.  
       
       
      (2) The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown Prosecutor to present an indictment which charged as the first count an assault between 1 March,1975 and 29 March,1976.  
       
       
      (3) The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of assaults by another person.  
       
       
      (4) The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence three statements by M.  
       
       
      (5) The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of indecent and other assaults as “relationship” evidence.  
       
       
      (6) The trial judge erred in giving inadequate and incorrect directions to the jury in respect to “relationship evidence”.  
       
       
      (7) The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to lead as complaint evidence of a conversation between Mrs Md and V.  
       
       
      (8) The trial judge erred in directing the jury “ the fact that a person makes a complaint contemporaneously is evidence of the truth of its contents”.  
       
       
      (9) The trial judge erred in directing the jury “ you may well think that they had good reason for not making any further complaint”.  
       
       
      (10) The trial judge erred in failing to give the jury a proper or adequate “ 
      Longman 
      ” direction.  
       
       
      (11) The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they must consider each count separately and only by the evidence that applied to it.  
       
       
      (12) The trial judge erred in directing the jury “ you should look for support from evidence of other witnesses, albeit they were not present at the time when the actual events are said to have occurred”.  
       
       
      (13) The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of a crime the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care.  
       
       
      (14) The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that if the jury had a reasonable doubt concerning credibility of the evidence of the complainants on one or more counts they could take that into account when assessing her reliability on other counts.  
       
       
      (15) The trial judge erred in allowing impermissible cross-examination of the appellant.  
       
       
      (16) The trial judge erred in failing to sum up the evidence of DP.  
       
       
      (17) The trial judge erred in permitting questioning and herself questioning M in front of the jury.  
       
       
      (18) The trial judge erred in allowing evidence to be lead in re-examination.

      SUMMARY OF TRIAL 
      
    8 The following summary of trial is taken from the Crown’s submissions, which identify first the Crown case and then the appellant’s case. I shall quote the first part, being the summary of the Crown case, from the Crown submissions themselves. I then give a much shorter distillation of the appellant’s case.  
     
      
       
      Crown Case 
       
        
        “ 
        The Crown case may be summarised as follows 
        : 
        The Appellant was born on 10 December 1960 Exhibit A – birth certificate.. 
        V gave evidence that that her name was originally V N and that she was born on 30 March 1961. She was the eldest child and had two younger sisters, M born September 1962 and D born 4 February 1964 T 21.2.00 p 9. exhibit A – birth certificate, T 23.2.00 p 146 exhibit C – birth certificate. 
        Some time in 1972 while she was in her last year of primary school she, her parents and sisters went to live with the Md family at their small farm at Ebenezer near Windsor in New South Wales T 21.2.00 18.10. See also evidence of D 23.2.00 p 147.45. Her mother was then admitted to hospital Mrs N apparently suffered from a mental illness and epilepsy and was admitted to hospital (see evidence of D T 23.2.00 p 146 and the evidence in the case for the Appellant given by Ester Md at T 28.2.00 p 385). This was how the Ns met Mrs Md who had worked as a nurse.  and her father An alcoholic according to D, see T 23.2.00 p 146 went looking for work leaving the three children with the Mds T 21.2.00 p 11.. 
        The farm had an old house, old sheds and bush and a dam. The Mds had cows, a horse, goats, sheep, hens and ducks and a couple of dogs. There were also a number of sheds on the property T 21.2.00 p 11-17. Photographs of the property taken in 1997 by Detective Cox were tendered, exhibit B, T 25.2.00 p260.40.. 
        The Appellant was the eldest son of the Mds and had two younger sisters Bronwyn and Leonie. The Appellant was the eldest of the six children. Bronwyn was about M’s age and Leonie was younger than D  T 21.2.00 p 18.50 . When they first moved there her mother and father slept in one room and she, her sisters and foster sisters slept in another room. After her mother and father left, for a short while she slept in their room on her own T 21.2.00 p 12.. 
        There were two caravans on the property. A small caravan under a verandah and a larger caravan out the back past the laundry. She moved from the bedroom previously occupied by her parents first to the small caravan and then into the big van. One of her sisters then moved into the small caravan  T 21.2.00 p 13.. 
        She and her sisters were under the authority of Mrs Md mainly: “She did the discipline”. They were given chores to do on the property T 21.2.00 p 17.. 
        She went to Windsor Primary School and then started at Windsor High School in 1973 when she was 11 and ¾ years old T 21.2.00 p 18.15. 
        As children they played as a group and played games such as hide and seek and “karate chop” which involved them having to battle the Appellant.  
        The games were rough games and on occasion she would complain to Mrs Md: 
         
          
          “I used to tell Mrs Md that I would get hurt, that he would hurt me and yeah that they were rough. She would tell me “That’s what boys do”. 
          
         
        During these games incidents of a sexual nature would occur: 
         
          
          “ With the karate chop games Darryl would grab you between your legs and sometimes he’d squeeze your nipples to grab you and put you down to the ground so you’d you know you’d cry in pain so you end up being on the ground first”. 
          
         
        During hide and seek: 
         
          
          “Sometimes Darryl would grab me and drag me away and tell me he’d know places to hide and drag me off and we’d hide in places and he’d put his fingers inside my vagina” 
          
         
        Her response was “I’d just try and tell Mrs Md that he hurt me”. Hide and seek was played in the large bushes that surrounded the house and was also played around the packing shed  
         T 21.2.00 p 19. 
        . 
        They also went swimming. She could only remember one dam on the property. She could not swim. She had a one piece swimming costume that Mrs Md gave her. She was about 12 and ½ years old. The costume was too big for her; it had a padded bra like a lady would wear. The Appellant used to throw her in the water and as she could not swim she would struggle and he would think that was funny. At other times he would lead her into deep water and because she could not swim she would have to hold onto him otherwise she would go underneath. The Appellant “used to hold me up by sticking his fingers in my vagina and then push me up” T 21.2.00 p 20-22. 
        She did not like going into the water, she was scared of it and she hated her swimming costume. However Mrs Md would force her to go and on one occasion dragged her out of the toilets where she was hiding by her hair  T 21.2.00 p 23.45. The complainant’s evidence on this point is supported by the evidence of D that they had never been taught to swim and that she observed that the complainant was petrified of the water and used to run off at times when they were told to go swimming. She also observed this incident between Mrs Md and the complainant T 23.2.00 p 152, 153.20.. 
        Sometimes one of the animals on the farm would stray and they would have to go look for them. On some occasions just she and the Appellant would go. She could recall one occasion when she was nearly 13 when she and the Appellant were looking for the dogs. They were looking in the bush across the road from the house. The Appellant pushed her to the ground, climbed on top of her, pushed her dress up, pulled down her pants and forced his penis into her vagina T 21.2.00 p 25.15. 
        They were in a paddock a fair way from the road at the time. She ran away and hid in the bush until it got dark. She went back to the caravan. Mrs Md was waiting. She told her that the Appellant had hurt her but Mrs Md said that boys do that and then belted her with a piece of green siphon hose T 21.2.00 p 25. 
        About a month or so after this incident they were in the orchard. She was up the ladder picking fruit. The Appellant started shaking the ladder. She tried to jump off and stumbled as she fell. The Appellant dragged her to the ground, rolled her over and forced his penis into her vagina. It was a Saturday, it was auction day and some of the other kids had gone off to sell fruit with Mrs Md at McGrath’s Hill. She observed that she had white stuff all over her and she figured it came out of him. She got up, cleaned herself up then started to walk back up to the house. At the house she hid her underpants and put fresh ones on and went back to the orchard  T 21.2.00 p 27.. 
        A few days later the Appellant asked if they could go swimming in the dam. She panicked and said she didn’t want to go and that the Appellant hurt her. Mrs Md responded, “Don’t be stupid boys do things like that”. She was angered by this and said “He makes me have sex with him”. Both the Appellant and Mrs Md proceeded to physically and verbally abuse her.  
         
          
          “Darryl lunged at me and called me filthy slut, grabbed me and was shaking me and she was screaming and I was yelling and she was telling me I shouldn’t say things like that, that he was like a brother to me and I shouldn’t be saying those things, telling lies and she had hold of me and she grabbed the dog chain and she started to hit me with the dog chain…………and she started wailing into me with the dog chain and I tried to get away and she grabbed me by my shirt and she dragged me backwards and managed to drag my shirt off me and told me to get down on my hands and knees and beg for forgiveness for saying such terrible lies about him, so I…yeap, got down on my hands and knees and I said I was sorry to please forgive me…..I laid there for a minute or so. They’d walked away. Mrs Md kicked me a couple of times and threw my shirt at me and told me to get up and I waited a couple of minutes and I got up and I ran away into the bush again”. 
           T 21.2.00 28.25. Her account is corroborated by the evidence of D who witnessed part of this incident. She described what she saw as follows: 
          
         
        
       
      “When I was about 11, V told Mrs Md that…Daryl had been hurting her and touching her and Mrs Md told her that she had to beg for forgiveness for saying such blatant lies. I was hiding around the corner and V was naked and she was kissing Daryl’s feet and Mrs Md was screaming at her. V was begging forgiveness for saying such things” T 23.2.00 p 165.5 
       
        
        After this incident she ran away and hid in the bush and did not come back until the next morning  
         T 21.2.00 p 28.55. 
        . 
        Later the welfare officers came and asked why she ran away. She did not tell them the truth “…because I didn’t want to be taken away and leave my sisters behind. I was too scared” T 21.2.00 p 29.. 
        A few days after that the Appellant confronted her while she was alone and told her that she could never tell any one again and threatened her sisters: 
         
          
          “….Darryl confronted me and told me that I was never to tell anyone ever again what he’d been doing and he started coming over the top of me and telling me that he was going to do something to me that I would never, ever forget and I begged him, told him to leave me alone, I’d do anything he wanted me to, so long as he didn’t hurt my sisters and he was ranting and raving and told me that he was going to have sex with the girls and he was going to tie them up and make the dogs do it to them as well, so I told him that I would do whatever he wanted…” 
           T 21.2.00 p 29.55. See also T 22.2.00 p 84 for further evidence concerning her reasons for not complaining. 
          . 
          
         
        In 1974 she moved into the bigger caravan to sleep there and do her homework there. She was not allowed to lock the van as Mrs Md would want to come in and out when she wanted to: “If you locked it you got a belting for it, so you didn’t”. 
        On one occasion the Appellant told her that he was going to come to the caravan that night T 21.2.00 p 30.55-31.5. She did not know what to do. He turned up and told her to take her clothes off, she begged him not to do anything but “he knocked me around and told me to get my clothes off. She then laid on the bed. He laid on top of her and put his penis in her vagina. After sexual intercourse had occurred “he wanted to have a look at what he’d done so he made me spread my legs and looked at me with the torch. And then told me not to tell anyone and he left” T 21.2.00 p 31.45. 
        A couple of weeks after this incident the Appellant again came over to the van at night. She asked him not to do anything as she had her periods however he said it did not matter: 
         
          
          “…he told me to get undressed and forced me onto the bed. And I was begging him not to. And he said “open your legs” and stuck his fingers inside my vagina and said “Don’t worry about it, it won’t make that much mess” and after he did that he hopped on top and had sex with me” 
           T 21.2.00 p 32.20 
          . 
          
         
        The sheets were stained with blood as a result of this incident, she tried to wash the blood out in the shed but did not know what to then do with them. Mrs Md caught her the next morning putting the rolled up wet sheets into her school bag and belted her for wetting the bed and hung the wet sheets over the front fence 
         T 21.2.00 p 32.35 
        In 1975, when she was nearly 14 and in third year at high school there was an occasion when the Appellant came out to the caravan and told her he “..had heard about something different that women did to men, sucking their penises and he told me we were going to do it”. She told him that she did not want to do it she tried to get out of the caravan but he beat her around the head and she fell hitting her head on something which made her dizzy. He forced her down to her knees and made her suck his penis “… and I was gagging and he was yelling at, yelling or talking at me saying not to bite him, that you just do it and he was pushing my head up and down”. He told her he would belt her if she bit him and when he ejaculated and she gagged he told her she had to swallow it. When she spat it out he forced her head down onto the ground and rubbed her face in it”  T 21.2.00 p 33. The beating inflicted prior to the forced fellatio is the subject of Count 1 on the Indictment, Assault, section 61 Crimes Act 1900.. 
        Another incident occurred when she was 14 and sleeping in the van. The Appellant came out to the caravan and forced penile vaginal intercourse upon her. She described what occurred as follows: 
         
          
          “He come out to the caravan and told me we were going to have sex. And after an initial struggle like we would normally do and I’d ask him not to do it and he would. He climb on the bed and he started to have sex with me….and then he got off”.  
          
         
        By “sex” she meant “put his penis in my vagina” 
        He had a long black torch with him. After he had finished intercourse he got off her “… and all of a sudden it got dark, darker”. Previously the torch had been on but the light disappeared. She could still see the Appellant sitting beside her “So I knew there was something inside me but I knew it wasn’t him…and it was hard and it was fairly big. And he was pushing it and then I realised it was the torch”. 
        When the Appellant was trying to put the torch in he was pulling at her vagina “pulling it apart trying to make it fit” T 21.2.00 p 34. The penile-vaginal intercourse is the subject of Count 2 on the Indictment, Rape, section 63 Crimes Act 1900. A sketch by V of the circumference of the torch was tendered during cross-examination, exhibit 3, T 23.2.00 p 135.15.. 
        On another occasion he inserted a stick into her vagina. This occurred when she was between 14 and 15 years old one night when the Appellant came to the caravan. The Appellant inserted a stick into her vagina causing her terrible pain and then had penile vaginal intercourse with her. She described what occurred as follows: 
         
          
          “…talking at me, going on, and I was asking him not to do anything and the next thing I know there was something inside me but I knew it wasn’t his penis ‘cause it was hard, and it was really thin. And he pushed it and I had terrible pain and when I looked down it was a stick. I tried to move away from it because it had hurt and I hit my head up against the caravan wall trying to get away from it. He grabbed me by my legs and pulled me back down…back down along the bed so that the stick would go in even further as he was dragging her back down. 
          I begged him to pull the stick out and he did. He said to me “You’ve got your periods”. “No I haven’t” and he said, “You have, you’re a wimp” and he dragged the stick out. I was in terrible pain and I think he had sex with me after that”. 
          
         
        By sex she meant “Put his penis in my vagina”. She never consented to any of this activity or gave him any reason to believe that she was consenting to it 
         T 21.2.00 p 36, 37.5. This act of penile-vaginal intercourse is the subject of Count 3 of the Indictment, Rape, section 63  
        Crimes Act 
         1900. 
        . 
        She did not tell anyone about this incident because she was too scared. She bled from her vagina for weeks after “…I was in terrible pain” T 21.2.00 p 36.35. . 
        A further incident occurred when she was 15 and they were playing hide and seek. The Appellant dragged her off and said, “Lets go hide in the trailer. They hid in the trailer and covered themselves with a tarpaulin. The Appellant pulled her trousers down and despite her protests forced penile-vaginal intercourse upon her.  
        She described what occurred as follows: 
         
          
          “…we got in the trailer and covered with a tarp and he decided he wanted to have sex there. I said to him “Not here someone will catch us, that’s what they’re doing, they’re looking for us” and he was just laughing saying they wouldn’t find us, it was okay. He started to pull my trousers down and I was saying to him “Look don’t do it, please don’t do it here”. And he wouldn’t listen and he started to put his penis in my vagina and started doing that.” 
          
         
        While he was doing this the tarpaulin was lifted up and she looked up and her younger sister D was standing looking at her. D dropped the tarpaulin. She then said to the Appellant “D, D’s found us” but the Appellant said “Don’t worry about it, D won’t say anything, don’t worry about it” 
         T 21.2.00 p 37.50. This act of penile vaginal intercourse is the subject of Count 4 on the Indictment, Rape, section 63  
        Crimes Act 
         1900. Evidence was given by D corroborating this, stating that during hide and seek “…I ran to the back of the trailer and when I lifted up the tarp Daryl lunged at me. He was underneath the tarp with V…Both him and V were naked under there”. 
        . 
        She left the Md family in 1977. She ran away after an incident in which Mrs Md abused her for something while she was in the kitchen and belted her with a horse bridle and then, picking up a knife which was at hand lunged at her with it and held the knife against her throat and threatened “to cut my neck from ear to ear if I ever spoke to her like it again”. She decided to leave after this incident, as she believed that if she stayed any longer Mrs Md would kill her T 21.2.00 p 38.20-38.40.. 
        D was born D on 4 February 1964. 
        When she was about 8 years old T 23.2.00 p 146 she met Mrs Md for the first time and when she was about 8 and a ½ she and her sisters moved in with the Md family T 23.2.00 p 147.45.  
        She slept at the front of the house and shared a room with her sister M T 23.2.00 p 148.5. They all had chores to perform such as feeding the chickens and collecting their eggs, milking the cows, picking oranges. One of her jobs was helping the Appellant by holding a light for him when he worked on his machinery in the sheds at night and get tools for him  T 23.2.00 p 148.45-149.15. He would work on the machinery in a shed that was about 100 metres away from the house She thought this shed was depicted in photograph 11, exhibit B but could not be positive - T 23.2.00 p 149, 150.5. She would usually help him at night after dinner T 23.2.00 p 153. 
        When she was 12 and starting high school there was an occasion during March or April of that year when she was helping the Appellant in the shed. It was late at night  T 23.2.00 p 154.20. The Appellant asked her to come with him to get a part. She carried the torch and they walked to the back of the shed where there was a lot of old cars. The Appellant was in front of her and he could not see properly so she put the torch in front of him and he turned around and said, “You have to do this”. She did not understand what he meant and he had his penis out of his dark blue overalls that he wore. He told her to shut up and put it in her mouth and suck it and move it back and forth. He had hold of her hair and she did it. It only last a few minutes. When he had finished he told her not to tell anybody. She was crying, she was hysterical and she was gagging as he had ejaculated into her mouth T 23.2.00 p 154-155.15. This incident is the subject of Count 5 on the Indictment, Indecent Assault, section 76 Crimes Act 1900.. 
        She was too scared to tell anyone about it and they went back to working on the car again T 23.2.00 p 155. 
        When she was about 12 she could recall an incident where the Appellant inserted his fingers into her vagina while they were swimming in the dam: 
         
          
          “…on a lot of occasions Daryl would have a habit of like grabbing you and throwing you and things like that and one occasion he dragged me down to the deep end and I couldn’t swim and I started to really panic and he had hold of me backwards, so my back was against his chest and as we were going he was dunking me, you know like put me under, let me up, put me under, let me up and when we finally got to a stage where I couldn’t stand up at all, he inserted his fingers inside my vagina and kept me afloat” 
           T 23.2.00 p 156.25. This incident is the subject of Count 6 on the Indictment, Indecent Assault, section 76  
          Crimes Act 
           1900. 
          . 
          
         
        At about the end of 1976, just before she went into Year 8 she slept for a little while in the small caravan on the farm. She was about 12 at this time. 
        On Saturdays Mrs Md used to go to the auctions. One Saturday while she was away and Mr Md was down in the orchard the Appellant came into the caravan while she was there. The Appellant forced penile-vaginal intercourse upon her. She described the incident as follows: 
         
          
          “Daryl came to my van and I asked him what he wanted and I can’t remember what he said but he had my head in between his thighs and he was squeezing it and every time I screamed, “Stop” he’d just keep doing it. So he told me to get undressed and I can’t remember taking all my clothes off but I think I took like my shorts and pants off and he took off what he was wearing. He had a brown t-shirt on and it had these red stripes across it and a pair of brown stubby shorts and he spread, spread my legs open and he inserted his penis into my vagina”. This caused her a lot of pain 
           T 23.2.00 p 157.25. This incident is the subject of Count 7 on the Indictment, Rape, section 63  
          Crimes Act 
           1900. 
          . 
          
         
        She thought that this incident occurred in the early months of the year, as it was fairly hot at the time. She also thought it occurred after her birthday in February but still in the first part of the year  
         T 23.2.00 p 158. 
        . 
        A further incident occurred again when she was helping him one evening while he was working on a motor. She described what occurred as follows: 
         
          
          “ One night I was helping him and he said that we needed to get a part and I knew what would happen if we got a part. Anyway we went around the side and I started crying, I was pretty hysterical and I kept saying that I was tired and I wanted to go to bed and I didn’t want to go. Anyway he dragged me into the feed shed and there was a lot of old canvas bags that we used to have because we bought feed for the animals. He threw me on top of the feed bags and he had intercourse with me”.  
           T 23.2.00 p 160. This incident is the subject of Count 8 on the Indictment, Rape, section 63  
          Crimes Act 
           1900. 
          
         
        He forced her legs apart and forced his penis into her vagina. He was sadistic in his treatment of her; he twisted her nipples as he was having sex. Throughout she was crying and struggling and asking him to stop 
         T 23.2.00 p 160.35 – 162.40 
        . 
        On one occasion a group of them were playing hide and seek. A boy, DP, who was their neighbour, was also playing with them. The Appellant told her that she was hiding with him. At the front of the house there were these great big bushes. In the middle of the bushes was a type of shelter. There was grass there and they all used to hide underneath. The Appellant pulled her into this sheltered section of the bush. The boy DP was with them as well. The Appellant pulled her dress up and pulled her pants down, inserted his fingers into her vagina and told DP: 
         
          
          “…that he could do this……He showed DP how to put his fingers inside my vagina, told DP that he could do it as well. I was crying. I told DP not to do it, but they did it anyway and then we could hear others coming, so they took off”  
           T 23.2.00 p 163.40-164. This incident is the subject of Count 9 on the Indictment, Indecent Assault, section 76  
          Crimes Act 
           1900. 
          .  
          
         
        She was about 13 when this incident occurred and she thought it would be “approximately” to her birthday  
         T 23.2.00 p 164.15. 
        . 
        She left the Md property in about August September 1977. M had run away some time before and V had left about a month before T 23.2.00 p 164.25 – 164.40. 
        The Crown called a number of other witnesses. 
        M was called to give evidence. She initially was reluctant to give evidence and the trial was adjourned for a short time. She did not eventually give her evidence in chief viva voce. Rather three statements made by her were tendered T 24.2.00 p 229, exhibit D. This comprised her evidence in chief and she was then cross-examined. 
        In those statements, exhibit D, she stated that on one occasion while she was on the Md property she heard V yelling. She ran across a road to some bushland that was still part of the property where she could hear the yelling. She saw the Appellant lying on top of her sister V and holding her down. V was screaming and both she and the Appellant were naked. This happened not long after she had arrived to live with the Mds. 
        She hated living with the Mds. They were beaten numerous times; Mrs Md would fly into rages without warning. Once she was injured while playing with the Appellant and even though her head was bleeding Mrs Md dismissed her complaint. 
        Once some dogs got loose and then Mr Md dragged a sheep into the yard, made her and D stand next to it, then shot the sheep right next to them and they were splattered with its blood. Later that night at dinner Mrs Md slammed her head and D’s head together.  
        On another occasion some birds got out and Mrs Md repeatedly beat all of them until D said she was responsible.  
        She and her sisters could not swim but the Appellant would hold her head under water and would throw her and her sisters in the dam. She was now petrified of water because of this. 
        She also described an incident in which the Appellant ordered she and her sisters to strip off their clothes, put them in a trailer and drove up and down Tizzana Road Ebenezer. 
        She ran away frequently and was beaten for it. The last occasion she was beaten Mrs Md told her “I am going to kill you this time” and choked her. When Mrs Md let her up she ran away and hid in the bush. She was chased by the Appellant and Mrs Md and they had guns. The Appellant was shot by Mrs Md during the search. She hid in a cave for days until she eventually went to a nearby shop. She was taken back to the Mds but only stayed there for a short time until police arrived. 
        The Crown called the witnesses Douglas Wormald and Ruth Firth. They gave no evidence in chief but were cross-examined by counsel for the Appellant and were then re-examined by the Crown.  
        Douglas Wormald stated that he worked for the Department of Community Services between 1971 and 1988 and within that period he had contact with the N sisters. Two other officers were responsible for them before him, a Mrs West and a Mr Bradfield 25.2.00 p 252 
        None of the children complained of any sexual abuse. However he thought V was maliciously treated prior to her leaving. Mrs Md had persuaded the owner of the café where V worked to dismiss her and prevented V from undertaking nursing training at Hawkesbury hospital 25.2.00 p 253. 
        Ruth Firth was a teacher at Windsor High School in 1975. She taught V English and personal development. The students could speak about their problems and social issues in these classes T 25.2.00 p 255. 
        She took a special interest in V. V spent a lot of time in the library and she was often on library duty. She made enquiries about fostering V but was told she would have to take all three children. She stated that it also concerned her that V’s foster parents were insisting she leave school but V wanted to stay on and she was a very bright little girl T 25.2.00 p 258.25. She stated that she met Mrs Md on one occasion. She thought she was very eccentric as on this occasion she came into the library, still wearing slippers and complained that “V is totally uncontrollable, she kicked the goat this morning” T 25.2.00 p 257.35.  
        Detective Richard Cox gave evidence that on 23 October 1996 he spoke to the Appellant put the allegations to him and then subsequently charged him T 25.2.00 p 260.30.. He gave evidence that he spoke to Mrs Md quite regularly, made appointments for her to come and speak to him but that she and the Appellant’s sister Bronwyn did not keep these appointments. The Appellant’s sister Leonie indicated to him that she did not wish to be involved T 25.2.00 p 261”  
        
       
       
      Appellant’s case 
      
    9 Essentially the case for the appellant was that the two complainants and their sister, M, had concocted their evidence. The appellant gave sworn evidence in his defence and was cross-examined. Four other witnesses also gave evidence in his defence. Reliance was also placed on the cross-examination of the complainants and the witnesses M, Douglas Wormald and Ruth Firth. This was in order to establish:  
     
      
      (a) Inconsistencies between the evidence of V, D and M; and 
      (b) Absence of complaint to, or observations of sign of abuse by, adults other than Mrs Md, for example welfare officers and teachers, despite opportunity.  
      
    10 The appellant stated that he was about 10 years old when the N girls moved in with the Mds; T, 25.2.00, p266. He thought he was in primary school in the grade below V when the events were said to have occurred, but he did not have a clear memory about this; T, 25.2.00, p267.  
     
      
    11 He denied ever sexually or indecently assaulting or assaulting at all either of the complainants. He stated that DP was his neighbour and had been his friend and he denied that he ever invited him to sexually assault D. He denied that V had ever complained to his mother in his presence that he had sexually assaulted her and he denied the incident described by V and D, stating that it had never occurred; T, 25.2.00 p368. His evidence was that his mother had very strict views about sexual relations between children; she had stated “there is no sex between children”; T, 25.2.00, p316-7.  
     
      
    12 In addition, he denied most of the claims made by V, D and M about the circumstances in which they lived with the Md family.  
     
      
    13 Those denials included that he had never physically assaulted the girls, none of the girls were blamed for the sheep being attacked by dogs, the girls were never ordered by him to strip off their clothes and then driven round by him in a trailer and the camping trailer was so full there was no room for anyone to hide inside. Trailers were “a bit of a taboo”; T, 25.2.00 p356.25, 358.55. His picture was of a generally happy household with no obvious signs of discontent until the end. That was when M ran away when there was a lot of tension, dramas and upsets.  
     
      
    14 Mrs Md, the mother of the appellant, also gave sworn evidence and was cross-examined. She stated that none of the children ever made an allegation of a sexual nature against the appellant. She gave evidence denying a number of the claims made by V, D and M about the circumstances in which they lived with the Md family and about the appellant’s habits as a youth.  
     
      
    15 Thus she said that the children slept in rooms at the bottom part of the house until the top half of the house was built by her husband. The latter was done about three years after the three girls had joined the household and the girls all changed rooms but none of them ever slept outside. She could not recall the exact date but the appellant had moved into the larger caravan when he started High School whilst V stayed in the larger caravan for about a month only at the end of her schooling, T, 28.2.00, 29.2.00 p397, 406.  
     
      
    16 She conceded that she physically chastised the children at times, but stated that she never punched, kicked or threatened anyone with a knife or indicated that she was prepared to use a firearm against them. While there were two trailers and there were tarpaulins that could go over those trailers, she stated that no sexual activities were ever undertaken in them by the appellants and V; T, 29.2.00 p436.35.  
     
      
    17 Finally, DP, now an adult, but being the boy referred to by D, was called and gave evidence concerning the incident D said occurred, when the appellant and then himself had, according to D, inserted their fingers into her vagina. He stated that his date of birth was 4 September 1963. He denied that this incident had ever occurred. He also stated that he had no recollection of the complainants.  
     
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL ON CONVICTION 
      
    18 I have concluded that there were a number of features of the trial which rendered the proceedings fundamentally flawed. This was to the degree that the appellant’s trial “so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all” so as to result in a miscarriage of justice, requiring a re-trial; compare Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ in Wilde v the Queen [1987-1988] 164 CLR 350 at 373.  
     
      
    19 The reasons for that conclusion can be encapsulated in a series of connected propositions. They are derived from what I consider in the context of this trial to be the most serious of the appeal grounds. These are best considered in the first instance collectively. For it is their cumulative effect in the context of this trial that augmented prejudice to the appellant to the extent that the trial “so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all”. That no objection was taken to these matters at trial renders rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applicable, requiring leave to raise them on appeal. But the discretion under rule 4 must I am satisfied be exercised in favour of permitting these grounds to be raised, given their fundamental impact on the fairness of the trial. The summary elaboration which follows sets out to explain that impact.  
     
      
       
      (1) Throughout the Crown case, the trial judge admitted evidence of assaults by Mrs Md against V and D of a most violent kind (appeal ground 3). This gave rise to the likelihood of prejudice against the appellant by his being unfairly associated with such assaults in the jury’s mind. It forced him, when giving evidence, to deny or minimise these accounts of assaults through family loyalty and in order to endeavour to overcome that prejudice. This was exacerbated by his cross-examination, when the Crown devoted a large part of it to an attack on Mrs Md who had been called as a defence witness (appeal ground 15). Thus at T, 275-284 (where he was asked about a violent incident said to involve two large German shepherd dogs attacking a sheep, and the father possibly having shot some of the sheep and then about Mrs Md’s attitude and reactions), T, 316-8 (her attitude to sex and children and her reasons) T, 320 (cross-examined about Mrs Md chastising the girls) T, 322-4 (cross-examined on Mrs Md’s reaction when the sheep got out and had to be destroyed), at T, 324-6 (when he was asked to comment on D throwing Leonie in the well, her motives and Mrs Md’s reaction), at T, 367-8 (further cross-examination regarding Mrs Md’s possible reaction). That led to a real possibility that the jury would proceed to convict if they took an adverse view of Mrs Md and notwithstanding that the allegations of assault by Mrs Md had no direct relevance to the case against the appellant save as a possible explanation for failure to complain. To allow it as relationship evidence (as the Crown submitted in relation to the dogs) creates the prejudice set out in (2) below, with its atmosphere of household violence.  
       
       
      (2) Prejudice to the appellant was exacerbated by the trial judge admitting evidence of indecent and other assaults as relationship evidence. This was notwithstanding that these were not the subject of any charge and many were said to have occurred before he was 14 years old and thus not criminally capable, so going beyond any justification based on an improper criminal sexual content; appeal ground 5. It is true that it was accompanied by a direction not to substitute these acts for the acts charged, the purpose rather being “ 
      to place the evidence of particular acts in a …  
      true and realistic 
       context 
      ” [emphasis added] (SU 26-7, 30). But for the reasons later elaborated (see [22] and following) this did not properly address the imbalance between the sheer volume of that prejudicial evidence as well as similar prejudicial evidence from M (see (3) and (4) below) as against its probative value.  
       
       
        
        Relationship evidence has its legitimate place;  
        R v H 
         (NSWCCA, 24 October 1994, unreported);  
        R v Fraser 
         (CCA, 10 August 1998, unreported);  
        R v Fordham 
         (CCA, 2 December 1997, unreported);  
        R v A N 
         (2000) 117 ACrimR 176 for Kirby J, especially at pp181-185;  
        R v M M 
         (2000) 112 AcrimR 519;  
        R v Etherington 
         (1982) 32 SASR 230;  
        Gipp v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR106 at paragraph 177;  
        R v A H 
         (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 708 and also  
        R v Clarke 
         (2001) 123 ACrimR 506 at 562, for a detailed review of the law concerning relationship evidence by Heydon JA (as he then was).  
        
       
       
        
        Thus it may be used to rebut an innocent sexual relationship between the appellant and the complainants in regard to the allegations of rape, sometimes described as evidence of guilty passion. That would have allowed, with appropriate warning, M’s evidence alleging she saw the appellant in the bushland lying on top of V who was screaming, both being naked with the appellant holding her down and the aftermath. This is so long as it was emphasised by the trial judge that this allegation was denied and not the subject of any charge (statement of 8 June 1996 referred to below).  
        
       
       
        
        Relationship evidence may be admitted to place the evidence of the Crown witness into context and to enable the jury to understand the evidence of the complainant in a sexual assault case. The objection lies in the extent to which it was allowed, surpassing any legitimate purpose and where much of that evidence was of peripheral relevance at best. Repeated as it was, it was insufficiently probative and highly prejudicial.  
        
       
       
      (3) The trial judge on the third day of the trial admitted into evidence three statements by M (appeal ground 3). These concerned numerous alleged incidents of intimidating violence by not only the appellant but Mrs Md, none the subject of any charge. Then (appeal ground 17)  
      in the presence of the jury 
       she was allowed to explain her evident reluctance to give evidence, so reinforcing its impact to the jury when later given. Counsel for the appellant nonetheless consented to these statements being admitted into evidence and did not object to the jury hearing her statements of reluctance (T, 24.2.00 p220 to 223 and in particular p222.55 to .57).  
       
       
      (4) The three statements admitted into evidence contained extensive reference to assaults by Mrs Md and not just the appellant, of an excessively violent kind. She gave evidence of assaults by the appellant that in some cases did not include the complainants but did include M. The effect of that evidence was to associate the appellant as the perpetrator of violence, in a household of violent propensity. Her evidence even included an entirely irrelevant and gratuitous paragraph 10 in the statement of 2 October 1996 of the appellant killing puppies and kittens in the most violent and horrific way. So was admitted into evidence a large body of irrelevant material or material which went far beyond explaining the absence of complaint. This was when there was already evidence of that nature which did not require further gratuitous amplification.  
       
       
      (5) The directions set out below were given by the trial judge to the jury. But they were not sufficient to redress the unfair prejudice to the appellant from this admission of prejudicial evidence, much of it of peripheral relevance at best and of a kind that would have the tendency to raise bad character, suggesting propensity to commit the acts charged. Indeed the admission of so much of such evidence rendered any direction incapable of redressing that unfair prejudice.  
       
       
      (6) The trial judge gave various directions and warnings, when it came to her summing up. After referring to her earlier directions concerning relationship evidence, the trial judge justified the admission of evidence of “ 
      some wider sexual history 
      ” than that charged, and allowed it to be taken into account by the jury, “ 
      to place the evidence of particular sexual acts in a  
      true and realistic 
       context 
      ” [emphasis added] but not to “ 
      substitute those other acts or occasions for those charged 
      ”. Thus she said:  
       
       
        
         
          
          “The Crown as I have said, must identify specific acts and occasions for each count that is in the indictment and must prove those particular acts and not some other acts on other occasions, that is fundamental to this case. That does not however mean that you may not take into account some wider sexual history if it is proved, that is the evidence of acts of a sexual nature between the accused and the complainant. You do not do that in order to substitute those other acts or occasions for those charged. The history of a wider series of sexual acts is led for a different purpose altogether and it is important for you to understand what that purpose is, it is to place the evidence of the particular sexual acts into a true and realistic context. Otherwise you see a jury, such as yourselves, may wonder as to the likelihood of apparently isolated acts occurring suddenly without any apparent reason, without being repeated”. (SU 25)  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Her Honour later stated at SU 26:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “It is for that reason that the law permits a wider sexual history to be proved”.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        At SU 30, Her Honour gave further directions and warnings as to how relationship evidence was not to be misused, as follows:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “So that is what is called relationship evidence and that is the evidence of V and as I have said to you in the course of that direction I gave you a few moments ago is that you- I emphasise to you again that you must not substitute evidence of those other acts for the specific ones that are charged. And you must not reason along the lines well this accused may have done some wrong things on other occasions relating to this girl and therefore we will convict him on these specific acts in the indictment. The Crown must prove those particular acts, that is the ones in the indictment, beyond reasonable doubt. You have the wider history merely to place her evidence into context.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (7) Thus (appeal ground 6) the trial judge:  
       
       
        
        (a) failed to tell the jury unequivocally that they could not use the evidence to prove that the appellant committed any offence on the indictment, being instead expressly permitted “ 
        to place the particular sexual acts into a  
        true and realistic 
         context 
        ” [emphasis added]. This gave a basis for the jury to take those matters into account. But it was expressed in such a way that the emphasised words undermined the warning not “ 
        to substitute those other acts or occasions for those charged 
        ” as well as the warning that “ 
        you must not reason … this accused may have done some wrong things on other occasions relating to this girl and therefore we will convict him … 
        ”.  
        
       
       
        
        (b) failed to tell the jury unequivocally that they could use  
        only 
         the facts of the alleged sexual assaults charged and then only if they were satisfied that they actually occurred,  
        
       
       
        
        (c) failed to tell the jury at all that they could not use the relationship evidence of V to place into context the evidence of D or vice versa, and  
        
       
       
        
        (d) failed to tell the jury at all that all the allegations of these other sexual incidents were denied by the appellant; the words “ 
        true and realistic 
         context 
        ” were highly damaging in themselves and the more so in disregarding that denial.  
        
       
       
      (8) The trial judge (SU 66-7) failed to give the jury a fully adequate “ 
      Longman 
      ” direction (appeal ground 10), though in circumstances where the appellant’s counsel did not seek a better direction. This was particularly in failing to refer to it being based on the accumulated experience of the courts in dealing with cases characterised by substantial delay in making complaints about alleged offences. Rather it was couched in terms of it being “ 
      a matter of common sense 
      ”. The result was to weaken its effect as bearing the imprint of the court’s authority. Were that the only ground of appeal, that shortcoming might leave its sufficiency on the borderline; compare Sully J in  
      R v BWT 
       (2002) 54 NSWLR 241 at [95]. But it must be viewed in the context of this trial with its other serious flaws.  
       
       
      (9) Importantly against this background, the trial judge then failed to direct the jury that they must consider each count separately and only by reference to the evidence that applied to it (appeal ground 11). That failure was exacerbated (appeal ground 12) by the direction to the jury that “ 
      you should look for support from evidence of other witnesses, albeit they were not present at the time when the actual events are said to have occurred 
      ” (SU 68). Furthermore, the judge referred with apparent approval to a submission of the Crown Prosecutor in final address that the jury “ 
      can aggregate the evidence 
      ” (SU 32), giving examples of how to go about “aggregating” at SU 35-6. Counsel’s submission for the defence, that there was no such principle or rule of law as “aggregating”, was referred to by the trial judge (SU 51), but not endorsed as correct.  
       
       
      (10) The trial judge (appeal ground 13) should have warned the jury that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of a crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care, the so-called “ 
      Murray 
       direction” (appeal ground 13); see  
      R v Murray 
       (1987) 11 NSWLR 12. In SU 60-68 particularly at SU 67 the warning is rather of a  
      Longman 
       kind couched in terms of delay. The need for a proper  
      Murray 
       direction is of course emphasised by the factor of 24 years delay in complaint. Also by the question from the jury “ 
      what constitutes proof when there are only two people involved? Can you give directions on this as there is some confusion as to what can be accepted without other witnesses that are independent? 
      ” (SU 30, and see also SU 42-5).  
       
       
      (11) The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that if the jury had a reasonable doubt concerning credibility of the evidence of the complainants on one or more counts they could take that into account when assessing her reliability on other counts (appeal ground 14).  
       
       
      (12) Having, as earlier stated, admitted evidence of assaults by Mrs Md, further error occurred (appeal ground 15) in allowing extensive and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant about the actions and motives of others, particularly Mrs Md, so leaving him little alternative but to express an opinion as to the conduct or motives of his mother and driving him into saying that other witnesses were lying in that context.  
       
      
    20 For the reasons earlier stated summarily, I am satisfied, first, that notwithstanding failure of counsel at the time to object, or even counsel’s acquiescence, leave of the court should be given pursuant to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, to raise these grounds on appeal. This is on the basis that the irregularity which has occurred is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings (R v Wilde (supra) at 369). The ultimate question is whether the totality of the departures from the requirements of a fair trial so permitted to be raised are so gross that “the proceedings before the primary court have so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all” (Wilde at 373). That requirement operates, where necessary, even in the face of deliberate decisions taken at trial. This Gleeson CJ explains in R v Meier (NSWCCA, 26 May 1996, unreported) at 19-20 adopting what was said by Barwick CJ in R v Pemble (1971) 134 CLR 107 and 117: “Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for technical reasons in what he considers the best interests of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law.” That was not done in the present case, in the respects earlier broadly outlined. However, some additional elaboration is called for as to the evidence so permitted to be adduced.  
     
      
    21 I start with the admission of evidence of assaults by Mrs Md, because it was from that initial admission that much else flowed, which on the appellant’s case was of such a prejudicial character as to preclude a fair trial.  
     
      
    22 Thus V gave evidence of assault by Mrs Md by her being dragged out of the toilet by her hair, being dragged along cement and pushed into water when she could not swim (T, 23.45). That occurred early in the Crown case on 21 February 2000. Further such evidence was given of an assault by Mrs Md upon V where allegedly she was belted with a siphon hose for running away (T, 25.48-.56). Then there was an alleged assault by Mrs Md upon V where she was grabbed, hit with a dog chain, dragged backwards, her shirt dragged off, kicked a couple of times (T, 28.30-50). M’s evidence was foreshadowed by her protestation before the jury about being unwilling to give evidence. The evidence M actually gave about Mrs Md is fairly summarised by the appellant as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “(i) dragged out of bed by hair, dragged out of bedroom, thrown outside; 
        (ii) beaten by Mrs Md when picking fruit; 
        (iii) slamming of her head with her sister D’s head, causing her a bad headache; 
        (iv) grabbed by hair, dragged to room, punched repeatedly; 
        (v) bruised all the time; 
        (vi) dragged into lounge room, tied to pole, punched and screamed at for hours; 
        (vii) hit with a poker in the left leg; 
        (viii) whipping V across the breasts with a hose; 
        (ix) Bronwyn and Leonie being beaten; 
        (x) dragged around the sandstone verandah for hours; picked up with both hands by the hair and dropped; 
        (xi) punched in the face, knocked down, dragged outside by the hair, dragged around the verandah, banging her head on the sandstone, kneeled on chest and started to choke her, saying “I am going to kill you this time” and Mr Md saying “get off her, and bring her in here Elaine, we’ll finish her off in the kitchen”; 
        (xii) chased by the accused and Mrs Md- they all had guns and wanted to kill her  
        (xiii) made to stand in lime by the accused which caused a huge amount of pain ( statement 8/6/96) 
        (xiii) Picked up, put in well, held under water by Mrs Md (statement 2/10/96).”  
        
       
      
    23 Then there were frequent references to assault by Mrs Md on D in the latter’s evidence.  
     
      
    24 That in turn led the Crown to devote a large part of its cross-examination and submissions to an attack on Mrs Md whom the defence decided to call as a defence witness. That decision was one which the appellant’s then counsel, in giving evidence in this appeal frankly acknowledged in hindsight was a mistake. This was because Mrs Md “basically became an adverse witness – not an adverse witness, but a witness contrary to our case …” (Appeal T, 34.24).  
     
      
    25 I should interpolate here that the reason the appellant’s then counsel gave evidence in the appeal was that one of the grounds of appeal is that the appellant was incompetently represented (appeal ground 20). It was conceded that any privilege was thereby waived. The appellant’s then counsel thus gave candid and helpful evidence as to his reasons for certain forensic decisions that were the subject of, or necessarily involved in, the grounds of appeal. The defence strategy, as the appellant’s then counsel explained it, was first to try to show in the context of the Md family household that there was no sexual activity between the appellant and the complainants. That, he said, called for evidence without artificial exclusion on the household situation in which sexual activity was generally denied (Appeal T, 34). Second, that by opening up the day to day functioning of the family on the farm, it would show that much of what was said in the police statement of the three girls was implausible (Appeal T, 37.7). Third, he made these decisions upon instructions and the appellant expressed anger at Mrs Md’s evidence only after she gave that evidence (Appeal T, 39.22). Fourth, the appellant’s then counsel, even after opportunity to refresh his recollection, had no recollection of the circumstances surrounding M’s giving evidence at the trial (Appeal T, 42-3). Fifth, he attempted to explain his not objecting to what is described compendiously as relationship evidence, being sexual and other assaults by the appellant outside the specific matters of complaint. It was that if he had objected, this would have made the whole strategy of displaying the whole background look lopsided before the jury and possibly unbelievable (Appeal T, 48.35). All this was in a context where counsel gave as his original understanding from the appellant that, “if his father knew about these things he would have flogged him and that his mother was a woman of considerable rectitude”. In the event, as he acknowledged, she turned out to be a disastrous witness; T, 50-1. Finally, he did not object to the material in Miss N’s statements on the basis that he had the anticipation that the parts that he considered outrageous would be demonstrably proven to be untrue when Mrs Md gave evidence (Appeal T, 52 ). That did not happen.  
     
      
    26 In setting out, as I have done, the tactical reasons which underlay the appellant’s counsel’s decisions, a matter not normally before an appellate court, one starts with what Gleeson CJ described in Meier (supra) as “one of the assumptions which underlies the adversary system”. It is “that counsel, in representing their clients, will make clear to the court or tribunal the points they wish to argue, and those they do not desire to press, and the procedural applications upon which they seek a decision” and “it is understandable that there may be, on occasions, a reluctance to be seen by a jury to be taking objections to evidence”.  
     
      
    27 Gleeson CJ then pointed to the overriding obligation upon a trial judge which is nonetheless to intervene, even if counsel remains inactive, should a fair trial according to law, be otherwise evidently at risk. I adopt here what is said by Buddin J on that matter.  
     
      
    28 The Crown in this appeal attempted to justify the evidence of the Crown witnesses being admitted upon allegations of assault committed upon those witnesses by Mrs Md, as also allegations of assault by the appellant though not the subject of any charge. I have earlier made brief reference to the contents of the three statements of M. Insofar as her statements related to alleged assaults or violence by the appellant which were not the subject of the relevant charges, they require some elaboration to demonstrate their prejudicial character.  
     
      
    29 The first such allegation is contained in the statement of 8 June 1996, paras 4-5 (AB Vol. 1 at 20) to which I have earlier made brief reference:  
     
      
       
        
        “4. I remember hearing V yelling one day. I was at the house, in the yard when I heard the screaming. I walked across Tizzana Road, to another part of the Mds property. This part of the property is bushland. I ran towards where V was screaming.  
        5. I saw Daryl lying on top of V and V was screaming. Daryl was holding her down. Both V and Daryl were naked. I ran right up to them, and Daryl screamed at me “Go away.” I got scared and ran away. At the time I didn’t know what was going on, but I now know that Daryl was having sex with V.”  
        
       
      
    30 Then in her longer statement of the same date, at para 7 (AB Vol. 2 at 23) is the following which I quote verbatim:  
     
      
       
        
        “The first day we were at the Mds, I was outside playing with Darryl. I was pushed by him, into a sandstone block, that was sitting in yard. I ended up with a cut to the head. This cut was bleeding a lot. I ran inside to tell mum and dad. They were sitting inside with Mrs Md. I told mum and dad that had happened, and Mrs Md [scil “said”] “ 
        they are Darryl’s games, he is just playing. He will play the games the way Darryl wants to play them. Go back out and play. 
        ”….  
        
       
      
    31 In the same statement there is a reference to Mr Md shooting a sheep causing the sheep’s blood to spatter all over D and M (para 13).  
     
      
    32 In the same statement at 15 there is a reference to “Darryl had beaten me at the school, and another boy at the school came up and hit him”. She then ran away and was caught by Mrs Md and beaten severely according to the statement.  
     
      
    33 In her final statement of 2 October 1996 she asserts that all three sisters had been made to strip naked and put in the back of a trailer and paraded up and down a public road nearby by the appellant.  
     
      
    34 A particularly gratuitous, highly prejudicial piece of evidence which on no view could be said to be relevant is para 10 quoted below (to which I have earlier made brief reference):  
     
      
       
        
        “To show the type of person Darryl was, I remember seeing him put a lot of puppies in an old hessian bag and tie the top. He then tied this bag to the back of the dune buggy and dragged it along until the puppies were dead. He also made me watch him beat kittens to death with a shovel.”  
        
       
      
    35 The statement concludes with a reference to when she ran away from the Mds for the last time when “Mrs Md shot Darryl. I don’t know where she shot him. At the time this happened I knew that the bullet was meant for me because they were hunting for me. I was scared.”  
     
      
    36 The impact of this evidence on the jury must have been heightened by the jury being permitted to be present when M was questioned about her unwillingness to give any evidence. That would have emphasised its importance in the jury’s minds; see T, 218-222.  
     
      
    37 The Crown attempted to justify these related matters in the following way. First, the evidence of violence in the household was to explain the fear leading to absence of complaint by the two girls D and V for nearly 24 years.  
     
      
    38 This was also the basis relied upon by the Crown for the trial judge having “correctly admitted relationship evidence which dealt with a number of acts of violence and sexual and indecent assaults by the appellant towards one or other of the complainants”. It was submitted that “the evidence of Mrs Md’s violence and anger which created terror in the complainants and a wish to run away, was also admissible as relationship evidence so that the jury could see the context of the allegations made in the indictment”; Crown’s written submissions on appeal, para 10.  
     
      
    39 It was also submitted that, “the evidence of violence at the home where the complainants and their sister were being fostered is relevant to the credibility of the complainants, particularly as their evidence as to the complaint has been disputed”; see para 9 of Crown’s written submissions.  
     
      
    40 The Crown relied particularly upon the decision in R v H (supra) as dealing with a case with, it was said, “some similarities”. That case dealt with evidence as to violence and sexual acts by the then appellant only; this was as here directed towards the complainants and other members of the household. But there was no equivalent evidence in R v H of the violence and sexual acts by other members in the household that featured in the present case, a matter which reduced its probative weight without diminishing its prejudicial impact.  
     
      
    41 The Crown specifically relied upon the following passage by Dunford J at 15:  
     
      
       
        
        “As to the evidence of violence, the complainants said that they did not complain because they feared  
        the appellant 
        , and they gave evidence of  
        his 
         violence towards them and others. In these circumstances, it was permissible for the Crown to lead evidence of his violence towards not only the complainants, but towards other members of the household as that made the complainants’ explanations for their failure to complain more credible. The evidence was that on many occasions the complainants or either of them witnessed the violence by the appellant towards others and this no doubt influenced their attitudes to making complaints”. [emphasis added]  
        
       
      
    42 The Crown also relied upon the following comments on the evidence by Dunford J at 18-19:  
     
      
       
        
        “The mothers of each of the complainants also gave evidence in the defence case denying any sexual impropriety or any violence on the part of the appellant. By his denials, the appellant put the credibility of the complainants forward as the main issue in the trial; and in these circumstances, I cannot see that the Crown should have withheld part or all of the evidence which it had available, and which tended to make the complainants’ evidence more credible. If the whole or part of the evidence relating to other sexual activity or violence in the household had been excluded in the exercise of discretion, the jury would have had only part of the picture, and therefore a distorted picture, and may have regarded the complainants’ evidence as less credible than they considered it in the light of the whole story”.  
        
       
      
    43 The context in which these observations are made does however distinguish R v H from the present case. That context is clearly stated by Gleeson CJ at [3]-[4] as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “This is an extraordinary case. The alleged conduct the subject of the specific charges against the appellant involved sexual perversion and physical cruelty of a remarkable kind, engaged in over a period of many years. The complainants, who were the appellant's daughters, claimed that the family background in which they and the appellant lived was one in which sexual perversion, bestiality, and torture were commonplace. All this was flatly denied by the appellant, who said that, subject to certain qualifications, the evidence of the complainants was totally false. The qualifications arose from the fact that some of the strange practices mentioned were the subject of photographs tendered in evidence. The appellant did not deny them, but sought to explain them as examples of high-spirited and innocent, even if somewhat eccentric, family behaviour.  
        Most of the evidence the subject of the grounds of appeal was not objected to by trial counsel. It may be remarked that, where complainants and their supporting witnesses are alleged to be concocting a story, in some respects it suits the defence for that story to be as extreme and apparently outlandish as possible.  
        If objection had been taken to some of the evidence now in issue, such as evidence of violence by the appellant to members of the household other than the complainants, it may have been necessary to explore in more detail such matters as the knowledge by the complainants of the incidents in question; although, as Dunford J has observed, it is hardly likely that they could have failed to know about them. Moreover, there was a real issue as to why other members of the household did not report the appellant's conduct to the authorities, and the evidence had a bearing on that matter.  
        None of the evidence went merely to show the appellant's criminal propensity. It went further than that in its relevance.”  
        
       
      
    44 There is however an entirely apposite warning by Dunford J on the need for the trial judge to give consideration to when the point is reached where the probative value of the additional evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. That is, with respect, something that the trial judge in the present case simply failed to do. This is when there was already ample evidence from V of the intimidatory violence in the household without need for all of the detailed evidence from M, such as the entirely gratuitous passages concerning torturing of puppies and kittens. Especially relevant here is the following passage cited in R v H from the decision of Hunt CJ in CL in R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 522 as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “So far as concerns the second of the balancing operations (the discretion to reject the evidence upon the basis that its probative weight is outweighed by its prejudicial effect), the stage will inevitably be reached where the evidence of other sexual activity between the complainant and the accused will no longer reasonably be required either to establish the guilty passion (or the sexual desire or feelings) of the accused for the complainant or to place the evidence of the offence charged into a true and realistic context, and it does little or no more than emphasise that the accused has a propensity for committing crimes of the nature charged or crimes of a similar nature. When that stage has been reached, trial judges should be firm in excluding the evidence tendered ...”  
        
       
      
    45 Here, there was no exercise of the discretion under s137 of the Evidence Act to exclude evidence outside the matters charged, where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. I refer here to the acts of violence of Mrs Md and to the violent behaviour of the appellant, accepting that evidence of M of a sexual assault on V outside that charged by the appellant may be relevant to show guilty passion. However, it is then of even greater importance that the judge give proper explanation to the jury as to the strictly limited purpose for which the evidence is admitted with an appropriate warning as to its use. This Hunt CJ in CL emphasises in R v Beserick (supra) at 516 again cited by Dunford J in R v H:  
     
      
       
        
        “If the judge declines to exercise that discretion to exclude the evidence of such other sexual activity, an explanation should invariably be given to the jury - as soon as the first of that evidence is given and, if necessary, again in the summing-up - as to the purpose for which the evidence is admitted, together with a warning to the jury that they must not either substitute evidence of such other sexual activity for the specific activity which is the subject of the offence charged or reason that, because the accused may have done something wrong with the complainant on some other occasion or occasions, he must also have done so on the occasion which is the subject of the offence charged.” 
        
       
      
    46 That was not done at the time the first of that evidence was given when its impact was likely to be greatest. While the summing up did include those necessary elements of that explanation, it fell short in the respects earlier mentioned (see [19 (7)] above).  
     
      
       
      Summing Up 
      
    47 Thus I consider that the failure to direct the jury that they must consider each count separately and only by the evidence that applied to it, coupled with the weaker Longman direction invoking common sense rather than the court’s experience (Su66-7), along with the failure to direct the jury that where there was only one witness asserting the commission of a crime the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care, all augmented the prejudice to the appellant from the admission of the evidence in question. I refer here to the evidence of violence by Mrs Md, assaults by the appellant outside the subject of the charge, and concerning his alleged violent and cruel nature generally. It amounted to a virtual invitation to attribute guilt derived from not only the supposed propensity of the appellant towards violence (mitigated but not removed by the warning at SU 25 and 30) but the propensity of the household itself towards violence centring around Mrs Md. All this renders R v H, with its careful exposition of the need for early warning and where the evidence was in relation only to the appellant, entirely distinguishable from the situation of this trial and this evidence. The position for the appellant was, as I have said, made worse by permitting his cross-examination at great length over two days (T, 275-371) about the actions and motives of others, mainly Mrs Md. This was where his defence of Mrs Md’s actions could well have created the risk of yet further prejudice in the eyes of the jury.  
     
      
       
      Appeal Ground 2 
      
    48 I should conclude by dealing briefly with appeal ground 2, for the guidance of a future trial judge. Complaint is made concerning the first ground, assault on V, alleged to have occurred sometime between 1 March 1975 and 29 March 1976. Born as she was on 30 March 1961, because of her age no issue of consent arose, though it was clearly the Crown’s case that she was not consenting. The Defence argued that the act relied on to constitute the offence was in fact one which amounted to an indecent assault and, subject to the statutory bar after 12 months, should have been charged as such pursuant to the law in force at the time, namely under s76 of the Crimes Act. However s78 of the said Act prevented any prosecution for such an offence, where the complainant was over the age of 14 and under 16 years, after the expiration of 12 months from the time of the alleged commission of the offence.  
     
      
    49 The Defence argued that where, as here, the conduct relied on was in fact an indecent assault, the charge of committing a mere assault was not open to the Crown as a way of avoiding the statutory bar, citing Saraswati v The Queen (1990-91) 172 CLR 1.  
     
      
    50 It is apparent from the Crown prosecutor’s remarks at T, 123/124 on 23 February 2000 that the Prosecutor was well aware of the statutory bar and was of the view that it could not appropriately charge an indecent assault. 
     
      
    51 It is also apparent that the Prosecutor avoided the restrictions by calling evidence of a number of other indecent assaults as “relationship evidence”.  
     
      
    52 The Crown attempted to distinguish Saraswati on the basis that it only applied to preclude the substitution of a more serious offence for that which is statute barred. Here assault, a less serious offence, was being substituted for indecent assault, so it was said that there was no statutory constraint on that. Saraswati, on its facts, involved substituting a charge of indecency with a person under the age of 16, when the conduct relied on overlapped with that for the 12 month statute barred charges of indecent assault and unlawful carnal knowledge. No suggestion is made in the reasoning of the High Court that any gradation of seriousness of the substituted offence was either determinative or even relevant. The offences were, however, sufficiently related, for the High Court to reject any attempt to avoid the 12 months bar, by bringing a charge so close to the statute barred offences.  
     
      
    53 The present case involved, in any event, a serious assault. The conduct which was common to both offences was an assault. It would be wholly unreal to deal with that assault charge without reference to the sexual aspects of the alleged events. It would in those circumstances be a contrivance to circumvent the specific 12 month’s bar, to allow the general provision of a charge of assault to be brought, when the charge of indecent assault is statute barred. The gravamen of the reasoning of McHugh J (at 30) concurred in by Toohey J, was to apply the context rule of statutory construction. It “holds that a general provision of a statute [here that dealing with assault generally] is not to be construed so as to avoid the conditions or limitations contained in a specific provision of a statute, namely the 12 month’s time bar”. This is so, though the actual charge brought, assault, while covering the common assault elements does not include those sexual elements peculiar to an indecent assault. I would accordingly uphold the second appeal ground, quash the conviction for the first count on the indictment and in respect of that count enter a verdict of acquittal.  
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    54 Without need to refer to the other matters in the grounds of appeal, and making no adverse judgment as to the competence of the appellant’s representation, I am satisfied that the combination of matters set out in the earlier propositions rendered this not a fair trial. I consider that it so far miscarried as hardly to be a trial at all. That must mean that the convictions must be quashed in respect also of counts 2 to 9 inclusive and a new trial ordered in respect of those counts. I would so order. And in those circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to deal with the submissions on behalf of the appellant in relation to sentence.  
     
      
    55 Finally, since preparing a draft of these reasons, I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the judgment of Buddin J and agree with his additional observations.  
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
      
    56 Accordingly I would order as follows: 
     
      
      1. Convictions in respect of counts 2 to 9 be quashed and there be a new trial. 
      2. Conviction in respect of count 1 be quashed and in respect of that count there be a verdict of acquittal. 
      
    57 SULLY J: I agree with Santow JA.  
     
      
    58 BUDDIN J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the judgment of Santow JA. I agree with the orders which his Honour proposes. I am in substantial agreement with his Honour’s reasons for proposing those orders and wish to add only the following observations.  
     
      
    59 With the exception of Ground 20, which asserts that the appellant was incompetently represented, every other Ground complains of error on the part of the trial judge. As Santow JA has made clear, a large number of those complaints have been made out. That conclusion however masks the real problems that emerged in this trial. Having said that, the trial of the appellant was always going to be a difficult one and in that respect one can have some sympathy for the trial judge. First, the allegations which gave rise to the various counts in the indictment occurred, as Santow JA has observed, about 25 years before the matters came on for trial. Secondly, not only were the complainants themselves quite young at the time the alleged offences occurred, but the appellant was himself then only aged between about 14 and 16. Thirdly, the circumstances in which the alleged offences occurred were themselves highly unusual.  
     
      
    60 As Santow JA has pointed out, a quite bewildering array of inadmissible material found its way into evidence. True it is that it was not objected to by counsel who appeared on behalf of the appellant at trial. Counsel gave evidence in this Court and sought to provide an explanation as to why he had taken the forensic decision not to object to any of this material. He gave evidence that he formed the view that many of the allegations made by the complainants and their sister were highly implausible, and would be clearly seen as such by the jury. More importantly, the allegations were capable of being refuted by Mrs Md, who was to be called in the appellant’s case. As it happened, Mrs Md turned out to be an unsatisfactory witness. In those circumstances it is apparent that the decision which was taken was an unfortunate one. More fundamentally however, the strategy was bound to fail from the outset because there was a considerable body of material which Mrs Md was simply not in a position to contradict. That made the failure to object to it all the more surprising. 
     
      
    61 It is, as Santow JA has observed, quite unnecessary to determine whether the appellant has succeeded in relation to Ground 20. It is apparent from what his Honour has said that the appellant has plainly demonstrated that there has been a miscarriage of justice such as to entitle him to a new trial in respect of counts 2 - 9. 
     
      
    62 The original source of the problems that were created lay in the fact that the Crown led a great deal of inadmissible material. Santow JA has referred at some length to that material. It is unnecessary for me to repeat it. His Honour has also pointed out the limited extent to which the evidence of M could have been admissible. His Honour has also referred to parts of her evidence. In order however to emphasise the real sting which her evidence carried, it is necessary only to set out (omitting formal parts) the contents of her statement dated 2 October 1996, which was tendered without objection. It was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        On the 8 June, 1996, I gave a statement to Detective Rogan at the Windsor Police Station. This statement outlines a number of assaults which were committed upon me my (sic) Mr and Mrs Md along with the appellant. The statement further outlines that I have witnessed a number of assaults committed upon both my sisters V and D. 
        
       
       
        
        Further to that statement I would like to add that in paragraph 33 that I started to drink at 18 years old. I became a very heavy drinker on a regular basis until I was 24 years of age. I believe that if I drank it helped me block out the memories I have of my childhood. 
        
       
       
        
        My childhood I endured I know really affected me greatly that was the reason why I turned to alcohol. I constantly had to witness beatings, by beatings I mean physical assaults on my sisters, along [sic] enduring the same treatment dished out by Mrs Md, the appellant and Mr Md. 
        
       
       
        
        I remember at one stage in my childhood Mr Md hit me with the butt of a shotgun. He hit me across the back of the legs. I don’t remember exactly when this happened as we all used to get assaulted regularly.  
        
       
       
        
        At one stage of my childhood Mrs Md held my head under water in the underground well that was on the property. I am sure that this was done for something to do, there never used to be a real reason why we would be assaulted. 
        
       
       
        
        During the same time the appellant would also hold my head under water and he would throw us into the dam which was also on the property. He repeatedly did this to V, D and I, at that stage none of us could swim and the appellant knew this. I remember feeling petrified as I thought that one day one of us would drown. We just had no control over what the appellant and Mrs Md did to us, the appellant was so much bigger that (sic) us. To this day I am still scared of water.  
        
       
       
        
        At one stage I remember being told to strip naked by the appellant. I was with Vi and D at the time. He made all of us strip and made us get on the back of a trailer which was attached to a home made dune buggy. I don’t remember why he did this but he drove use (sic) naked up and down Tizzana Road Ebenezer. 
        
       
       
        
        To show the type of person the appellant was, I remember seeing him put a lot of puppies into a (sic) old hessian bag and tie the top. He then tied this bag to the back of the dune buggy and dragged it along until the puppies were dead. He also made me watch him beat kittens to death with a shovel. 
        
       
       
        
        I remember that during our childhood after tea, the appellant would always have D with him he would say, ‘She’s my helper”. I believed that D was helping the appellant with some welding that he used to do in one of the sheds on the property. 
        
       
       
        
        When I ran away from the Mds for the last time, Mrs Md shot the appellant. I don’t know where she shot him. At the time this happened I knew that the bullet was meant for me because they were hunting for me. I was scared. 
        
       
       
        
        When I was eventually found I remember Mrs Md said, “If you ever try to run away again I will kill you.” To this day I believe that Mrs Md, the appellant or Mr Md would have carried out that threat.  
        
       
       
        
        I feel that during my childhood I have suffered extreme hardship at the hands of the Md family. Myself along with my sisters were tortured, beat (sic), abused, intimidated, humiliated and they stole our childhood from us. We were used as slaves for work, we just had no rights at all. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe that I am very lucky to be alive today but my body is in constant pain from what these people did to me as a child. Due to the pain I have suffered I constantly see Doctors. 
         
        
       
      
    63 To my mind it is difficult to credit that that material was placed before the jury without anyone apparently giving consideration to the following questions. First, how it was said to be relevant to the issues in the trial. Secondly, if it was relevant whether or not it was only peripherally so and thirdly, whether it should be excluded pursuant to ss 135 and/or 137 of the Evidence Act. Much the same may be said about those parts of the complainants’ evidence in which they made allegations of gratuitous violence on the part of Mrs Md and of the appellant. Assuming that it was legitimate for the Crown to introduce evidence of that kind in order to explain the absence of complaint, it was quite unnecessary for it to lead the volume of material that it did especially as the details of the incident (referred to by Santow JA in the summary of the Crown case), in which V, having sought to complain to Mrs Md about the appellant’s conduct of a sexual nature towards her, was physically chastised and humiliated for having done so, was already in evidence. 
     
      
    64 The obligations of a Crown Prosecutor in relation to the calling of evidence has been the subject of much judicial comment. In Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657, Deane J said: 
     
      
       
        
        …In performing his function of presenting the case against an accused, [a Crown prosecutor] will act with fairness and detachment and always with the objectives of establishing the whole truth in accordance with the procedures and standards which the law requires to be observed and of helping to ensure that the accused’s trial is a fair one. (at 663-4) 
        
       
      
    65 Dawson J said the general obligation cast upon the Crown Prosecutor is “to act fairly in the discharge of the function which he performs in a criminal trial. That function is ultimately to assist in the attainment of justice between the Crown and the accused.” (at 675) 
     
      
    66 It is axiomatic that the Crown should only call evidence that is relevant and admissible in support of the charges which it brings. Generally speaking it cannot, simply because no objection is raised on behalf of the accused, tender evidence that does not meet the relevant tests for admissibility. That is particularly so when the material sought to be tendered is of the nature which was led in the present case. On occasions, a Crown Prosecutor may be confronted with a situation in which an accused person wants material introduced which is either plainly inadmissible or, is reasonably believed to be so, by the Crown Prosecutor. In those circumstances the prudent course will often be for the Crown Prosecutor to draw the material in question to the attention of the trial judge. Such an approach will provide the trial judge with advance warning of the difficulties which may lie ahead. A trial judge can then make some assessment of the situation in order to ensure that only properly admissible material finds its way into evidence. Nothing of that kind occurred in the present case. 
     
      
    67 In my view, once the highly prejudicial and inadmissible material was admitted into evidence, the trial was almost bound to miscarry. Furthermore once the evidence was led, the trial inevitably was diverted into an examination of entirely collateral issues, including an extensive inquiry into the activities of Mrs Md and the appellant and the apparently dysfunctional household in which they lived. Santow JA has highlighted many of the problems that thus arose. It resulted, for example, in the appellant being placed in the invidious position of not only having to defend the charges brought against him but also having to defend his mother from the attacks which were made upon her. Findings made by the jury against her (which were very likely to have been made in view of the nature, scope and sheer volume of the evidence introduced about her conduct) were inevitably going to reflect adversely upon the appellant.  
     
      
    68 Whilst a trial judge has an overall obligation to ensure that an accused person obtains a fair trial, he or she is of course constrained to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the circumstances, by the way in which counsel conduct the proceedings. A trial judge is also entitled, and is indeed required, to be somewhat circumspect before questioning the way in which counsel is or are conducting a trial. Nevertheless, where evidence which is clearly prejudicial to the accused is being led, there comes a point in time at which he or she must make due enquiry in order to ascertain the basis upon which the material is said to be admissible. A trial judge is not absolved from responsibility in that regard by simply relying upon the way in which the parties are conducting the matter. It is impossible of course to lay down rules of universal application which will enable a decision to be made as to when it is appropriate to intervene in a particular case. Nevertheless the material introduced in this case, and its sheer volume, was of such an extraordinary and unfairly prejudicial kind that it plainly called for some form of appropriate intervention at an early point in the proceedings. 
     
      
    69 Furthermore, given the nature and scope of that material it is difficult to conceive how suitable directions could have cured the impermissible prejudice which had been thus occasioned, more especially given M’s initial appearance in front of the jury in which she expressed her reluctance to give evidence at all. Accordingly the inadequacies and errors which have been identified in the summing-up, need to be viewed against that background.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Gibson DCJ in the District Court at Sydney on 4 October 2002. On that occasion the applicant pleaded guilty to an offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing therein a serious indictable offence namely stealing, in circumstances of special aggravation which were that he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon a victim. The offence occurred during the night of 3 November 2001. The victim was aged twelve years. The applicant was born on 1 April 1984 and therefore was aged seventeen years and six months at the date of offence but was eighteen years of age when sentenced. His Honour imposed a sentence of ten years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years and six months directing, pursuant to appropriate findings, that the applicant be detained in a juvenile detention centre until the attainment of his twenty first birthday. 
     
      
    2 In a written submission (adopted by senior counsel at the hearing, the submission having been filed and signed by another) the grounds of appeal were stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred in failing to have sufficient regard to the youth of the applicant and the fact that he was a child at the time of the offence.  
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentence was too severe and that some other lesser sentence is warranted.” 
        
       
      
    3 In his remarks on sentence, the learned sentencing judge identified the considerable volume of tendered material, particularly factual material, to which he had had reference and in so doing did not recite detail with which he had been supplied concerning the offence and its surrounding circumstances. He noted that the offence was a defined serious indictable offence and that the applicant, although aged less than eighteen at the date of offence, was required to be dealt with according to law. He found that the offence was objectively a very serious one. No challenge is offered against that description, however, in the light of matters raised and argued in support of the grounds abovementioned it is appropriate to extract from the material before his Honour a slightly more detailed description of the relevant facts arising out of which the applicant’s culpability needed to be assessed. Some of the facts which I now recount are extracted from answers given by the applicant when he was interviewed by police in the presence of his mother following arrest a few days after the offence and others from statements which were tendered in the sentencing proceedings and received without objection on the part of the applicant, all part of the evidence at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    4 There was a party being held in an area near a surf club. The applicant had been introduced to a young man who was about to leave with a friend at about 12.30 am. This young man had a car and the applicant asked whether he could come along on the journey which was being undertaken in order to drop off a passenger. This passenger was dropped at Randwick and the applicant asked to be taken to Tamarama. By this time there were only two occupants in the car. As they approached Tamarama the applicant asked to be let out. He asked the driver to wait, however the driver did not and proceeded towards Bondi but after apparently cruising in that direction he turned around in order to return to his home. On this return journey the applicant was seen running towards the car carrying something. The driver stopped the car and the applicant threw what was later identified as a stereo into the back seat of the car. He said to the driver “Drive, drive, drive.” He asked to be taken to Botany. On the journey the car radio was playing music and the applicant was singing to it. Near Botany he asked to be left near a park and asked the driver whether he could leave the stereo in the car. The driver refused and the applicant alighted with the stereo.  
     
      
    5 The final contact between the driver and the applicant involved the receipt by the driver of a call on his mobile phone a few days later. The applicant identified himself and among other things said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think I could be in some trouble because I hit someone over the head with a cricket bat and put them into a coma. It’s on the news.” 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “If I get caught I could go to gaol for a long time, so keep your mouth shut and don’t tell anyone. If you tell anyone you’ll get hurt.” 
        
       
      
    6 What had happened when the applicant alighted from the vehicle at Tamarama is that he entered the bedroom of a dwelling house, via a balcony. He was armed with a knife. He commenced to disconnect a stereo system and whilst doing so, a twelve year old boy awoke and called out for his mother. The applicant picked up a cricket bat which belonged to this boy and struck the victim twice. In interview with police he stated, “He just stood there. He went back down and I hit him again as he went down.” The applicant fled the scene with the stereo and as I have related, he encountered the driver who had previously given him a lift and was taken to Botany.  
     
      
    7 The victim’s father heard moaning and banging coming from the young boy’s bedroom and as a result he came into the room where he saw his son bleeding from the mouth and appearing to be having a seizure. An ambulance was called and at hospital it was discovered that the boy had a fractured skull. He was placed on a respirator and remained in a coma for several days. He has been significantly and permanently impaired as a result of head and brain injury and there was evidence before his Honour concerning the markedly reduced scale of intellectual, verbal and performance abilities of the victim.  
     
      
    8 The applicant told police that the purpose of the theft was to obtain money to purchase marijuana. Before striking the victim he realized that he was young although he estimated his age at thirteen or fourteen. He said he carried the knife to scare anyone that came to him and said that he “didn’t fucking intend to hurt the kid, but he just woke up at the wrong moment and I was there”. The purpose of hitting him with the cricket bat was to knock him out in order to make him be quiet.  
     
      
    9 In addition to the telephone conversation with the driver of the car which I have recited in part, there was also confirmation to police that the applicant had told a friend “I had to frigging belt some cunt’s head in ‘cause he woke up and frigging his dog and that started barking”. 
     
      
    10 Against those facts, the learned sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was sorry for his actions as he stated in a letter which was tendered at the hearing. Nevertheless his Honour did not accept that the applicant fully appreciated the long-term damage which he had done to the victim. He accepted that alcohol and drugs (the applicant had stated that he had consumed a considerable quantity of beer and a tablet of ecstasy during the night) might explain although not excuse the conduct of the applicant. The plea of guilty was accepted as evidence of remorse and his Honour accepted that the applicant had resumed his education whilst in custody and was trying to rehabilitate himself. He accepted that the applicant’s actions in hitting the victim were reaction and not something he had intended upon entering the premises. He assessed the applicant’s prior record as of relatively minor nature and it was common ground that the applicant had never previously been detained or imprisoned. As can be deduced from the sentence imposed, he found special circumstances by which he reduced against the statutory formula, favourably to the applicant, the proportion between non-parole period and head sentence. 
     
      
    11 In a precise and comprehensive oral submission Mr Craigie SC for the applicant focussed upon the youth of the applicant and the obligation to apply the principles specified in s6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “6. A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      
    12 It can be observed that subs(e) does not mandate a lesser sentence than that which would be imposed upon an adult for an offence of the same kind. 
     
      
    13 The essence of the applicant’s submission was expressed in a contention that in resolving a necessary tension between moral culpability for an offence and the objective gravity of it, the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give proper or sufficient weight to the applicant’s age and immaturity. 
     
      
    14 It was recognized that there were applicable authorities concerning the approach to be taken in such cases. A young offender who conducts himself “as an adult” or engages in “grave adult behaviour” will have less weight given to those principles and more weight given to the objective seriousness of the offence: R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58; R v MHH  NSWCCA 161. The same may apply if there is planning of the offence: R v Pham 1991 55 A Crim R 128. 
     
      
    15 When the offence was committed the applicant was six months short of his eighteenth birthday. In reference to the principles abovementioned, Hunt CJ at CL observed in R v Bus, unreported NSWCCA 3 November 1995: 
     
      
       
        
        “In any event, it is obvious that the relevance of the principles stated in section 6 to each individual case depends to a very large extent upon the age of the particular offender and the nature of the particular offence committed. An offender almost eighteen years of age cannot expect to be treated according to law substantially differently to an offender just over eighteen years of age.” 
        
       
      
    16 It was pointed out in the written submissions that such a qualification does not appear in the section, however the section articulates the principles and Hunt CJ at CL was dealing with their application. I would respectfully endorse his comments concerning obviousness. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rehabilitation plays a more important role and general deterrence a lesser role:  
        R v GDP 
         1991 53 A Crim R 112. But that principle is subject to the qualification that, where a youth conducts himself in the way an adult might conduct himself and commits a crime of considerable gravity, the function of the courts to protect the community requires deterrence and retribution to remain significant elements in sentencing him.” 
        
       
      
    17 See also R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109. 
     
      
    18 Particular attention was directed to the finding by Gibson DCJ that the applicant’s hitting the victim was a reaction and not something which he intended upon entering the premises. The argument was developed that the cricket bat, the property of the victim, was “a weapon of opportunity” and the use of it as “a reaction” was a manifestation of the applicant’s immaturity. The critical elements of the applicant’s culpability relate to the circumstances of aggravation and it was contended that his Honour erred in, at least notionally, not severing those elements and assessing the applicant’s immaturity in that regard and reflecting that immaturity in accordance with principles applicable to child offenders. 
     
      
    19 As the cricket bat was in the premises, the applicant could not have intended to use it before he entered but he did not come unprepared. He had a knife. Police asked him about it. He was asked to describe it and replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was a long black handle, but I had no intention of using it, I just …… to scare whoever came. That’s why I had to pick up the bat and that’s why I didn’t want to use a frigging knife to frigging kill no one.” 
        
       
      
    20 The applicant had also chosen the house because it was large and had a lot of windows and doors.  
     
      
    21 Thus the evidence showed that the applicant had made a series of judgments concerning the suitability of the particular house as a target for theft, arming himself for the purpose of scaring anyone if he was discovered and, in the event of discovery, actually choosing a weapon option which he assessed as less likely than the knife to cause fatality. I am unpersuaded that the sentencing judge fell into error in failing to find that the applicant’s reaction was immature and unlike that of an adult. 
     
      
    22 Reference was made to the applicant’s ingestion, prior to the offence, of intoxicating liquor. He also mentioned a tablet of “ecstasy”. These were not matters demanding mitigatory reflection. There was some expert evidence based upon hypotheses of quantities ingested but there was also the eyewitness statement of the car driver: 
     
      
       
        
        “I could smell alcohol on him. I’m not sure how many he had to drink. I remember him running towards me and he didn’t look drunk. He didn’t mention anything to me in relation to alcohol or drugs.” 
        
       
      
    23 In revealing the processes of his reasoning his Honour estimated a sentence referrable to culpability of fifteen years imprisonment which he reduced to ten years by reason of the applicant’s subjective case and the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. It was submitted that fifteen years was an excessive estimate. It represents three-fifths of the prescribed statutory maximum. It was conceded, as it had to be, that the consequences of the offence were not irrelevant. The consequence of injury to the twelve year old boy was accurately described as catastrophic. His Honour’s estimate was not erroneous. 
     
      
    24 As already mentioned the specified non-parole period was reduced as against the statutory formulation and the applicant is to be detained in a juvenile centre until he is twenty one years of age. Counsel calculated that he would therefore be transferred to an adult institution to serve approximately two years and seven months before becoming eligible for consideration for parole. It was said that there was a risk that possible advances towards rehabilitation achieved in the juvenile system may be prejudiced by transfer into an adult regime. That is not, of course, to ignore that there exist young offenders programmes within the adult system. The issue for this Court is whether there was error in the assessment of sentence and in this regard, none is demonstrated. 
     
      
    25 The jurisdiction of this Court to intervene on a matter of sentence requires a finding that some less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed before it is enlivened: Criminal Appeal Act s6(3). I am unpersuaded to that effect and in my opinion the imposition was well within the range of the sound exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. 
     
      
    26 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal dismissed.

      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 3 March 2003 a person who I will refer to as ""Mr Y"" pleaded guilty to the murder of Michael Collins who died on or about 23 August 2001. It remains for me to pass sentence. To do so, I must first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. Where the facts are adverse, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Y, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities (R v Storey (1996) 89 A Crim R 519; The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270). 
     
      
       
      The Incident 
       
      
    2 Mr Michael Collins was 49 years old. He lived alone in a flat in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross. He was homosexual. He made no secret of that fact. Mr Y told the police that on 23 August 2001 he went to Mr Collins' flat ""for a bit of company and to have a drink"". He had met Mr Collins a week before. He knew that Mr Collins would have alcohol. 
     
      
    3 Mr Y said that he arrived at the flat at about 9.00 am, or perhaps 9.30 am. There is some uncertainty about that time. A telephone call was made from the flat to Mr Y's mother at 7.51 am. That may suggest that Mr Y was at the flat somewhat earlier. The time of his arrival is only relevant insofar as it is capable of shedding light upon the nature of Mr Y's relationship with the deceased. However, there is simply not enough information about the actual time of arrival to draw an inference one way or the other. 
     
      
    4 What is clear is that the deceased and Mr Y boarded a bus to the city at about 9.40 am. Mr Collins recognised a woman on the bus. She had previously worked with him. He introduced her to Mr Y. The atmosphere, according to this woman, was jovial. The deceased and Mr Y left the bus at Market Street in the city. 
     
      
    5 Mr Collins was a member of the Tattersalls Club. He and Mr Y went to the club for a drink. The club, however, refused Mr Y entry because he was wearing running shoes. So he and the deceased went to a menswear store in George Street. At 10.28 am Mr Collins purchased black shoes for Mr Y. They then returned to the club. Mr Collins signed Mr Y into the club, and they had lunch. In the course of lunch, Mr Y had about 12 middies of beer. 
     
      
    6 At some time before 1.50 pm, the deceased withdrew $500 from his credit union. He and Mr Y then returned to the flat. On the way to the flat, Mr Collins purchased two bottles of Scotch. At 2.30 pm Mr Collins telephoned the woman he had met on the bus. However, she could not speak at that time. She promised to ring back. 
     
      
    7 Mr Y and the deceased began drinking the Scotch. In the course of the afternoon one bottle was consumed. The second was opened. At some point before 6.30 pm, Mr Y attacked the deceased. 
     
      
    8 The attack was particularly brutal. Mr Y later described what happened to the police. He said that he had smashed a glass he was holding into Mr Collins' face. It crumbled and broke. There were extensive lacerations to Mr Collins' face and neck. Mr Y cut his hand at the same time. The attack, however, did not end there. Indeed, Mr Y acknowledged to the police that he ""went mad"". Using a brass vase or trophy, he struck the deceased on the head a number of times. It is plain that he then choked Mr Collins using a belt, although he had no recollection of having done so. 
     
      
    9 The body of Mr Collins was not discovered for almost 24 hours. Dr Lawrence, pathologist, attended the flat at about 9.10 pm the next day, the 24th August 2001. Having removed the belt, there was a ligature mark around the neck. There were petechial haemorrhages to the eyes suggesting strangulation. On post mortem, Dr Lawrence found a fracture to the left side of the thyroid cartilage. He formed the view that death had been caused by strangulation. He estimated the time of death as between midnight on 23 August 2001 and 4.00 pm the next day. 
     
      
    10 It would appear, therefore, that the deceased was still alive when Mr Y left the flat. A call was made from the flat to Mr Y's father at 5.45 pm. A further call was made to his mother at 6.02 pm. I infer that both these calls were made by Mr Y shortly before leaving the flat. At about 6.30 pm the woman on the bus that morning returned Mr Collins' call as she had promised. The phone was not answered. 
     
      
    11 Mr Y acknowledged that he took money from the flat. He provided the police with an estimate of $1,000 to $1,500. A video recorder was also missing from the flat. However, no inference can be drawn that it was stolen by Mr Y. In his elaborate confession to the police, he made no such acknowledgement. The flat was open for almost 24 hours before Mr Collins' body was discovered. 
     
      
    12 Having left the flat, Mr Y met a friend, Ms Sharon Crawley, in Darlinghurst Road at 7.15 pm on 23 August 2001. He had a tea towel wrapped around his hand, which was bleeding. He said that he had ""heaps"" of money. Together they went by taxi to Redfern where they bought heroin and other drugs. In a nearby lane they each injected the heroin. Shortly thereafter Mr Y collapsed upon the median strip of Regent Street, Redfern. He had overdosed. At 7.51 pm he was treated by ambulance officers who had been called to the scene. 
     
      
       
      The Motive for the Attack 
       
      
    13 What, then, caused Mr Y to brutally attack Mr Collins in this way? Mr Y was interviewed by the police. Four possibilities emerge from his answers. First, there is the obvious motive of robbery. At least $1,000 was taken from the flat. However, there were many opportunities to rob Mr Collins in the course of the day, had that been Mr Y's intention. Indeed, he could have done so without violence. Mr Collins was comparatively small. He was older. He was drunk. The money was not hidden. I am not persuaded that robbery was the motive for the attack. I accept the submission made by counsel for Mr Y that the theft of the money was opportunistic. 
     
      
    14 The second possibility suggested by Mr Y was that Mr Collins was a paedophile. Mr Y had been abused as a child. He said to the police that Mr Collins had shown him pornography depicting young boys, and invited him to watch videos which included sexual acts with boys aged 14 years. This material triggered painful memories of his youth, such that he lost control. Again, I am not persuaded. There is no evidence that Mr Collins was a paedophile. Certainly he had pornography in the flat. However, it depicted adults, not children. 
     
      
    15 The third possibility, also raised by Mr Y, is that Mr Collins, in the course of the afternoon, made sexual advances which were unwelcome. Indeed, he was affronted. Whereas at one time he believed himself to be homosexual, he said he later discovered an interest in women. He formed a relationship with a particular woman with whom he had a child, a daughter aged 10 years. 
     
      
    16 Again, to my mind, this account does not provide a convincing motive. Mr Y, at various stages of his life, had been a sex worker offering homosexual men sex in return for money. By this means he financed his need for drugs, including heroin. Indeed, he told the Probation and Parole Service in a recent interview that, after his release from gaol on 25 July 2001, he supported himself financially by this means. Why, then, would a proposal of sex in return for money from Mr Collins cause him to act in the way that he did? 
     
      
    17 The final explanation provided by Mr Y is the most plausible. I accept that Mr Collins proposed that they should have sex, offering money. I accept that Mr Y, for whatever reason, declined. Mr Collins, in these circumstances, according to Mr Y, then called him a ""dog"". That remark touched a nerve. Mr Y had spent some time in gaol. The word ""dog"" is a particular insult within the prison system. It signifies someone who has broken the code of silence and informed on another inmate. 
     
      
    18 The insult, for Mr Y, had a particular sting. He had twice provided evidence against other inmates, as I will shortly describe. He had, within the gaol, been branded a ""dog"". It was this remark, I believe, which caused Mr Y (in his own words) ""to snap"". It was a comment made by the deceased at a time when he was heavily intoxicated by alcohol. His blood alcohol reading was 0.274 grams per one hundred millilitres of blood. Mr Y was likewise heavily intoxicated. The remark, perhaps unwittingly, provoked Mr Y. Although it does not amount to provocation in law, it furnishes an explanation for what occurred, although obviously not an excuse. I accept that the attack upon Mr Collins was a spontaneous outburst. It was not planned (cf s21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) (""the Act""). 
     
      
       
      Mr Y's Background 
       
      
    19 Mr Y has furnished a description of his early years (Exhibit 2). He was born on 16 December 1970. He is therefore 32 years old. He did not know his father, although he has spoken to him once. His mother was alcoholic. His relationship with his stepfather was violent. He ran away when aged 11. He lived for a time on the streets. He was made a State Ward. His education was neglected. He came before the Children's Court in 1983 when not even 13 years old. He became involved in drugs. He thereafter committed crimes in order to purchase drugs, and was regularly brought before the Children's Court in 1984, 1985 and 1987. 
     
      
    20 In 1985 he was befriended by an adult male who I will refer to as Prisoner 1, who sexually abused him. I will return to this aspect later in these remarks. 
     
      
    21 On 2 September 1987 Mr Y was sentenced for malicious wounding to 15 months imprisonment with a non parole period of six months. In the years that followed, Mr Y was charged with various offences, including common assault in 1990, and malicious damage in 1991. He was treated leniently, being given a recognisance in each case. In 1997 Mr Y was charged with possessing a prohibited drug, heroin. Again, he was given a recognisance. 
     
      
    22 In April 1999 Mr Y was charged with a number of armed robberies. He pleaded guilty to two counts. Each offence involved a knife. He asked the court to take account of four additional offences on a Form 1. The offences included two further armed robberies, one involving a blood filled syringe, and the other a replica pistol. He was sentenced by Judge Davidson on 14 December 1999. The sentence reflected, amongst other things, an acceptance by his Honour that Mr Y had some insight into the link between his criminal behaviour and alcohol and drugs. His Honour accepted that he intended to enter a long term rehabilitation programme. 
     
      
    23 The sentence also took account of assistance Mr Y had given the police in respect of the sexual abuse committed by Prisoner 1. Mr Y was one of a number of victims of Prisoner 1, who was convicted and sentenced in 2001. Judge Davidson discounted the sentence by 50 percent to reflect both the plea of guilty and the assistance to authorities which Mr Y had provided. On the first count of armed robbery, his Honour imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment with a minimum term of one and a half years. On the second count, he was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and three months, again with a minimum term of one and a half years. 
     
      
       
      Incident in Gaol 
       
      
    24 Whilst serving this sentence at the Silverwater Correctional Centre, Mr Y shared a cell. On Sunday 19 March 2000, his cellmate was brutally murdered in the yard. His head was crushed by a brick and a large piece of sandstone. Mr Y had witnessed two inmates transfer the piece of sandstone from the garden bed to a location not far from the place where the murder took place. After the murder, one of the inmates involved in the transfer approached Mr Y. He asked him not to mention the incident. Mr Y, however, made a statement to the authorities on 3 April 2000, in which he described what he had seen. I accept that his involvement had an unsettling effect upon Mr Y. 
     
      
    25 On 10 October 2000 Mr Y was released to parole. He immediately began using alcohol. Soon after he was again using heroin. He stole his mother's television set. He was charged with stealing and sentenced at the Sutherland Local Court on 26 April 2001 to three months imprisonment. He returned to gaol. 
     
      
    26 On 13 June 2001 Mr Y was called as a witness in committal proceedings relating to the murder of his cellmate. His evidence conformed to the statement he had provided in April 2000. Two prisoners, who I will refer to as Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 3, were committed for trial. 
     
      
    27 By 25 July 2001 Mr Y had completed the sentence imposed by the Sutherland Local Court. He was again admitted to parole. It was a condition of his release that he should report at once to Lyndon House Rehabilitation Centre and contact the Probation and Parole Service. Mr Y did neither. On 7 August 2001 his parole was revoked. 
     
      
    28 In a recent interview by the Probation and Parole Service, Mr Y told that service that soon after his release from gaol he resumed heavy drinking and working as a sex worker. Within less than a month, on 23 August 2001, he murdered Mr Collins. He was arrested on 30 August 2001. He has been in custody ever since. 
     
      
    29 The Crown accepts that, although his parole had been revoked, and he had resumed the sentence for armed robbery, his sentence in respect of the present offence should date from the time of his arrest, 30 August 2001. 
     
      
       
      Plea of Guilty 
       
      
    30 On 19 November 2001 Mr Y was called to give evidence in the Supreme Court hearing into the charge of murder against the two inmates who had been committed for trial. He refused to be sworn. It was implicit in the reason he provided for his refusal that he was in fear. The trial did not proceed. The two accused faced trial again in May 2002. On 13 May 2002 Mr Y gave evidence. He resiled, to some extent, from the account he had provided. He was not sure of the identity of the inmate involved in the transfer of the piece of sandstone. He had no recollection of the conversation in which the same inmate asked him not to speak about the incident. The Crown, in these circumstances, sought and was given leave to cross examine. 
     
      
    31 During the period that Mr Y was required to give evidence for the Crown, he was also required to deal with the charge of murder involving Mr Collins. He saw a senior public defender shortly before he gave evidence in May 2002. He saw his counsel again after the trial. His solicitor provided an affidavit in which he said that Mr Y appeared distracted and distressed at each conference. He instructed his solicitors that he wished to plead guilty to the charge of having murdered Mr Collins. He said: ""I am not emotionally stable enough to go through a trial."" He simply wanted the case finished. He entered a plea of guilty on 29 May 2002. 
     
      
    32 On 29 August 2002 Mr Y made application to Greg James J to withdraw that plea. The application was supported by a report from Dr Westmore, psychiatrist. It was plain that his decision to plead guilty was made at a time that his mind was in turmoil by reason of his role as a Crown witness in the other murder prosecution. His Honour gave leave to withdraw that plea ([2002] NSWSC 786). The matter was then fixed for trial before me to commence on 3 March 2003. 
     
      
    33 Mr Y once more received advice in respect of the charge which he faced. By that time his role as a Crown witness was behind him. He was at last able to consider his own interests without the distraction of the other matter. On 3 March 2003 Mr Y again pleaded guilty. A conviction was recorded. 
     
      
    34 Having regard to this history, I do not regard the plea of Mr Y as one entered at the last minute. The case against him was strong. However, Mr Y acknowledged from the outset his responsibility for the death of Mr Collins. The only issue was whether, as a matter of law, the circumstances might warrant a reduction of the charge to manslaughter by reason of provocation. There was, perhaps, some prospect, although slight, of that partial defence succeeding before a jury. The trial, had it gone ahead, would have been likely to have lasted a number of weeks. Mr Craigie SC, for Mr Y, suggested that Mr Y should not be penalised for the late entry of the plea, and should receive the full discount of 25 percent suggested by R v Thomson (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, per Spigelman CJ at 418. I believe that the appropriate discount is 15 percent. In reaching that figure, I have accepted the opinion of Dr Lennings, psychologist, and others, that Mr Y has shown genuine remorse. The discount includes the utilitarian benefit. 
     
      
       
      Assistance to Authorities 
       
      
    35 Mr Y has on two occasions provided assistance to authorities. The first was in respect of Prisoner 1. That assistance was recognised by Judge Davidson in the substantial discount he made when sentencing Mr Y for the armed robbery offences. No further discount is appropriate. 
     
      
    36 The second occasion concerned Mr Y's evidence in the trial of Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 3. That assistance should be recognised in respect of the present charge by the imposition of a lesser penalty (s23(1)). The penalty, nonetheless, must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence (s23(3)). 
     
      
    37 In determining an appropriate discount a number of issues must be considered (s23(2)). The statement of Mr Y describing matters which he had witnessed shortly before the murder of his cellmate was important evidence for the Crown. His observation was ultimately adopted by the trial Judge as a finding of fact on sentence (Queen v Fyffe [2002] NSWSC 751, para 9). Mr Y gave evidence at the committal in accordance with that statement. Thereafter he was less than fully co-operative. He refused to be sworn in November 2001. When called by the Crown in May 2002, he modified his evidence in important respects. The trial Judge, when sentencing Prisoner 2, was satisfied that his evidence was false and that his earlier statement and evidence had been true. 
     
      
    38 The change in Mr Y's evidence was, I believe, the product of fear. The victim had been his cellmate. His murder was particularly brutal. It was also a reprisal for having given evidence for the Crown. Mr Y, having made his statement to the police, was later transported to court in the same vehicle as Prisoner 2, although separated from him. He said, and I accept as probable, that in the course of that journey he was abused and threatened by Prisoner 2. Mr Y was, on another occasion, also threatened by another inmate. I accept that the threat was connected to his role as a Crown witness. 
     
      
    39 By the time he gave evidence Mr Y had murdered Mr Collins and been arrested. He faced the prospect of a long gaol term. Inevitably there was the possibility of intermittent contact with Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 3 and their associates. Mr Y was apprehensive lest he should meet the same fate as his cellmate. His fears were understandable. 
     
      
    40 Notwithstanding the retreat from his statement and evidence given at committal, Mr Y's evidence was useful to the Crown. It gave coherence to the Crown case. 
     
      
    41 Mr Y applied to the Department of Corrective Services to be placed on protection. His application was refused. Prisoner 2 and Prisoner 3 in the meantime were each sentenced to life imprisonment. Mr Y is currently held in the Medical Transient Remand Centre at Long Bay. The centre services the general prison population. He recently heard the name of Prisoner 3 on the loudspeaker system. Mr Dominic Pezzaro, the Deputy Manager of Inmate Classification, gave evidence. He said the refusal to provide formal protection to Mr Y did strike him as unusual. It certainly strikes me as unusual and unsatisfactory. 
     
      
    42 Mr Y, in consequence, has felt obliged to ask for a form of protection known as Protection, Non-Association. By choice, he has nothing to do with other prisoners. He spends over 23 hours a day in his cell. He has limited access to inmate programmes. 
     
      
    43 Dr  Lennings, psychologist, saw Mr Y on 11 April 2003. He reported a high level of anxiety. He said this: (para 31) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Y is currently a 'strict non association' classification. Generally, such a classification would produce severe psychological deficits in a person as the sense of interpersonal isolation becomes intolerable. Mr Y is a young man, and has a reasonable degree of sensation seeking and stimulus seeking in his personality. He already talks to himself (he tells me) and utilises fantasy and dissociative mechanisms to cope with his current circumstances. The likelihood is that if he stays in such confinement over a longer period his behaviour will become more inward turning and bizarre as he seeks to project his mental world into his external reality. The analogy is the experience of sensory deprivation candidates who eventually develop psychosis-like symptoms in order to cope with the numbing of their senses."" 
        
       
      
    44 He added: (para 32) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Returned into the main population I suspect he will become over-stimulated (through fear and anxiety) and his behaviour will subsequently deteriorate, assuming he is not, in fact, hurt. Left on strict protection he will run the risk of quietly acting as if he is going 'mad'. However, I regret I can see no alternative for him."" 
        
       
      
    45 I understand that Mr Y's application for protection will be reviewed after I have imposed sentence, and the committee will have regard to these remarks. I would strongly urge that Mr Y be admitted to a form of protection which will permit association with other inmates, and provide him with an appropriate level of security. I believe the form of protection is termed Special Management Area Placement. 
     
      
    46 Having regard to the nature of the assistance provided by Mr Y, and the hardship which he is likely to experience when serving this sentence (and taking into account s23(3)), I believe that an appropriate discount, including the plea of guilty, should be about 33-1/3 percent. 
     
      
       
      Prospects of Rehabilitation 
       
      
    47 Judge Davidson, in 1999, when sentencing Mr Y for armed robbery, accepted that there were reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. He remarked that Mr Y appeared then, as he appears now, to have some insight into the link between drugs and alcohol and his offending behaviour. At the time he imposed sentence, Mr Y planned to enter Odyssey House, when admitted to parole. 
     
      
    48 However, that resolve dissipated in the 18 months of his sentence. It did so, partly I believe, because of the unsettling effect of the gaol murder and his role as a Crown witness. Necessarily, the sentence that I must impose will be significantly longer. Mr Y will emerge from gaol a somewhat older man. Maturity is likely to help in his rehabilitation. Notwithstanding his history, I regard the prospects of rehabilitation as reasonable. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    49 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including general deterrence. The circumstances in which Mr Collins died were brutal in the extreme. He was left for dead, although still alive. I accept that he was unconscious. He died some hours later. It is a circumstance of aggravation that the crime was committed whilst Mr Y was on parole (s21A(2)(j)). His record does not entitle him to leniency (s21A(2)(d)). The only matters by way of mitigation are that the attack was not planned (s21A(3)(b)) and was, unwittingly, provoked by a remark of Mr Collins (cf s21A(3)(c)). Taking account of the plea of guilty, and the assistance to authorities, and bearing in mind the requirements of s23(3) of the Act, the appropriate sentence is a term of imprisonment of 16 years. I make a finding of special circumstances. Mr Y's conditions of confinement are likely to be more harsh than would ordinarily be the case. He will, by reason of his involvement with drugs and alcohol, benefit from an extended period of supervision. The non parole period should be 11 years. The Crown acknowledges that the sentence should date from Mr Y's arrest (30 August 2001). 
     
      
    50 Mr Y, I sentence you to imprisonment for 16 years commencing on 30 August 2001, with a non-parole period of 11 years. You will be eligible for release on parole on 29 August 2012. Your sentence will expire on 29 August 2017.

      JUDGMENT 
      
      
      [2002] NSWIRComm 340 
     1 These proceedings involve three prosecutions pursuant to s15(1) and one prosecution pursuant to s16(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (""the Act"") brought by Inspector Gabriele Belley of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (""the prosecutor"") against Hughston & Sons Pty Limited (""the defendant"").2 The prosecutions were heard concurrently by the Court. A plea of guilty was entered by the defendant in Matter Nos. IRC3954, 3955 and 3957 of 2000. The prosecutor offered no evidence with respect to Matter No. IRC3956 of 2000, which prosecution was thereby dismissed at the outset of the proceedings. The question of costs in that matter was decided in favour of the defendant but the assessment of those costs was reserved for consideration in conjunction with the question of costs arising in the balance of the proceedings. The Court received a communication on 21 October 2002, indicating the parties had reached an agreement as to costs in relation to the four prosecutions (which agreement shall be considered later in this judgment).3 The defendant conducted a business as an apiarist near Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales. The defendant had conducted a business in beekeeping and the production of honey at those premises since about 1963. The business was located one kilometre from the remote township of Wanaaring which was situated approximately 200km west of Bourke and had a population of approximately 70.4 On the evidence before the Court, the prosecutions do not arise out of an accident but rather from investigations conducted by Inspector Monahan of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales on 11, 12 and 13 August 1998 (on two occasions accompanied by Constable Fleming of the Wanaaring Police Station) and Inspectors Monahan and Watson on 27 and 28 August 1998. Following upon those investigations Inspector Monahan issued four improvement notices and one prohibition notice. It was indicated in the evidence of Inspector Belley in these proceedings that the defendant had satisfied the requirements of the improvement and prohibition notices within the time period specified within those notices. Nevertheless, these prosecutions were brought. Broadly speaking, the charges (as earlier mentioned, under ss15(1) and 16(1) of the Act) concern a failure to safely store what was described in the proceedings by the defendant as ""chemicals"" and a failure to provide or maintain a system of work to ensure that plant at the premises was provided and maintained in a condition that was safe and without risk to health.5 At the commencement of the proceedings the prosecutor was given leave to amend the charges in Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000. The charge against the defendant and the particulars thereof were set out in the amended summons as follows: 
      
       
        
        I, Gabriele Belley of WorkCover Authority of New South Wales ... allege that HUGHSTON & SONS PTY LIMITED (ACN 001 279 125), an incorporated company with its registered office located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        DID FAIL 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        To ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees, contrary to Section 16(1) of the  
        Occupational Health & Safety Act  
        1983 in such case made and provided in that: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        It is alleged that the Defendant, HUGHSTON & SONS PTY LIMITED (ACN 001 279 125), an employer, breached Section 16(1) of the  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act 
         1983 on 12 August 1998 at premises located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales (""the Premises""), in that it failed to ensure that persons not in its employment were not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of its undertaking whilst they were at it's place of work. In particular, the Defendant failed to ensure the safe storage of the chemical Phostoxin (Aluminium Phosphide) at the Premises. 
        
       
     6 The charge and particulars in Matter No. IRC3955 of 2000 were in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        I, Gabriele Belley of WorkCover Authority of New South Wales ... allege that HUGHSTON & SONS PTY LIMITED (ACN 001 279 125), an incorporated company with its registered office located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales.

        Occupational Health & Safety Act  
        1983 in such case made and provided in that: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        It is alleged that the Defendant, HUGHSTON & SONS PTY LIMITED (ACN 001 279 125), an employer, breached Section 15(1) of the  
        Occupational Health & Safety Act  
        1983 on 27 August 1998 at premises located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales, in that it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare of its employees, in that it failed to provide or maintain a system of work to ensure that plant at the premises was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risks to health. In particular, the Defendant failed to provide or maintain a system of work to ensure that: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (a) a Paulcall docking saw was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risks to health, in that the saw blade was not adequately guarded; 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (b) a bench saw at the premises was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risks to health, in that it had no hood guard; 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (c) a pedestal drill was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risks to health, in that the flat and V belts and pulleys were inadequately guarded and the drill was not electrically wired to comply to Australian Standard AS3000. 
        
       
     7 The charge and particulars in Matter No. IRC3957 of 2000 were in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        I, Gabriele Belley of WorkCover Authority of New South Wales ... allege that HUGHSTON & SONS PTY LIMITED (ACN 001 279 125), an incorporated company with its registered office located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        DID FAIL 
         
         
        To ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees, contrary to Section 15(1) of the  
        Occupational Health & Safety Act  
        1983 in such case made and provided in that: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        It is alleged that the Defendant, HUGHSTON & SONS PTY LIMITED (ACN 001 279 125), an employer, breached Section 15(1) of the  
        Occupational Health & Safety Act  
        1983 on 28 August 1998 at premises located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales, in that it failed to provide or maintain a system for the storage of liquid petroleum gas cylinders that was safe and without risk to health. 
        
       
     The Prosecutor's Evidence8 At the hearing, the prosecutor tendered a statement of agreed facts, a document known as a ""Material Safety Data Sheet"" concerning the product 'phostoxin round fumigation tablets' which were known as 'aluminium phosphide' (""phostoxin""), nine colour photographs (although the prosecutor contended that the photograph numbered four was irrelevant to the proceedings) of the premises of the defendant, bee boxes and phostoxin containers in a box and machinery, and an extract from the WorkCover Authority Prior Convictions database indicating that the defendant had no prior convictions.9 As earlier mentioned, the prosecutor also called Inspector Belley to give evidence. Inspector Belley essentially gave evidence responsive to evidence given by Mr Bruce Hughston, a director of the defendant, to the effect that the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales had closed down the defendant's factory or that the closure of the factory was as a consequence of the notices issued by that body. Mr Belley's evidence was that the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales had not closed the factory. Nor had the improvement or prohibition notices had the effect of closing the factory. These statements were not tested in cross-examination of either Inspector Belley or Mr Hughston. The issue was not raised by the defendant in submissions, save as to indicate that the closure of the factory worsened the financial position of the defendant. Having regard to the submissions in the proceedings (and manner in which the prosecutor and defendant approached the evidence in relation to this question), I do not consider that the issue requires any further assessment or determination, other than to take into account the fact that the factory was closed down at some time after the notices were issued and that such closure resulted in financial loss to the defendant. If the Court was required to make a finding in relation to the issue, it would conclude that the defendant had not established, on the evidence, that the notices issued by the defendant had caused the defendant's factory to close. However, the financial means of the defendant shall, in accordance with principles later discussed, be taken into account in sentencing the defendant in this matter.10 The statement of agreed facts was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
        1. At all material times the Prosecutor was an Inspector appointed pursuant to the provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1983 and empowered by section 48 of the Act to institute proceedings in this matter. 
         
         
        2. At all materials times the Defendant, Hughston & Sons Pty Ltd (ACN 001 279 125) was an incorporated company with its registered office located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales. 
         
         
        3. At all material times the Defendant: 
         
         
          
          (a) carried on bee keeping and the production of honey at premises located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales (“the premises”) 
          
         
         
          
          (b) employed Wayne Edwards, a 30 year old beekeeper at the premises (“Edwards”). 
          
         
         
        4. Wanaaring is a remote township approximately 200 kilometres west of Bourke in Western New South Wales and has a population of approximately 70. 
         
         
        5. The road between Bourke and Wanaaring is largely uncapped and travel to Wanaaring from Bourke and the return to Bourke is a two day trip. 
         
         
        6. In wet weather, in rain over 10mm, the road is closed except to emergency services vehicles. 
         
         
        7. Public services such as postal, are infrequent. Postal services are only twice a week. 
         
         
        8. On 10 August 1998 Edwards was relocating a ponding tank that was used as a reservoir for the honey during the refining process. The tank was a 200-litre drum with a honey feed pump and pipe work attached. The pump was operated by an electronically controlled float switch which was secured to the top of the drum. 
         
         
        9. On 11 August 1998, Inspector Monahan of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (together with a Police Constable from Wanaaring Police Station) attended the premises and observed as follows: 
         
         
          
          (a) An L shaped building, the front entrance of the building was approximately 12 metres in width, the north western side of the building 50 metres in length, the south west and back of the building was approximately 47 metres in width in the south eastern end of the building was approximately 31 metres in width. The building had a pitched roof of corrugated iron and corrugated iron walls. 
          
         
         
          
          (b) At the entrance of the building was a mechanical repair workshop. 
          
         
         
          
          (c) At the back right hand side of the shed there was a large sliding door and a truck loaded with bee boxes was parked in the shed. 
          
         
         
          
          (d) In the back of the shed was stacks of bee boxes covered with clear and black plastic sheeting. 
          
         
         
          
          (e) In the middle of the back L shaped building there were honey extractors and a ponding tank also known as the “purging tank”. This tank was identified by the Police Constable from the Wanaaring Police Station and the area had been fenced off with police tape. 
          
         
         
        10. On 12 August 1998 Inspector Monahan and Constable Flemming attended the premises and conducted investigations which disclosed as follows: 
         
         
          
          (a) They identified a container marked “Phostoxin-aluminium phosphide”. Constable Flemming established that the compound was a hazardous material if not used properly. 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        11. As a result of the investigations conducted, it was found that: 
         
         
          
          (a) Had the chemical come into contact with water, it would have produced toxic fumes of phosgene gas. 
          
         
         
          
          (b) The Defendant used Phostoxin for controlling bee wasps. 
          
         
         
        12. From his investigations on 12 and 13 August 1998, Inspector Monahan found that the Defendant had provided inadequate arrangements at the premises for the safe storage of the chemical Phostoxin (aluminium phosphide). 
         
         
        13. Phostoxin had been approved and continues to be approved by the Department of Agriculture for a number of uses including fumigation of honey frames to avoid wax moth, an insect pest that eats and destroys honey comb. 
         
         
        14. According to the Material Safety Data Sheet it is advised that the chemical should be stored in a safe, cool, dry place out of reach of children and irresponsible persons. 
         
         
        15. The Phostoxin is now stored in a locked cupboard in the Defendant's work area. 
         
         
        16. From their investigations on 27 and 28 August 1998, Inspectors Monahan and Watson found that the Defendant: 
         
         
          
          (a) Failed to adequately guard a Paulcall docking saw at the premises on 27 August 1998 in that the saw blade was exposed. 
          
         
         
          
          (b) Failed to adequately guard a bench saw at the premises on 27 August 1998 in that it had no hood guard. 
          
         
         
          
          (c) Failed to provide a pedestal drill on 27 August 1998 that was safe and without risk to health in that the flat and V belts and pulleys were inadequately guarded and the drill was not electrically wired to comply to Australian Standard AS3000. 
          
         
         
          
          (d) Both full and empty liquid petroleum gas cylinders were stored in a building on 28 August 1998 on the premises creating a risk of gas build up in the event of a leak. 
          
         
         
        17. On 14 August 1998 Inspector Monahan issued the following Improvement Notice to the Defendant: 
         
         
          
          (a) Improvement Notice No. 166686 requiring the Defendant to ensure the safe use and storage of hazardous substances as required by the Material Safety Data Sheet for Phostoxin. 
          
         
         
        18. On 27 and 28 August 1998 Inspector Monahan issued the following Improvement Notices to the Defendant: 
         
         
          
          (a) Improvement Notice No. 166687 on 27 August 1998 requiring the Defendant to ensure the safety of employees by providing effective guarding on a Paulcall docking saw and a bench saw. 
          
         
         
          
          (b) Improvement Notice No. 166689 on 28 August 1998 requiring the Defendant to provide a pump or other means to extract petrol from containers. 
          
         
         
          
          (c) Improvement Notice No. 166690 on 28 August 1998 requiring the Defendant to provide sufficient personal protection equipment for the use of employees. 
          
         
         
        19. On 27 August 1998 Inspector Monahan issued Prohibition Notice No. 103170 to the Defendant requiring it to provide effective guarding to a pedestal drill used for mixing, including guarding belts and pulleys of the machine. 
         
         
        20. The defendant had approximately 40 gas cylinders stored inside the factory at the premises. 
         
         
        21. On 28 August 1998 Inspector Colin Watson of WorkCover Authority of New South Wales issued the following Improvement Notices to the Defendant: 
         
         
          
          (a) Improvement Notice No. 166734 requiring the Defendant to install full and empty liquid gas petroleum cylinders in an outside area to avoid gas build ups. 
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
        22. It is alleged that on 12 August 1998 the Defendant, an employer, breached section 16(1) of the  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act  
        1983 at premises located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales in that it failed to ensure that persons not in its employment were not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of its undertaking while they were at its place of work. In particular, the Defendant failed to ensure the safe storage of the chemical Phostoxin (aluminium phosphide) at the premises. 
         
         
        23. It is alleged that on 27 August 1998 the Defendant, an employer, breached section 15(1) of the  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act 
         1983 at premises located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales in that it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees, in that it failed to provide or maintain a system of work to ensure that plant at the premises was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risks to health. In particular, the Defendant failed to provide or maintain a system of work to ensure that: 
         
         
          
          (a) A Paulcall docking saw was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risks to health, in that the saw blade was not adequately guarded; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) A bench saw at the premises was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risks to health, in that it had no hood guard; 
          
         
         
          
          (c) A pedestal drill was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risks to health, in that the flat and V belts and pulleys were inadequately guarded and the drill was not electrically wired to comply to Australian Standard AS3000. 
          
         
         
        24. It is alleged that on 28 August 1998 the Defendant, an employer, breached Section 15(1) of the  
         Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 
         at premises located at Vicary Street, Wanaaring in the State of New South Wales in that it failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees, in that it failed to provide or maintain a system for the storage of liquid petroleum gas cylinders that was safe and without risk to health. 
        
       
     The Defendant's Evidence11 Mr A Moses of counsel, who appeared for the defendant, tendered an affidavit in mitigation of sentence of Mr Bruce Hughston (together with a one paragraph extract of an earlier affidavit sworn by Mr Hughston concerning the aforementioned closure of the defendant's factory).12 Mr Hughston gave evidence that due to the remote location of the business it was difficult for the defendant to secure the services of qualified tradespersons and other services. Business equipment is usually purchased from outside Wanaaring and transported by the defendant to the defendant's property.13 He gave evidence that the defendant had not employed any new staff since 1998 and employed two employees as beekeepers who helped with the extraction of honey. It should be noted that, in cross-examination, Mr Hughston indicated that he was an employee of the defendant and thus the defendant presently had three employees. It should be noted that the statement of agreed facts referred to the employment of a Mr Edwards. It is not clear on the evidence whether that person was engaged by the defendant at the time of the hearing of this matter (so as to constitute four employees of the defendant).14 The defendant gave particular evidence as to each charge. In relation to Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 concerning the storage of phostoxin, the defendant gave the following evidence by affidavit: 
      
       
        
        14. The defendant purchased a box of Phostoxin in 1984. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        15. Phostoxin had been approved and continues to be approved by the Department of Agriculture for a number of uses including fumigation of honey grames to avoid wax moth, an insect pest that eats and destroys honey comb. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        16. The label which is attached to the Phostoxin canisters makes no reference to the storage of Phostoxin. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        17. The box of Phostoxin lasted until 1999 and was the only purchase of aluminium phosphide made by the defendant prior to August, 1998. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        18. The canisters of Phostoxin remained in the box in which they were purchased. That box was stored on a work bench behind a large lathe and a bench grinder in the defendant's factory. The bench and its immediate area is a dry area free of water or moisture or dampness. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        19. The defendant's factory is locked each evening. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        20. The WorkCover Authority recommended that the chemical should be stored in a locked cupboard to eliminate the possibility of inadvertent access to the chemical and the defendant has agreed to this recommendation. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        21. The defendant was unaware of the requirement that the chemical be kept in a locked cupboard. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        22. The defendant had been using Phostoxin for 14 years without incident. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        23. The Phostoxin is now stored in a locked cupboard in the defendant's work area and the storage has been approved by the WorkCover Authority. 
        
       
     15 The box referred to in this evidence is shown in the photographs as a worn, open, cardboard box. In cross-examination, Mr Hughston agreed this had been used to store ""phostoxin"" since 1984. Mr Hughston also gave evidence that he was unaware that the phostoxin had to be kept in a locked cupboard or of the existence of the 'Material Safety Data Sheet' as to that substance (until informed by WorkCover).16 The Material Safety Data Sheet revealed that the phostoxin is a dangerous substance which will create acute adverse health effects if ingested, contact is made with the skin or eyes or inhalation of dust or liberated phosphene gas occurs. The data sheet provided safe handling information. As to storage precautions, the data sheet specified that the tablets be kept dry and kept locked up in a safe, cool, dry place in their container out of reach of children and irresponsible persons. It was indicated that phostoxin should be stored away from habitation and protected from moisture exposure.17 As to the charge in Matter No. IRC3955 of 2000 concerning the failure to provide or maintain a system of work to ensure that plant at the premises was maintained in a condition that was safe and without risk to health, the defendant gave the following evidence by affidavit: 
      
       
        
         
        24. Each of the pieces of machinery were purchased by the defendant approximately twelve months after the completion of the factory in 1968. The machinery was purchased in a second hand condition from a commercial retail supplier of machinery, Haire and Forbes, situated in Parramatta. 
         
         
        25. The machinery was purchased by my father, now deceased, and transported to the defendant's premises. 
         
         
        26. The pedestal drill was initially used for metal working and later used by the defendant for mixing feed for bees. 
         
         
        27. The drill was not ""hard wired"" but was on an extension lead so as to facilitate the movement of the drill around the workplace to enable work to be done at different locations. 
         
         
        28. The drill was used predominantly during the period late December to February for mixing feed. Thereafter the drill was not in regular use. 
         
         
        29. Until August, 1998 the defendant was unaware that the drill required additional guarding and it remained in the condition in which it was purchased. 
         
         
        30. In response to the WorkCover's notice, a grill guard was made by the defendant and fitted to the machine. 
         
         
        31. The pedestal drill is no longer in use. The defendant purchased a mixing machine which has superseded the pedestal drill. 
         
         
        32. The docking saw did not have a bottom guard which covered the blade whilst not in use and which rotated once the blade come into contact with wood. 
         
         
        33. The defendant was unaware that the docking saw required additional guarding. 
         
         
        34. The docking saw is used for wood work in repairing bee hive material. 
         
         
        35. The docking saw is used irregularly and is not a piece of equipment that is used regularly. 
         
         
        36. After the WorkCover Authority issued a notice, a guard was made from steel and fitted to the saw. The WorkCover Authority approved the guarding of the machine. 
         
         
        37. The bench saw did not have an emergency mushroom stop button and a guard had been removed by a former employee who was a carpenter and who found the guard made the saw difficult to use. 
         
         
        38. The defendant was unaware that it was necessary to have an emergency mushroom stop button. 
         
         
        39. Like the docking saw, the bench saw is used for wood work in repairing bee hive material. 
         
         
        40. An emergency mushroom stop button was installed by an electrician to the satisfaction of the WorkCover Authority in August, 1998 and the guard was refitted. 
        
       
     18 As to the prosecution in Matter No. IRC3957 of 2000 concerning the safe storage of liquid petroleum gas cylinders, the defendant gave the following evidence by affidavit: 
      
       
        
         
        41. The defendant has approximately 40 gas cylinders. 
         
         
        42. The gas cylinders are used for domestic use (stove and heating) and the defendant also sells gas to other residents. 
         
         
        43. The property is not connected to gas mains and it is necessary to use liquid petroleum gas for heating and cooking. 
         
         
        44. At the time of the infringement the gas cylinders were stored inside the defendant's factory. 
         
         
        45. Prior to 1996, the cylinders were refilled by the defendant when its directors visited Sydney. The cylinders were refilled at a gas plant at St Marys. The gas plant at St Marys ensured that all cylinders are maintained to a level required by regulations relating to the storage and transport of liquid petroleum gas. Since 1996, the cylinders are filled and delivered by Western Fuel Distributions to the defendant's premises. 
         
         
        46. Each gas cylinder has been dated for safety purposes and are checked regularly. 
         
         
        47. At no time has the defendant ever experienced leakage in relation to the cylinders. 
         
         
        48. The cylinders are now stored some 60 metres away from the factory. WorkCover has approved the storage of the cylinders. 
        
       
     19 In the evidence of Mr Hughston, it was revealed that as at August 1998, the defendant had an unblemished safety record and had not been the subject of any prosecutions or convictions under the Act. There had earlier been a visit to the workplace by an Inspector of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales in relation to an old extracting area, but no improvement notices had been issued and no proceedings commenced against the defendant.20 As to the financial situation of the defendant, Mr Hughston gave evidence that the company had as directors his step-mother, wife, an employee, Mr McLellan, and himself. Whilst the business had been incorporated, the defendant was, according to his evidence, effectively a family business. A profit and loss statement for the financial years ending 2000 and 2001 were produced with Mr Hughtson's evidence. He gave evidence that the company had traded poorly for those years and it was his expectation that the following financial year would be the defendant's worst year of operation since commencing in 1963. The defendant was producing at approximately ten percent of its usual production levels. It was very reliant on seasonal conditions and substantially affected by the drought.21 Evidence was also given by Mr Hughston that the defendant would not meet the honey quota set by Capilano Honey Limited for the 2001 financial year. In that event, there would be a risk that the defendant would lose the quota entitlement for the next financial year, resulting in additional hardship.22 The defendant had lost approximately $100,000 as a consequence of the closure of the factory after the WorkCover investigations. It had also incurred substantial costs which related to the preparation of its defences in these matters.23 In cross-examination, Mr Hughston stated that the company had produced honey in every year since 1963. During that time it had had good and bad years of production. Mr Hughston was also cross-examined as to the company's turnover for the financial year ending 2000 (there being a turnover of $291,247). He stated that there was a ""big turnover"" but also stated the ""overall profit on that particular year is a very small margin for the amount of assets involved"". The financial records revealed the profits for that year to be $2,915.20. He gave evidence that the average profit was $20,000. Mr Hughston also agreed in cross-examination that wages were a component of the expenses incurred by the defendant. He was paid a wage of $650 gross per week.24 Mr Hughston gave evidence that the company owned a station property at Ularara and a property at Wanaaring on which the factory was located. The defendant was presently selling the Ularara property for $175,000, the proceeds of which will be used to discharge a mortgage and pay off a debt to Mrs Catherine Ellen Hughston, his step-mother, and some other small bank loans. The money will also be used to pay legal fees and any fine imposed in these matters.25 Mr Hughston gave evidence that, given the current state of the defendant's finances, a fine imposed by the Court in the vicinity of $50,000 would cause the defendant to go into liquidation. He gave evidence that the money could not be raised by a bank loan as the company was already working on a bank loan. However, he did indicate that if a fine in that vicinity was imposed, the debt which is owed to his step-mother would not be paid to her.26 Evidence was also given as to the consequences of liquidation, including the relocation of the defendant and Mr Hughston, and the consequent loss of employment and services to the Wanaaring community.27 Finally, Mr Hughston gave character evidence as follows: 
      
       
        
        (a) I am a member and the captain of the local volunteer fire brigade; 
         
         
        (b) I am a member of the Health Centre Support Group which provides assistance to the resident health nurse and the flying doctor; 
         
         
        (c) I am an officer of the local Progress Association; 
         
         
        (d) I am a member of the Town Hall Committee; 
         
         
        (e) I am a member of Paroo River Committee; 
         
         
        (f) I am a member of the Committee to seal the Bourke and Wanaaring Road; and 
         
         
        (g) I am the President of the local Golf Club. 
        
       
     Submissions for the Prosecutor28 Mr P Skinner of counsel, who appeared for the prosecutor, submitted that, in this matter, a risk had been identified before any accident or injury had occurred and this fact may be relevant to the assessment of the nature and quality of the offence.29 It was submitted that the charge in relation to the failure to safely store phostoxin was objectively the most serious matter before the Court. There had been quite inadequate storage of a dangerous substance giving rise to a quite substantial risk. The prosecutor acknowledged that the defendant did not know about the storage requirements, although the Material Safety Data Sheet was quite clear as to both the danger of the substance and the storage requirements.30 The prosecutor emphasised the significance of general deterrence in relation to the charge concerning the storage of phostoxin because of the need to compel investigation by businesses as to the characteristics of potentially dangerous chemicals and the need for their proper storage. However, the prosecutor submitted that having regard to both objective and subjective considerations, the Court may decide ""to deal with this by way of remarks rather than penalty [-] the prosecution is brought in this jurisdiction and pressed to seek some statement from the Court of general application and general deterren[ce] ..."".31 As to the charge concerning the failure to ensure that plant at the premises was provided and maintained in a condition that was safe and without risk to health, the prosecutor submitted that the requirement for the guarding of machines and, in particular, saws, should be well known (and should have been known to the defendant which had operated since 1963). However, Mr Skinner submitted this charge was ""a small thing in one sense objectively"". It was conceded that any penalty arising from this matter should be at the lower end of the range.32 As to the charge concerning the failure to safety store liquid petroleum gas, Mr Skinner conceded that the charge was pursued because of the possibility of gas build up from leakages but the Court was not assisted greatly by the photographs produced and there was little evidence as to the matter. There was no evidence that the cylinders maintained by the defendant were leaking. As to this charge, the prosecutor submitted that any penalty should be at the ""lower to middle range"".33 The prosecutor made submissions as to general deterrence. It was submitted that it was necessary to deter breaches of the Act by businesses operating in remote areas so as to ensure that the duties under the Act are maintained, even in those areas. The prosecutor also submitted that the sentence should reflect the need for specific deterrence.34 The prosecutor submitted that the Court should have regard to the standing of Mr Hughston in the community as a factor in favour of the defendant.35 The prosecutor also conceded that the means of the defendant were relevant. As to the assessment of the financial means of the defendant, the prosecutor relied upon the decision of Wright J, President, in Ferguson v Nelmac Pty Limited (1999) 92 IR 188 and the decision of Haylen J in Inspector William Hopkins v Michael Wherritt t/as M J Wherritt Concrete Pumping Services [2002] NSWIRComm 16 at [59] - [60].36 It was submitted that the defendant should not be dealt with as if it was an ""individual"" defendant. The Court should also have regard to the substantial turnover of the defendant and the variability of returns in rural operations. It was also submitted that the defendant had not contended that it was currently insolvent and that the defendant may have ""good years"" in the future.37 The prosecutor also submitted that the defendant had the obligation to make out a case for the lack of financial means. The Court should not accept, it was contended, the proposition advanced by the defendant that the existence of bank loans would prevent the defendant being able to meet any fine by raising a loan or disposing of assets.38 As to the question of the pleas of guilty, it was submitted by the prosecutor that the pleas in Matter Nos. IRC3955 and IRC3957 of 2000 had been entered at the earliest possible opportunity. However, Mr Skinner submitted that the prosecution could not concede that the plea in relation to the charge of failing to safely store phostoxin (Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000) was entered at the earliest opportunity. The prosecutor sought to distinguish the decision in Cameron v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 382 essentially on the basis that Cameron concerned a drug charge where the particularisation of the illegal substance was a matter of some importance to the offence charged. Here, the amendment to the charge on the day of the hearing, it was submitted, did not alter the substance of the charge and ""the defendant was always able to plead to the offence upon which it now stands before your Honour for sentencing"". The prosecutor did concede that there were additional elements to the new charge but sought to distinguish this case from Cameron upon the basis that there was still a substantial element of the original charge remaining after the amendment. It was submitted that, in essence, if the matter had gone to trial and the prosecution had proved the unsafe storage of phostoxin, there would have been a conviction.39 Mr Skinner submitted that the prosecutor was reluctant to suggest a penalty range (in response to a submission on penalty range by the defendant). However, it was submitted that, whilst ultimately the prosecutor did not need to respond, a range, after the application of the principle of totality, should be ""something higher than $10,000"" and ""certainly extend quite a way past $40,000 but there may be some overlap"".Submissions of the Defendant40 The defendant submitted that the Court should apply the principles for sentencing stated by Hungerford J in WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector McMartin) v Transfield Pty Limited t/as Transfield Maintenance (No. 2) (2001) 110 IR 160 at [44] in this matter. His Honour there applied, it was submitted, the judgment of a Full Bench of the Court in Lawrenson Diecasting Pty Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Ch'ng) (1999) 90 IR 464 at 475 where it was held that the primary factor to consider in relation to the penalty to be imposed is the objective seriousness of the offence with subjective factors playing a subsidiary role in the determination of penalty. His Honour also referred, it was contended, to the judgment of Kirby J in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 341 wherein reference had been made to the inappropriateness of imposing a ""crushing"" sentence. His Honour also referred to the decision of the Full Bench in Warman International Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Ankucic) (1998) 80 IR 326 at 339 where it was held that ""the level of penalty must, on the one hand, compel attention to occupational health and safety risks in order to ensure that persons are not exposed to such risks at their workplaces but, on the other, must not be oppressively high"".41 Mr Moses submitted that the maximum penalty with respect to each offence was $550,000. Having regard to the discussion of the principle of totality in Crown in Right of the State of New South Wales (Department of Education and Training) v Keenan (2001) 105 IR 181 at [36] and [37], it was submitted that the principle of totality should be applied with respect to the prosecutions in Matter Nos. IRC3954 and IRC3957 of 2000. The principle of totality, it was contended, was applicable to these matters as both of them related to the unsafe storage of chemicals at the defendant's premises, whereas Matter No. IRC3955 of 2000 did not attract the operation of the principle as it concerned a ""guarding offence"".42 Further, the defendant submitted that in sentencing the defendant the Court should have regard to the circumstances of the offence in each of the prosecutions as well as the circumstances of the offender: WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Lyons) v Warman International Limited (2001) 105 IR 236 at [80] (although I would note that this aspect of the judgment particularly concerned specific deterrence).43 As to the failure to safety store ""chemicals"", it was submitted that the true depiction of the failure is given in the statement of agreed facts and the evidence of Mr Hughston and not by the photographs presented to the Court in the evidence of the prosecutor. It was further submitted that the defendant did not know that the method of storage used was unsafe. The defendant had assumed that all necessary steps had been taken in order that the chemical would not be the subject of inappropriate use by the method of storage utilised, although the defendant now understood that the ""chemicals could have been more safely stored"" on the defendant's premises. In the case of phostoxin, it is recognised that the substance should have been stored in a locked cupboard.44 It was also submitted that the seriousness of the charges concerning the failure to safety store ""chemicals"" was diminished because no public access was available to the premises of the defendant. Further, there was only a small workforce.45 As to the ""guarding"" charge, the defendant contended that it was unaware that the items of equipment required additional guarding as their condition remained unaltered from the date of original purchase by the defendant. In the case of the bench saw, the guard had been removed by a former employee who was a carpenter and who found the guard made the saw difficult to use.46 Mr Moses agreed with the submission by the prosecutor that the absence of an injury featuring in relation to the offences did not necessarily detract from the gravity of the offence. However, the defendant submitted that the Court should have regard to the fact that in this case there was no injury sustained as a result of the breaches of the Act: Tyler v Sydney Electricity (1993) 47 IR 1 at 5 and WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Ankucic) v McDonalds Australia Limited and Anor (1999) 95 IR 383 at 350.47 It was submitted that ""general and specific deterrence"" were applicable in the assessment of penalty in this matter and that, in the result, the defendant did not make an application (properly in my view) that the Court should exercise its discretion under s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It was also submitted that deterrence would have a role to play with respect to the charges concerning the unsafe storage of chemicals but that the Court would also have regard to the context in which the offences occurred, including the location at which the offence has occurred. The Court should also consider the manner in which and the location at which the chemicals were stored, including the precautions taken by the defendant. The ""deterrence factor"" would be sufficiently served by the Court convicting the defendant of the offence and imposing a penalty on the defendant at a level that would be a sufficient deterrent to the general community, but have regard to the particular nature of the offence in this matter and the circumstances of the defendant.48 As to the subjective considerations, it was put by the defendant that the Court should apply the authority in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and, having regard to the pleas of guilty and other relevant considerations arising from that judgment, a discount of 25 percent should be granted the defendant. It was submitted that the plea of guilty for the offence in Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 was given at the earliest available time because the prosecution withdrew one of the particulars in that matter thereby giving rise to the plea of guilty being entered on the first day of hearing.49 Mr Moses also submitted that the discount should have regard to the defendant's co-operation with the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales, express contrition and lack of any prior convictions.50 It was contended that the Court should have regard to the prompt attention given by the defendant to the improvement notices issued by the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales and to the defendant's good character. In this respect, it was submitted that the good character of a director, Mr Hughston, who was, in effect, the controlling mind of the company, was admissible as a factor relevant to the defendant's character and credit: WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Robins) v CT Plumbing Pty Limited [1991] NSWIRC 28 (16 December 1991). The good character of a director was admissible in favour of a corporate defendant, it was submitted, because that fact pointed to the likelihood that the corporate defendant, through the director, had made proper admissions. It also assisted in the assessment of the corporate defendant's commitment to safety when submissions as to that matter were advanced in relation to a plea of guilty.51 Mr Moses submitted that the financial position and means of the defendant should be taken into account in relation to the question of penalty: Ferguson v Nelmac at 209. It was contended that the imposition of a heavy fine would be a burden on the defendant and its financial resources ""sufficiently ... to in effect have it go out of existence with consequent loss to not only the company but obviously third parties"". Whilst the financial resources of a defendant is a matter that should be given appropriate weight in relation to the question of penalty, it was submitted, that factor did not necessarily result in the Court refraining from the imposition of a heavy penalty when regard was had to the objective seriousness of the offence. The defendant submitted that, on the evidence before the Court, the Court would find that the company was a small concern, having regard to the income received by it and that a more substantial fine would cause the defendant to go out of business.52 The defendant submitted that the Court should not adopt the principle proposed by the prosecutor, namely, that the financial means of the defendant should be assessed by reference to the future potential earnings of the defendant. It was submitted that the Court should have regard to the company's present financial standing and, to the extent relevant, take that matter into account in the assessment of penalty. 53 It was submitted that the penalty imposed by the Court, after the application of the principle of totality, should be in the lower range with respect to the three offences and, in particular, should be in a range of $10,000 to $40,0000.Joint Submissions as to Costs54 At the conclusion of the proceedings, the Court gave leave for the prosecutor and the defendant to file further written submissions as to the question of costs or, in the event of a settlement of that issue, to file a document reflecting that agreement. As earlier mentioned, on 21 October 2002, the Court was advised that an agreement had been reached between the prosecutor and the defendant. That agreement required the prosecutor to pay the defendant the sum of $8,500 ""in full and final settlement of all outstanding costs matters"".Consideration55 It is well settled that the primary factor to be examined in relation to the penalty to be imposed for breaches of the Act is the objective seriousness of the offence and, in that respect, as was observed by Hungerford J in WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Carmody) v Consolidated Constructions Pty Limited (2001) 109 IR 316 at [43], the penalty imposed must be determined by reference to the offence as charged.56 This matter does not emerge from an accident or incident at a workplace, but rather breaches of the Act detected by the prosecutor during a course of an investigation of the defendant's workplace. This fact does not deprive the charges of their validity or efficacy, as an offence under s15(1) or s16(1) of the Act concerns a failure to ensure that persons are not exposed to risks rather than the failure to prevent a particular accident per se. Thus, what is required to demonstrate a breach of those sections is proof of the existence of a failure on the part of the employer which is causally connected with a relevant risk to safety: Drake Personnel Limited t/as Drake Industrial v WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Ch'ng) (1999) 90 IR 432 at 452 - 453. Nor does the gravity of the consequences of an accident, such as damage or injury, of itself, dictate the seriousness of an offence or the amount of penalty: Capral Aluminium Limited v WorkCover Authority of NSW (2000) 49 NSWLR 610 at [94].57 I adopt, in this respect, the following passage from WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Farrell) v Schrader (2002) 112 IR 284 at [66]: 
      
       
        
        [66] It is not necessary to arrive at a precise conclusion as to how the accident occurred. It is now axiomatic that the general duties created by the Act are directed at obviating risks to the health and safety of persons in the workplace rather than to the circumstances or causes of a particular accident: see  
        Haynes v C I & D Manufacturing Pty Ltd  
        (1995) 60 IR 149 at 158;  
        Drake Personnel Ltd t/a Drake Industrial v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Ch'ng) 
         (1999) 90 IR 432 at 452 - 454 and  
        Cleary Bros 
         at [68]. Further, in assessing an appropriate penalty for the purposes of these proceedings, it should be firmly borne in mind that it is the objective nature and seriousness of the offence that should dictate the penalty as opposed to the actual consequences of the particular breach charged. ... 
        
       
     58 Further, the principal and particular purpose of the Act is the protection of workers from breaches of safety, health and welfare and to compel attention to occupational health and safety issues so that persons are not exposed to risks to their health and safety at the workplace: McDonalds at 427.59 However, the gravity or otherwise of the potential risk to safety flowing from a breach is relevant as a measure of the gravity of the breach and the culpability of the defendant: Lawrenson Diecasting at 476. Hence, it was stated in Inspector Hannah v Wonar Pty Limited (unreported, Fisher CJ, Glynn and Cullen JJ, CT90/1214, 30 June 1992 at 9) that ""a breach that was quite unlikely to lead to serious consequences, might be assessed on a different basis to a breach where there was a prospect of serious consequences"". Further, a penalty flowing from a breach of the Act should not be such as would be ""oppressively high"": Alcatel Australia Ltd v WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Clyant) (1996) 70 IR 99 at 106.60 Having regard to these principles, I consider that the prosecutor is correct in submitting that the charge concerning the unsafe storage of 'phostoxin' is more objectively serious than the remaining charges. The risks occasioned by the failure to safety store phostoxin are substantial having regard to the dangers associated with any mishandling of that product. The seriousness of that risk, however, was diminished, to a moderate extent, by the following considerations: 
      
      (1) Whilst the defendant had failed to take the comprehensive measures required by the Act to safely store phostoxin, the defendant had, throughout the long period in which it had held that substance, kept it within its factory which was locked each evening. 
      
      
      (2) The charge in relation to the safe storage of phostoxin was brought under s16(1) of the Act and was thereby confined to persons not in the employment of the defendant (although the charge is one which refers to 'employees' of the defendant). The charge does not relate to the 'use' of phostoxin. The location was remote with visitation by non-employees being somewhat restricted. 
     61 As was properly conceded by the prosecutor, there are aspects of the remaining charges which diminish their seriousness as follows: 
      
      (1) In the case of the storage of liquid petroleum gas cylinders, the cylinders were regularly maintained and checked and no leakage was demonstrated or experienced from the cylinders; 
      
      
      (2) Whilst there was an absence of guarding from certain machinery, there was no evidence as to the exact nature of the missing guarding, its significance to the work performed or the nature of the risk exposed by it other than what might be understood as a general proposition, namely, that the guarding of saws and drills is an essential component of the provision of a safe system of work where those pieces of equipment are employed at the workplace. 
     62 The defendant submitted in mitigation that it had limited knowledge of the safe storage requirements for the chemicals or the guarding requirements for the equipment and machines (until advised of such requirements by the WorkCover Authority of NSW). It was also submitted that the defendant had been hindered, in the case of the storage of phostoxin, by the lack of particular information as to that product (although Mr Hughston conceded that the WorkCover Authority of NSW had made him aware of the Material Safety Data Sheet after the investigation). Further, the equipment investigated by the inspector, it was contended, was in its original state and that the defendant was not aware of any further requirements for the guarding of that equipment over its original purchased state.63 I consider that these matters should attract little by way of mitigation of the objective features of this matter. In coming to that conclusion, I have had regard to the decision of the Full Bench of this Commission in Ridge Consolidated Pty Limited v Mauger [2002] NSWIRComm 108 at [32] - [33] whereby the Full Bench, in adopting the decision in Schrader, emphasised the extent of the duty cast upon an employer, in the strongest possible language, by the Occupational Health and Safety Act, including the duty to be proactive and anticipate a risk that might arise at the workplace. The Bench adopted the following passage from Schrader: 
      
       
        
        [56] In short, the duty is to be proactive. This duty was, in my view, correctly and forcefully stated by  
        Bauer  
        J in  
        WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Twynam-Perkins) v Maine Lighting Pty Ltd  
        (unreported, CT94/1037, 13 April 1995 at p18) (approved recently by Full Benches of this Court in  
        Profab  
        at [37] and  
        Riley v Australian Grader Hire  
        (2000) 103 IR 143 at [15]): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ... the Act was designed to protect against human errors including inadvertence, inattention, haste and even foolish disregard of personal safety as well as the foreseeable technical risks in industry.  
          
         
         
        [57] Equally forceful observations have been made, an example of which includes the judgment of  
        Watson  
        J in  
        Carrington Slipways Pty Limited v Callaghan  
        (1985) 11 IR 467, in which his Honour held (at 470):  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In their context and purpose, there would appear to be no reason to make any implication that the words ""to ensure"" are to be construed in any way other than their ordinary meaning of guaranteeing, securing or making certain.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [58] It is pertinent to observe also the comments of  
        Hill 
         J in WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Egan) v Atco Controls Pty Limited (1998) 82 IR 80 at 85:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          This case is yet another illustration of the need for employers to exercise abundant caution, maintain constant vigilance and take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace. It is essential that the approach should be a pro-active and not a re-active one; employers should be on the offensive to search for, detect and eliminate, so far as is reasonably practicable, any possible areas of risk to safety, health and welfare which may exist or occur from time to time in the workplace.  
          
         
         
        [59] I would also concur with the observations of  
        Wright  
        J, President, in  
        Ferguson v Nelmac Pty Limited  
        (1999) 92 IR 188 where, in the context of a s15 prosecution, his Honour observed that the Act imposed (at 209):  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ... an obligation on an employer which is not confined to the taking of precautions only when there are warnings or signals of danger or when experience indicates that a risk to safety has arisen and requires remedy. So much is clear from the structure and language of the section which is premised on the requirement to 'ensure ... health, safety and welfare at work' and the decided cases which make plain the nature of the obligation.  
          
         
        
       
     64 The prosecutor was correct, in my view, in emphasising in this matter the need for general deterrence. I also consider that Mr Moses properly conceded that the need for general and specific deterrence took this matter outside the limited class of cases which may attract the exercise of the Court's discretion under s10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In these respects, I adopt what was stated by the Court in Schrader at [69] and [70]: 
      
       
        
         
        [69] The purpose of the Act is well known and often referred to in judgments of this Court. In my view, it is important, when considering notions of general deterrence, that the Court be cognisant of the fact that the Act is for the benefit of the public generally and particularly employees at work. The goal is the prevention, deterrence and punishment of breaches of health and safety requirements. The notion of general deterrence is well understood. However, in my view, and in accordance with what was stated by the Full Court in  
        Capral Aluminium  
        (at [72] - [74]), in cases such as this, it should be reiterated that ""one of the main purposes of punishment, ... is to protect the public from the commission of such crimes by making it clear to the offender  
        and to other persons with similar impulses  
        that, if they yield to them, they will meet with severe punishment"" (emphasis added):  
        R v Rushby

        Capral Aluminium  
        at [72]).  
         
         
        [70] Further, I would note that it has been described as ""the fundamental duty of this Court"" to ensure that any penalty imposed is severe enough to ""compel attention to occupational health and safety issues so that persons are not exposed to risks to their health and safety at the workplace"":  
        Fisher v Samaras Industries Pty Limited 
         (1996) 82 IR 384 at 388 adopted in  
        Capral Aluminium  
        (at [74]). 
        
       
     65 Whilst the offences in this matter are less serious than those which may otherwise come before this Court, there is a need, in my view, for general and specific deterrence. It is necessary to emphasise that substances, such as phostoxin, must be stored with the utmost care and caution because of the very significant risks they pose to employees and to the public at large. It should also be emphasised that information is readily available, in the form of ""Material Safety Data Sheets"", as to the health hazards associated with such substances and the precautions which should be adopted for their safe use and handling. The failure to properly guard machinery continues to be a significant cause of injury in the workplace and should be deterred by an appropriate penalty.66 It is also necessary to emphasise, having regard to some of the submissions of the defendant, that the conduct of a business in rural areas (even those conducted in remote locations), does not excuse full compliance with the terms of the Act which impose rigorous requirements as to the occupational health and safety of employees and other persons having contact with workplaces.67 It is also appropriate to ensure the penalty reflects specific deterrence (having regard to the principles stated in Capral) because the defendant has made it plain that it intends to continue its beekeeping business in such a manner as will necessarily involve the use of chemicals and equipment of the kind referred to in the charges. However, the Court has paid regard, in this respect, to the circumstances of the offender and has noted that the defendant in this matter gave prompt and complete compliance with improvement and prohibition notices served upon it. 68 I have also had regard, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, to the fact that simple remedies were available to the defendant in order to remove the risk to safety in this matter.69 The final matter concerning the objective seriousness of the offence which I have taken into account is that the maximum penalty for each offence charged is $550,000.70 The Court shall turn now to the subjective features of this matter.71 The Court shall firstly consider the discount that should be allowed for the defendant having entered a plea of guilty. It will be recalled that Mr Skinner submitted that the Court should treat the pleas of guilty entered in Matter Nos. IRC3955 and 3957 of 2000 as having been entered at the earliest opportunity (and thereby attracting a discount at the high end of the scale in R v Thomson, but that the plea in Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 should attract a lower discount as the plea was not entered until the hearing of the matter.72 During the course of his submissions on this matter, Mr Skinner referred, at the invitation of the Court, to Cameron. In the light of the judgment of the High Court in Cameron, those submissions tended to focus upon changes which had been agreed to be made to the charge in Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 prior to the date of hearing and as to whether that circumstance would warrant the granting of a full discount for the plea of guilty. However, since the judgment in Cameron the Court of Criminal Appeal in this State has held that the reasoning of the judgment in Cameron does not apply in this State: R v Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300 at [68]. Rather, it was held that the decision in R v Thomson at 383 should be followed (see also R v Cousins and Anor [2002] NSWCCA 340, although in that matter it was held that, although Thomson stated that the top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas entered at the earliest opportunity, that statement did not mean that an early plea automatically brought a discount at the top of the range as discounts would depend, amongst other things, on the length and complexity of the trial, the cost of which had been saved (at [21])).73 Spigelman CJ (with whom Woods CJ at CL, Foster A-JA and Grove and James JJ agreed) in Thomson stated guidelines applicable to offences against the laws of New South Wales as follows: 
      
       
        
        (i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight.  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence insofar as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, e.g. assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
         iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 percent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.  
         
         
        (iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount. 
        
       
     74 Having regard to those principles, it appears to the Court that the following history is relevant in determining the question raised by the prosecutor in this matter: 
      
      (1) On 24 May 2001, the defendant indicated that it would enter a plea of not guilty in Matter Nos. IRC3954 and 3956 and a plea of guilty in Matter Nos. IRC3957 with the plea in Matter No. IRC3955 reserved until the next call-over before the Industrial Registrar. 
      
      
      (2) On 7 June 2001, the defendant entered a plea of guilty in Matter No. IRC3955. In the result, the defendant entered two pleas of guilty by June 2001, which the prosecutor accepted were pleas entered at the earliest possible time. 
      
      
      (3) On 8 August 2001, the prosecutor and defendant agreed that the matters for which a not guilty plea had been entered would be set down for trial over four to five days. The parties would agree on a programme. An agreed programme was forwarded to the Court on 22 August 2001 and, having regard to the available dates for the legal representatives of the prosecutor and the defendant, the matter was set down for hearing over five days in March 2002. 
      
      
      (4) In February 2002, the defendant advised that it intended to enter a plea of guilty with respect to Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 and that the prosecutor had agreed to withdraw the charge with respect to Matter No. IRC3956 of 2000. In the result, it was requested, by consent, that three days of hearing be vacated and the remaining two days be allowed for the plea. The Court forthwith vacated the days so as to make them available for other aspects of the Court's business. 
      
      
      (5) The amended application in Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 resulted in a reasonably substantial reduction in the particulars of the charge in that matter - the particulars being altered from a failure to safely use and store the phostoxin to a failure to safely store that substance. 
     75 Having regard to the history of the matter, the defendant should be given a moderate discount for the plea of guilty in Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 (when the utilitarian aspects are assessed with other relevant factors referred to in R v Thomson). The defendant should receive a discount at the top of the range for its plea of guilty (and other relevant factors referred to in R v Thomson) for the remaining charges. The Court has taken into account the contrition of the defendant and the very substantial assistance to and co-operation with the authorities by the defendant both during the investigation and in the implementation of the improvement notices issued to the defendant. I have in mind, in this latter respect, the changes introduced to the operations of the defendant after the issuing of the notices.76 Before turning to the actual discount allowed for the subjective features, it should be noted that the defendant has no prior record and given that, as at the date of the charges, the defendant had not been known to the prosecutor, the defendant should be treated as having a good record. It has been a good industrial citizen and is of good character.77 Having regard to the aforementioned subjective features, I consider a total discount of thirty percent should be allowed for Matter No's IRC3955 and 3957 of 2000 and twenty percent for Matter No IRC3954 of 2000.78 There are two further matters requiring attention in this matter, the financial means of the defendant and the principle of totality. 79 The defendant raised its financial means in mitigation of penalty. I shall apply, in the consideration of that issue, the discussion of the relevant principles concerning the financial means of a defendant in Schrader at [83] - [85], as follows: 
      
       
        
         
        [83] The financial means of the defendant was a matter that was submitted in mitigation of penalty. In this regard I would adopt what I stated in  
        Department of Mineral Resources v A M Hoipo & Sons  
        (at [50]): 
         
         
          
          It is proper, nonetheless, to have regard to the financial position and means of the defendant when considering the question of penalty: see  
          Ferguson v Nelmac Pty Limited 
           (1999) 92 IR 188 at 209. The purpose of a fine is primarily to punish the offender. The burden which will be imposed by virtue of a fine at a particular level will, to some extent, depend upon the financial circumstances and resources of that offender. As a result, the amount and method of payment of a fine will need to take into account, as far as practicable, the financial resources and income of the defendant: see  
          R v Sgroi 
           (1989) 40 A Crim R 197 at 200 - 201.  
          
         
         
        [84] This approach was subsequently adopted in  
        Manpac Industries  
        where the Full Bench of this Court stated (at [81] - [82]): 
         
         
          
          ... Section 6 of the  
          Fines Act 
           1996 provides that in exercising a discretion to fix the amount of any fine a court is required to consider the means of the accused and such other matters as are relevant to the fixing of that amount. That statutory injunction, of course, has long been recognised as an appropriate part of the sentencing process: see, for instance,  
          Warman International 
           (80 IR at p339);  
          WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Dowling) v Overtop Pty Ltd  
          (1998) 86 IR 319 at p333; and  
          Profab Industries 
           (49 NSWLR at p714, 100 IR at p76).  
           
           
          However, and given the primacy of the objective seriousness of an offence in determining an appropriate sentence, the financial situation of a defendant, in our view, needs to be carefully scrutinised. In  
          Ferguson v Nelmac Pty Ltd 
           (1999) 92 IR 188 at pp209 - 210,  
          Wright 
           J, President observed :  
           
           
          ... Whilst I accept that the imposition of heavy fines would be a burden on the defendant and its financial resources and that consideration should be given appropriate weight on the question of penalty, it does not necessarily result in the Court not imposing a heavy penalty. ...  
           
           
          ...  
           
           
          When viewed in the context of the statutory mandate in s 15 the offences were very serious and provided proper weight is given to the subjective considerations and insofar as deterrence is concerned some tempering thereof, the penalty should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. ...  
          
         
         
        [85] I would reiterate what the Court stated in  
        WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Ankucic) v Lyndhurst Trading Co Pty Ltd  
        (2000) 95 IR 462 (at 476): 
         
         
          
          Where the means of the defendant to pay any fine is raised, the proper course will be to assess the appropriate amount of the fine having regard to the gravity of the offence charged and then reduce the fine to take into account the defendant's means and impecuniosity: see  
          Rahme 
           (1989) 43 A Crim R 81 at 86  
          
         
         
        (See also Inspector William Hopkins v Michael Wheritt trading as M J Wherritt Concrete Pumping Services [2002] NSWIRComm16 at [59] - [60]). 
        
       
     80 In addition to those matters and, having regard to the submissions of the prosecutor and the defendant, I also have taken into account the judgment of Wright J, in Ferguson v Nelmac and, in particular, the following aspect of his Honour's judgment (at 209): 
      
       
        
        The financial position and more particularly the means of the defendant should be taken into account in relation to the question of penalty. Otherwise it is inappropriate to consider the fact or amount of legal costs, consulting and other fees. In any event, it was not submitted that I should. I should, as submitted by counsel for the informant, consider not only the financial information included in the correspondence from the accountants, but also the defendant's asset position. Whilst I accept that the imposition of heavy fins would be a burden on the defendant and its financial resources and that consideration should be given appropriate weight on the question of penalty, it does not necessarily result in the Court not imposing a heavy penalty. ... 
        
       
     81 I consider that the defendant has established that it is suffering financially from a variety of factors. In coming to this view, I have not taken into account the legal costs incurred by the defendant in these proceedings or the potential cost of the imposition of a fine but nonetheless find that the defendant has established a significant case warranting its financial means being taken into account in the assessment of penalty. This consideration will result in a lower penalty than might have otherwise been imposed in this case. Before leaving the question of the financial means of the defendant two matters are worthy of note: 
      
      1. It is relevant to consider whether a significant fine may have a major impact upon the defendant's viability:  
      WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Page) v Walco Hoist Rentals Pty Limited and Another  
      (No 2) (2000) 99 IR 163; 
      
      
      2. I do not consider that the future prospects of the defendant are a material consideration in this respect, as was suggested by the prosecutor, particularly where, in this case, there was no substantial evidence as to just what those prospects might be. 
     82 Before imposing penalty it is necessary to have regard to the principle of totality. The defendant raised this issue and submitted that the principle should be applied to the two charges concerning the unsafe storage of ""chemicals"" because of the common elements of the offences. It was submitted that the principle of totality would not be applicable to the guarding offences. No contrary submission was advanced by the prosecutor.83 In Crown (Department of Education and Training) v Keenan, a Full Bench of this Commission considered the principle of totality. It was stated (at [22] and [23]): 
      
       
        
         
        22 In  
        Pearce v The Queen  
        (1998) 194 CLR 610, however, the majority of the High Court rejected this approach. That case concerned an offender charged with two offences - the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm and the infliction of grievous bodily harm during a break and enter - which both arose out of the same incident. The majority,  
        McHugh 
        ,  
        Hayne 
         and  
        Callinan 
         JJ, stated:  
         
         
          
          [45] To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error.  
          A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.  
           
           
          [46] Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision. It is, then, all the more important that proper principle be applied throughout the process.  
           
           
          [47] Questions of cumulation and concurrence may well be affected by particular statutory rules. If, in fixing the appropriate sentence for each offence, proper principle is not applied, orders made for cumulation or concurrence will be made on an imperfect foundation.  
           
           
          [48] Further, the need to ensure proper sentencing on each count is reinforced when it is recalled that a failure to do so may give rise to artificial claims of disparity between co-offenders or otherwise distort general sentencing practices in relation to particular offences. (references omitted, emphasis added) 
          
         
         
        23 The effect of  
        Pearce 
         is that, in sentencing a defendant for more than one offence, the Court is required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality. It is only after determining an appropriate sentence for each offence that the Court should consider whether the sum of the separate sentences properly reflects the totality of the criminality involved. 
        
       
     84 The Court then proceeded to examine ""Common Elements of Multiple Offences"" and stated (at [30]): 
      
       
        
         
        30 The principle underlying the appellant's submissions was that a defendant should not be punished more than once for the same failures which may be the subject of multiple offences. This issue was considered by the High Court in  
        Pearce  
        at 623. In that case,  
        McHugh 
        ,  
        Hayne 
         and  
        Callinan 
         JJ stated the principle in the following way: 
         
         
          
          To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements,  
          it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. 
           No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts. (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
     85 After considering the judgment of Wright J, President, in WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Mulder) v Yass Shire Council (2000) 99 IR 284, the Full Bench undertook the following further discussion as to the principle of totality (at [34] - [38]): 
      
      34. In  
      Warman International Limited v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales 
       (1998) 80 IR 326 (a case decided before  
      Pearce 
      ), a Full Bench of this Court treated the fact that different offences have strong connecting features as supporting the application of the totality principle. In that case, the Full Bench considered the appropriate penalties for a defendant convicted of five offences under the  
      Occupational Health and Safety Act 
       (under both sections 15(1) and 16(1)), and one offence under s 27(1) of the  
      Factories Shops and Industries Act 
       1962. Those offences arose out of four accidents and one inspection at the defendant's premises. The Full Bench stated (at 339) that:  
       
        
         
          
           
          There were in our view clear features connecting a number of these events to each other. The first prosecution concerned a sheet metal rolling machine, which would appear to stand alone. The second and third prosecutions both related to the use and fencing of a fast loop moulding machine. The fourth prosecution related to a table mounted circular saw of some age which was sought to be replaced after the relevant accident by a new saw which itself, although freely available on the market, had two identified safety weaknesses which led to the fifth and sixth prosecutions. This inter-relationship seems to us to satisfy with considerable ease the proposition involved in the principle of totality that there be some similarity in the offences.  
          
         
        
       
      
      
      35. Subject to one consideration, that judgment reflects an appropriate application of the principle of totality, reflecting the need to avoid excessive punishment and to avoid ""double punishment"" for common elements of multiple offences. The last sentence of the passage cited, however, which seems to limit the circumstances in which the principle of totality is to be applied, appears to state the principle too narrowly and may well require reconsideration in subsequent Full Bench proceedings. See, for example, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
      Close  
      (1993) 
        
      65 A Crim R 55 at 59-60 where  
      Hunt 
       CJ at CL stated:  
       
       
        
         
          
          Whenever sentences are accumulated, careful consideration must always be given to the principle of totality - as to whether the simple addition of two or more sentences which may individually be appropriate has nevertheless produced a total figure which is excessive having regard to the totality of the criminality involved:  
          Glenister 
           [1980] 2 NSWLR 597 at 612;  
          Holder and Johnston 
           [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260-261; (1983) 13 A Crim R 375 at 389-390. That principle is  
          not 
           restricted to sentences imposed for offences committed as part of a connected and roughly contemporaneous series of offences:  
          L Vogel & Son Pty Ltd v Anderson 
           (1968) 120 CLR 157 at 168;  
          Bakhos 
           (1989) 39 A Crim R 174 at 176, 177-178;  
          Harrison 
           (1990) 48 A Crim R 197 at 198-199. It was clearly relevant in this case. In such circumstances, all of the sentences which are accumulated should usually be adjusted downwards in order to produce an acceptable total sentence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        A similar approach was taken by  
        Sheller 
         JA at 56-57 and by  
        Sully 
         J at 70. However, this appeal does not require for its determination the resolution of that issue. 
        
       
       
      36. This review of the authorities establishes that in determining penalties for multiple offences under the  
      Occupational Health and Safety Act 
       the Court is required to determine separately an appropriate penalty for each offence. Having done so, the Court should then consider what the appropriate penalty should be by applying the principle of totality. Where the multiple offences contain common elements, the principle of totality must, for that reason alone, be applied to ensure that the defendant is not punished more than once for the common elements of the offences and to avoid the double jeopardy that would follow if that occurred. The principle must also be applied for the reasons stated in  
      Pearce 
       and  
      Mill 
      .  
       
       
      37. We should emphasise that the principle that a defendant is not to be punished more than once for the common elements of the offences does not require that a single penalty only should be imposed for the multiple offences. The Court is required to determine a separate penalty for each offence before applying the principle of totality. It will then usually be appropriate to fix separate penalties for each offence. It is in applying the principle of totality - which requires the consideration of the overall criminality involved in the offences - that regard should be had to the principle that a defendant is not to be punished more than once for elements which are common to the offences as well as ensuring the aggregate sentence or penalty is just and appropriate.  
       
       
      38. In accordance with  
      Pearce 
      , we must first consider the appropriate penalty for each offence, assessed separately. 
     86 The decision in Crown (Department of Education and Training) v Keenan has been applied in a number of decisions of this Court where common elements have been found between offences: WorkCover Authority of NSW v Transfield at [42]; WorkCover Authority of NSW (Inspector Thomas Clark) v Ledonne Constructions Pty Limited [2001] NSWIRComm 272 at [32]; Inspector Mayo-Ramsay v Rail Infrastructure Corporation [2002] NSWIRComm 217 at [69] and Inspector Brett Martin v True Perspective Pty Limited [2002] NSWIRComm 197. However, in Inspector John Patton v Brambles Australia Limited t/as Gardner Perrott [2002] NSWIRComm 178, Kavanagh J expressed a view that Keenan was not authority for the proposition that it was a necessary precondition for the application of the principle of totality for there to be similarity in the offences or common elements in the offences. In that matter her Honour found that the charges did not contain common elements ""in the nature of the breaches as pleaded"" but nonetheless had regard to the ""overall criminality of the defendant in setting final penalty"".87 88 Having regard to submissions of the defendant in this matter (and the prosecutor by its failure to adopt any contrary position), it may not be necessary to explicitly deal with the question as to whether the principle of totality may be confined to circumstances where there are common elements of multiple offences. It is certainly beyond doubt that where multiple offences contain common elements, the principle of totality must, for that reason alone, be applied to ensure that the defendant is not punished more than once for those offences and to avoid double jeopardy. The 'storage' offences in this matter, whilst arising respectively under ss15 and 16 of the Act, nonetheless contain common elements which properly require the operation of the principle of totality in the assessment of the penalty for those offences. As to the broader question raised in Brambles, it is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that the Full Bench in Crown (Department of Education and Training) v Keenan left open the question, in my view, as to whether the principle of totality might be applied in circumstances where a defendant was convicted of multiple offences which did not have 'common elements'. In any event, I have also had regard to the circumstances of the offences and the offender in assessing the overall criminality of the defendant in this matter.89 I consider that the pleas of guilty were properly made in this matter and enter a verdict accordingly. Having regard to the proper approach to the operation of the principle of totality referred to by the Full Bench in Crown (Department of Education and Training) v Keenan, I shall firstly determine the penalty for each offence before applying the principle of totality. In doing so I will apply at that point the discount arising from the financial means of the defendant and the subjective considerations earlier identified. I consider that, having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence, and after allowing a discount for the subjective factors and taking into account the financial means of the defendant, an appropriate penalty with regard to each offence is as follows: 
      
      Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 
       
       
      I consider the appropriate penalty to be $25, 000. 
       
       
      Matter No. IRC3955 of 2000 
       
       
      I consider the appropriate penalty to be $5, 000. 
     90  
      
      Matter No. IRC3957 of 2000 
       
       
      I consider the appropriate penalty to be $10, 000. 
     91 However, applying the principle of totality to the charges in Matter Nos. IRC3954 and 3957 of 2000, I consider that the appropriate total penalty for the storage charges should be $25, 000. The penalty for each offence should then be: 
      
      Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000 
       
       
      I consider the appropriate penalty to be $23, 000. 
       
       
      Matter No. IRC3955 of 2000 
       
       
      I consider the appropriate penalty to be $2, 000. 
       
       
      Matter No. IRC3957 of 2000 
       
       
      I consider the appropriate penalty to be $10, 000. 
     92 Finally, I note the parties' agreement as to costs that the prosecutor will pay the defendant the sum of $8,500. Further, the prosecutor should have a moiety of the fine. I also confirm the dismissal of charges in Matter No. IRC3956 of 2000.93 I make the following orders: 
      
      1. The following fines are imposed on the defendant with a moiety thereof to the prosecutor: 
      
      
       (a) As to Matter No. IRC3954 of 2000, $23, 000. 
       
       
       (b) As to Matter No. IRC3955 of 2000, $2,000. 
       
       
       (c) As to Matter No. IRC3957 of 2000, $10, 000. 
      
      
      2. The prosecutor shall pay the defendant's costs in the sum of $8,500.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: These two applications for leave to appeal derive from circumstances which are to an extent common however the applicants were separately represented and their arguments were independent of each other. It was convenient to hear argument successively and in the presence of both applicants. 
     
      
    2 In July 2000 following numerous complaints from members of the public a police operation was mounted to investigate supply of prohibited drugs from residential premises at Bidwill. These were located two doors from a primary and pre-school. The operation included the use of electronic surveillance including, pursuit to warrant, telephone intercepts and listening devices. Undercover police were authorized to engage in “controlled operations” seeking to and purchasing illicit drugs.  
     
      
    3 The occupants of the premises included the applicants, Joanne Dineen (a younger sister of the applicant Kathleen Dineen) and several other family members including school aged children. 
     
      
    4 The applicants and Joanne Dineen appeared for sentence before Gibson DCJ at Penrith District Court, and on 27 September 2002 respective impositions of sentence occurred.  
     
      
    5 Mark Arthur Meres pleaded guilty on arraignment to one count of supplying a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) on an ongoing basis between 20 April and 15 May 2001, contrary to s25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, 1985. Unless otherwise stated, section references are to that statute. To be taken into account on sentence for that offence were four charges on a Form 1, two charges of knowingly taking part in the supply of amphetamines, one charge of possession of the same drug and one charge of goods in custody reasonably suspected of having been stolen or unlawfully obtained (a motorcycle). 
     
      
    6 He was sentenced to imprisonment for four years nine months with a non-parole period of three years, both sentence and non-parole period to commence on 6 December 2002, that date coinciding with the expiry of a sentence of twelve months imprisonment which he was required to serve for an unrelated offence. It should be noted that Meres had been in custody for six months prior to the commencement of that unrelated sentence and, as that custody was referrable to the current matters the sentencing judge expressly acknowledged an allowance of six months which was “owed” to the applicant. It is therefore appropriate to attribute a notional assessment of five years and three months to represent the head sentence. 
     
      
    7 Kathleen Dineen was presented on indictment charging one count of supplying a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine) on an ongoing basis between 4 April and 16 May 2001, contrary to s25A and, in the alternative, of supplying that drug on 4 April 2001 contrary to s25(1) and five further counts of similar offences contrary to s25(1) committed on 8, 14, 22 and 30 April and 16 May 2001. The prescribed maximum penalty for an offence in s25(1) is fifteen years imprisonment. The prescribed maximum penalty for an offence in s25A is twenty years imprisonment. 
     
      
    8 She pleaded not guilty to the count of ongoing supply but guilty to the alternative of supply as well as pleading guilty to the five further counts similar to the alternative. The Crown accepted these pleas of guilty in discharge of the indictment.  
     
      
    9 His Honour was asked to take into account nine further offences on a Form 1, eight charged supply of methylamphetamine and one charged supply of cannabis.  
     
      
    10 In the event, Kathleen Dineen stood for sentence on six counts of supplying methylamphetamine contrary to s25(1). On count seven (the offence of 16 May 2001) she was sentenced to six years six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years, both to date from 6 June 2001 upon which date she had been taken into custody. The Form 1 offences were taken into account in this imposition. On counts two and three (the offences of 4 and 8 April) she was sentenced to concurrent fixed terms of eighteen months imprisonment. On counts four and five (the offences of 14 and 22 April) to concurrent fixed terms of two years and on count six (the offence of 30 April) to a fixed term of three years. All the fixed terms were directed to commence on 6 June 2001.  
     
      
    11 Joanne Dineen was sentenced upon one count of ongoing supply of amphetamines (between 20 April and 16 May 2001) contrary to s25A and she was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years. Four further charges of supplying amphetamines (on dates between 11 April and 16 May 2001) contrary to s25(1) were taken into account on a Form 1.  
     
      
    12 All the offenders were habituated to amphetamines, however, they were suppliers in what his Honour described as “a busy and thriving operation”. Some challenge to that observation was offered in a written submission on behalf of Kathleen Dineen when it was stated that it was worthwhile to look at the evidence of the undercover police to appreciate the “fairly loose” operation that it really was. It was contended: 
     
      
       
        
        “The usual scenario was that an undercover operative would attend at the subject premises and seek to purchase amphetamines from one or more of the offenders. On taking cash from the operative for the amphetamines, on the basis that the offender (s) had no money to purchase the amphetamines, one or more of the offenders would leave the subject premises either by pushbike or car and return a short time later with the amphetamines. It is clear on the evidence that the offenders had a supplier (s) nearby and rarely did they have the drugs required by the operative on the premises.” 
        
       
      
    13 There was no finding about the cash liquidity situation of the offenders nor the source from which the drugs emanated. It may be mentioned for example that on 15 May Meres produced plastic bags of amphetamines from within the premises, one of which he then sold to an undercover operative receiving $170 in exchange. When arrested at the premises on 6 June he was in possession of a small satchel containing amphetamines. The facts are as consistent with the drugs being “warehoused” somewhere or with someone as being supplied by someone else. Be that as it may, I reject the submission that the operation was little different from that of “street dealers”.  
     
      
    14 The correctness of his Honour’s finding that it was a busy and thriving operation is demonstrated by the sheer quantity of intercepted telephone contacts. I accept that not every call would necessarily relate to drug supply but to a single telephone service in what gave the appearance of being a suburban dwelling about 3,500 calls were monitored in the period between 30 March and 6 June 2001. In particular, Kathleen Dineen was identified as agreeing to supply various quantities of drugs ranging from 1.75 grams to 14 grams. A Sergeant Clarke gave evidence, accepted by his Honour, enabling translation of argot into statements about quantities of particular drug. It was contended that his Honour erroneously referred to single dealings of amounts up to an ounce but, even so, criminality is not always to be measured by quantity (although in some cases, of course, it may be a principal factor and there are statutory scales of traffickable, commercial etc.) but in these cases it is the repetitive nature of illicit dealing, in the case of Meres, charged with ongoing supply and in the case of Kathleen Dineen the multiple instances of her conduct. His Honour’s description of the offenders having gone “into business selling or supplying drugs cold bloodedly for reward” was manifestly accurate.  
     
      
       
      MERES 
      
    15 I have mentioned above some of the facts pertaining to the applicant Meres. On occasions he received money from undercover operatives and departed by bicycle (sometimes leaving his watch as an earnest) and returned shortly afterwards with the requested drugs. 
     
      
    16 The first ground of appeal asserts that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of the disparity between sentence received by him and his co-offender Joanne Dineen. The principles of approach concerning such a ground are well established and do not require restatement: Lowe v The Queen 1984 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v The Queen 1997 189 CLR 295. 
     
      
    17 Attention was drawn to a finding of the sentencing judge that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The main facts in the cases of Joanne Dineen and Meres do not vary to any great extent.” 
        
       
      
    18 That finding may be accepted but there were marked differences in the subjective cases to be taken into account in relation to the respective offenders. Joanne Dineen had pleaded guilty before the Local Court and was committed for sentence pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act. Meres had been the subject of committal proceedings and pleaded guilty some time thereafter when he was presented for arraignment. The “utilitarian” value of their pleas of guilty were assessed by his Honour at 20 percent and 13 percent respectively: R v Thomson 2000 49 NSWLR 383. There is no error in those assessments nor is the difference capable of giving rise to reasonable complaint.  
     
      
    19 In addition his Honour expressly found that the early aspect of Joanne Dineen’s plea of guilty was itself some evidence of her remorse. Importantly, there was a stark difference between the offenders on the issue of efforts at rehabilitation. A pre sentence report conveyed the applicant’s stated intention to make positive changes but this included what seemed to be a proviso that he “agreed to attend for drug counselling or undertake a residual drug rehabilitation programme if so directed”. By way of contrast, Joanne Dineen had entered a methadone program, attended counselling and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and sought to further her general education. Reference was made to Meres having been in custody but both he and Joanne Dineen were in custody between arrest in June 2001 and sentence which was finally imposed on 27 September 2002.  
     
      
    20 The positive effort on the part of Joanne Dineen was noted by his Honour against a background of “a long record for possession of drugs as well as violence and dishonesty” and his comment that she would, at first glance be a bad prospect for rehabilitation is readily understandable. Nevertheless, Joanne Dineen had embarked upon the efforts mentioned. 
     
      
    21 The applicant challenged a finding attributed to the sentencing judge that he had “a bad record in relation to possession” but as the Crown Prosecutor pointed out that does not complete the quote from the remarks on sentence which referred to the applicant having “a bad record in relation to possession, violence, driving offences and dishonesty and his response to supervision has been bad”.  
     
      
    22 As above stated the effective sentence received by Meres was four years nine months (notionally five years three months) with a non-parole period of three years, whereas Joanne Dineen received four years with a non-parole period of two years.  
     
      
    23 The applicant’s “parity” argument should be rejected. 
     
      
    24 The second ground of appeal related directly to the quantification of the “discount” for the guilty plea (13 percent). This was also raised in connection with contrast of 20 percent received by the co-offender Joanne Dineen. It might be mentioned on this aspect that an assessment of 10 percent was made in relation to the sentence of Kathleen Dineen. 
     
      
    25 In Thomson @ 418 two circumstances were identified as generally affecting the level of discount in a particular case, the timing of the plea and the potential complexity and length of the trial, the need for which is avoided by a plea of guilty. The applicant contends that the second of these required that he receive a discount, at least to the same level as Joanne Dineen. Given the evidence available of the direct dealing by the applicant with the undercover officers, the issues at trial would not seem to fit any category of more than moderate complexity. The length of trial would depend largely upon forensic decision by the Crown as to how much background (particularly surveillance, telephone intercept or listening device evidence) was appropriate to be tendered. 
     
      
    26 This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    27 The third ground asserted that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    28 It needs to be observed that s25A has been recognized to have been introduced to provide a strong deterrent to those who may be tempted to engage in an ongoing trade in drugs: R v Khaled [2001] NSWCCA 169. An obvious target of the legislation is the dealer who might claim that his or her offence (viewed in isolation) is relatively minor but who is, in reality, a persistent trafficker. 
     
      
    29 The applicant’s prior record to which the sentencing judge made the reference earlier set out, operated towards disentitlement to lenience. It was a serious matter of aggravation that at the time of the commission of these offences the applicant was currently subject to a term of imprisonment, suspended upon his having entered a recognizance to be of good behaviour.  
     
      
    30 As has become common in these cases, the statistics collated by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales were extracted. It does not seem to me to be of utility to recount the variety of sentences observable in some samples of cases relied upon by the applicant and by the Crown. The head sentence (assuming the notional five years three months) is slightly more than one quarter of the maximum prescribed by statute. That sentence also included a reflection for the matters on the Form 1 which, in the circumstances, would not be merely token. As abovementioned, the applicant’s record disentitled him to particular leniency and there was the matter of serious aggravation. The sentence was within discretionary range and not manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      KATHLEEN DINEEN 
      
    31 A ground of appeal was simply expressed in an assertion that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and that some other sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    32 In support of the ground, counsel for the applicant drew attention to a number of incidental factors. In distinction from both co-offenders Kathleen Dineen was not convicted of an offence against s25A although given the six counts and the nine matters on Form 1, it was not contended that her offences should be regarded as isolated actions. The amount of drug in every case was very small. The reference to as much as an ounce for an individual “deal” in the remarks on sentence was acknowledged to be erroneous.  
     
      
    33 The applicant was a woman of thirty eight years being imprisoned for the first time. She had previously been convicted of possession of drugs once as recently as October 1999, but the two previous occasions were as long ago as thirteen years to 1989 and sixteen years to 1986. On each of the prior occasions she had been dealt with by fine. It may be observed, although parity was not raised as a specific ground, that her record provided a favourable contrast as against those of her co-offenders. 
     
      
    34 The learned sentencing judge found that this applicant was more actively involved than the others. All of her offences were evidenced by agreements to supply made in telephone calls which had been intercepted. The statement of facts tendered revealed that between 20 April and 16 May undercover operatives attended the premises on eight occasions and purchased 3.5 grams of amphetamine on each occasion pursuant to these calls. The statement of facts does not involve the applicant in the physical exchange of money and drugs. I recognize that the total of intercepted calls previously stated refers to a span of time longer than that within which the applicant’s offences were committed, and, as I have said, it should be accepted that not every call to the premises related to drugs. However, a flavour of her participation can be obtained from the transcript of an intercepted conversation which gave rise to the first and second (alternative) counts charged against her. A call to the premises was received at about 7.50 am on Wednesday 4 April: 
     
      
       
        
        “DINEEN: Yeah. 
        
       
      CALLER: Hello, is that you Kath? 
       
      DINEEN: Yep. 
       
      CALLER: It’s Rhonda. 
       
        
        DINEEN: Yeah I haven’t got nothing right now but after the kids go to school. 
         
        CALLER: All right, ‘cause um he wants sixteen. 
         
        DINEEN: Yeah. 
         
        CALLER: All right, and he needs it by nine o’clock. 
        
       
      DINEEN: Yeah all right. 
       
      CALLER: All right? 
       
      DINEEN: Yep. 
       
      CALLER: Is that okay? 
       
      DINEEN: Yep. 
       
      CALLER: All right darl. Okay, bye-bye.” 
       
      
    35 Against that background debate between counsel for the applicant and the Crown focussed upon whether the imposition was so far outside of an established pattern of sentencing to call for intervention and substitution of a lesser term. The argument, as a matter of particularity, was directed to the longest term which had been imposed upon count seven. 
     
      
    36 The Court was invited to look at statistics collated by the Judicial Commission and at sampled particular cases. The Crown called to attention that bald statistics have been said to be of limited use: R v Bloomfield 1998 44 NSWLR 734, but in that case it was also observed that the statistics may provide an indication of general sentencing trends and standards, assist in assuring consistency and be useful in determining whether a sentence is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate: @ 739.  
     
      
    37 Statistics compiled up to March 2003 revealed that of 246 offenders charged with supply of amphetamines contrary to s25, the highest head sentence of six years imprisonment was imposed on two offenders only. Of 240 offenders (I do not know why the number is less than the number of head sentences surveyed) the highest non-parole period was four years six months imposed upon a single offender, the next highest three years imposed on nine other offenders. It is to be observed that the statistics are “rounded up” and the highest sentence may actually only be within the twelve month range leading up to the number of years stated.  
     
      
    38 As I have remarked, the Crown accepted a plea of not guilty to an offence against s25A when accepting the pleas of guilty to the offences against s25 in full discharge of the indictment. In R v CBK [2002] NSWCCA 457 Wood CJ at CL observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “It needs to be clearly understood that section 25A offences are considerably more serious than section 25 offences, as is indicated by the increase in the maximum available penalty. 
        
       
       
        
        An offender charged with a section 25A offence cannot rely upon an argument that the act of supply was an isolated event, nor can (he or she) expect to receive a sentence of the kind which may be appropriate for a single offence of supply. “ 
        
       
      
    39 There is no question, of course, of the applicant’s offences being an isolated event. They were ingredients of a thriving business. Nevertheless, given that an offence against s25A is the more serious, it is instructive to note that a statistical collation of sentences for s25A offenders (as at March 2003 for amphetamines) shows that of forty nine offenders the highest term was five years imprisonment received by two offenders and that the highest non-parole period was three years received by three offenders (out of forty four). S25A is a special enactment targeted at ongoing dealing in drugs, including small repetitive dealing. 
     
      
    40 It must be recognized that the upper extremity of a statistical range does not represent the maximum appropriate for the worst offence and/or the worst offender. A worst case has the potential to attract the statutory maximum. Nor is multiplicity of offences with the inherent possibility of accumulation, to be ignored. Nevertheless the whole of the information before the Court including the sentencing judge’s findings as to the facts of these offences and the subjective circumstances of the applicant lead me to conclude that, as against established sentencing patterns, the imposition of six years six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years is excessive to a level at which the intervention of this Court and a less severe sentence is warranted. 
     
      
    41 The structure of the sentences for the various counts which I have set out above suggests that the approach to sentencing for multiple counts directed by Pearce v The Queen 1998 194 CLR 610 may not have been implemented. However, the fixed term sentences on counts two, three, four and five have been fully served and the sentences are expired. The only current sentences consist of three years fixed term imposed on count six and on count seven, six years six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. The nine matters on Form 1 were taken into account in fixing the latter sentence. 
     
      
    42 In relation to the fixed term sentences it is apparent that his Honour had increased the term successively to reflect a greater seriousness with which he regarded repetition. I would not vary the sentence on count six. I would assess an appropriate sentence on count seven, taking into account the Form 1 matters, as five years imprisonment. I would find special circumstances similar to his Honour and specify a non-parole period of three years. 
     
      
    43 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      IN THE APPLICATION OF MERES: 
       
      
    44 Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted, but appeal dismissed. 
     
      
       
      IN THE APPLICATION BY KATHLEEN FRANCIS DINEEN: 
       
      
    45 (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted.  
     
      
      (2) Appeal allowed. 
       
      (3) Sentence imposed in the District Court on count seven quashed and in lieu thereof, the applicant sentenced on that count to five years imprisonment to date from 6 June 2001 and to expire on 5 June 2006, with a non-parole period of three years to date from 6 June 2001 and to expire on 5 June 2004. 
      
     (4) Sentences on other counts to stand. 
     
      
      (5) First date of eligibility for parole specified as 5 June 2004. 
       
      
    46 IPP JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    47 SHAW J: I agree with Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: In this application for leave to appeal I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Hodgson JA in draft form. His Honour comprehensively sets out the evidence, the findings of the magistrate, the history of the proceedings, and the legislative provisions, and I have no need to repeat this material. 
     
      
    2 The question in this case, as Sperling J recognised, was not whether the transactions between the appellant and its customers could be characterised as mortgages. As his Honour said, plainly they were. The question was whether the transactions were pledges and could also be characterised as such. 
     
      
    3 The transactions exhibited all the essential elements of a pledge at common law because there was a bailment of goods by their owner to the appellant as security for a debt, and the appellant had possession of the goods pursuant to that bailment. The appellant possessed additional rights under its mortgages, but in my judgment these additional rights were not inconsistent with a common law pledge of the goods. Those additional rights did not deny or exclude any of the essential features of a valid pledge but merely conferred additional rights on the pledgee. 
     
      
    4 This is clear in principle and is not denied by any authority to which we were referred. Thus in Ex parte Hubbard in re Hardwick (1886) 17 QBD 690 Bowen LJ said at 698: 
     
      
       
        
        If the pledge is accompanied by a written document, still the essence of the transaction is that actual possession of the goods should be given to the pledgee. 
        
       
      
    5 Although, in that case, the document only recorded the pledge and did not purport to confer additional rights as a mortgagee on the pledgee, this analysis is still relevant. 
     
      
    6 In Ex parte Official Receiver in re Morritt (1886) 18 QBD 222 Cotton LJ, delivering the judgment of himself, Lindley and Bowen LJJ, said at 232-3: 
     
      
       
        
        A pledge of personal chattels as a rule is and must be accompanied by delivery of possession. It is out of the possession given him under the contract that the pledgee’s rights spring. A contract of pledge carries with it the implication that the security may be made available to satisfy the obligation, and enables the pledgee in possession (though he has not the general property in the thing pledged, but a special property only) to sell on default in payment and after notice to the pledgor ... A mortgage of personal chattels involves in its essence, not the delivery of possession, but a conveyance of title as a security for the debt. A mortgage of personal chattels may, however, be accompanied with a transfer of possession ... But I am of opinion that a mortgagee of personal chattels which are in his possession is not in a worse position than a pledgee, and that, where there is no express power of sale given by the mortgage, he has, after default in payment, and after he has given the mortgagor a reasonable time to pay the money due, a power to sell and give a good title to the purchaser .... 
        
       
      
    7 The important point, for present purposes, is that a mortgagee of personal chattels which are in his possession is not in a worse position than a pledgee. If he has all the rights of a pledgee plus the additional rights conferred by his mortgage, including the general property in the goods, then the transaction can fairly and properly be characterised as a combined pledge and mortgage. Such transactions are clearly within the Act. 
     
      
    8 I agree therefore with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    9 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Hodgson JA and the additional reasons of Handley JA. 
     
      
    10 HODGSON JA: The applicant Palgo Holding Pty. Limited was convicted in Lismore Local Court on the following charge: 
     
      
       
        
        Between 16 October, 2000 and 1 March, 2001 at Byron Bay in the State of New South Wales that the defendant did carry on the business of lending money on the security of pawned goods within the meaning of the Pawnbrokers & Second-hand Dealers Act 1996 whilst not being the holder of a licence contrary to the Act or Regulations.  
         
         
        Particulars 
         
        The defendant carried out 36 pawn broking transactions in the name of Cash Counters Byron Bay (17.10.00-28.02.01).  
        
       
      
    11 The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales pursuant to s.104 of the Justice Act 1902. This appeal was dismissed by Sperling J on 30 September 2002. The applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court from the decision of Sperling J. The application was argued on the basis that, if leave is granted, the appeal would be decided without further argument. 
     
      
       
      EVIDENCE BEFORE MAGISTRATE 
      
    12 The prosecution evidence included evidence by Mr. K.W. Gowans, an inspector with the Department of Fair Trading, by way of a statement and also oral evidence. The statement included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        17. On the 16th February 2001 I returned to the Byron Bay Police station to continue my enquiries. This included a taped interview with a Leon Murray who had carried out transactions with Cash Counters Byron Bay that were current at that time. Mr Murray indicated that he had carried out various transactions with Cash Counters Byron Bay and all had been on the (sic) basis. He would enter the store, Darrin would say how much he was prepared to loan, the paperwork was then signed, the goods left as security and Mr Murray would then leave with the money. 
         
         
        18. On the 20th February 2001 I again went to the Byron Bay Police Station to check evidence and again was involved in a taped interview with a Guy Bampling. Mr Bampling had a current transaction in place with Cash Counters Byron Bay at that time. He said that Darrin had offered a sum as a loan on the goods and when agreed to had taken the goods into storage as security and gave him the cash. He indicated that he had 7 days to pay back the money with interest to redeem the goods. 
         
         
        19. I continued my enquiries over the next 2 months approx and interviewed other persons in relation to transactions carried out by them at Cash Counters Byron Bay. 
         
         
        20. All persons interviewed indicated they had taken in goods which were valued by the manager of Cash Counters Byron Bay Mr Darrin Page. They all indicated that when the details were agreed to Mr Page took the items into storage as security and gave them a loan against the goods. The money along with the interest had to be paid within 7 days or the goods were sent to auction in Brisbane. 
        
       
      
    13 The primary judge summarised other evidence given for the prosecution as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        10 A statement by Senior Constable D L Hurt was tendered (Exhibit 4). He also gave oral evidence. On 15 February 2001, he executed a search warrant in relation to the appellant's premises. A quantity of goods were seized, including computers, jewellery, CDs, stereos, surfboards, mobile phones and tools. 
         
         
        11 Five ring binders containing copies of some hundreds of transaction documents numbered 144 to 949, found on the premises, were tendered (Exhibit 5). The transactions occurred between 16 October 2000 and 1 March 2001. 
         
         
        12 The transaction documents in Exhibit 5 included the 36 transactions particularised. The documentation was in standardised form, having been generated by computer on the premises in relation to each transaction. It consisted of sections entitled ""Secured Loan Agreement"" and ""Bill of Sale/Goods Mortgage"".  
         
         
        13 Particulars of the bill of sale incorporated in the document included the name of the appellant as ""Mortgagee"", the name of the borrower as ""Mortgagor"", and a description of the goods as ""Mortgaged Property"". Then followed a particular ""Location of Goods"" against which, in all cases, the following words appeared: ""In storage at mortgagors request"". The terms of the bill of sale/goods mortgage were attached. 
        
       
      
    14 The mortgage included the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        1(a) If the Mortgaged Property is situated in Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania, South Australia or the Northern Territory, you transfer title in the Mortgaged Property to us as security for the repayment of the Secured Moneys. 
         
        … 
         
        5.1 You must keep the Mortgaged Property in good condition and repair. 
         
        5.2 You must keep the Mortgaged Property in your possession and custody. 
         
        ... 
         
        6.2 You must take out comprehensive insurance 
         
        (a) you must maintain insurance in connection with the Mortgaged Property against loss, theft, damage, accident, fire, storm, tempest and any other risk that a prudent owner would insurance against; 
         
        (b) you must insure the Mortgaged Property for any value that we may reasonably require; 
         
        (c) you must insure our interest as well as your interest in the Mortgaged Property and you must note our interest on any insurance policy. 
         
        6.3 You must provide evidence of any insurance. 
         
        Upon request, you must show us evidence that satisfies us of any invoice and its currency in connection with the Mortgaged Property. 
        
       
      
    15 The primary judge’s summary continued as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        14 Ms J Rafter gave evidence in relation to three of the subject transactions. As to the first of them, she said that she pooled certain goods with two other persons, that the transaction went through in her name, and that the one sum of money was lent which she split up with the other two. She said that the manager of the appellant just took the goods, the implication being that there was no suggestion that she and her friends had the option of taking the goods away with them and that there was no request by them for the appellant to store the goods during the currency of the loan. There was then evidence of two further transactions entered into by Ms Rafter. In relation to those transactions there was explicit evidence that no suggestion was made that the goods could be taken away and there was no request for the appellant to store the goods. She said she was not asked at any stage whether she had insurance. 
         
         
        15 Mr Z S Jacobs gave evidence of several transactions with the appellant. He said he did not request the manager, with whom he dealt, to hold the goods. No suggestion was made that he could retain the goods and there was no request by him that the appellant store them.  
         
         
        16 A statement by Mr R M Ferris was tendered. He said that on 12 February 2001 he borrowed $80 on the security of a portable radio and a mobile phone. After the documents had been signed, the appellant's manager with whom Mr Ferris dealt, said he would keep the goods at the shop. Mr Ferris said in his statement that he assumed he had to leave the goods with the appellant because that is the way a pawnbroker normally works.  
         
         
        17 A statement by Ms K A Vagne was tendered. She said that on 9 February 2001 she borrowed $60 on the security of a microwave and a set of speakers. She had dealt with the appellant previously. She had asked a few times where the goods were kept and the appellant's manager had said they were kept out the back. He had said that the goods would be kept there until the loan was paid off. She had noticed the reference in the documentation to the goods being kept in storage at the borrower's request. She said she had never quite understood what that meant. She had never been asked about it and had assumed that that was necessary to get the loan. The implication was that she had never been given the option of taking the goods away and had never requested that they be stored by the appellant. 
         
         
        18 A statement by Ms M C Boyne was tendered. She said that on 8 January 2001 she had borrowed $40 on the security of a ring. Before the documentation was completed, the ring had been put in a plastic bag and taken out the back. She said she was not made aware that she did not have to leave the ring as security in order to get the loan. Indeed, the person with whom she dealt had said that she would have to leave the ring as security. She took this to be the usual thing. 
         
         
        19 A statement by Mr M S Hunt was tendered. He said that on 2 February 2001 he borrowed $60 on the security of a guitar. Before the documentation was prepared, the person with whom he dealt took the guitar out the back. Mr Hunt said he was not told that he was not required to leave the guitar there, and he did not make a request to have it kept in storage.  
         
         
        20 A summary of a taped interview with Mr G N Bampling was tendered. In the transaction to which he referred, a radio/CD player and a video player had been provided as security. He had left the goods because he believed that was part of a normal hock transaction. He did not make any request to have the goods stored at the shop. 
         
         
        21 A statement by Mr P R Farrell was tendered. He had borrowed $100 on the security of a Ford Falcon motor car. He left with the car. He was not requested to leave the car with the appellant. The formula ""In storage at mortgagors request"" nonetheless appeared in the documentation relating to this transaction. 
        
       
      
    16 The primary judge set out the evidence called for the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        24 Mr M C White was called for the appellant. He was administration officer for Cash Counters Pty Limited. The appellant was a licensee of that company which carried on a lending business in Queensland. He said the paperwork tendered was in a standard format used by the company in Queensland, where it had been approved by the relevant state government department. He had seen Mr Page, the manager of the Byron Bay business, doing particular loans. Mr White was permitted to give an explanation for the formula appearing in the documentation to the effect that the goods were stored at the borrower's request. This was that the borrower was under a contractual obligation to insure the property. Borrowers did not have insurance. Accordingly, the company, at the borrower's request, performed the borrower's obligations in that regard by keeping the goods on the premises where they were covered by the appellant's insurance policy. In that regard, Mr White said, the appellant was acting as agent for the borrower in relation to the borrower's obligation to keep the goods insured. 
         
         
        25 Mr White said that the manager of the Byron Bay store at the time of the relevant transactions, Mr Darren Page, was no longer employed by the appellant and was now in Perth. He conceded in cross-examination that Mr Page was a relative of one of the directors of Cash Counters Pty Limited and that Mr White had made no inquiry as to Mr Page's availability to attend court and give evidence. 
        
       
       
      DECISION OF MAGISTRATE 
      
    17 The case involved the interpretation of s.6 of the Pawnbrokers and Second-hand Dealers Act 1996, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        6. A person must not carry on a business of lending money on the security of pawned goods except in accordance with a licence held by the person. 
        
       
       
      There is no definition of “pawned goods” in the Act. 
       
      
    18 It was common ground that the applicant had no licence during the relevant period, and also that money was lent on the security of goods. The only question at issue was whether, in the events that occurred, the goods over which security was provided were “pawned goods” within the meaning of the Act. The Magistrate found the offence proved, convicted the applicant, and imposed a fine of $6,000.00. 
     
      
    19 After considering the arguments presented to him, the Magistrate expressed his conclusions as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The act provides a definition of a Pawnbroker in these terms (vide section 3) ""Pawnbroker means a person who carries on a business of lending money on the security of pawned goods"". There is however no definition within the act of what is or is not pawned goods. The shorter Oxford Dictionary defines pawn as ""a thing given, deposited or left in another's keeping, as security for a debt"" and as a verb ""to give or deposit as security for the payment of a sum of money."" Sykes and Walker in the 5th edition of The Law of Securities describes pawning or pledging as arising ""when one person transfers the possession of goods actually, constructively, or symbolically to another as security for the payment of a debt ... ... If the pawnor defaults the pawnee may have recourse to the chattel to sell it to satisfy the debt."" In reality in all but one transaction the goods were left with the defendant and of course Exhibit 2 clearly demonstrates that in the event of the principal and interest not being repaid then the goods were to be sold. In Osborne Computer v Airroad Distribution 1995 37 NSWLR at page 389 (a case involving corporation law) His Honour Mr Justice Rolfe had cause to determine whether goods were held by lien or pledge and cited Herron A/CJ in Gunnedah Municipal Council v New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Co Limited (1963) NSWLR 1229 at p 1232 quoted with approval Cockburn CJ in Donald v Suckling (1886) LR 1 QB 585 at 618-619 ""We are not dealing with a case of lien, which is merely the right to retain possession of the chattel, and which right is immediately lost on the possession being parted with ... ... ... In the contract of pledge, the pawnor invests the pawnee with much more than the mere right of possession. He invests his with a right to deal with the thing pledged as his own, if the debt be not paid and the thing redeemed at the appointed time."" In Osborne Rolfe J went on to find in that case that the contract was one of pledge ""the two essential elements being the possession by the defendant and the right to sell"". 
         
         
        I am satisfied that the documentation relied upon by (sic) evidence was created and worded with the express intent to circumvent the Pawnbrokers Act and the reality of the transactions reflects that the goods were in fact pawned or pledged. They satisfy the actual tests of (1) transfer of possession, (2) the right to redeem by tendering the appropriate sum and (3) the right of sale in the pledgee of default. I am therefore satisfied that the provisions of the Pawnbrokers Act apply and it follows that I find the offence proved. 
        
       
       
      DECISION OF PRIMARY JUDGE 
      
    20 The appeal to the primary judge was brought on one ground: 
     
      
       
        
        The learned Magistrate erred in law in finding the transactions relied upon by the prosecution to establish that the appellant was carrying on the business of a pawn broker were pawns or pledges. 
        
       
      
    21 The primary judge considered the question whether, because the transactions were mortgages, they were not pledges. He concluded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        37 The question in the present case, however, is not whether these transactions were mortgages. Plainly, they were. The question is whether they were pawnbroking transactions. It does not seem to me that there is any legal reason why they cannot have been both. If, notwithstanding the transfer of title (as occurred), the transactions had all of the features of a pawnbroking transaction as understood by the law, including the transfer of possession as security for the loan, it seems to me that the transactions must be held to have been pawnbroking transactions. No case was cited to the contrary of that approach and I have discovered none.  
         
         
        38 There is a legislative context. It would be extraordinary if the legislature had intended that a transaction having all of the features of a pawnbroking transaction would not be covered by the legislation if the transaction contained the additional element that title in the goods passed to the lender. That would mean that ordinary pawnbroking transactions could be removed from the purview of the Act at the stroke of the pen, which cannot have been intended. 
         
         
        39 The only contentious element in the present case is whether possession passed to the appellant, in the subject instances, as security for the repayment of the respective loans. 
         
         
        40 The learned magistrate was bound to find that it did. The following subsidiary findings were mandated on the evidence: the borrowers were not asked if they wished to retain the goods; they did not request that the appellants store them; with the exception of Mr Farrell, they simply handed over the goods at the time of the respective transactions and the goods were then put away by the appellant's employee. The only rational reason for such a transfer of possession was as security for the respective loans. On those subsidiary findings, it was inescapable that the transactions, with the exception of the Farrell transaction, involved the lending of money on the security of pawned goods. 
         
         
        41 A competing thesis was that advanced by Mr White. His explanation for the transfer of possession necessarily involved that, in each of the hundreds of transactions recorded in Exhibit 5, the borrowers had gone through the mental process of deciding to leave the goods with the appellant in order to avoid being in breach of the term requiring them to keep the goods insured, rather than retain possession themselves. The thesis was implausible and was inconsistent with the evidence of the borrowers who gave evidence and whose statements were tendered. 
         
         
        42 The standard formula that the goods were stored by the appellant at the borrower's request was a sham. It did not record the true situation. That the same formula was used in Mr Farrell's transaction, in particular, shows that the formula was utilised automatically and without regard to the reality of the situation. 
         
         
        43 Whether the court below was bound to make the relevant findings is a question of law. Whether the goods the subject of the transactions were pawned goods within the meaning of the act is a question of law: Hope v The Council of the City of Bathurst (1980) 144 CLR 1. 
         
         
        44 For the reasons I have given, the learned magistrate was bound to find that the offence charged was made out. The appeal should accordingly be dismissed. 
        
       
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    22 The applicant seeks leave to appeal on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned Magistrate erred in law in finding the transactions relied upon by the prosecution to establish that the appellant was carrying on the business of a pawn broker were pawns or pledges. 
         
        2. The learned Magistrate erred in fact in finding the transactions relied upon by the prosecution to establish that the appellant was carrying on the business of a pawn broker were pawns or pledges. 
         
        3. There has been a miscarriage of justice in that the verdict of the Court was against the weight of the evidence and/or unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
         
        4. The fine imposed by the learned Magistrate is manifestly excessive. 
         
        5. The costs order made by the learned Magistrate is manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    23 Mr. Aitken for the applicant, submitted that, because the primary judge found there was a chattel mortgage in each relevant transaction, there could not have been in each transaction a pledge or pawn: a pledge or pawn is a bailment, where the only security is possession of the goods. 
     
      
    24 Mr. Aitken referred to Ex Parte Official Receiver. In Re Morritt (1886) 18 QBD 222, per Cotton LJ at 232, where the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        In order to solve the question which I am now considering, it is necessary to consider the exact rights of sale which a mortgagee of personal chattels possesses. A pledge of personal chattels as a rule is and must be accompanied by delivery of possession. It is out of the possession given him under the contract that the pledgee's rights spring. A contract of pledge carries with it the implication that the security may be made available to satisfy the obligation, and enables the pledgee in possession (though he has not the general property in the thing pledged, but a special property only) to sell on default in payment and after notice to the pledgor, although the pledgor may redeem at any moment up to sale. A mortgage of personal chattels involves in its essence, not the delivery of possession, but a conveyance of title as 
          
        a security for the debt. A mortgage of personal chattels may, however, be accompanied with a transfer of possession; and mortgages of personal chattels in cases where possession is retained by the mortgagor may, and commonly do, provide that on default the mortgagee may take that possession which is until default withheld from him. There is very little, if any, authority on the point. But I am of opinion that a mortgagee of personal chattels which are in his possession is not in a worse position than a pledgee, and that, where there is no express power of sale given  
        by  
        the mortgage, he has, after default in payment, and after he has given the mortgagor a reasonable time to pay the money due, a power to sell and give a good title to the purchaser, though, of course, the mortgagor has, at any time before sale, a right on payment of the money due, including expenses, to prevent the sale and redeem the chattels.  
        
       
      
    25 He referred to Halsbury’s, Laws of England, 4th Ed., Vol.32, par.[312], where the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        312. Mortgage distinguished from pledge or pawn. A pledge is a species of bailment whereby chattels are deposited by way of security with the pledgee, its key characteristic being the actual or constructive delivery of immediate possession of the chattels in exchange for the loan but without transfer of ownership. The pledgor's right to possession is deferred to the repayment of the debt; however, he retains the right to deal with the goods as title-holder subject to the pledge. It is said that the pledgor retains a general property in the goods, while the pledgee takes a special property, but this terminology has been criticised. The pledgee does not acquire title to the goods, but has the power to to (sic) sell the goods in default of payment at the stipulated time, if any, or at a reasonable time after demand and non-payment where no time for payment is agreed upon. 
         
         
        A mortgage of chattels, on the other hand, is an assignment of a legal or equitable interest. It does not depend on the delivery of possession to the mortgagee. 
        
       
      
    26 He referred to In Re Cosslett (Contractors) Ltd. [1998] Ch 495, per Millett LJ at 508, where the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        There are only four kinds of consensual security known to English law: (i) pledge; (ii) contractual lien; (iii) equitable charge and (iv) mortgage. A pledge and a contractual lien both depend on the delivery of possession to the creditor. The difference between them is that in the case of a pledge the owner delivers possession to the creditor as security, whereas in the case of a lien the creditor retains possession of goods previously delivered to him for some other purpose. Neither a mortgage nor a charge depends on the delivery of possession. The difference between them is that a mortgage involves a transfer of legal or equitable ownership to the creditor, whereas an equitable charge does not. 
        
       
      
    27 He also referred to Ex Parte Hubbard. In Re Hardwick (1886) 17 QBD 690 at 698.  
     
      
    28 He submitted that this result could be avoided only if it were shown that the agreements were shams. Except possibly in relation to one transaction, there was no finding by the Magistrate that the agreements were shams, and the primary judge did not hold that the agreements were shams. The fact that they may have been designed to avoid a statute by means of artifice does not mean that they are shams: Paintin & Nottingham Limited v. Miller Gale & Winter [1971] NZLR 164 at 175; Dalco v. FCT (1988) 82 ALR 669 at 670-71.  
     
      
    29 Mr. Greenaway for the opponent submitted that the transactions had all the elements of pawns or pledges, and the circumstance that they may also have been mortgages did not exclude their character as pledges or pawns. Furthermore, he submitted, they were in fact sham transactions. 
     
      
       
      DECISION 
      
    30 I accept Mr. Aitken’s submission that, considered as complete transactions, the subject transactions were not found to be shams. I accept that the circumstance that they were designed to avoid the relevant statutory provision is not a basis for finding the transactions to be shams: Esanda Limited v. Burgess [1984] 2 NSWLR 128. I accept that, in proceedings between the applicant and each customer, a tender of the signed document would establish the terms of the agreement between them, subject to the limited exceptions to the parole evidence rule.  
     
      
    31 However, it is also clear that, apart from the transaction involving Mr. Farrell, the goods were left with the applicant. Furthermore, in all cases, including Farrell, the signed document noted the location of the goods as “in storage at the mortgagor’s request”.  
     
      
    32 The fact of the applicant’s retention of the goods, together with this note, shows that an arrangement was made which was contrary to the requirement of cl.5.2 of the document that the mortgagor keep the property in the mortgagor’s possession. If the applicant had claimed that a mortgagor was in breach of cl.5.2, the answer to that claim was in the document itself, namely the acknowledgement that the goods were in the applicant’s possession at the request of the mortgagor. Furthermore, if the mortgagor had required the applicant as mortgagee to return the property to the mortgagor’s possession, without paying the loan back, it would have been open to the mortgagee to rely on the “request” referred to in the document; and it would have been possible for the mortgagee to claim that it would not have entered into such a transaction unless the “request” had been made and the goods handed over, and thereby to resist their return. I do not need to find that such resistance would have been legally justified: it is highly unlikely that there would be court proceedings over these items of small value. I am suggesting however that the document does not negative the reality that the applicant was relying on possession as security. 
     
      
    33 The primary judge went so far as to find that the formula that the goods were stored by the applicant at the borrower’s request was a sham; and the same must also apply to the terms relating to possession, maintenance, access and insurance. In my opinion, that finding was justified.  
     
      
    34 In these circumstances, in my opinion the transactions (apart from that of Farrell) had all the elements of pledge or pawn transactions. The mode of entering into the transactions was typical of that of a pawnbroker’s business, and the transactions had the essential elements of the passing of possession, substantial reliance on possession as security (rather than entitlement to take possession), and the ability to sell on default. In my opinion, the mere circumstance that the applicant had a document which gave it rights as a mortgagee is not sufficient to prevent these transactions being fairly described as pledges or pawns.  
     
      
    35 I do not think this view is inconsistent with the authorities cited by Mr. Aitken, referred to above, nor with what was said in Hubbard. At p.698 of that case, Bowen LJ said this: 
     
      
       
        
        There are two well-known and entirely distinct kinds of transaction. There is a mortgage of chattels, when there is no delivery of the chattels to the mortgagee, but the general property in them passes to him by the mortgage deed. There is another entirely distinct transaction, which was known to the Romans, and has been long familiar to English law, the transaction of pawn or pledge, where there must be a delivery of the goods pledged to the pledgee, but only a special property in them passes to him, in order that they may be dealt with by him, if necessary, to enforce his rights - the general property in the goods remaining in the pledgor. 
        
       
      
    36 It is to be noted that Bowen LJ spoke of a mortgage of chattels as being where there was no delivery of the chattels; and of pawn or pledge as being where there must be a delivery of the goods. I do not think it is inconsistent with this to say that, if one has delivery of possession and reliance on possession by the lender, the fact that the lender also obtains a passing of title as mortgagee will not necessarily prevent the transaction from being a pawn or pledge.  
     
      
    37 There is another approach that can be taken also. The statute refers to “the business of lending money on the security of pawned goods”. Where the applicant carried on business in the fashion of a pawnbroker, receiving possession of goods in circumstances where the intention of both parties was plainly that possession be retained until the loan was repaid and that the applicant could sell in the event of default, the goods in question are fairly described as “pawned goods” even if, on a technical legal analysis, they were subject to a mortgage contract and the transactions were not pledges or pawns strictly so called. If I were wrong to say that the transactions were pledges or pawns strictly so called, I would have accepted that alternative argument. 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
      
    38 The appeal against sentence and costs was not supported by submissions, and had no substance. 
     
      
    39 This matter has raised a question not directly the subject of authority, and I think it appropriate that leave to appeal be granted. In my opinion, the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal granted, and order that a Notice of Appeal be filed within 14 days. 
       
      2. Appeal dismissed. 
       
      3. Appellant to pay respondent’s costs of the application and the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 26 February 2002 David Leonard Collisson (the appellant) was found guilty by a jury of the murder of Shahab Kargarian on 8 October 2000 at Greenwich in the State of New South Wales. On 26 March 2002 the appellant was sentenced by Whealy J to imprisonment for 24 years to commence on 8 October 2000 and to expire on 7 October 2024 with a non-parole period of 18 years to expire on 7 October 2018.  
     
      
    2 The appellant appeals to this Court only against his conviction. Five grounds of appeal were originally advanced when the Notice of Appeal was filed on 26 March 2002. The appeal was later refined to three grounds and, ultimately, to one, namely, that the trial judge was in error when he failed to grant an application by the Crown in which the appellant joined that a Mr Simon Bradley be examined on the voir dire with the intention that he give evidence in the trial. At the hearing before us this ground was further refined in accordance with the appellant’s oral submissions to which I refer below. 
     
      
    3 The Crown case was that at or around 12.45 am on 8 October 2000 the deceased and his girlfriend, Shabnam Faiz, parked at Greenwich Peninsula to watch the city lights. They were standing in front of the deceased’s Toyota and eating when a man demanding the deceased’s wallet accosted them. Another, shorter, man was present but not in the immediate area. The deceased said he did not have a wallet at which point the taller of the two men shot him twice and then both men absconded. The police responded quickly and shut down Greenwich Point. At 2.45 am the appellant and a Simon Bradley (Bradley) were found by police in a reserve not far from the crime scene. Later that morning various items were found linking the appellant to the shooting including a sports bag which the appellant and, later, the other man, had been seen carrying which contained the weapon which, so the evidence established, was used in the shooting.  
     
      
    4 Ms Faiz gave evidence to the effect that, after about 10-20 minutes when she and the deceased were standing near their car, eating and watching the city lights, she saw two men approaching diagonally from her left hand side. Whilst the taller man came over to the couple and demanded that the deceased give him his wallet, the shorter of the two men retreated to the other side of the road. After the shooting other witnesses observed the two men running off.  
     
      
    5 The critical issue in the case was the question of identity. After the Crown had opened to the jury counsel for the appellant also opened in which he confirmed that the pivotal issue in the case was one of identification. The evidence proposed to be called by the Crown was that the shooter was the taller of the two men who was the appellant, the shorter man being Bradley. There was no issue but that the appellant was taller than Bradley.  
     
      
    6 At the conclusion of his short opening to the jury, counsel for the appellant said this:’ 
     
      
       
        
        “You’ll hear evidence, as the Crown indicated, not just regarding Mr Collisson the accused, but also Mr Bradley. You’ll hear evidence about that and my friend has already told you about one piece of evidence already. That is, that gunshot residue which is a maybe for Mr Collisson but a positive for Mr Bradley. Bear that in mind as you listen to all the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    7 It was a reasonable inference from this statement of counsel for the appellant that the latter’s defence was that it was not he who was the shooter but Bradley. This became more apparent as the trial proceeded. 
     
      
    8 Representatives of both the Crown and the appellant had attempted to interview Bradley without success. The police had interviewed him but he had refused to make a statement, as was his right. By the time of the trial Bradley, who with the appellant was arrested in October 2000, had been charged with the commission of a criminal offence, namely, the offence of concealing a serious crime which carried, as a possible consequence, a term of imprisonment if he was convicted. He had pleaded not guilty to that charge and, at the time of the trial of the appellant, no date for hearing of that charge had been set.  
     
      
    9 It would appear that from the commencement of the trial the Crown had indicated to counsel for the appellant and the latter had agreed that Bradley would at some point of time during the Crown case be called as a witness in what is referred to as a Basha inquiry. The intention was that Bradley would be called to give evidence on the voir dire in the absence of the jury in order to enable the parties to ascertain the evidence that he was able to give. This was necessary as Bradley had refused to make a statement and to be interviewed by either representatives of the Crown or the appellant with the consequence that neither party was aware of the evidence that might be elicited from him. In particular, no one knew as to whether such evidence, if and when given, would favour the Crown or the appellant. 
     
      
    10 It would also seem that Bradley was at all material times represented by counsel who advised the legal representatives of both the Crown and the appellant that her client, if called, would refuse to answer any questions on the ground that such evidence may tend to prove that he had committed an offence against or arising under an Australian law. On 18 February 2002, being the eleventh day of the trial, the Crown Prosecutor informed his Honour that it was proposed to call Bradley in the absence of the jury; that it was anticipated that when asked to give particular evidence he would refuse to give that evidence on the ground referred to and that the Crown and the appellant would apply to his Honour pursuant to s 128(5) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) (the Act) to exercise his discretion under that provision to require Bradley to give the evidence sought upon the basis that the witness would be given a certificate under s 128(6) in respect of that evidence. The consequence of such a certificate would be that Bradley’s evidence could not be used against him in an Australian court: see s 128(7). At the time it was foreshadowed by counsel for Bradley that such a course would be opposed upon the basis that it would not be in the interests of justice to require Bradley to give such evidence given that there were outstanding charges against him which had not been finally resolved.  
     
      
    11 Bradley was then called and sworn and the following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “Crown Prosecutor: Q. Would you state your full name please? 
         
        A. Simon Mark Bradley 
         
        Q. Mr Bradley, are you able to tell the Court if you were on 8 October in the year 2000 shortly after 9.30 pm present on the Rooty Hill Railway Station along with Mr Collisson? 
         
        A. Possibly, I couldn’t tell you if it was that time. 
         
        Q. Do you have a recollection of being in the presence of Mr Collisson on that evening? 
         
        FRANCIS: At this stage the witness is seeking to take the objection.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour then informed Bradley of the effect of s 128 and, in particular, s 128(5). The following further exchange then took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Are you wishing to object to the particular question that has been asked, Mr Bradley, or not? 
         
        WITNESS: Yeah. 
         
        HIS HONOUR: Is that on the basis that you say the evidence may tend to prove that you have committed an offence under Australian law? 
         
        WITNESS: Not only that, It may or may not incriminate me with or without the certificate. 
         
        HIS HONOUR: Miss Francis, do you wish to put a submission to me about this matter? 
         
        FRANCIS: The objection is taken in accordance with s 128(1) of the Evidence Act.” 
        
       
      
    13 The issue which was then debated between the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the appellant on the one hand and counsel for Bradley on the other was whether the Court could be satisfied, within the meaning of s 128(5)(c) of the Act, that the interests of justice required Bradley to give the evidence sought. At the end of the argument his Honour delivered judgment in which he concluded that he should not make an order under s 128(5). He identified the critical issue as being whether he was satisfied that the interests of justice required that Bradley give the evidence sought. Having noted that the subject provision did not compel the making of an order thereunder and that the making of an order requiring a person facing unresolved charges to give evidence would result in a situation where incriminating evidence must be provided, his Honour determined that Bradley should not be required to give the evidence in question.  
     
      
    14 His Honour’s reasons for refusing the order were set out in the following paragraphs of his judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “13. First, it is well-established that the evidence of an accomplice is “inherently suspect”. 
        
       
       
        
        14. Secondly, this is even more so where the accomplice, although charged, has not finally been dealt with. 
        
       
       
        
        15. In  
        R v Booth 
         (1982) NSWLR 847 at 850, Street CJ said that is well-recognised in practice that accomplices should normally be finally dealt with before being called to give evidence in support of the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          It will rarely arise 
          ”, his Honour said, “ 
          in practice that an accomplice who has not been finally dealt with, or who perhaps may not have received a pardon or otherwise has had his position finalised will be called to give evidence. 
          ” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        16. In the same case, Lee J, at page 851, said this: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “ 
          In this State, the practice is, when the Crown intends to call an accomplice, for the Judge to sentence the accomplice if he is charged and to do that before he is called and I would say that that practice is one which should be followed in all cases, unless there are the most cogent reasons for not so doing. 
          ” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        17. These principles are not directly applicable in the present case since it cannot be said the evidence of Mr Bradley is to be called in support of the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        18. Nevertheless, the reasons underlying this practice, including notions related to the instability and the unreliability of such evidence, especially in the context of the present trial, are compelling considerations for not making an order under sub-s 5. This is precisely because the Crown has no idea what the witness will say, nor, as I have been told, does the accused. For example, in purely hypothetical terms, the witness might volunteer that he saw the accused shoot the deceased: such a statement might be virtually worthless since he is an accomplice awaiting trial. On the other hand, he might suggest that neither he nor the accused were, at the relevant time, anywhere near the crime scene. In theory, he might say he was the shooter and the accused was entirely innocent: or he might say he has no recollection whatsoever of the events of the evening. Again for varying reasons these statements, were they to be made, would be virtually worthless.  
        
       
       
        
        19. Fourthly, there is the broader consideration of the position of the witness himself. As I have said, he is implicated and charged in relation to the very criminal act with which the accused is charged. It would only be, in my view, in the most compelling of circumstances that the should be required prior to the resolution of the charge against him to give evidence of his involvement, if any, in that act, notwithstanding the apparent protection afforded by the certificate.” 
        
       
      
    15 Having referred to the desire of the Crown to avoid a Jones v Dunkel direction if it did not call Bradley as well as its desire to dispel any suggestion that it had acted in any way improperly by not calling a witness who could give evidence about a relevant matter at the trial, his Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “20. ….it is my assumption that the accused wishes to cross-examine his companion on the night to bolster his own position, perhaps at the expense of Mr Bradley. If I am wrong in this assumption, it is at least true to say that the elements of the defence approach to date have been designed to target Mr Bradley as the shooter…” 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour concluded his reasons in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “22. It seems clear to me that where neither party has any idea what evidence will be given by a potential witness such as Mr Bradley, and the witness refuses to give information in an interview, it is quite inappropriate to speculate whether he should be called by either party in criminal proceedings. In the absence of his evidence, the jury would be directed not to speculate about his evidence and to decide the issues on the evidence before them ( 
        Newland 
         at p 462). It is equally unclear whether Mr Bradley would give any useful or reliable evidence. I do not disagree that a Basha type preliminary inquiry may be held in an appropriate case to determine what it is that a witness might say, and to allow the defence to test his evidence; But if that can only occur by calling in aid sub-s 5 of s 128, especially in circumstances where the witness is charged and implicated in the principal crime, then I consider that it is positively not in the interests of justice that he or she be required to give potentially incriminating evidence. Mr Bradley’s position regarding the serious charge against him remains completely unresolved at this time. 
        
       
       
        
        23. This conclusion is re-enforced by the fact that whatever he might say would be inherently unreliable and inherently suspect. What would be the true value of such evidence? Whatever be his evidence, it would require the jury to be warned in that regard in accordance with the provisions of s 165 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . For all those reasons, I have come to the conclusion that I should not make an order under sub-s 5 of s 128.” 
        
       
      
    17 On the day following his Honour’s refusal to exercise his power under s 128(5) of the Act, counsel for the appellant applied for the discharge of the jury and the ordering of a new trial to be held after all charges against Bradley had been finalised so that at least the major reason for it not being in the interests of justice that Bradley be required to give evidence would have disappeared. It was submitted that this course was necessary to ensure that the appellant received a fair trial. 
     
      
    18 In the course of his judgment refusing this application his Honour distinguished the facts in Booth to which he had referred in his judgment the previous day and, in the course of so doing, repeated his finding that there was no basis for supposing that were Bradley called in the Crown case his evidence would be reliable and that, as an accomplice in circumstances where there was no suggestion that he would give evidence in support of the Crown case, there was every reason to believe that his evidence would in fact be unreliable. His Honour considered that that likelihood would be increased by the fact that the charge against Bradley had not been finalised.  
     
      
    19 Counsel for the appellant made two submissions to his Honour which, he contended, arose as a consequence of his decision the day before not to require Bradley to give evidence and which would result, if the matter continued, in the appellant not receiving a fair trial. The first was that there was an obligation on the Crown to ensure that Bradley’s charge was brought to finality before the appellant’s trial, an obligation that it had not fulfilled. The second was that it would be difficult for the appellant to call Bradley in his own case without placing the witness in a position where he may not wish to give evidence. As his Honour noted, this argument presupposed that the Crown had reason to believe that Bradley had the capacity and the ability to give evidence in support of the Crown’s case.  
     
      
    20 His Honour then considered these two submissions. Having rejected the first, he noted with respect to the second that he had no reason to suppose that Bradley’s evidence would be any more reliable were he to be called for the defence than if he was called by the Crown. He observed that counsel for the appellant had had a recent conference with Bradley although he had not been made aware of the witnesses’ attitude to the giving of evidence for the defence. He therefore considered that there was no reason why he could not be called in the appellant’s case. His Honour ultimately determined that he was not satisfied that there was any danger of the appellant not receiving a fair trial in light of the ruling he had made the previous day and that he did not consider that the appellant’s position would be prejudiced because the hearing of the charges against Bradley had not been concluded. He accordingly declined in his discretion to abort the trial. 
     
      
    21 I have already referred to the opening to the jury of counsel for the appellant and to the implicit suggestion that it was Bradley who was the shooter and not the appellant. The subsequent conduct of the case by counsel for the appellant apparently caused his Honour, in his judgment on 18 February 2002, to observe that it was: 
     
      
       
        
        “…at least true to say that elements of the defence approach to date have been designed to target Mr Bradley as the shooter.” 
        
       
      
    22 Nevertheless, immediately following his Honour’s refusal of the adjournment application and before any further evidence was called, counsel for the appellant indicated to his Honour that: 
     
      
       
        
        “We (the defence) wanted to call him (Bradley) and we intend at some stage to call him.” 
        
       
      
    23 On 20 February 2002 counsel for the appellant, immediately after the close of the Crown case, again advised his Honour that, after calling a fingerprint expert, he “would seek to call Mr Bradley”. However, he closed the defence case without doing so.  
     
      
    24 Having not called Bradley for whatever reason, it is unsurprising that in his closing address to the jury counsel for the appellant advanced the argument that there was a real possibility that Bradley was the shooter and that possibility was certainly sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the appellant. As his Honour observed to the jury in his summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “He (counsel for the appellant) put it plainly enough to you that it is quite possible that Mr Bradley was the shooter, not the accused.” 
        
       
      
    25 The thrust of the appellant’s argument before this Court was that his Honour’s discretion to require Bradley to give evidence pursuant to s 128(5) of the Act miscarried when his Honour, in his consideration of whether he was satisfied that the interests of justice required the witness to give the evidence, gave as one of his reasons for not being so satisfied that it was “well-established that the evidence of an accomplice is ‘inherently suspect’.” It is pertinent to record that it was not suggested that his Honour’s second stated reason, namely, that it would not be in the interests of justice that Bradley be required to give potentially incriminating evidence where there was a serious charge against him which remained unresolved, disclosed error.  
     
      
    26 Accordingly, the appellant’s argument was, as I understood it, confined to the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) His Honour was in error in applying the well-established statement of principle that the evidence of an accomplice was “ 
      inherently suspect 
      ” to the particular circumstances of Bradley in this case;  
       
       
      (b) if that were so, then that erroneous basis for his Honour not being satisfied that the interests of justice required Bradley to give evidence should be excised from his Honour’s reasoning; 
       
       
      (c) accordingly, the only valid reason given by his Honour for not being satisfied that the interests of justice required Bradley to give the evidence was his second reason, namely, that he should not be required to give potentially incriminating evidence when he was subject to a serious charge arising out of the same events which remained unresolved; 
       
       
      (d) although that reason was a valid and justifiable reason for his Honour not to be satisfied that it was in the interests of justice that Bradley be required to give evidence, it followed that he should have aborted the trial to enable the charge or charges against Bradley to be finalised when a new trial of the appellant could be had at which Bradley could be required to give the evidence which he had so far refused to give but in circumstances where the charges against him having been finalised, his Honour could be satisfied that the interests of justice required Bradley to give that evidence. 
       
      
    27 I should observe that counsel for the appellant properly accepted that if his challenge to the first reason advanced by his Honour in support of his lack of satisfaction that it was in the interests of justice that Bradley be required to give evidence failed, then it would follow that his Honour’s decision to refuse to exercise his power pursuant to s 128(5) of the Act to require Bradley to give evidence was error free and, further, that in those circumstances there could be no proper challenge to the exercise of his Honour’s discretion the following day to refuse the appellant’s adjournment application. 
     
      
    28 Accordingly, the outcome of this appeal centres on whether his Honour was entitled, when determining that he was not satisfied that the interests of justice required Bradley to give the evidence, to apply to Bradley the well-established principle of the common law that the evidence of an accomplice was “inherently suspect”. In this respect, the nub of the appellant’s argument was that his Honour had erred in finding that Bradley was an unreliable witness simply because he fell within the class or category of witnesses referred to in s 165(1)(d) of the Act whose evidence “may be unreliable”. It was submitted that his Honour could not opine that the evidence of Bradley would in fact be unreliable without first ascertaining the nature of the evidence that he was prepared to give. It was contended that it was necessary to ascertain and then assess that evidence before his Honour could determine that it would be so unreliable that, in the interests of justice, Bradley should not be required to repeat that evidence, one assumes, before the jury.  
     
      
    29 In my opinion, the appellant’s submission should be rejected. It is, of course, essentially circular. It makes no sense to suggest, as does the submission, that although it would be in the interests of justice to require Bradley to give incriminating evidence in the absence of the jury notwithstanding that the charges against him have not been finalised, it would (or, at least, may) not be in the interests of justice to then require him to give the same evidence in the presence of the jury.  
     
      
    30 As I have observed, it was not contested that his Honour was correct in stating the “well-established principle” that the evidence of an accomplice is “inherently suspect”. Equally, it was not contested that Bradley was a witness who fell within the class or category of witnesses referred to in s 165(1)(d) of the Act whose evidence may be unreliable and in respect of which a warning to the jury, if requested, may be necessary pursuant to s 165(2). Accordingly, I do not understand why his Honour was not entitled to describe any evidence that Bradley might relevantly give as inherently unreliable. It seems to me that it was not necessary for his Honour to know the exact details of the evidence which Bradley would give before he could come to that conclusion.  
     
      
    31 In [18] of his judgment of 18 February 2002 his Honour postulated three hypothetical examples of the type of evidence which Bradley might give. As he then concluded, all three theoretical statements, were they to be made, would be virtually worthless. If his evidence favoured the Crown case and implicated the appellant (the first example), then there could be no doubt that counsel for the appellant would have requested his Honour to warn the jury that that evidence may be unreliable in terms of s 165(2)(a) of the Act. On the other hand, counsel for the appellant conceded that it would be unlikely in the extreme that Bradley would have given evidence that he, and not the appellant, was the shooter (the second example).  
     
      
    32 In fact, it was the third theoretical example postulated by his Honour in the passage referred to that the appellant relied upon before this Court, namely, that Bradley might give evidence that neither he nor the accused were, at the relevant time, anywhere near the crime scene. It was suggested that if such evidence was given the nature of the defence may have been different. Needless to say such a suggestion is highly speculative especially as from the very outset of the trial the appellant’s case was that Bradley rather than he, was the shooter.  
     
      
    33 In any event, in the light of the other independent and objective evidence that had been given, one would not need to be too prescient to conclude that any such evidence would simply have been unbelievable and, therefore, disbelieved. In these circumstances, I can see no error in his Honour’s first reason as to why he could not be satisfied that the interests of justice required Bradley to give evidence, namely, that that evidence would be unreliable. 
     
      
    34 That really disposes of the appeal. However, even if that first reason had not been a proper basis for his Honour’s lack of satisfaction that the interests of justice required Bradley to give evidence, nonetheless I do not consider that his Honour’s discretion to refuse an adjournment miscarried even if one assumes that his sole or primary reason for not being so satisfied was that to require Bradley to give evidence before charges against him were disposed of would subject him to unacceptable prejudice. In my opinion, his Honour’s exercise of discretion to refuse an adjournment could only have miscarried if he was or ought to have been satisfied that, if the trial was adjourned to enable the charges against Bradley to be resolved, the appellant would have been better off than would have been the case had the trial proceeded. 
     
      
    35 In my opinion, it is just not possible to be satisfied that the appellant would have been better off had his trial been adjourned. No one knew what evidence Bradley would give. Given the nature of the then known charge against him, it would be unlikely, even if the proceedings involving that charge were resolved, that Bradley would then have given evidence to exculpate the appellant by admitting that he was the shooter. Again, the only evidence that counsel for the appellant could suggest might place the appellant in a more advantageous position if the trial was adjourned was that Bradley might give evidence that neither he nor the appellant were, at the relevant time, anywhere near the crime scene. However, as I have already observed, not only is this entirely speculative but also entirely unbelievable.  
     
      
    36 Absent any acceptable basis upon which it could properly be suggested that the appellant would have been better off had he had the benefit of Bradley’s evidence, it is clear that his Honour’s discretion to refuse an adjournment did not miscarry. Further, even if that direction had miscarried, in my opinion no substantial miscarriage of justice has, in the circumstances, actually occurred in the required sense that the appellant has not lost “a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted”.  
     
      
    37 For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.

    3 I would not myself assert a concluded view that the first opponent had no relevant duty of care. I would express the basic reason why the claimant is not entitled to succeed as follows. In the circumstances referred to by Tobias JA, it was not unreasonable for either opponent to leave the footpath in a state falling short of that to be expected of a normal paved footpath. In this situation, in order to show that the claimant was caused to fall by a hazard which should have been attended to by one or both opponents, there was required at least a more accurate identification of what this hazard was, how big it was, and where it was. Otherwise, it could not be found either that one or both opponents were or should have been aware of the risk it constituted, or that reasonable care would have required that they deal with that risk. 
     
      
    4 This is not intended as any criticism of the claimant or her solicitors. It is understandable that no close inspection was made at the time, and the Council’s work obliterated the scene of the accident shortly afterwards. But the Court can only act on the evidence presented to it, and that evidence was insufficient to identify a hazard that called for attention in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    5 TOBIAS JA: On 6 January 2000 the claimant, a woman of 63 years of age and who resided at 34 Ludgate Street, Roselands, fell and was injured when traversing the footpath in front of the adjoining property, 32 Ludgate Street, which was owned by the first opponent. The footpath was part of the road reserve under the control of the second opponent. 
     
      
    6 The claimant sued the opponents alleging breach of their duty of care towards her by reason of their respective failure to take adequate precautions to ensure the safety of persons using the footpath. The proceedings were heard by his Honour Judge Williams of the District Court who, on 10 May 2002, found in favour of the opponents upon the basis that, although each owed the claimant a duty of care, there had been no breach of that duty. He accordingly entered judgment for the opponents with costs. It is against that decision that the claimant now seeks leave to appeal to this Court. That application and the appeal were heard concurrently. 
     
      
    7 It was common ground that the footpath in front of 32 Ludgate Street was, at the material time, in a state of disrepair being rough and uneven. It had been in this condition since 1998. At least part of the footpath had been damaged and broken up as a consequence of building work carried out, with the second opponents consent, on the first opponent’s adjoining property. The direct source of that damage was found by the primary judge to be due to trucks and bobcats entering and leaving that property and trucks delivering bricks to the site. 
     
      
    8 In or about September 1998 the second opponent began upgrading the existing bitumen footpath in Ludgate Street. This upgrading was from a bitumen to a concrete footpath and had, by the end of 1998, been completed in front of 30 and 34 Ludgate Street. However, the new footpath was not extended across the front of 32 Ludgate Street, an officer of the second opponent having informed the husband of the first opponent on or about 7 September 1998 that this work would not be carried out until the building work upon the first opponent’s property had been completed. No doubt, this was in order to avoid damage to any new footpath it being conceded by the claimant that it was reasonable for the second opponent to defer the new work for the reason given. 
     
      
    9 In late 1998, after the second opponent had carried out the new footpath work on either side of 32 Ludgate Street, the husband of the first opponent placed two tonnes of road base over the existing footpath in front of her property in order to bring it up reasonably level with the new footpath which had been constructed on either side. By December 1999 the building work upon the first opponent’s property was complete and, on 22 December 1999, the first opponent paid to the second opponent the sum of money required by it as the cost of rectification and restoration of the footpath in front of 32 Ludgate Street. Shortly thereafter the second opponent commenced the new footpath work but at the time of the claimant’s accident it had not been completed. According to an endorsement on a letter from the second opponent to the husband of the first opponent dated 17 December 1999, that work was completed by approximately 13 January, some seven days after the accident.  
     
      
    10 The claimant’s evidence accepted by the primary judge was that she was fully aware that the footpath in front of 32 Ludgate Street was in a state of disrepair in that it was rough and uneven. She herself had traversed the broken footpath probably at least twice a week over the period that the building work was being carried out on the adjoining property. She gave evidence that on numerous occasions she avoided the footpath when there were no cars parked at the kerb by walking on the adjoining roadway because she was aware that the footpath was very rough, uneven and damaged in places.  
     
      
    11 However, on the occasion of her accident there were cars parked along the kerb as a consequence whereof the claimant decided to walk on the footpath itself. It was daylight, the weather was fine, she wore sensible shoes and she was aware of the necessity to be very careful when walking on the footpath due to its condition. When questioned as to the nature of the surface in front of her, she replied that it “wasn’t even, it wasn’t level”. 
     
      
    12 After she had covered approximately 2-3 metres of the footpath in front of 32 Ludgate Street the claimant stepped on a patch of grass, expecting it to be flat, but underneath was a raised, hard object. She stepped on the edge of this object which caused her to lose her balance and start to fall. She managed to stop herself falling to the ground by hanging on to the mesh fencing that ran along of the front of the first opponent’s property and as a result, twisted her knee causing extensive damage thereto.  
     
      
    13 The primary judge found that the claimant was unable to say exactly what caused her to fall whether it was a stone, a piece of brick, a rock or a piece of concrete or even a piece of the old uneven footpath. She did not look to see what had caused her to fall as the area was she said, overgrown by grass. There was, according to the primary judge, no evidence as to the size of the object in question or whether it was loose on the surface or buried in some way.  
     
      
    14 Two photographs tendered in evidence (Exhibit A) and taken by an employee of the second opponent between 14 and 17 December 1999 (some three weeks before the accident) indicated that, at the point where the claimant maintained she fell and which she had marked on one of the photographs, there was no grass but, rather, a bare patch of ground. However, the claimant maintained, and the primary judge accepted, that she might have been mistaken as to the exact location of the accident as so marked as she was adamant that where she fell there was grass. In simple terms, the claimant maintained that she stepped onto a patch of grass but was unable to see what lay beneath it as a consequence whereof she unwittingly stepped on the edge of a raised object and lost her balance.  
     
      
    15 The primary judge also found that each of the opponents owed the claimant a duty of care. In respect of the first opponent he held that that duty arose as a consequence of the damage caused to the footpath by the first opponent’s building work and, with respect to the second opponent, in permitting that damage to remain, there having been created a situation of some danger that would not normally have been the case on a public thoroughfare. His Honour found that the first opponent’s duty was firstly, to minimise that damage and, secondly, to ensure within reason that the damage was unlikely to cause harm to a pedestrian. He was less specific with respect to the duty of care found to be owed by the second opponent.  
     
      
    16 However, the primary judge found that none of the particulars of negligence or, more accurately, breach of duty were made out against either opponent. He found that the area within which the claimant fell was a reasonably level, but rough, patch of pavement that seemed to have loose material and grass distributed over it in different areas. In light of the evidence he was unable to find that the damage which had been caused to the footpath by the building work conducted on behalf of the first opponent upon her property extended to that part of the footpath where the claimant said she fell. He said that the photographs (Exhibit A) were not of such a quality that he could reliably determine the state of the footpath close to the claimant’s premises (that is, I assume, in the area two to three metres along the footpath from where it commenced at the common boundary between 32 and 34 Ludgate Street) and that no evidence had been given with respect to that area in particular except to the effect that the footpath was much the same all over. 
     
      
    17 The primary judge also found that there was no evidence that in the two years prior to the accident and during the course of the building work upon 32 Ludgate Street, anyone else had experienced any problem in the area including the claimant who had used the footpath regularly. The roughness of the surface was obvious and well known to the claimant. He found that building sites such as that with which the first opponent was associated were a regular occurrence in suburban and metropolitan areas and that the footpaths outside such sites have to be regularly negotiated by pedestrians. 
     
      
    18 Having referred to the decision of the High Court in Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council (2001) 206 CLR 512 and citing from [6], [153], [249] and [356] thereof and after referring to what is known as the Shirt calculus (Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48), the primary judge summarised his findings in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Here there was a hard irregularity under some grass, it not being known how long the grass was. What that hard irregularity was is unknown. Indeed there is no evidence to link what it was to either defendant. It could have been something discarded by a complete stranger, we just do not know…… No one has been criticised for allowing the grass to grow and as to how much of it would have grown between the date the photographs were taken and 6 January, I am not prepared to speculate on. No one suggests that the defendants should have remade the path in some fashion each day.” 
        
       
      
    19 So far as the second opponent was concerned the primary judge, after referring to the fact that it was reasonably probable that the second opponent commenced work on the rectification of the footpath shortly after 22 December 1999, said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Their failure, that is the council’s failure, if it indeed is a failure to complete the work before the plaintiff’s fall is hardly a negligent act contributing to the fall because the footpath situation had been its known state for a very long time.” 
        
       
      
    20 The primary judge concluded that he would not categorise the pathway as unsafe. Certainly it was rough and uneven and could possibly be an occasion of harm but neither of those factors of themselves bespoke either negligence or breach of a relevant duty of care. Accordingly, he held that the claimant had failed to establish a breach of any duty of care on the part of either opponent. 
     
      
    21 It is clear that the primary judge properly directed himself as to the relevant legal principles as articulated in the then recent decision of the High Court in Ghantous. That decision has been followed and applied in this Court on numerous occasions. Those decisions establish that a pedestrian has no expectation that the surface of a footpath will be smooth and lack imperfections or defects. This is so because pedestrians are in a position of advantage as they can protect themselves from uneven surfaces of footpaths by keeping a proper lookout for the purpose of taking care for their own safety. This is particularly the case where the hazard is one which is obvious.  
     
      
    22 In the present case, the footpath, to the knowledge of the claimant, was in an obvious state of disrepair and, therefore, constituted a hazard of which she was well aware. As a consequence, when she was able to do so, she had avoided the footpath by walking on the adjoining road. However, it was submitted by the claimant that irrespective of whether she stepped on a rock, a piece of concrete a brick or some other object, that which caused the claimant to lose her balance was concealed from her view by grass which had grown within the footpath area.  
     
      
    23 In my view the fact that part of the footpath surface may have been covered by grass should, if anything, have alerted the claimant that the grass covered area was to be avoided as it was more likely than not that the surface underlying the grass was rough and uneven (consistent with the footpath generally) and, therefore, a hazard. This is not a matter relevant only to contributory negligence as the care which pedestrians must themselves take also enters into the definition of the duty of care: Burwood Council v Byrnes (2002) NSWCA 343 at [33] per Handley JA (with whom Beazley and Hodgson JJA agreed) 
     
      
    24 It was submitted by the claimant that the first opponent’s duty of care arose on three bases. The first was that it was a condition of the Road Opening Permit which the first opponent obtained from the second opponent on 17 September 1997 that the permittee would be responsible for the protection of the public from risks which may be caused by the opening of the road carriageway or nature strip. The second was that, having placed road base upon the footpath at the end of 1998 the first opponent had a duty to ensure that it had been laid in a manner which did not cause danger including a duty to ensure that grass did not grow over the road base in a manner that concealed dangers lurking beneath. The third was to the effect that the first opponent also had a duty to ensure that no debris from the building work being conducted on her property was permitted to remain on the footpath concealed from view by the growth of grass over it. In each case it was contended that the duty referred to was breached by the failure of the first opponent (and, for that matter, the second opponent) to remove the grass by physically pulling it out or poisoning it so as to reveal the underlying uneven surface. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion, none of the bases advanced to found a duty of care on the part of the first opponent have substance. The first is misconceived given that the state of the footpath was not brought about as a consequence of any opening of any part of the road reserve including the footpath. As to the second, there was no suggestion either in the particulars of negligence or in the evidence that the first opponent’s husband had laid the road base other than in an appropriate manner. To suggest that, having laid the road base, the first opponent had a duty to ensure that no part of the footpath became overgrown with grass is, with respect, fanciful. The first opponent was not the occupier of the footpath and had no control over it. There was nothing to suggest that any conduct of hers was the cause of the growth of the grass of which complaint was made.  
     
      
    26 As to the third basis, there was no evidence that the object upon which the claimant stepped and which caused her to lose her balance was debris from the first opponent’s building work. Nor in my opinion, could it be inferred that it was. In this regard, the evidence did not identify with any precision where and how the accident occurred to enable the primary judge to determine what, if anything, could have been done to avoid it. His Honour expressed misgivings with respect to the imprecision of the evidence on these important issues and, in my opinion, he was clearly justified in so doing. In a case such as the present, in order to assert a duty of care to avoid the risk of injury that she sustained, the claimant was required to establish with a degree of precision not only the location but also the manner and cause of her fall. That precision was conspicuously absent in the present case.  
     
      
    27 Furthermore, I am not satisfied that it was properly put before the primary judge that the nature and extent of the duty of care upon the first opponent and, for that matter, the second opponent, was one which required her (or it) to remove the grass by poisoning or otherwise so as to reveal the underlying uneven surface. Such a case was not particularised and there is nothing in the evidence which suggests that such a case was being advanced. I see no reason to depart from the primary judge’s specific finding that  
     
      
       
        
        “No one has been criticised for allowing the grass to grow” 
        
       
      
    28 For the foregoing reasons, therefore, I am of the opinion that the primary judge was correct in finding that there had been no breach of any duty on the part of the first opponent. Furthermore, in my opinion there was no relevant duty of care imposed on the first opponent and the primary judge should not have found that there was.  
     
      
    29 The claimant submitted with respect to the second opponent that it controlled the footpath and had been aware of its unsafe condition since September 1998 when it was so informed by the first opponent’s husband. It was therefore submitted that it had a duty to inspect the footpath from time to time and to take steps to minimise any danger to pedestrians revealed by such inspections. Had such an inspection taken place the first opponent would have discovered, so it was contended, that grass had grown to such an extent that it had concealed the underlying uneven surface thus obliging it to take steps to remove that grass and expose what was otherwise concealed.  
     
      
    30 Employees of the second opponent inspected the footpath at the time that the photographs (Exhibit A) were taken between 14 and 17 December 1999. That inspection revealed the state of the footpath as depicted in the photographs. The inspection took place for the purpose of determining the extent of the work required to restore the footpath. That work commenced a short time after 22 December 1999 and was completed within a few weeks of commencement.  
     
      
    31 It was not suggested that the second opponent was dilatory in its commencement and completion of the restoration of the footpath subsequent to the inspection in mid-December. Nor was it suggested by the claimant that the second opponent was negligent in the carrying out of that inspection. Furthermore, as the second opponent submitted, the mere fact that there was some object rendering the footpath uneven beneath the grass was not a sound basis upon which to found liability against it. In the circumstances, particularly where the claimant had acknowledged her awareness of the rough and uneven nature of the footpath, she could not reasonably have had an expectation that there was no roughness or unevenness within the alignment of the footpath beneath the grass which she observed and upon which she stepped. To that extent, the defective nature of the surface of the footpath continued, to the claimant’s knowledge, to constitute a hazard which she could and should have avoided had she taken care for her own safety by looking where she was going and avoiding an area where she could not be confident that the surface was safe to walk on. 
     
      
    32 Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the primary judge was correct in finding that there had been no breach of any duty of care on the part of the second opponent. However, as with the first opponent, I am also of the opinion that, in the circumstances, the second opponent did not owe the claimant a relevant duty of care in the first place. 
     
      
    33 For the foregoing reasons, I am therefore of the opinion that the primary judge was clearly correct in entering judgment in favour of the opponents. There being no matter of principle involved, in my opinion leave to appeal should be refused. I would accordingly propose that the summons for leave be dismissed with costs.

     R v Pauline Dorothy WEIR 
     
     
      
     
    The applicant pleaded guilty to four charges of fraudulent misrepresentation, one of using a false instrument and one of passing a valueless cheque. The total effective sentence handed down was one of seven years with a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
    On appeal, it was submitted that there had been an error in the trial Judge’s assessment of the net loss to the victims such that the amount lost was just over $823,000 rather than over $1,000,000. It was also submitted that the trial Judge had neglected to address the possibility that one of the victims, who had a caveat over the applicant’s home, might upon the sale of the home recover some of the money he had lost. 
     
      
    HELD (Per Sheller JA; James and O’Keefe JJ agreeing): 
     
      
       
      1. The Court must form a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed before exercising its power to quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution thereof:  
      R v Simpson 
       (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 applied. 
       
       
      2. If the amount of the loss was overstated, the error did not result in any miscarriage of the sentencing discretion. On any view the loss to the applicant’s victims was substantial and that conclusion is not undermined by the asserted error, even if it was an error. 
       
       
      3. If the applicant wished to rely upon some possible further repayment to one of the victims, this should have been placed in proper and exact terms before the sentencing Judge, which it was not:

     R v Pauline Dorothy WEIR 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: The applicant, Pauline Dorothy Weir, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to six charges: four of fraudulent misrepresentation (s178A of the Crimes Act 1900 (the Act)), charges 1, 2, 3 and 5 in the charge sheets attached to the certificate of committal; one of using a false instrument (s300 of the Act), charge 4 of the attached charges; and one of passing a valueless cheque (s178B of the Act), charge 6 of the attached charges. The applicant was committed for sentence to the District Court where she adhered to her pleas of guilty. On 6 September 2002 she was sentenced by his Honour Judge Dodd on the first charge (taking into account matters on a Form 1) to imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of two years to date from 6 September 2002, on the fourth charge (taking into account matters on a Form 1) to imprisonment for five years with a non-parole period of two years to date from 6 September 2004, a sentence cumulative upon the sentence imposed on the first charge, on charges 2, 3 and 5 to a fixed sentence of two years from 6 September 2002 and on charge 6 to a fixed term of nine months to date from 6 September 2002. The total effective sentence was one of seven years with a non-parole period of four years dating from the date of sentence. 
     
      
    2 Section 178A of the Act provides, so far as presently material: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever having collected or received any money or valuable security upon terms requiring him or her to deliver or account for or pay to any person the whole or any part of: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) such money or valuable security or the proceeds thereof, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) any balance of such money, valuable security or proceeds thereof after any authorised deductions or payments have been made thereout, 
        
       
       
        
        fraudulently misappropriates to his or her own use or the use of any other person, or fraudulently omits to account for or pay the whole or any part of such money, valuable security, or proceeds, or the whole or any part of such balance in violation of the terms on which he or she collected or received such money or valuable security, shall be liable to imprisonment for seven years.” 
        
       
      
    3 Section 178B provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever obtains any chattel, money or valuable security by passing any cheque which is not paid on presentation shall, unless he or she proves: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that he or she had reasonable grounds for believing that that cheque would be paid in full on presentation, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that he or she had no intent to defraud, 
        
       
       
        
        be liable to imprisonment for one year, notwithstanding that there may have been some funds to the credit of the account on which the cheque was drawn at the time it was passed.” 
        
       
      
    4 Section 300 of the Act, so far as presently material, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or she, or another person, will use it to induce another person: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to accept the instrument as genuine, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to that other person’s, or to another person’s, prejudice, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          is liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person who uses an instrument which is, and which the person knows to be, false, with the intention of inducing another person: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to accept the instrument as genuine, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to that other person’s, or to another person’s, prejudice, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 Relevantly, s299 of the Act defines ”instrument” to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) any document, whether of a formal or informal character, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a card by means by which property or credit can be obtained, or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) a disc, tape, sound track or other device on or in which information is recorded or stored by mechanical, electronic or other means.” 
        
       
      
    6 The first fraudulent misappropriation charged occurred between 27 May 1999 and 5 July 1999. The victim was Paul Brandling. The amount fraudulently misappropriated was $242,682.31. The Form 1 offences to be taken into account occurred on 18 May 1998, 1 October 1998 and between 31 May 1999 and 5 September 1999. In each case Mr Brandling was the victim. The amount of the fraudulent misappropriation in the first was $100,000, in the second $35,000, and in the third $45,000.  
     
      
    7 The second fraudulent misappropriation charged occurred between 15 May 2000 and 12 June 2000. The amount involved was $25,000 and the victim Melissa Jane Gillies. The fraudulent misappropriation, the subject of the third charge, occurred between 19 April 2001 and 15 June 2001. The amount involved was $50,035 and the victim Ken Goff.  
     
      
    8 The fourth charge was that the applicant between 1 March 2001 and 20 March 2001 used a Westpac Banking Corporation application for irrevocable documentary credit for $495,000, which the applicant knew to be false, with the intention of inducing another person to accept the instrument as genuine and because of that acceptance to act to that other person’s prejudice. In sentencing on that charge the Judge took into account twenty-seven offences on a Form 1, fifteen of fraudulent misappropriation, four of passing a valueless cheque, five of making a false instrument and three of using a false instrument. The amounts fraudulently misappropriated under the fifteen charges of fraudulent misappropriation taken into account exceeded $500,000.  
     
      
    9 The twenty-seven offences occurred between 16 June 2000 and 27 November 2001. The victims were Ms Gillies six times, Christopher Stevens once, Kenneth Brittliff fourteen times and Bunty Carolyn Avieson six times. The fifth charge for fraudulent misappropriation occurred between 5 May 2001 and 10 July 2001. The sum involved was $50,000 and the victim Kenneth Brittliff. Kenneth Brittliff was also the victim of the sixth charge, passing a valueless cheque in the sum of $82,764 which occurred between 19 March 2001 and 12 July 2001. The total of the sums involved in the offences charged and offences taken into account exceeded $1,000,000. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    10 The sentencing Judge set out the terms of the six charges and the three offences on the Form 1 taken into account in respect of the first charge. Of these he said that Mr Brandling had received nothing in return for the amounts misappropriated. He then summarised the twenty-seven offences listed on the other Form 1 schedule and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The matters of fraudulent misappropriation under s178A of the Crimes Act carry a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. The offences of make and of use a false instrument under s300 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         each carry maximum penalties of 10 years imprisonment and the offences of pass valueless cheque under s178B of the  
        Crimes Act  
        each carry maximum penalties of one year’s imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    11 Dealing with the first charge the sentencing Judge said that from 1990 the applicant or her partner prepared Mr Brandling’s wife’s tax returns. Mr Brandling met the applicant in 1995. From 1995 the applicant prepared his tax returns. Mr Brandling received the sum of approximately $500,000 from a transaction in 1997. After discussion with the applicant about the appropriate details to be disclosed in the tax return in respect of that transaction the return was prepared on the basis that an amount of $242,682.31 was due to the Commissioner of Taxation. The applicant advised Mr Brandling to borrow the full amount, which he, by a loan from the St George Bank, did using his house as security. Mr Brandling agreed to the applicant’s suggestion that she invest it on his behalf before payment to the Tax Office on the due date. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You drafted a loan agreement for an amount of $243,000. You suggested that a prepaid interest component be added to the loan, taking the amount due back to him as $259,000. Part of the agreement was for a caveat in [Mr Brandling’s] favour over [the applicant’s] property at 42 Garden Street, Eastlakes. The document offered the interest rate of 13.8 per cent per annum.  
        
       
       
        
        Mr Brandling’s understanding was the money would be placed on the short-term money market. In short, [the applicant] misappropriated the money and did not pay either Mr Brandling or the Australian Taxation Office the amount of Mr Brandling’s tax bill.” 
        
       
       
      The sentencing Judge added: 
       
       
        
        “That is a much shortened version of what actually occurred, because from the time the money was given to you, to the time that Mr Brandling eventually found out that he was not to ever see it again, there were many discussions between you and Mr Brandling and many attempts by him to obtain satisfaction and the return of his money. He was put off by you on a number of occasions until eventually Mr Brandling paid the outstanding bill owing to the Australian Taxation Office after borrowing further money.” 
        
       
      
    12 So far as charges 2, 3 and 5 were concerned, the sentencing Judge said that the applicant represented to the victims on various occasions that she was able to avail them of investment opportunities, whereby they would obtain high rates of return on short-term investments which did not exist. Nevertheless the applicant was able to persuade them to hand over to her large sums of money. None of them ever saw those amounts of money or the interest return on them again. The event of the fourth charge was that persons involved handed over to the applicant large sums of money on multiple occasions.  
     
      
    13 Judge Dodd said that in summary Mr Brandling had lost an amount of approximately $402,000. The other three persons whom the applicant defrauded lost a total amount of approximately $623,000. About $700,000 of this went into the Star City Casino’s coffers. The applicant sent an amount of approximately $500,000 to Nigeria to be invested in some widely advertised scheme or scam to which several people had fallen prey. According to the sentencing Judge the amounts defrauded from the victims came to a total of just over $1,000,000. The balance of the $1.2 million from the two amounts referred to came from borrowings made by the applicant against the security of her own house and the security of her brother’s house to an amount of approximately $120,000. That amount had not been repaid and in the result the applicant’s brother had had to sell the house. So far as the applicant’s gambling and so-called Nigerian investment were concerned, the return to her had been nothing. 
     
      
    14 The applicant was born on 16 September 1943. She had three previous convictions for fraud matters, the first at Castlereagh Street Local Court on 26 July 1989 on a charge of obtaining money by deception when she was placed on a good behaviour bond for two years, the second on 27 November 1988 at the Downing Centre Local Court when she was convicted on two counts of obtaining money by deception, for the first of which she was ordered to perform community service of one hundred hours and for the second community service of two hundred hours cumulative upon the first. In both those matters she gave evidence that she had obtained the money to support a gambling habit. 
     
      
    15 At the time of the commission of some of the offences, and particularly the offences involving Mr Brandling, she was subject to the community service orders, which the sentencing Judge noted was an aggravating feature. She had also been charged in respect of some of the Brandling offences, itself an aggravating feature. The sentencing Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “These are very serious offences. They involve breach of trust with persons who gave you their money for investment purposes and whose trust you had obtained by acting as an accountant. In effect, these people were clients who trusted you. The sheer amount of money involved overall indicates the scale of the offences and their seriousness. The crimes were committed in a pattern of consistent behaviour over a long period of time, you fully knowing what you were doing. 
        
       
       
        
        The courts have repeatedly said, including the Court of Criminal Appeal, that in such cases whether a gambling addiction is part of the cause or not, there is a need for sentences to reflect both specific and general deterrence.” 
        
       
      
    16 Judge Dodd referred to a pre-sentence report from Anna Robilliard, a psychologist, and a number of testimonials including one from the applicant’s sister, Susan Donovan, and one from her daughter, Janine Gale. Two of the applicant’s daughters had been in court throughout the sentencing exercise. The applicant gave evidence. His Honour said that it was clear that she had had a gambling problem or addiction for a long period of time and that the crimes were committed to satisfy that gambling addiction.  
     
      
    17 Her attempts to invest in the Nigerian scheme were apparently designed to recoup her losses. It was a desperate scheme, which she acknowledged any intelligent person, such as herself, should have realised. The sentencing Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It also seems to me that anyone who chooses to gamble at an institution such as the Star City Casino over any consistent period of time, and who has any intelligence, would also know that the odds are deliberately stacked against the gambler and in favour of the house. Indeed it is explicitly part of the business plan of such casinos. Nevertheless you continued to gamble at the Star City Casino.” 
        
       
      
    18 His Honour acknowledged that to an extent her gambling had been encouraged by the staff of the Star City Casino. 
     
      
    19 As a result of what she had done, the applicant had no assets and no money. She had gained absolutely nothing from what she did in monetary terms. She had lost her own house, which was in her name and which had been sold. She had split up with her husband. Her brother’s house had been sold and she had caused a lot of grief, not only for the victims of her crime and herself, but also for family members. She was aware of all this. 
     
      
    20 She said that, since a newspaper article had been published bringing home to her the exact nature of the crime she had committed, her attitude had changed. She wished she could take back what she had done but, realising she could not, she was ready to accept her punishment. She indicated in evidence that she was very, very sorry and never intended to do what she did. His Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “In one sense that cannot be true. Obviously you did intend to take the money, use it unlawfully and deprive your clients of it. I do accept, however, that in the nature of a gambling addiction you continued to hope, even expect, that you would be able to recoup your money and repay it to your victims despite your intelligence indicating to the contrary.” 
        
       
      
    21 The applicant had support from her family, in particular her daughters. The Judge accepted that she was genuinely remorseful in respect of her crimes. Her future employment prospects were bleak. It was unlikely on her release from prison that anyone would be eager to employ her in a position of trust.  
     
      
    22 The applicant had told Anna Robilliard that she was enjoying a sense of relief and liberation at being charged because she had been able to terminate the well-established pattern of addictive gambling that governed her for over twenty years. The applicant said that she now liked being open about what she was and what she was doing rather than having to construct excuses. She saw the charges as being an opportunity to face up to what she had done and to get on with her life. She remained optimistic, energetic and positive. Judge Dodd added that the applicant did appear to be prepared to face her punishment acknowledging that she would spend time in prison. She was adamant that she would never consider borrowing money again to gamble and was indeed perhaps a little over-confident about that, indicating to Anna Robilliard that she doubted that she would need any intensive rehabilitation programme for her gambling addiction. The sentencing Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, in order to maximise your prospects of rehabilitation, a longer than normal period of supervision will be necessary so that your behaviour can be monitored by the officers of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service and to ensure that for a reasonable period after release from prison you are able to avail yourself of their assistance and guidance and to remain subject to their directions including any directions to attend gambling rehabilitation programmes. On that account I find special circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        I also find special circumstances by virtue of your age and by reason of your likely inability, upon release, to obtain ready employment in your specialist field of accountancy.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour gave the applicant the full discount of 25 per cent for her plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Taking into account all of those matters, and indicating that I have taken into account whether or not I have specifically referred to them, all the matters specified under s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and in particular taking into account the principle of totality, I have come to the conclusion that the appropriate penalty overall is one where the total head sentence is seven years imprisonment with a four year non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    24 In the result, the applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 5 September 2006. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    25 Judge Dodd said that Mr Brandling had lost $402,000 and three other persons a total of $603,000. In the applicant’s written submissions, the net loss to all six victims was said to be just over $823,000, which had not been recovered. This was particularised in a table which was part of the submissions. The first ground of appeal was that the sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the net loss to the victims.  
     
      
    26 Ground 2 was that the sentencing Judge failed to take into account the prospect of some repayment to Mr Brandling.  
     
      
    27 It was said that Mr Brandling had a caveat over the applicant’s home in which there was an equity of some $360,000. The applicant’s husband, from whom she has separated, also has an interest in the home. At the time of sentence it was unclear how the proceeds of the sale of the house would be divided. There was no suggestion that the applicant would not be entitled to a share which would mean there would be at least some repayment to Mr Brandling. Despite this, the sentencing Judge made no reference to the prospect of Mr Brandling recovering some of his money. 
     
      
    28 In Phelan (1993) 66 A Crim R 446 Hunt CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In many of these cases, some emphasis has been placed upon the fact that the amount involved has voluntarily been repaid, but in my view it would be wrong to interpret those cases as supporting any proposition that an offender is able to purchase mitigation. Where there has been a substantial degree of sacrifice involved in the repayment, that is a matter which may properly be taken into account by way of mitigation. Otherwise, in my view, it is more a matter of aggravation where there has been a loss which is effectively irretrievable than a matter of mitigation when the loss has simply been made good.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Burke 
       [2002] NSWCCA 353. 
       
      
    29 It was submitted that there was evidence that there would be some, albeit unquantified, repayment to Mr Brandling. This was said to involve a very considerable sacrifice by the applicant. She would lose her home and faced the prospect of ultimate release from gaol as a woman in her sixties with no home, money, or other assets and limited prospects in the workplace. In the circumstances, the likely repayment of some money was relevant in reducing an aggravating feature and as a mitigating feature. The failure of the sentencing Judge to refer to it would lead the Court to draw the inference that it was not taken into account.  
     
      
    30 It was submitted that if specific error was established the Court would intervene. In AB v The Queen (1999) 198 CLR 111 Hayne J at 160 said by reference to the well known passage in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 that if there is specific error in the sentencing process which the appellate court identifies,  
     
      
       
        
        “the sentence imposed below must be set aside and the appellate court is then required to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. The offender must be re-sentenced unless, of course, in the separate and independent exercise of its discretion the appellate court concludes that no different sentence should be passed.” 
        
       
      
    31 The applicant submitted that in the exercise of this discretion the Court should impose a lesser sentence. It was conceded that there were some serious aggravating features in the applicant’s case. The crimes were serious both in number and magnitude. They involved the ongoing deception of persons with whom a relationship of trust had been built. Some of the offences were committed whilst on bail in relation to the Brandling matter. Some were committed while subject to a community service order in relation to prior offences of dishonesty. The applicant was not assisted by her prior record.  
     
      
    32 On the other hand, as against this, the fact of imprisonment itself was likely to bear heavily on the applicant. She faced the prospect of ultimate release from gaol as a woman in her sixties with no home, money or other assets and limited prospects in the workplace. In R v McDonald (1994) 71 A Crim R 370 at 379 it was observed that a first incarceration may have a very salutary effect and the prospect that it may do so should not be left out of account when its length is fixed. To some extent, though not in mitigation, the applicant’s gambling addiction explained her offending. Ultimately she obtained no benefit from her crimes, which resulted both in personal loss and loss to her brother.  
     
      
    33 Reference was made to R v Power [2002] NSWCCA 244, where an effective sentence of eight years with a non-parole period of five years was imposed in relation to a fraud on the applicant’s employer of over $5 million. This Court reduced the non-parole period to four years. It was conceded that Power had more favourable subjective circumstances but the scale of the fraud was in an altogether different category. 
     
      
    34 In R v Cappadona (2001) 122 A Crim R 52 a husband and wife were convicted of fraud on the Taxation Office involving a loss of about $3.5 million. The offences involved a systematic fraud over a period of five years. At first instance the husband received a sentence of twelve months imprisonment and the wife a twelve months suspended sentence. On a Crown appeal the husband’s sentence was increased to a fixed term of eighteen months. The Crown’s appeal against the wife’s sentence was dismissed.  
     
      
    35 In R v Egerton NSWCCA, 8 August 1997, a fraud in excess of $3 million was committed. The accused pleaded not guilty and after trial was sentenced to two years with a minimum term of eighteen months. Although Smart J said the Judge had imposed “the most lenient sentence which the circumstances allowed”, there was no suggestion it was inadequate.  
     
      
    36 It was submitted that these cases supported the proposition that a lesser sentence could properly be passed in the present matter. Taking into account all the matters referred to above and in particular the personal circumstances of the applicant and the fact that it was her first sentence of imprisonment, it was submitted the Court would intervene. 
     
      
    37 In its submissions the Crown pointed out that each of the offences the applicant committed were committed by her as the tax agent of the victims. The amount involved was said to be not less than $820,000. The offences were committed by the applicant in breach of the trust reposed in her by reason of her professional relationship with her clients to whom she gave investment advice. Reference was made to R v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328 at 330. In that case the applicant sought leave to appeal. The effective sentence for nine counts of larceny as a servant was twelve years penal servitude with a non-parole period of four and a half years. The offences involved a total of $417,628. The majority of the Court dismissed an application for leave to appeal against sentence. Wood CJ at CL, with whom Carruthers J agreed, said at 330: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the sentences and non-parole period were well within a proper exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. While the applicant’s infatuation with his former girlfriend provided an explanation, at least in part, for what he did, it constitutes no justification, and it is not a circumstance attracting leniency. The simple fact remains that the offences involved very large sums of money, spanned an extended period, and involved separate and gross breaches of trust. 
        
       
       
        
        As was observed in  
        McKechnie 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 1 October 1987), those involved in serious white collar crime must expect condign sentences. The commercial world expects executives and employees in positions of trust, no matter how young they may be, to conform to exacting standards of honesty. It is impossible to be unmindful of the difficulty of detecting sophisticated crime of the kind here involved, or of the possibility for substantial loss by the public.  
        
       
       
        
        …  
        
       
       
        
        The magnitude of the offences required a substantial head sentence. Against that head sentence a non-parole period slightly in excess of one third was light, and was clearly selected by his Honour to take into account all of the favourable subjective circumstances, including the applicant’s age and the fact that he was, for the first time, facing a prison sentence.” 
        
       
      
    38 In R v Falzon (unreported) CCA 20 February 1992, a Crown appeal, Loveday J, with whom Carruthers J agreed, said that he accepted there was a wide-ranging scale in relation to white collar crime and that breaches of trust by professional people are at or near the top of that scale. The Crown appeal was upheld and an aggregate sentence of five years imposed, in one case with a minimum term of two and a half years and in the other a minimum term of three years. 
     
      
    39 The Crown emphasised the factors of aggravation, the applicant’s criminal record, which consisted of convictions for dishonesty, the fact that at the time of the commission of the offences for which she was sentenced she was on conditional liberty under a community service order imposed for offences of dishonesty and at the time of the commission of some of them was on conditional liberty on bail after having been charged with others of them: see Readman  (1990) 47 A Crim R 181.  
     
      
    40 The applicant had asked that the offences referred to in the Forms 1 be taken into account under the provisions of s33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In Attorney-General’s Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518 the Chief Justice said (para 42): 
     
      
       
        
        “The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused is engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences … for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.” 
        
       
      
    41 The Crown submitted that the amount set forth in the table in the applicant’s submissions represented the net losses suffered rather than the amounts the subject of the offences. Judge Dodd said that the amount of the loss to the victims he mentioned was over $1,000,000. If the amount of the loss was overstated the error did not result in any miscarriage of the sentencing discretion. On any view the loss to the applicant’s victims was substantial and that conclusion is not undermined by the asserted error, even if it was an error. 
     
      
    42 Further, so far as the prospects of any repayment to Mr Brandling were concerned the evidence was that the applicant’s home had been sold by the mortgagee under its power of sale and that, quite apart from the applicant and Mr Brandling, the applicant’s husband and a Mr Knudd had some interest in the proceeds of sale. There was evidence that a balance was held by a solicitor but no evidence as to who the solicitor was or how much or on what terms. There was no evidence as to what interest in the proceeds was protected by the caveat. If the applicant wished to rely upon some possible further repayment to Mr Brandling this should have been placed in proper and exact terms before the sentencing Judge, which it was not.  
     
      
    43 Before this Court the applicant relied upon the affidavit of her husband, Mervyn Patrick Weir, of 9 July 2003, to be taken into account if the Court were to re-sentence the applicant. From this it emerges that the applicant became bankrupt on 15 March 2000. There is an ongoing dispute as to the division of the surplus proceeds of the sale of the property. Mr Brandling is obviously a creditor of the applicant. There was nothing in the material before the sentencing Judge nor is there anything before us to suggest that the sale of the house was not the inevitable consequence of the applicant’s insolvency and that Mr Brandling stands in no better position than any other of her creditors. The possibility that at some stage Mr Brandling as a creditor may receive some dividend does not reflect in any way adversely upon the sentencing Judge’s course of reasoning. 
     
      
    44 The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge was required to impose a sentence that properly reflected the objective seriousness of the offences, the need for general deterrence and the protection of society. Any lesser sentence would have failed to meet these requirements. 
     
      
    45 As Spigelman CJ observed in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 para 79: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: ‘If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process.’ That is not the statutory formulation. By s6(3) [of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912] this Court must form a positive opinion that ‘some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed’. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to ‘quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore’ is not satisfied. As the judgments in  
        Dinsdale v The Queen  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321 
          
        to which I have referred indicate, the exercise of the power in s6(3) further requires the identification of error in the requisite sense.” 
        
       
      
    46 In the present case, a series of offences were committed over a prolonged period of time in a systematic way by a professional person employed to look after the victims’ financial affairs. The amounts involved were substantial, whether the total of the loss to the victims be something over $800,000 or something over $1 million. The applicant had a criminal record for dishonesty. The offences were committed when the applicant was at conditional liberty under a community service order. Some of the offences were committed when she was at conditional liberty on bail after being charged with other offences. These were aggravating circumstances. It is acknowledged that the proceeds of the crime were wasted by the applicant and that she is left with nothing due in part to an addiction to gambling. She is contrite and this is the first time that she will be serving a gaol sentence. However, I am not persuaded that some other sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed. Nor am I satisfied that such error has been shown as would justify this Court intervening. There is no exact calculation of the losses but they were substantial.  
     
      
    47 I would grant leave but dismiss the appeal.

      1  
      SPIGELMAN CJ: 
       I have read the judgments of both Hulme J and Buddin J in draft. I agree with Buddin J on Ground 2. Otherwise, I agree with Hulme J and with Buddin J’s additional observations on Ground 10. I agree with the orders proposed by Hulme J. 
       
        
       
      2  
      HULME J 
      : On 26 September 2001, after a trial lasting a number of days, the abovenamed Appellants were convicted of being, between about 19 November 1999 and about 23 December 1999, knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of prohibited imports, namely narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of cocaine being not less than the trafficable quantity thereof. 
       
        
       
      3 On 8 February 2002 Judge Hock sentenced each of the Appellants to imprisonment for 12 years including a non-parole period of 8 years.  
       
        
       
      4 Both Appellants have appealed against their conviction and sought leave to appeal against sentence. The grounds of appeal of each are in the same terms and are as follows:- 
       
        
         
          
          1. The jury’s verdict was unreasonable. 
          
         
         
          
          2. Her Honour erred in admitting Exhibit J on the trial being a telephone call between the accused Soukoulis and a person named Alex on 25 November 1999 at 12:16:13 hours. 
          
         
         
          
          3. Her Honour erred in: 
           
           (a) admitting; and 
           
            
            (b) not, when directing the Jury, withdrawing from their consideration 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           evidence of the electronic transfer of Australian $28,885.40 by Eleftheria Pappas in Adelaide to Gigel Bosca in Germany on 16 December 1999. 
          
         
         
          
          3A Her Honour erred in not, when directing the Jury, withdrawing from their consideration, evidence of the electronic transfer of Australian $18,743.00 by Eleftheria Pappas in Adelaide to Toni Raffella Racerullo in Germany on 16 December 1999. 
          
         
         
          
          4. Her Honour erred in directing the jury as to a not guilty verdict. 
          
         
         
          
          5. Her Honour erred in directing the jury as to an element of the charge, namely being knowingly concerned in the importation of prohibited goods. 
          
         
         
          
          6. Her Honour erred in directing the Jury that all of the evidence admitted on trial was available to be used by them against the accused Cerullo and the accused Soukoulis. 
          
         
         
          
          7. Her Honour erred in directing the Jury as a matter of practical reality the verdict in respect of the accused Cerullo would be the same as the verdict in respect of the accused Soukoulis. 
          
         
         
          
          8. Her Honour erred in not fully or adequately putting the defence case to the jury. 
          
         
         
          
          9. The trial miscarried as a result of inadequate Counsel for the Appellant. 
          
         
         
          
          10 The sentence imposed upon the Appellant was manifestly excessive. 
          
         
        
       
      5 In written submissions filed on behalf of the Appellants, ground 1 was abandoned. However, before proceeding to the other grounds it is convenient to provide an outline of the Crown case. On 23 December 1999, a parcel containing cocaine was delivered to one Szelenczy at premises at Rose Bay, Sydney. There was evidence that the Appellants were there at the time although they left within minutes thereafter. Shortly after that, the police raided the premises and found the parcel, still unopened, and a sum of $1,000 on a table in the lounge room. Mr Szelenczy had a further $1,100 in his hand. There was evidence from Detective Critchlow (who was encouraged, without objection, to give a deal of hearsay evidence) that the undercover agent who had delivered the parcel had not seen the money there at the time of delivery but there was no evidence as to the extent of the latter’s opportunity for observation. It seems that the parcel had been posted from Frankfurt, Germany at 8pm (Frankfurt time) on 15 December 1999. The name of the sender on the airways bill for the parcel wasfictitious. 
       
        
       
      6 Mr Szelenczy had only recently returned to Australia from Frankfurt. It was accepted that he had left Frankfurt on 15 December 1999, at 11.55 pm (Frankfurt time) and had himself posted the parcel at about 8 pm (Frankfurt time). 
       
        
       
      7 In circumstances described in more detail below, on 16 December in Adelaide an associate of the Appellants received from Mr Soukoulis’ accountant, a cash cheque in the sum of $22,300. The funds were, in effect, debited against funds of one or both of the Appellants. On the same day in transactions extending over some hours but concluding at about 7 pm, associates of the Appellants sent from Adelaide two amounts of money, one of approximately $19,000 and the other approximately $28,000. The funds were addressed separately to Toni Raffela Racerullo and Gigel Bosca, in Frankfurt.  
       
        
       
      8 Mr Szelenczy’s ticket to Frankfurt, then Budapest, then Frankfurt and then Sydney had been tentatively booked by Ms Cerullo, accompanied by Mr Szelenczy, in Sydney on 19 November 1999 when she also paid a deposit of $100 for it. There was, in addition, evidence that on 23 November 1999 Ms Cerullo made a travel booking for herself and the second Appellant from Melbourne to Frankfurt and return. On 8 December 1999 Mr Soukoulis cancelled his booking for a reason irrelevant to the proceedings. The Flight Schedule envisaged Ms Cerullo arriving in Frankfurt on 8 December and departing from Frankfurt at 7.40 pm on 17 December 1999. The ticket suggests these dates and times were adhered to. Ms Cerullo’s passport shows she left Frankfurt on 17 December. 
       
        
       
      9 Also on 23 November, at about 11 am, Ms Cerullo sent a fax from Melbourne to Mr Soukoulis in Sydney which included the words:- 
       
        
         
          
          “Or: Lets meet at La Meridien Park Hotel centre of town. 10.30 pm 8 Dec. No matter what! 
          
         
         
          
          TICKET: He should pick up then delay it. Then cancel it. 40% loss average.” 
          
         
        
       
      10 The fax also contained a list of hotels in Frankfurt. Le Meridien was one on the list. Later that day, Mr Szelenczy met Mr Soukoulis in Sydney and then left Sydney for Europe between about 3 and 3.30 pm. 
       
        
       
      11 Shortly before the parcel of cocaine was delivered to Mr Szelenczy, he was heard to say to the Appellants, “I’ve received a phone call. The parcel will be 20 minutes”. A few minutes later the three caught a taxi to Mr Szelenczy’s flat. 
       
        
         
        Ground 2 
         
        Her Honour erred in admitting Exhibit J on the trial being a telephone call between the accused Soukoulis and a person named Alex on 25 November 1999 at 12:16:13 hours. 
         
        
       
      12 Alex was not otherwise identified in evidence in the trial. It was he who had called Mr Soukoulis. It is unnecessary to set out the totality of the conversation. A reading of the transcript suggests strongly, if not inevitably, that the participants in it were being very circumspect in what they said. However, the conversation did include the following (M1 is Mr Soukoulis; M2 is Alex):- 
       
        
         
        M1 Ah beautiful ah yeah the stock has it come in (wds) 
         
        M2 No waiting hopefully next week it will be here JIM I’ve fucking been delayed. 
         
        M1 Ah beautiful. 
         
        M2 Because of the fucking earthquake and I’ve got so much stock to come and I’ve got people waiting. 
         
        M1 Yeah yeah. 
         
        M2 Hopefully next week will be here. 
         
        M1 Ah beautiful 
         
        M2 Yeah 
         
        … 
         
        M2  
        You know do you know what I want. 
         
        M1  
        Come one. 
         
        M2  
        I want – pause – you see how our mums prepare that nice meal not the kind that we eat with coffee but that white cappuccino but it must be white. 
         
        M1 Laughs –  
        yes yes. 
         
        M2  
        Do you understand. 
         
        M1  
        Yes I understand. 
         
        M2  
        Does it exist. 
         
        M1 Ah. 
         
        M2  
        Because I’ve got somebody you see when I went to Sydney last week. 
         
        M1 Yes.  
         
        M2 I got fucked around up there they told me  
        it was from the good stuff. 
         
        M1 Yes. 
         
        M2  
        And I turned up there and it was the same coffee. 
         
        … 
         
        M2  
        Because I have somebody that has the (fine stuff/coin) so that he can take all of it and go on a holiday. 
         
        M1  
        Yeah Yeah. 
         
        M2  
        But the colour of it must be nice. 
         
        M1  
        Okay 
         there’s no problems but not now  
        not now. 
         
        M2  
        Not yet hey 
        . 
         
        M1 Nope no. 
         
        M2 Alright  
        if there’s anything telephone me immediately. 
         
        M1 Oh straight away straight away. 
         
        
       
      13 The passages in bold were spoken in Greek. The other passages were spoken in English.  
       
        
       
      14 No evidence was led directed specifically to the meaning of “white cappuccino”. Nor was there any demonstrated link between the subject of the telephone call and the importation the subject of the charge against the Appellants. 
       
        
       
      15 On behalf of the Appellants it was argued that even if the inference was drawn that “white cappuccino” was a reference to cocaine there was nothing to link the subject of the conversation with the importation with which the Appellants were charged and that, at worst, the telephone call indicated simply a propensity on the part of Mr Soukoulis to deal in a prohibited drug of some kind. The Crown, relying on  
      Harriman v R 
       (1989) 167 CLR 590 – see also  
      R v Quach 
       [2002] NSWCCA 519, submitted that the evidence was admissible on the basis that it tended to confirm the involvement of Mr Soukoulis in an illegal enterprise. 
       
        
       
      16 Although I would not embrace the way in which the Crown advanced the matter, the evidence was admissible and the cases to which I have just referred support that conclusion. The link between the conversation and the cocaine the subject of the charge against the Appellants is provided by:- 
       
        
         
          
          (i) the reference “white”, and evidence in the trial that the cocaine found in Mr Szelanczy’s unit was white, 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) the statement that Mr Soukoulis did not have what was being sought “now” and the clear inference that he would have some in the future – a future one might infer was not so distant as to make his possession of what was being discussed of no interest to Alex, and  
          
         
         
          
          (iii) the timing of the conversation relative to other events including the flight bookings on 19 and 23 November, the despatch of the cocaine from Frankfurt on 16 December and its arrival in Sydney on 23 December 1999 
          
         
        
       
      17 Given that the issue was whether the Appellants were involved with the importation of a drug, commonly white, with which they were, very soon after its delivery, in close proximity, the statement by Mr Soukoulis three weeks or so before, clearly susceptible of the interpretation that he expected to, or might, be in possession of a white substance apparently referred to by a pseudonym in the foreseeable future was both relevant and clearly went further than indicating the propensity suggested. To adapt the words of Toohey J in  
      Harriman v R 
       at 609, “it was relevant to the likelihood” that the Appellant’s physical proximity to the cocaine on 23 December was because he was involved in the importation of it rather than, for example, pure chance. 
       
        
       
      18 The question whether the evidence was admissible against Ms Cerullo also, can be left until I direct attention to Grounds 6 and 7. 
       
        
         
        Grounds 3 & 3A 
         
        3. Her Honour erred in: 
         
          
          (a) admitting; and 
           
            
            (b) not, when directing the Jury, withdrawing from their consideration, 
            
           
          evidence of the electronic transfer of Australia $28,885.40 by Eleftheria Pappas in Adelaide to Gigel Bosca in Germany on 16 December 1999. 
          
         
         
         3A Her Honour erred in not, when directing the Jury, withdrawing from their consideration, evidence of the electronic transfer of Australian $18,743.00 by Eleftheria Pappas in Adelaide to Toni Raffella Racerullo in Germany on 16 December 1999. 
         
        
       
      19 A little more detail of these transfers and contemporaneous events is appropriate. There was evidence from a Ms Golding, an agent for Travelex Australia Pty Ltd that on Thursday, 16 December 1999 at about 3pm she was approached by a Mr Pappas who indicated that he wanted to send two sums of money to two persons in Germany. Each sum was contained in a calico bag, in one case consisting of some $19,000 in cash and the other about $30,000 in cash. Ms Golding was not sure of the precise amounts or which of the recipients was to receive which sum. Mr Pappas was unable to provide the identification which Ms Golding required, made a telephone call and some time later a woman who gave her name as Eleftheria Pappas attended, completed the forms which were ultimately used in connection with the transfers. Because of a number of complications to which it is unnecessary to refer further, the transaction was not completed until about 7.10pm Adelaide time. As has been said, the nominated transferees of the funds were described as Toni Raffella Racerullo and Gigel Bosca in Frankfurt, Germany. 
       
        
       
      20 A Mr Caracoussis, an accountant, also gave evidence. He had known Mr Soukoulis all his life and was acting or had acted for both Appellants. He gave evidence that at some stage Ms Cerullo had asked for, and been given, advice as to the method by which funds could be transferred to Germany. Mr Soukoulis was present. Mr Caracoussis also said that on 16 December 1999 between about 3 and 3.30pm he was requested by a Mr Atsikbasis to advance $22,300 and in fact did so by way of a cash cheque. Mr Atsikbasis appeared to be in a hurry and the transaction took some 5 minutes. The funds were provided by Mr Caracoussis himself but in circumstances where he had been authorised to draw on loan funds due within 24 hours over the security of some property owned by Miss Cerullo.  
       
        
       
      21 Mr Caracoussis also gave evidence that he believed Mr Steve Pappas, Mr Atsikbasis and Mr Soukoulis knew one another.  
       
        
       
      22 At 3.27 pm that day Mr Atsikbasis rang Mr Soukoulis and said that he was going to be delayed. Mr Soukoulis agreed to do something for Mr Atsikbasis. At 11.05 pm there was a further call initially between the two but then Mr Atsikbasis put Mr Pappas on the line. Mr Atsikbaisis and Mr Pappas informed Mr Soukoulis that the name of some person, later in the conversation identified as Mr Pappas’ sister, was Eleftheria. Mr Soukoulis also asked whether Mr Pappas’ name had a “Double PAS”. 
       
        
       
      23 At 11.13 pm there was another conversation between Mr Soukoulis and Mr Atsikbasis. Its terms included the following (M1 was Mr Soukoulis and M2, Mr Atsikbasis):- 
       
        
         
          
           
          “M1 Mate you guys are fuckin’ abortions that what youse guys are between both of youse. 
           
          M2 Why 
           
          M1 Your fuckin’ abortions you know what I’ve just realised  
          you put both names together from the one. 
           
          M2 (Wds) no we didn’t. 
           
          M1  
          You fucked up you fucked up. 
           
          M2 (Wds) no we didn’t. 
           
          M1 No wonder no wonder things  
          are fucked up 
           mate you you you guys don’t fuckin think – pause- last minute fuckin’ things. 
           
          M2 (We put ‘em) separate mate. 
           
          M1  
          You are clever who put them mate. 
           
          M2  
          I put them. 
           
          M1  
          One did 
           
          M2  
          Yes 
           
          M1 What does that tell you. 
           
          M2 Yeah  
          alright 
           I understand what your saying.” 
           
          … 
          
         
        
       
      24 As has been said, the evidence showed that Mr Szelenczy posted the parcel of cocaine at about 8 pm and left Frankfurt at 11.55 pm (Frankfurt time) on 15 December 1999. There was uncontradicted evidence that Frankfurt was 10 hours behind the time in Adelaide, making the times of posting and departure 6 and 9.55 am on 16 December, Sydney time.  
       
        
       
      25 At the trial no objection was taken to the admission of the evidence of the transfer addressed to Toni Raffella Racerullo. That is not surprising when regard is had to the similarity in name of that recipient and Miss Cerullo, the fact that Ms Cerullo was in Frankfurt at the time the funds were transferred, and the fact that funds in which Ms Cerullo could fairly be regarded as having an interest were made available in cash at about the time that monies were being presented to Ms Golding for remission to Frankfurt. The evidence of the remission of funds addressed to Toni Racerullo was clearly admissible. And the similarity of circumstances between that transfer and the transfer addressed to Gigel Bosca means that the evidence of that transfer was admissible also, notwithstanding the name of the addressee. The use of pseudonyms or false names is a well known fact of life which the jury was entitled to take into account. 
       
        
       
      26 In reaching these conclusions I do not ignore the evidence that indicated that the money was transferred from Australia after the time at which the cocaine was posted and Mr Szelenczy would seem to have left Frankfurt. It would seem that initially the Crown had suggested that the funds transferred represented the cost of the cocaine to be imported although later the Crown seems to have been content to treat the evidence as merely one of the circumstances the jury were entitled to take into account on the issue of being “knowingly concerned”. A suggestion from counsel to Detective Critchlow that the drugs business was not one in which credit was given was rejected. However the number and similarity in the timing of the events to which I have referred meant that the evidence the subject of this ground was admissible. In a case where the Crown relies on circumstantial evidence, it does not have to provide express proof of a specific link between all pieces of evidence. 
       
        
         
        Ground 4 
         
        Her Honour erred in directing the jury as to a not guilty verdict. 
         
        
       
      27 The error the subject of this ground is highlighted in the following extracts taken from Her Honour’s summing up. 
       
        
         
          
          I refer to your joint decision because under our system of law, your verdict, whether it be guilty or not guilty, must be unanimous. We do not in this State recognise majority verdicts. Just as a verdict of guilty must be unanimous so must a verdict of not guilty. It is not the case that simply because you cannot agree that an accused is guilty that you find him or her not guilty.  
          A finding that an accused is not guilty is just as much a finding that he is guilty 
          , and in either case the verdict must be unanimous before it can be pronounced by you. 
          
         
         
          
          This does not mean that you must all agree on the same reasoning for reaching your verdict. You may individually rely on different parts of the evidence, or place a different emphasis on parts of the evidence. But, whatever path you take to arrive at your decision, that final decision, either guilty or not guilty, must be unanimous before it becomes your verdict. 
          
         
        
       
      28 It was submitted that the passage I have highlighted was both confused and misleading and that they jury may have understood the trial Judge to be saying that whatever way the jury looked at it, the Appellants were guilty. 
       
        
       
      29 Against the totality of the passage I have quoted the proposition has only to be stated to be rejected. Clearly, if Her Honour’s words are accurately recorded the highlighted passage contains error but, against the balance of the passage which I have quoted, the error is so obvious that no jury could have been misled by it. Her Honour had earlier said that:- 
       
        
         
          
          “Except in the areas where there appears to be no real dispute, I will be trying to express no opinion about the facts at all”. 
          
         
        
       
      30 In the light of that statement – borne out by the totality of the summing up - and others in the passage I have quoted it can not possibly have been thought that Her Honour was telling the jury that whatever way they looked at the case, the Appellants were guilty. 
       
        
       
      31 It might be noted also that no objection was taken to this passage in the summing up, a fact which again argues for either it being incorrectly transcribed or, taken in context, not something which seemed significant. 
       
        
         
        Ground 5 
         
        Her Honour erred in directing the jury as to an element of the charge, namely being knowingly concerned in the importation of prohibited goods 
         
        
       
      32 The passages to which exception is taken are highlighted in the following extract from Her Honour’s summing up. 
       
        
         
          
          What does that mean, knowingly concerned - to be knowingly concerned in the importation of the cocaine? To be concerned in an offence means to do something which involves a practical connection with the offence and all that is involved in the offence. Concern means involved or participating in the importation. It does not mean worries about, for example.  
           But, to wait or stand by with knowledge with a view to doing something connected with the importation, would amount to being knowingly concerned in the importation. 
          
         
         
          
          These things must be done before or during the importation. That is, before or during all the things that are involved in the importation. You must be implicated or involved in the importation. You must be implicated or involved in the sense of having something to do with the importation, and the importation, as I indicated, includes all that is incidental or proximate to the act of importation, but it does not include the use, transportation or disposal of the goods after everything proximate and incidental to the importation has been completed. In other words, you might think that after such prohibited goods as cocaine are imported into Australia ultimately the aim is to have them distributed into the community. That is not the process that you are concerned with here. You are concerned with the process of importation which, on the evidence in this case, ceased at the time that package was handed over to Mr Szelenczy at Rose Bay. 
          
         
         
          
          It is not necessary that the accused manifest his concern 
          , that is show by his actions that he is concerned in a physical sense while the importation is actually in progress. It is sufficient if the concern is manifested in the venture which centres around the importation. The venture does not finish the moment the goods are landed or even the moment they are cleared through Customs, but extends to all matters and all events that are related or proximate or incidental to the importation. If he or she is standing by ready and willing to do something connected with the importation process, which means the whole process of making available in Australia goods from overseas, then he or she is concerned in the importation. 
          
         
         
          
          As I said, members of the jury,  
          mere involvement or participation in the importation of narcotic goods is not of itself, sufficient to make out the charge before you 
          . The involvement or participation must occur when the person knew that the goods were to be imported included a quantity of narcotic goods. (sic) 
           
          
         
        
       
      33 This ground is also simply disposed of. There was no error in what Her Honour said. 
       
        
       
      34 The first of the passages highlighted is amply supported by the remarks of the court in  
      R v Kelly 
       (1975) 12 SASR 389 at 400 and it was not necessary for her Honour to limit the waiting or standing to which she referred to temporary inactivity.  
       
        
       
      35 The selectivity involved in the second passage highlighted – picking out the first third of a sentence and ignoring the balance – denies the criticism of the passage of all validity. In fact the whole sentence in substance repeats what was said by this Court in  
      R v Shin Nan Yong  
      (1975) 7 ALR 271 at 275:- 
       
        
         
          
          “It is by no means an essential part of the crime against S233B(1)(d) that the “concern” be made manifest in a physical sense whilst the importation is actually in progress. It is sufficient if the “concern” is manifested in the venture which centres upon the importation”. 
          
         
        
       
      36 Nor do I see any basis for the criticism that the third of the passages highlighted was likely to have confused the jury. Her Honour had in the paragraph containing that passage clearly moved from the topic of “concern” to the topic of knowledge. 
       
        
         
        Grounds 6 and 7 
         
          
          6. Her Honour erred in directing the Jury that all of the evidence admitted on trial was available to be used by them against the accused Cerullo and the accused Soukoulis. 
          
         
         
          
          7. Her Honour erred in directing the Jury as a matter of practical reality the verdict in respect of the accused Cerullo would be the same as the verdict in respect of the accused Soukoulis. 
          
         
        
       
      37 Prior to the Crown opening its case before the jury, there had been debate before Her Honour as to the admissibility of some of the evidence. Before Her Honour ruled on some of this, the transcript records the following:- 
       
        
         
          
          HH: Mr Forrest and Mr Shield, I have worked on the basis in particular that because there is no objection to some of the facts in the majority of the telephone intercept calls, that for the purpose of the legal argument both of you concede that there is reasonable evidence of joint enterprise? 
          
         
         
          
          Forrest:Yes. 
          
         
        
       
      38 At no stage during the course of evidence was it submitted by Counsel for either of the Appellants that some of the evidence was not admissible against one as distinct from the other Appellant. Furthermore, there was no objection taken to those aspects of Her Honour’s summing up as are the subject of these grounds of appeal. Having satisfied myself that there was, in the evidence to which I have referred, reasonable evidence of pre-concert – a question for the trial Judge – see  
      R v Ahern 
       (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 100, I would invoke Rule 4 and not permit the Appellants to rely upon these grounds. 
       
        
         
        Ground 8 
         
          
          Her Honour erred in not fully or adequately putting the defence case to the jury. 
          
         
        
       
      39 The course which Her Honour followed in summarising the respective cases of the Crown and the Accused was, in the case of the Crown case, to give the jury what she described as a non-exhaustive and dot-point list of the evidence on which the Crown relied. A short example of what Her Honour said in this regard was:- 
       
        
         
          
          “The Crown relies on the fact of the importation and the association between these two accused and the man Szelenczy. The Crown relies on the evidence of the money, the $50,000 in cash, which was taken to the Adelaide airport and which was transmitted to Frankfurt, Germany on 16 December 1999. The Crown relies on the phone calls which the Crown says are to do with the botched sending of the money;” 
          
         
        
       
      40 After some four paragraphs in this vein, occupying something over two pages, her Honour continued (and I include the totality of Her Honour’s summary of the defence case):- 
       
        
         
          
          As I said members of the jury I certainly do not propose to repeat what counsel for the Crown, nor counsel for either accused, said to you in their final addresses yesterday. Those addresses were heard yesterday. It would be counterproductive for me to repeat them to you. You have heard capable and comprehensive addresses from all counsel at the bar table.  
          
         
         
          
          In summary, the Crown submitted to you that when you consider all of the evidence, which he took you through in great detail, you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused because that conclusion is the only reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the whole of the evidence. 
          
         
         
          
          On the other hand Mr Forrest and Mr Shields – and again, I will deal with the defence case together because, as you would probably understand, the defence rely on all the material which was tendered in the defence case. And indeed, on what the defence submit is a different interpretation that you would place on the evidence that the Crown relies on. In particular, the defence points you to exhibits 1 and 4 which were tendered by the defence, and are relied by both the accused Soukoulos and Cerullo. Those phone calls, exhibits 1 to 4 of which you have transcripts, the defence point to the possible involvement of a man called Simmo as does the surveillance evidence and the possible involvement of a man called Lenny Retima. And the defence submit that those four phone calls, exhibits 1 to 4, put a different slant or complexion on the telephone intercepts on which the Crown relies. 
          
         
         
          
          The accused rely on the money arriving in Frankfurt after Mr Szelenczy left the country; the fact that there was no paper trail, that is, there was no evidence as to who collected the $50,000 where it was collected or when it was collected. The defence both submit to you that the accused and Szelanczy were friends – so what? They also point out to you that Mr Szelenczy made a number of calls outside the RSL club once Mr Moulds, that is the federal agent posing as a DHL courier, made contract with Mr Szelenczy in the RSL club; a total of something like 16 calls. 
          
         
         
          
          The defence submit to you that the Crown is inviting you to engage in speculation and guesswork and that you would not put the complexion on the facts that the Crown suggests. Counsel for each accused submits, in effect, that you would find that there is another conclusion reasonably available on the whole of the evidence which is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused, and therefore, your verdict would be not guilty in respect of each of the accused. 
          
         
         
          
         
        
       
      41 The passage just quoted occupied approximately 1¾ pages. Part of the criticism of the summing up advanced under this ground was that “the entire case for the Appellants was dealt with in three paragraphs of summing up of the learned trial judge totalling in all, 326 words”. When regard is had to the fact that her Honour dealt with the entire case for the Crown, including far more evidence than there was in the case for the Appellants, in a passage only slightly longer, the mere length of her summary of the Defence case provides no basis for criticism. Nor has it been shown that her Honour’s approach, one of brevity, was not one fairly open to her. 
       
        
       
      42 Particularly is this so for, as her Honour said without exception being taken:- 
       
        
         
          
          “Essentially there is no dispute with the evidence given by the witnesses. What is in dispute in this trial is the conclusion you can draw from that evidence.” 
          
         
         
        and 
         
         
          
          “Many of the facts, if not all of the facts, on which the Crown relies in this case are not in dispute. What is in dispute is the complexion to be put on those facts individually or, more importantly, when taken as a whole.”  
          
         
         
        Much of Her Honour’s account of the Crown case was that undisputed evidence. 
         
        
       
      43 In other criticism it was submitted, in substance, that:- 
       
        
         
          
          (i) Her Honour had undermined and misstated the defence case. 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) The Crown case was that the Appellants were the “brains” and financiers behind the importation. From this it flowed that there would be no other persons involved whereas clearly there were. Thus the involvement of others carried the implication that the Appellants were not knowingly concerned in the importation and Her Honour had failed to put this case to the jury. 
          
         
         
          
          (iii) That the off-hand remark “so what” undermined the force of arguments for the Appellants and withdrew the innocent explanation of friendship between the Appellants and Szelenczy from the jury’s consideration and made it unnecessary for Her Honour to direct the jury that they would have to exclude that explanation as a reasonable possibility before finding guilt. 
          
         
         
          
          (iv) Her Honour did not draw attention to the fact that the Appellant’s failure to take the cocaine with them after supposedly meeting up or being with Szelenczy when he obtained delivery of the cocaine did not fit with the Crown case. 
          
         
         
          
          (v) If the Appellants were “the brains” the financiers and determined to distance themselves from the importation there was no need for them to meet with Szelenczy at all. 
          
         
        
       
      44 The context in which the reference “so what” appears, does not persuade me that Her Honour was in any sense undermining the defence case as distinct from recounting an argument for the defence to the effect that friendship between themselves and Mr Szelenczy precluded any adverse inference being drawn from their contact. Furthermore, the suggestion that her Honour was commenting on, let alone making a comment which undermined the case of the Appellants is quite inconsistent with the tenor of her Honour’s summing up. 
       
        
       
      45 But even if the reference “so what” should be regarded as a critical comment, its effect at the highest was to suggest that the fact of friendship said nothing on the topic of what the Appellants and Mr Szelenczy may have done in the course of that friendship. Certainly the remark provides no basis for the suggestion that the trial Judge withdraw the explanation of friendship from the jury’s consideration. Nor was her Honour required to direct the jury that before verdicts of guilty could be returned the jury would have to exclude friendship between the Appellants and Mr Szelenczy as a reasonable possibility. The relationship between the Appellants on the one hand and Mr Szelenczy on the other was but one of a group of circumstances on which the Crown relied: It was not itself an essential link in the Crown case and Her Honour, on three or four occasions in addition to that contained within the passage I have most recently quoted, directed the jury that before they could convict, guilt must be the only conclusion open and the Appellants must be acquitted if there was another reasonable explanation for the facts.  
       
        
       
      46 As a matter of common sense, the suggestion that if the Appellants were the “brains” behind the importation and its financiers there would not be other persons involved is just wrong. If that was an argument which had been advanced by counsel at the trial – and counsel for the Appellants in this Court said merely that he inferred it was, the defence case was not weakened by Her Honour’s failure to repeat it. 
       
        
       
      47 So far as the fourth and fifth criticisms I have recounted are concerned, no doubt if they were made and thought by the jury to have had weight, they would have been remembered. For myself, I should have thought them of minimal significance. No other undermining or misstatement of the Defence case was suggested. None is apparent in what is, overall, a commendably clear and concise summing up. This ground also fails. 
       
        
         
        Ground 9 
         
          
          The trial miscarried as a result of inadequate Counsel for the Appellant 
          
         
        
       
      48 Two distinct matters are relied on as, so it is said, demonstrating the inadequacy of Counsel’s conduct of the trial. The first is the failure of counsel to challenge the admissibility of the evidence as to the transmission of the moneys to Racerullo and Bosca on the ground of the time at which the moneys were transmitted. As has been said, there was a challenge to the admission of the evidence concerning the Bosca monies on another ground. 
       
        
       
      49 What I have said above in considering grounds 3 and 3A provides a sufficient answer to this suggested demonstration of inadequacy. However there is another. For the course of the trial indicates that the failure to challenge the admissibility of the evidence as to the transmission of moneys to Racerullo and Bosca on the ground of the time at which the moneys were transmitted is capable of explanation by the possibility of forensic advantage. In these circumstances, it is impossible to say that the decision created or contributed to a miscarriage of justice. 
       
        
       
      50 In this regard there was an affidavit sought to be read on behalf of the Appellants in which it was said that “it was the intention of trial counsel to avoid any reference to (the timing of the receipt of the monies in Europe as showing they could not have been used to purchase the cocaine) to set up a so-called “killer point” that was unanswerable by the Crown”. The point was in fact made forcefully in the cross-examination of Detective Critchlow when he was recalled as the last witness. 
       
        
       
      51 According to the remarks of Gaudron J [at 27], Hayne J [at 107-108] and Gummow J [at 101], in  
      TKWJ v R 
       (2002) 193 CLR 7 the passage just quoted was inadmissible. Her Honour said:- 
       
        
         
          
          One matter should be noted with respect to the question whether counsel’s conduct is explicable on the basis that it resulted or could have resulted in a forensic advantage. That is an objective test. An appellate court does not inquire whether the course taken by counsel was, in fact, taken for the purpose of obtaining a forensic advantage, but only whether it is capable of explanation on that basis. 
          
         
        
       
      52 It is unnecessary for this Court to consider whether that is the last word on the topic. Gleeson CJ – see [8-10] did not obviously agree. McHugh J did not advert to the topic although his Honour referred, without disapproval, to  
      Ignjatic 
       (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 where an affidavit indicating that tactical decisions were the reason for some courses of action was received – see at p338 - and to that evidence – see at [81]. Nor do any of the judgments in  
      TKWJ v R 
       indicate that the issue was there the subject of argument.  
       
        
       
      53 Here, as has been said, quite apart from the affidavit, the course of the trial indicates that the failure to raise the time of transmission as a ground for challenging the admissibility of the evidence presently under consideration is capable of explanation by the possibility of forensic advantage. Accordingly the first aspect of this ground fails. 
       
        
       
      54 The second particular arose from the terms of a formal admission, headed “Statement of Agreed Facts” and which became Exhibit A. Its terms included the following:- 
       
        
         
          
          “1. On 19 November 1999 the Accused Cerullo attended the Mid City Flight Centre, Sydney. She was in the company of Mr Szelenczy. The Accused tentatively booked a flight for Szelenczy to travel from Sydney to Frankfurt to Budapest to Frankfurt and back to Sydney. She paid a deposit of $100.00. She gave out her contact number as 0415 910 469. 
          
         
         
          
          2. On 23 November 1999 the accused, Toni Raffaella Cerullo (“Cerullo”) made an international booking for herself and the co-accused, Dimitrios (Jim) Soukoulis (“Soukoulis”) to travel to Frankfurt, Germany with STA Travel in Swanson Street, Melbourne. 
          
         
         
          
          3. … 
          
         
         
          
          4. When making this booking Cerullo left a non-refundable $100 deposit. Cerullo left her telephone number 0413 707 390. 
          
         
         
          
          5. … 
          
         
         
          
          6. …” 
          
         
        
       
      55 It was submitted that reasonably competent Counsel would not have advised the Appellant to make the admission in paragraph 1 which, it was asserted, was wrong in that:- 
       
        
         
          
          (a) The booking was not for Szelenczy alone but for him and his wife; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) At some unstated time the booking was changed to Szelenczy alone; 
          
         
         
          
          (c) The first Appellant was not involved in the changing of the booking; 
          
         
         
          
          (d) The contact number was simply a contact number in relation to the booking and not the first Appellant’s contact number; and 
          
         
         
          
          (e) The contact number belonged to Szelenczy. 
          
         
        
       
      56 The Court’s attention was drawn to a statement by a Ms Griffiths of 28 January 2000 which was apparently included in the Crown brief and on which part of the Statement was based. She was the employee of Flight Centre with whom the booking was made. It was also asserted that apart from a warrant under Section 45 of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, which identified the service 0415 910 469 as belonging to Mr Szelenczy, there was no other evidence available to be called at trial as to Ms Griffiths’ involvement or as to the ownership of the mobile phone mentioned in the admission.  
       
        
       
      57 What the statement of Ms Griffiths said concerning the phone number given to her at the time of the booking was, “The female also gave me a contact number of 0415 910 469”. Ms Griffiths said also that the tentative booking was for Mr Szelenczy and his wife although Ms Griffiths went on to say that “she was not sure whether the wife could obtain holidays at that stage. However, Mr Szelenczy was definitely going”. 
       
        
       
      58 Although it would clearly have been more appropriate for the admission to follow the terms of Ms Griffiths’ statement, using the expression “a contact number” instead of “her contact number”, in context the difference was, in my view, immaterial, particularly given the reference to “her telephone number” in paragraph 4. Furthermore, there was, as was no doubt to be anticipated, other evidence in the trial as to phone numbers. As recorded it was that the phone number of Ms Cerrulo’s mobile phone was 0413 703 390 and that of Mr Szelenczy was 0415 912 469. Each of these is one digit different from the corresponding number in the Statement of Agreed Facts but is calculated to make clear whose number was given at the time of the booking of Mr Szelenczy’s flight.  
       
        
       
      59 It was also submitted that the absence from the Statement of any reference to the tentative booking having been made for Mrs Szelenczy was calculated to diminish the weight of an argument that Mr Szelenczy’s trip was of an innocent nature, one in which it was originally planned that his wife would participate. However, evidence of such a booking, later cancelled, is hardly compelling. 
       
        
       
      60 The counsel who had appeared at trial were not called and there was no evidence put before the Court as to why the Statement took the form that it did. I am prepared to assume that there was no justification for the departures from Ms Griffith’s statement to which I have referred. If so, the departures should not have occurred and counsel was at fault. However the fault does not come close to that of such a serious nature as would lead to the conclusion that there has been a miscarriage of justice – se  
      R v Birks 
       (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685. 
       
        
       
      61 In support of this ground, counsel for the Appellants sought, as I have said, to read an affidavit. It was by a barrister, Mr Wayne Baffsky. Mr Baffsky deposed to, inter alia, having an extensive criminal practice and of having read the transcript and many, if not all, of the documents in the case. Mr Baffsky opined that 
       
        
         
          
          “It was deficient of trial Counsel not to rely upon the later receipt of the Racerullo monies and the Bosca monies in Germany 
          
         
         
          
          “reasonably competent Counsel should have sought to have applied to have the Jury discharged or to have the Racerullo monies and the Bosca monies withdrawn for the Jury’s consideration” and 
          
         
         
          
          “reasonably competent counsel should not have advised the Appellant(s) to make the admission (contained in the Statement of Agreed Facts)”.  
          
         
        
       
      62 The Crown objected to the affidavit. The Court said that it would decide the question of admissibility in these Reasons. 
       
        
       
      63 I have already indicated that a passage wherein Mr Baffsky records that it was the intention of trial counsel to avoid any reference to the timing of the receipt of the monies in Europe as showing they could not have been used to purchase the cocaine so as to set up a so-called “killer point” that would be unanswerable by the Crown, was, in light of the remarks in  
      TKWJ v R 
      , inadmissible. The balance of the affidavit, which consisted of the opinions I have quoted and material which formed the basis for those opinions should also be rejected. Section135(c) of the Evidence Act (NSW) provides the basis for this conclusion:- 
       
        
         
          
          The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) … 
             
            (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      64 This Court has more than sufficient experience to make a judgment as to whether counsel’s conduct in the trial, which had no particularly unusual features, was reasonable or within the range of what reasonably competent counsel would or might have done. In the circumstances of the case the Court does not need and would not be assisted by the opinion of some practitioner on the issues to which Mr Baffsky’s opinion goes. Indeed, although I need not decide this now, I find it difficult to conceive of a case where evidence such as that given by Mr Baffsky would be of assistance to this Court. Even if there were no cross-examination – and the Crown in written submissions reserved its rights in this regard should the Court admit the evidence - the time taken to consider, and probably refer in the Court’s reasons to Mr Baffsky’s evidence might not be great but, as the evidence would not assist, that time would still be an undue waste.  
       
        
       
      65 This ground also fails. 
       
        
       
      66 It follows from what I have said that the Appeals against conviction should be dismissed. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the application of the proviso to s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
       
        
       
      67  
      Ground 10 
       
        
          
        The sentence imposed upon the Appellant was manifestly excessive. 
         
        
       
      68 The principal argument advanced in support of the application for leave to appeal against sentence was that her Honour had arrived at wrong conclusions as to the role of the Appellants in the importation and in particular as to the relative criminality of the Appellants and Mr Szelenczy. 
       
        
       
      69 The latter had been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. An appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was dismissed –  
      R v Szelenczy  
      [2001] NSWCCA 75. There is nothing in the report of the Court of Criminal Appeal to suggest that that Court or the primary judge took a different view of Mr Szelenczy’s role from that suggested above and that taken by Judge Hock.  
       
        
       
      70 Mr Szelenczy had however a number of subjective circumstances in his favour which the Appellants do not have. He had pleaded guilty at an early stage and was regarded as exhibiting remorse and contrition. He was in a serious state of ill health, both physical and psychological, and an alcoholic. He had sought treatment for drug and alcohol problems while in custody and was making genuine efforts to resolve his problems. Nevertheless, Szelenczy had committed the offence for monetary gain. 
       
        
       
      71 The Appellants on the other hand had earlier established themselves in a successful pasta restaurant and were regarded as intelligent and capable business persons whose only motivation was greed. More significant for present purposes were findings of her Honour recorded in the following passage:- 
       
        
         
          
          “On the evidence I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that these two offenders were involved in the importation from the early stages to its conclusion and that they were superior to Szelenczy in the criminal enterprise to import this drug into Australia. 
          
         
         
          
          I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt they were principals overseeing Szelenczy who was himself no mere courier. I base these findings on the following evidence: the recorded telephone calls in which these offenders gave instructions to Szelenczy; the transfer of the $50,000 to Frankfurt; the booking of Szelenczy’s flight by Cerullo and the fact that she travelled to Frankfurt; and finally the fact that these two offenders distanced themselves from the actual parcel containing the drugs. 
          
         
         
          
          In arriving at this finding I have not overlooked the transcripts of the telephone calls between Szelenczy and others not these two offenders tendered at the trial and on sentence. That material is capable of giving rise to an inference that Szelenczy may have also had a role in the subsequent distribution of some or all of the cocaine but that does not detract from the conclusion I have come to that these two offenders were the financiers and the brains behind the importation.” 
          
         
        
       
      72 A number of these findings were challenged. In particular, it was submitted that her Honour erred in finding that the role of the Appellants was superior to that of Szelenczy, and that in fact there were not recorded telephone calls in which the Appellants gave instructions to Szelenczy, that the Appellants did not distance themselves from the actual parcel containing the drugs and, even if they did, that does not support the conclusion that her Honour drew from such a finding.  
       
        
       
      73 I agree that there were not recorded telephone “calls” in which the Appellants gave instructions to Szelenczy. The Crown was only able to point to one such conversation, one on 18 December 1999 at 1835 hours and my perusal of the transcripts of the calls leads me also to the view that this was the only one. Her Honour’s reference to “calls” was erroneous although the one to which I have referred provides significant support for her Honour’s conclusion.  
       
        
       
      74 I am inclined to agree also that such evidence as there was that the Appellants distanced themselves from the actual parcel containing the drugs does not support the conclusion that the Appellants were in a position superior to that of Szelenczy. Having apparently been at Szelenczy’s premises at the time of delivery, their immediate departure argues as much for him being in a superior role as it argues for the reverse. Of course, Szelenczy’s retention of the parcel is consistent with either him having a superior role in the importation or being more closely involved with the subsequent sale or distribution of the drugs. 
       
        
       
      75 There were other factors. The number of conversations between one or other of the Appellants and Szelenczy in the days immediately prior to the arrival of the drugs on the topic of their delivery demonstrates a great interest in the consignment. However, the Appellants’ apparent position as financiers might be an explanation for that and while Szelenczy’s informing the Appellants of the parcel’s arrival and their attendance at his flat argues for their interest being substantially more than minor, even in conjunction with their almost immediate departure, it does not argue for their role being greater or higher than Szelenczy’s was. 
       
        
       
      76 There was however one further aspect of the events occurring at about the time of delivery to which her Honour did not refer, but might well have. The presence of the money on the same table as the drugs and in Mr Szelenczy’s hand at the time of the police raid on his flat argues for the conclusion that it had been paid to him by one or both of the Appellants, perhaps for the successful conclusion of the importation. 
       
        
       
      77 It was further submitted that her Honour’s findings that the money sent to Frankfurt was used in some way to finance the importation and that the Appellants were the brains behind the importation were findings not open to her Honour. The first of these has been sufficiently answered by what has been said when I was considering grounds 3 and 3A. The second is amply supported by the evidence as to what the Appellants on the one hand, and Szelenczy on the other, did. 
       
        
       
      78 Finally, it was submitted that “following the successful appeal in  
      Wong v R 
       (2001) 207 CLR 584, it is no longer appropriate to sentence an offender convicted of being knowingly concerned in the importation of narcotics by reference to the weight of the particular narcotic. It is appropriate to have particular regard to the role played by the Appellants in the importation”. 
       
        
       
      79 The second of these propositions has been dealt with. The first is wrong. In  
      Wong v R 
       members of the High Court criticised what they saw as undue emphasis on quantity but no one suggested it was irrelevant. Thus at [64], Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said, “In general, however, the larger the importation … the heavier the punishment that would ordinarily be exacted”. See also [31], [70], [129-130]. 
       
        
       
      80 No error has been shown in the sentence her Honour imposed. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence, but dismiss the appeal. 
       
        
       
      81  
      BUDDIN J 
      : I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the judgment of Hulme J. I respectfully agree with the orders which his Honour proposes. I am in substantial agreement with what his Honour has said in relation to Grounds 3 – 10 and wish to add only some brief observations concerning Grounds 9 and 10. As I have come to a different view as to how Ground 2 should be disposed of, it will be necessary for me to state my reasons for having done so. 
       
        
         
        Ground 2 
         
        
       
      82 Counsel on behalf of each of the appellants objected at trial to the admissibility of Exhibit J which was a phone call on 25 November 1999 between the appellant Soukoulis and a person identified only as “Alex”. The relevant parts of the conversation are set out in the judgment of Hulme J. The trial judge accepted the Crown’s argument that “the conversation is probative of…Soukoulis’ state of mind and his participation in the joint criminal enterprise [and that it was] made in furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise”. Her Honour concluded, without stating reasons, that there was no basis, pursuant to ss135 and 137 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      , upon which to exclude the evidence. Her Honour also concluded that although the appellant Cerullo was not a party to the conversation it was nevertheless admissible against her as well, in accordance with the principles enunciated in  
      Queen v Tripodi 
       (1961) 104 CLR, because it was said to be “in furtherance of the joint criminal enterprise”, of which there was reasonable independent evidence. 
       
        
       
      83 The Crown sought in this Court to rely upon the decision of the High Court in  
      Harriman v The Queen 
       (1989) 167 CLR 590 to support the admissibility of the evidence. As the various judgments in  
      Harriman 
       make clear, the evidence in question must demonstrate more than a propensity on the part of an accused person to commit a particular kind of criminal offence or that he or she is the sort of person who is likely to commit the offence charged, before it can become admissible.  
       
        
       
      84 In  
      Harriman 
      , evidence that the appellant and his co-offender had previously been involved together in the sale of heroin was admitted upon his trial in respect of a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin. The co-offender was the main Crown witness at his trial and he gave evidence of their having travelled together to Thailand in order to facilitate the importation of heroin into Australia. The appellant said that his purpose in travelling to Thailand was entirely innocent. The High Court held that the evidence of the appellant’s prior involvement with his co-offender in the sale of heroin was admissible because it was highly probative of the criminal character of their association in Thailand. It was accordingly held that the evidence went beyond being mere propensity evidence. 
       
        
       
      85 Hulme J also referred to this Court’s decision in  
      R v Quach 
       [2002] NSWCCA 510. In that case an argument was advanced that evidence in the form of 11 intercepted telephone calls between the appellant and a man named Le, which took place between 19 and 29 April 2000, and from which it could be inferred that they had had prior dealings in drugs, was tendency evidence within the meaning of s 97 of the  
      Evidence Act.  
      Spigelman CJ rejected that argument and 
        
      held, inter alia, that the reasoning in  
      Harriman 
       was applicable because the evidence to which objection was taken in that case, was admissible in order to demonstrate that the relationship in question could not be regarded as an innocent one. Sully J agreed. His Honour said: 
       
        
         
          
          The Crown case was that the appellant had sold 5.9 kilograms of heroin to Le in exchange for more than $700,000 in cash. The Crown case was that the transaction had occurred at the appellant’s premises and in the very early morning hours of 2 May 2000. There was no direct evidence of the carrying out of the transaction. The appellant’s stance at trial was that he had no connection whatsoever with any such transaction; that he had no acquaintance with Le except a casual and visual acquaintance deriving from a sighting of Le at a gambling casino; and that he had no relationship whatsoever with Le of such a kind as would discredit his, the appellant’s basic position that at the relevant time on the relevant morning he had been asleep in his own bed, oblivious to any drug-related activity of Le. 
          
         
         
          
          In such a trial setting, it seems to me that the evidence of the eleven intercepted telephone conversations was relevant and admissible in order to show such a relationship between the appellant and Le as would establish that it was no mere series of unfortunate coincidences that began with a flurry of telephone conversations about drugs; caused Le to drive from Melbourne to Sydney overnight to a destination in Sydney that was practically on the appellant’s door-step; and that found Mr Le shortly thereafter on his way back to Melbourne in possession of 5.9 kilograms of heroin; and found the appellant, at the same time, in possession of an enormous sum of money in bank notes, many of them new bank notes, the total amount of such money equating strikingly to the current market value of that 5.9 kilograms of heroin. (pars 71-2) 
          
         
        
       
      86 The last in time of the phone calls which were, in the light of the other evidence in the case capable of being regarded as concerned with a future supply of drugs, had taken place only two or three days before the transaction on 2 May.  
       
        
       
      87 So far as the present case is concerned, it may be inferred that the parties were speaking in a deliberately covert fashion during at least parts of their conversation. The critical issue however was whether there was a sufficient nexus between what was being discussed during the conversation in question and the importation which occurred a month later such as to justify the admissibility of the conversation. The nexus is said to have been provided in particular by the reference to “white cappuccino” by the man “Alex” and the appellant Soukoulis’ remark, “not now”. 
       
        
       
      88 To establish the nexus it had to be first inferred that the reference to “white cappuccino” was not only a reference to prohibited drugs but also that it was a specific reference to cocaine as distinct from any other prohibited drug which is white in colour. The appellant’s reference to “not now” had then to be interpreted to mean that he was intending to convey the impression that he was not able to there and then supply cocaine to “Alex” but he would be able to do so in the foreseeable future, (that is from the consignment of drugs which were to be the subject of the proposed importation then some weeks away). Having read the transcript of the conversation a number of times I am still left in considerable doubt as to what the conversation was actually about. The conversation was of very short duration and “Alex” was not otherwise referred to in the proceedings. Nor is there any other material available which would enable one to place the present conversation in some sort of context. All those considerations lead me to the conclusion that there was no satisfactory basis upon which the conversation could be safely interpreted in the manner which is suggested. Accordingly I am of the view that the evidence lacked the necessary probative value to justify its admissibility.  
       
        
       
      89 Even if the evidence was otherwise admissible, then in my view it plainly ought to have been excluded pursuant to the discretion conferred by s 135 of the  
      Evidence  
      Act either on the basis that it might be “misleading or confusing” or that it might be “unfairly prejudicial”. Alternatively it ought to have been excluded pursuant to s 137. 
       
        
       
      90 If on the other hand however, the conversation was indeed about a prospective drug supply but was not related in any way to the drugs to be imported, then in my view it could not rise above being anything other than mere propensity evidence. Because the conversation was between the appellant and a third person who was not demonstrated to have had any involvement in the cocaine importation, or to have been, or intended to have been the recipient of any part of it, then there was nothing about the nature of their relationship which could be established that could relevantly bear on the proof of the matter with which the appellants were charged. In those circumstances, there is nothing in my respectful view, in either  
      Harriman  
      or  
      Quach 
       that would justify the admissibility of the conversation against the appellant Soukoulis, much less against the appellant Cerullo. 
       
        
       
      91 Accordingly, in my view, the appellants have demonstrated error on the part of the trial judge in that evidence which was inadmissible has been received into evidence. It becomes necessary then to consider the possible application of the proviso to s 6(1) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      .  
       
        
       
      92 In respect of the appellant Cerullo, the Crown was able to rely, inter alia, upon the following pieces of evidence: 
       
        
         
          
          (i) her presence at the “Flight Centre” and her role in arranging the travel of Szelenczy; 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) her facsimile to the Appellant Soukoulis (Exh AH) concerning his meeting with Szelenczy; 
          
         
         
          
          (iii) her travel to Frankfurt at the material time; 
          
         
         
          
          (iv) her conversation with Caracoussis and the subsequent transfer of monies overseas; 
          
         
         
          
          (v) her various conversations with Soukoulis and Szelenczy; 
          
         
         
          
          (vi) being in the company of Soukoulis and Szelenczy on the afternoon of 23 December at which time the arrival of the “parcel” was discussed; and 
          
         
         
          
          (vii) her presence in Szelenczy’s premises at the time of the delivery of the parcel. 
          
         
        
       
      93 In respect of the appellant Soukoulis, the Crown was able to rely, inter alia, upon the following pieces of evidence: 
       
        
         
          
          (i) his presence in Sydney on 23 November 1999 and his receipt of the facsimile from Cerullo on that date; 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) his meeting with Szelenczy prior to Szelenczy’s departure to Frankfurt; 
          
         
         
          
          (iii) the fact that bookings were made for his travel, notwithstanding the fact that he did not ultimately leave Australia; 
          
         
         
          
          (iv) his various conversations with Cerullo and Szelenczy; 
          
         
         
          
          (v) his presence at the conversations between Cerullo and Caracoussis and the subsequent transfers of monies overseas; 
          
         
         
          
          (vi) being in the company of Cerullo and Szelenczy on the afternoon of 23 December 1999 at which time the arrival of “the parcel” was discussed; 
          
         
         
          
          (vii) his presence in Szelenczy’s premises at the time of the delivery of the parcel. 
          
         
        
       
      94 In my view a fair reading of the entire trial transcript reveals that the Crown was able to present a strong circumstantial evidence against each appellant. No evidence was called on behalf of either of them in answer to the Crown case. As against that, I do not believe that the inadmissible material would have occasioned any real prejudice to the appellants because as I have indicated earlier, the jury is likely to have been quite confused about the meaning to be attributed to the conversation and would, in all likelihood, have placed little or no reliance upon it. The trial was otherwise conducted with conspicuous fairness and the trial judge’s directions to which little or no objection was taken, were extremely clear and concise. In all those circumstances, and even if I am wrong in my assessment of the likely impact of the inadmissible material upon the jury, I would apply the proviso and dismiss the appeal upon the basis that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. See  
      Festa v R 
       (2001) 185 ALR 394. 
       
        
         
        Ground 9 
         
        
       
      95 In order to succeed upon this ground, the appellants must establish that there has been a “miscarriage of justice” within the meaning of s 6(1) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
       They seek to do so by persuading the Court that such a result was occasioned by reason of the way in which the trial was conducted by counsel who then appeared. Two particular matters are relied upon. I agree with Hulme J that the appellants have fallen well short of establishing a miscarriage of justice, much less that the conduct of counsel may in some way have contributed to such an outcome.  
       
        
       
      96 This question was the subject of recent analysis by the High Court in  
      TKWJ v R 
       (2002) 193 ALR 7. The appellant there contended that trial counsel’s failure to lead evidence of his good character, and his failure to seek an “advance ruling” as to the admissibility of that evidence, had resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The High Court rejected those arguments. Gaudron J said: 
       
        
         
          
          Even though there is no defect or irregularity in a trial, a question may arise whether there was a miscarriage of justice. Such is the case, for example, when it is argued that a verdict should be set aside because of the discovery of evidence that was not available or, with reasonable diligence, could not have been made available at the trial – “fresh evidence”, as it is usually called. The question may also arise if counsel fails to call evidence that was available or fails to elicit evidence in cross-examination. In that situation, it has been customary to focus on the competence of defence counsel, it being said that there must be “flagrant incompetence”, an “egregious error”, “extreme conduct” or “significant fault”. Thus it was that the argument in the present case was premised on counsel having made a “wrong” decision. 
          
         
         
          
          Apart from the difficulties involved in an appellate court reviewing the conduct of counsel to determine whether it justifies one or other of the above descriptions or, even, whether it involved error, that is not an exercise that is directly required by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Relevantly, the question posed by s 6(1) is whether “on any other ground…there was a miscarriage of justice”. The words “on any other ground” do not postulate the demonstration of error. Rather, they simply require that “something occurred or did not occur” in the trial. 
          
         
         
          
          As is the case where there is a defect or irregularity in the trial, the reason why something occurred or did not occur is relevant to the question whether, in the circumstances, there was a miscarriage of justice. But the relevant question that must ultimately be answered, is whether the act or omission resulted in a miscarriage of justice, not whether, if it is referable to the course taken by defence counsel, it was the result of “flagrant incompetence”, “egregious error” or the like. (at 14-15) 
          
         
        
       
      97 McHugh J said: 
       
        
         
          
          In determining whether the conduct of counsel has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, the “semantic exercise of trying to assess the qualitative value of counsel’s alleged ineptitude” is not an end in itself. A test such as “flagrant incompetence”, while a convenient label that may show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred in a particular case, is unhelpful generally in determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice within the terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Whether there has been a miscarriage of justice is the ultimate issue that the court must decide. Counsel’s conduct is a sub-issue. Where counsel’s conduct is in issue, the court must examine all the circumstances including the wide discretion that counsel, as an officer of the court, had to conduct the trial in the manner that he or she thought was in the best interests of the accused. If the court concludes that, despite that discretion, a material irregularity has occurred, it must determine whether there is a significant possibility that the irregularity affected the outcome. (at 32-3) 
          
         
        
       
      98 As their Honours point out, the critical question remains whether the appellants can demonstrate that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The resolution of that question is quintessentially a matter of law and as such, is an issue which is reserved for determination by an appellate court in accordance with well established principles. I would reach a similar conclusion concerning the question of incompetence of counsel and in particular in relation to an assertion of “flagrant incompetence”. Appellate courts are well placed, and indeed are expected, to decide such questions on the basis of collective judicial knowledge and experience. Accordingly the resolution of these issues is not assisted by the expression of an opinion by a barrister who claims expertise upon the subject.  
       
        
       
      99 For similar reasons I would not be prepared to conclude that the question of competence of counsel in the conduct of a particular trial is an identifiable field of endeavour which would constitute “specialised knowledge” within the meaning of s 79 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . It is unnecessary in those circumstances to consider the related question of whether, assuming that there is indeed such a field of endeavour, there was any basis upon which it could be demonstrated that Mr Baffsky had in any event, the requisite expertise. A claim based solely upon his asserted experience would not, I would have thought in the circumstances, suffice. 
       
        
       
      100 It is for these reasons that I agree with Hulme J that Mr Baffsky’s affidavit should be rejected. I also agree with his Honour that it is “difficult to conceive of a case where evidence of this kind” would be of assistance to this Court. 
       
        
         
        Ground 10 
         
        
       
      101 There are, as the High Court observed in  
      R v Olbrich 
       (1999) 199 CLR 270, limits to the utility in adopting labels such as “principal” or “courier” to describe an offender’s participation in an offence. Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ in a joint judgment said “it is always necessary, whether one or several offenders are to be dealt with in connection with a single importation of drugs, to bear steadily in mind the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced. Characterising the offender as a ‘courier’ or a ‘principal’ must not obscure the assessment of what the offender did” (at 279). 
       
        
       
      102 Bearing those considerations in mind, the answer to the applicants’ submissions does not ultimately depend, in my view, upon a determination of some hierarchy of relative culpability as between the applicants and the co-offender, Mr Szelenczy. What the evidence disclosed was that each of the applicants played a very significant role, as did Mr Szelenczy, in the commission of the present offence. True it is that the functions which they were to perform, differed. Each nevertheless played an indispensable part in ensuring that the object of their joint enterprise, namely the importation of the prohibited drugs, was achieved. On any view of the matter, it is apparent that the applicants performed functions that were,  
      at least 
      , as pivotal to the achievement of that objective as did Mr Szelenczy.  
       
        
       
      103 That being so, the sentences imposed upon these applicants sit comfortably with the sentence imposed upon Mr Szelenczy (which was not disturbed on appeal to this Court) when appropriate consideration is given to the favourable subjective factors upon which he, but not the current applicants, was able to rely. Prominent amongst those considerations was his plea of guilty. When due weight is given to those matters which Mr Szelenczy was able to call in aid, and to which Hulme J has referred, it can be readily assumed that the sentence that would otherwise have been appropriate in his case would have been in the order of 12 years’ imprisonment which is the precise head sentence that was imposed upon each of the applicants. 
       
        
       
      104 As to the submission concerning the relevance of the weight of the prohibited substance, it may be observed that in addition to the passage in the joint judgment of Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, in  
      Wong & Leung v The Queen 
       (2001) 207 CLR 584, to which Hulme J referred, their Honours also said that: 
       
        
         
          
          The weight of the narcotic which is imported is given statutory significance for sentencing purposes by the Parliament’s distinguishing between the maximum sentence that may be imposed for offences involving trafficable and commercial quantities. No doubt, within both of these categories, the particular amount of narcotic involved can have significance in fixing the sentence that is to be imposed on an offender. (at para 67) 
          
         
        
       
      105 So far as the continuing significance of the guidelines established by this Court in  
      R v Wong & Leung 
       (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 are concerned, Hidden J, with whom Levine J and Howie J agreed, said in  
      R v Taru 
       [2002] NSWCCA 391 that they “remain useful notwithstanding the subsequent High Court decision arising from that case, because they were expressed to be based on the existing pattern of sentence at the time the judgment was delivered. Indeed, much of the judgment of the Chief Justice was devoted to consideration of other cases and the patterns of sentence which emerged from them.” 
       
        
       
      106 In view of the significant involvement of each of the applicants in an enterprise of the scope and seriousness of the present offence, I cannot accept the submission that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
       
        
       
      107 Even if error had been established, I would not form the opinion pursuant to s 6(3) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 1912,  
       “that some other sentence…less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed”.

     R v Billy TRAD 
      
    The applicant was sentenced on charges contained in two indictments and six additional offences to be taken into account on the applicant’s request. The second of these indictments charged the applicant jointly with one Bill Chahrouk with five counts of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, with six additional offences to be taken into account. The first indictment charged the applicant alone with one count of attempted armed robbery and two counts of robbery. The applicant pleaded guilty to all charges, in summary being one count of attempted armed robbery, seven counts of armed robbery and one count of aggravated armed robbery with a further four counts of armed robbery and two of larceny motor vehicle, one count of receiving and two of resisting arrest to be taken into account as additional offences. 
     
      
    The sentencing Judge noted that the victims were usually young people, working alone in jobs that were not particularly well paid and that on all occasions the victims were put in fear, having knives or bars forced into their backs, being forced to the ground, being threatened and being led into store rooms and the like. Her Honour noted that severe punishment was called for for the offences in question. 
     
      
    The sentencing Judge acknowledged that the pleas of guilty had a utilitarian value nonetheless because the trial was to last three weeks and the Crown conceded that it did not have a particularly strong case against either offender, particularly Chahrouk. Her Honour considered that the combination of the utilitarian value of the plea and the recognition of the relative weakness of the Crown case gave rise to a discount but no more than a range of between 10 and 15 per cent. The combined effect of the sentences on both indictments was a total term of twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years. 
     
      
    It was submitted that her Honour erred in conflating two distinct principles in determining the appropriate discount to apply for the plea of guilty, those being the strength of the crown case against the accused and the utilitarian public benefit derived from the guilty plea. It was also submitted that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    HELD (Per Sheller JA, James and O’Keefe JJ agreeing): 
     
      
       
      1. The strength of the crown case may be taken into consideration only in relation to the contrition element of the leniency in sentencing which a plea of guilty affords an accused. The strength of the crown case is irrelevant to the utilitarian discount given for a plea of guilty and should not be taken into account:  
      R v Thompson; R v Houlton 
       (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 followed;  
      Winchester v The Queen 
       (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 followed. 
       
       
      2. A delay in sentencing a prisoner in relation to earlier offences, occasioned by the prisoner’s desire to have matters sentenced together will be irrelevant to any utilitarian discount and to the extent that it had any relevance it would entitle the offender to a degree of leniency:  
      Mill v R 
       (1988) 166 CLR 59 followed;  
      R v Fahda  
      [1999] NSWCCA 267 followed. 
       
       
      3. The sentencing Judge erred to the extent that her Honour took into account irrelevant matters when considering the utilitarian discount to apply in respect of the guilty pleas. However, the discount given, being one of 10 to 15 per cent, was appropriate in the circumstances given the time at which the pleas of guilty were entered and the disruption and inconvenience caused by the offender’s absconding. 
       
       
      4. The fact that offences were conducted in a way that the victims were put in fear in the course of their work in service stations and convenience stores was a factor that called for severe punishment for the offences in question. It was not possible to suggest that the sentence imposed was beyond the range.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA:  
     
      
       
      Two indictments 
       
       
      On 16 September 2002 her Honour Judge Tupman in the District Court sentenced the applicant, Billy Trad, on charges contained in two indictments, one dated 1 February 2002 and the other dated 11 March 2002.  
       
      
    2 The second of these indictments charged the applicant jointly with one Bill Chahrouk with five counts of robbery armed with an offensive weapon (s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 such an offence carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment), the incidents covering a period from 1 June 2000 to 17 July 2000. Both of the accused entered pleas of guilty to these charges on 11 March 2002. This was in a background of an earlier indictment of 15 November 2001, which charged them with some twenty counts, the majority of which were for armed robbery and some for larceny of a motor vehicle. The pleas of guilty to the five counts on 11 March 2002 were entered and accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the earlier indictment. However, six additional offences were to be taken into account pursuant to s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Each of the accused asked that those six offences be taken into account when sentencing for count 4 in the joint indictment. They were set out in a Form 1 document. Four were for armed robbery and two for larceny of a motor vehicle. 
     
      
    3 The first indictment dated 1 February 2002 charged the applicant alone with one count of attempted robbery armed with an offensive weapon, two counts of robbery armed with an offensive weapon, the first two counts relating to occurrences on 16 July 1999 and the third on 19 March 2000 and each with a maximum penalty of twenty years, and a fourth count of robbery armed with a dangerous weapon which carried a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment under s97(2) of the Crimes Act. That was alleged to have occurred on 23 March 2000. 
     
      
    4 These four charges were originally before the Court by way of pleas of guilty pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act 1902. The applicant was first arrested in relation to the first two of these offences on 6 August 1999 and given bail. He pleaded guilty on 1 September 1999 and was committed for sentence to the District Court with bail being granted. On 15 October 1999 the proceedings were adjourned to have the applicant placed in a William Booth Programme. The proceedings were stood over for hearing on 20 March 2000. On 19 March 2000 the applicant committed the offence the subject of the third count. He failed to appear in court on 20 March 2000 when his bail was revoked and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Whilst at large on 23 March 2000 he committed the fourth of the offences, the aggravated armed robbery. He was eventually arrested on 27 July 2000 in relation to these two last offences and other intervening offences which were the subject of the joint indictment. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court to counts 3 and 4 and was committed for sentence but bail refused. The sentencing Judge remarked that these four offences came before the court on pleas of guilty on indictment dated 1 February 2002 when they were entered. However, her Honour accepted that this was in circumstances where, in fact, the prisoner had pleaded to all four charges pursuant to s51A in the Local Court but the s51A documents had either been lost or misplaced. Her Honour accepted that these last four pleas at least had been entered at the earliest opportunity in the Local Court notwithstanding that on their face the pleas of guilty on arraignment occurred in February 2002. 
     
      
    5 On those charges the applicant asked that on count 4 three additional offences should be taken into account pursuant to s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, one for receiving on 15 December 1999 and two for resisting officers in the execution of their duty, namely two police officers, at the time of the applicant’s arrest on 27 July 2000.  
     
      
    6 In summary, the applicant was sentenced on one count of attempted armed robbery, seven counts of armed robbery and one count of aggravated armed robbery with a further four offences of armed robbery and two of larceny motor vehicle, one offence of receiving and two of resisting arrest to be taken into account.

    8 The combined effect of the sentences on both indictments was a total term of twelve years to commence on 27 July 2000, the day of the applicant’s arrest, with a non-parole period of eight years expiring on 26 July 2008. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    9 The sentencing Judge described in summary form the matters she dealt with on the indictment of 1 February 2002.  
     
      
    10 The offence charged under count 1 occurred at the Super Saver Store in Guildford just after 7 pm on 16 July 1999. The applicant produced a knife and demanded that the console operator open the till whilst pointing the knife at that person. The operator could not open the till and the applicant became aggressive and insistent, yelling at her. He climbed over the counter and tried to open the till, whilst continuing to threaten her with a knife. The applicant left the store without obtaining any property when the till would not open. The incident was filmed on surveillance camera.  
     
      
    11 The events giving rise to count 2 occurred about thirty minutes after the events of count 1 on 16 July 1999 when the applicant went into the Shell Service Station in Guildford. A Mr McGarry was working there behind the console. The applicant produced a knife and held it at Mr McGarry demanding money. Mr McGarry did not resist. The applicant pulled a jumper down over his hands, grabbed money from the cash register and walked from the store. A sum of just under $250 in cash was taken in this robbery which was also recorded on surveillance video. 
     
      
    12 As a result of his identification from the videos the applicant was arrested by police when seen on 6 August 1999. He declined to answer questions and when shown photographs from the surveillance videos he denied that he was the person involved. As already indicated he was granted bail when he came before the court and ultimately pleaded guilty pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act. 
     
      
    13 In the meantime, on 15 December 1999 he committed the first of the three offences in the Form 1, which was a receiving offence. At about 10 am on 15 December 1999 the applicant was found to be in possession of twenty-six assorted phone cards which had earlier been stolen from the Ampol Service Station at Granville in circumstances where a male person had robbed the console operator whilst armed with a knife. When the applicant was arrested and found to be in possession of those cards he indicated he knew they were stolen but that he had bought them earlier in the day from Auburn Railway Station. The sentencing Judge observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is unclear, to me at least, how in the circumstances, being on bail for two armed robbery charges, [the applicant] came to be granted bail in relation to that matter, and the evidence before me does not enable me to trace what occurred to this particular charge as it found its way through the Local Courts, but it is a matter which I take into account on sentencing him for count 4 in that February indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        In the intervening period, whilst he was on bail, pre-sentence reports were being prepared but there were indications that he was not complying with his bail conditions in relation to attending a rehabilitation programme and keeping appointments with Probation and Parole. There was, apparently, no action taken to deal with these breaches of bail conditions and ultimately he failed to appear for sentence on 20 March 2000. He had, in fact, committed the third of the three offences on 19 March 2000 in circumstances where at about 1 am that morning he approached the Mobil Service Station in Rydalmere where Mr Ali Baig was working alone. He gained entry to the shop area and after approaching the counter there pulled the hood of his jacked over his head to conceal the upper portion of his face. He removed a black metal bar from behind his back. He threatened Mr Baig that he would kill him and demanded money. [The applicant] moved behind the rear of the counter and again threatened the console operator with a metal bar. Fearing for his safety Mr Baig opened the cash register. [The applicant] removed a quantity of cash from it and also opened the cash dispensing safe under the counter, removing a tube which contained more money. He then took packets of cigarettes from the display case and left the store. This incident was captured by surveillance video and [the applicant] was positively identified from stills taken from this source.” 
        
       
      
    14 The sentencing Judge observed that it would appear from the terms of the third count, although nowhere in the facts tendered, that the sum of $350 in cash as well as two packets of cigarettes were stolen as a result of the robbery.  
     
      
    15 I must express my astonishment that the applicant on bail for two charges, one of attempted and the other of actual armed robbery, to which he had pleaded guilty, was granted bail when found to be in possession of phone cards stolen from a service station as the result of another armed robbery. My astonishment becomes even greater if it be right that the applicant was not complying with his bail conditions by attending a rehabilitation programme and keeping appointments with probation and parole officers. 
     
      
    16 Four days later on 23 March 2000 the applicant committed the fourth of the four offences in the indictment namely the aggravated armed robbery offence. This occurred at 1 am when the applicant entered the Seven Eleven Store at North Rocks. The console operator, Mr Kandiah, was standing outside the entrance doors and was approached by the applicant and an unidentified co-offender. The applicant entered the shop and selected some items while the co-offender was talking to Mr Kandiah, who then entered the shop to serve the applicant. When he walked past the applicant he was grabbed from behind and forced to the cash register. The applicant held a flick knife to his throat and the co-offender forced a metallic bar into his back. They forced him to open the cash register and demanded money. The attendant was understandably fearful for his well-being and complied and opened the till. The co-offender removed money from the cash drawer and the applicant removed a large quantity of cigarettes from the display shelves. He placed these into a large orange garbage bag. The co-offender also demanded the attendant’s wallet from which he then removed a sum of money. The two offenders then left the store. Examination of the display shelves uncovered a fingerprint which was later found to be that of the applicant. 
     
      
    17 According to his statement, Mr Kandiah was in such fear that he was in tears. The offenders told him as they left “Don’t call anyone, we will kill you.” Mr Kandiah’s arm was sore from being twisted and held behind his back by one of them.  
     
      
    18 All the victims of the four robberies were placed in fear as a result of the offences. Mr Kandiah needed to spend a few days away from work to recover. The sentencing Judge accepted from the wording of the fourth count in the indictment that the sum of $240 in cash was stolen during the course of this robbery as well as a quantity of cigarettes. 
     
      
    19 The sentencing Judge next dealt chronologically with the facts in relation to the jointly charged offences. The first of these, the first offence in the Form 1, occurred on 21 May 2000 when the co-offenders together went into the Caltex Service Station at Carlingford just after 6 am. I interpolate that her Honour wrongly referred to this as the BP Service Station at Blacktown but nothing turns on this. There was a twenty-year-old female attendant working there. She was alone. The two offenders pulled up in a brown Laser and entered the shop area. They pulled their jumpers up over their faces. One of them was holding a knife at waist height which had a blade of about 15 to 20 cm. A demand was made for the till to be opened and the attendant was asked the location of cigarettes. One or other of the two offenders emptied the till while the other put a quantity of cigarettes from the office into their vehicle. The console operator was forced to lie face down on the floor with a knife pointed at her abdomen from a short distance away. The offenders left shortly afterwards. During the course of that robbery the offenders took the wallet owned by the attendant, including $20 in cash and her credit cards, and the mobile phone belonging to her. $600 in cash and cigarettes with a total value of about $13,770 were removed. 
     
      
    20 The next offence was that charged in count 1 of the indictment. On 1 June 2000 the offenders went into the BP Service Station at Blacktown just after 6 am. The twenty-year-old male attendant was in the process of setting up the store for service. Each of the offenders was wearing head gear when they entered the shop, one a baseball cap and the other a beanie. One or other went behind the counter, produced a 20-cm-long bladed knife and told the attendant to get onto the ground. Each of the offenders was armed with a knife. Demands were made of the attendant to open the safe but he was unable to do so. He was also asked the location of mobile phone charge cards. The offenders took a quantity of cigarettes and placed them into a garbage bag and left the premises. As a result of this robbery about 1,000 packets of cigarettes were taken with an estimated total value of $10,000. In addition, about sixty pre-paid telephone cards were taken with differing values ranging in total from $6,000 to $30,000. The sum of about $340 was also taken in cash. Neither of the offenders was identified during this robbery because they were disguised. The fingerprint of the applicant was, however, found following the robbery and subsequently identified.  
     
      
    21 The registration number of the car used by the offenders to take them to this robbery was recorded when the attendant followed them outside. It had been stolen from the carpark of a unit complex in Auburn in the early hours of 1 June. When it was ultimately recovered, the quarter window had been smashed and the ignition had been damaged. The larceny motor vehicle, the second offence in the Form 1, was the charge flowing from this occurrence.  
     
      
    22 The next offence was count 2 in the indictment and occurred on 5 June 2000 at the BP Service Station at Auburn. The offenders went there just after 3 am. The attendant opened the doors and each entered. Each had on head gear, one a cream cap and the other a cap and balaclava. One produced a knife which was pointed at the attendant’s chest from about 10 cms away. He was told to lie down. He did so because of fear of being injured. The offenders placed packets of cigarettes into a garbage bag. The attendant was forced to open the till and the offenders left driving away in the stolen vehicle already referred to. A quantity of money and cigarettes was stolen but from the material tendered the sentencing Judge was unable to determine either the quantity of property or the amount of money removed. 
     
      
    23 The next offence was the subject of count 3 in the indictment and occurred on 8 June 2000 at the Mobil Service Station at Granville at about 5.30 am. A thirty-year-old male casual attendant was working there alone. His wife and infant daughter were inside the service station with him because of the wife’s fear of remaining at home alone. The offenders entered the store and moved to the console and to the male attendant. Each of them had a black bandanna covering the lower part of his face. One or other was holding a knife. He yelled that it was a robbery and the attendant’s family moved to the office area. The offenders then removed two garbage bags from underneath their jackets and filled them with almost all of the available cartons of cigarettes. About 120 cartons of cigarettes with a value of approximately $6,000 was stolen.  
     
      
    24 The next offence was the subject of the third offence in the Form 1 and occurred on 25 June 2000 at the Ampol Service Station at Rydalmere. The offenders drove a car up to the service station just after 6 am. A forty-one-year-old male attendant was working alone in the service station. One of the two offenders entered the store first with his face disguised by a balaclava and a baseball cap on his head. He produced a knife and pointed it at the attendant. The attendant tried to reach the alarm but the offender told him to move away. The offender jumped the counter and at that stage the other offender entered the store, also with his face disguised. He yelled for the attendant to get down onto the floor and pushed him down. One or other of the two offenders then carried a number of garbage bags. They led the attendant to the maintenance room, closed the door and placed cigarettes in the bag from the display shelves. They then asked the attendant how to open the two registers. One was open but empty. The two offenders then left the store taking some money from one of the registers. Cigarettes with a value of between $3,000 and $4,000 were stolen together with about $400 or $500 in cash.  
     
      
    25 The fourth offence in the Form 1 occurred on 11 July 2000 at the Shell Service Station at Ryde at 6 am just as it was opening. Again the attendant, a twenty-six-year-old male, was alone opening up the service station for business that day. The offenders arrived in a red Laser and as the attendant entered the shop area one of the offenders followed him, produced a knife and demanded that he get onto the floor. They demanded money from the till. The till was opened and the attendant was asked the location of the cigarettes and the mobile phone cards. Both offenders were in the shop and placed tobacco and other cigarette packets into a garbage bag. The attendant’s wallet with $70 in cash, his driver’s licence and other personal effects were stolen. Also stolen was about $400 in cash, cigarettes and tobacco products with a total value of about $4,350 with mobile phone cards with a total value of about $250. 
     
      
    26 The next offence was that in count 4 of the indictment and occurred on 14 July 2000 at the Caltex Service Station at Carlingford. This was the same location as that covered by the first offence on Form 1. The offenders confronted the twenty-two male attendant who was arriving at work just before 6 am to open up. Each was at the back door of the premises and had a hat or some other item covering the lower parts of his face. One of them held a knife with a 10-cm blade towards the attendant and ordered him to the ground. They asked the whereabouts of the money and cigarettes. One of the offenders went to the back room and placed the cigarettes into a garbage bag. They turned off the lights and took the contents of the cash register. They also demanded the change bag and the attendant’s wallet and searched for cash in them. They drove away in the red Laser. As a result of this robbery about $2,250 was stolen from the service station, an unknown quantity of cigarettes and about $100 from the wallet belonging to the attendant. It was on this count that the sentencing Judge was asked to take into account all of the Form 1 offences. 
     
      
    27 The next offence, count 5 in the indictment, occurred on 17 July 2000 at the Quix Store Gladesville at about 6 am. The twenty-three-year-old male attendant was working there alone. The offenders went to the premises in a red Laser with registration plates UIT 187. They went into the shop, looked around and then returned to the car. After the attendant finished serving a customer in the store they drove into the customer parking area and one approached the attendant from behind and stuck a knife into his back. The knife had a 20-cm blade. The attendant was told to go into the store and turn off the inside lights. He was forced to kneel and the two offenders took cigarettes and lighters from the shop and forced him to open the till. The offenders stole about twenty CDs from the shop. The attendant was directed to open the safe, which he could not do. He was taken by the offenders into the store room and told to lie on the floor. As a result of the robbery about $150 was taken from the register and CDs worth about $600 and an unknown quantity of cigarettes, lighters and confectionary were stolen. The fifth offence in the Form 1 related to the car used in this robbery, which had been stolen some time on 8 July 2000 from Flemington Markets. It was not recovered until early October. Its tyres were flat and rubbish and rotten fruit were found inside. It was uninsured and rendered virtually useless to its owner. 
     
      
    28 Judge Tupman observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the robbery occurring at the Quix Service Station I note that it was the second time that that particular twenty-three year old attendant had been the victim of such an armed robbery within a month. He had been a similar victim about three weeks previously in circumstances where I accept from his statement that these two [offenders] were the same two who had committed the earlier robbery. I also know that one of the original charges in the indictment, dated 15 November 2001, included an armed robbery at this Quix store in Gladesville on 21 June 2000. It appears to be one in relation to which the Crown elected to take no further proceedings as part of a negotiated result which gave rise to the pleas of guilty to five counts, with a further four counts on Form 1. I accept that, no doubt, this particular victim was further victimised as a result of the earlier offence having occurred and whether it be these two [offenders] who committed it or not, the prevalence of these offences in service stations and convenience stores in the late evening or early morning is such that offenders committing such offences could safely assume that these workers, just like bank tellers in the past, have been victims already of such offences and put in fear, such that a repetition only increases and exacerbates that apprehension. It would not be surprising if this was the case with this young man.” 
        
       
      
    29 The last offence, the sixth in the Form 1, occurred on 24 July 2000 when the offenders robbed the Shell Service Station at Blacktown. The nineteen year old female attendant opened up the premises at 5.30 am ready for a 6 am start. The offenders drove the stolen red Laser to the premises. She told the offenders that the shop did not open until six but as she used her key to enter, one or other of the offenders put his hand on her back and told her that it was a hold-up and demanded that she get onto the floor. He was holding a knife. The offenders dragged her up to her feet and forced her to open the cash register. They took money, cigarettes and phone cards as a result of this armed robbery. The sum of about $180 in cash, $2,000 worth of cigarettes and phone cards and other mobile phone kits worth about $100 were stolen as a result of the robbery. 
     
      
    30 At the time of his arrest on 27 July 2000 the applicant was living in a hotel at Lidcombe. The police attended there, making inquiries in relation to a string of service station robberies at the time. They approached the applicant on a landing near a room in that hotel. He struggled with them. He is said to have struggled violently by thrashing his arms and legs and attempting to strike police during the struggle. His actions in resisting that arrest gave rise to the last two offences on the Form 1 in relation to the indictment against the applicant alone. The applicant declined to participate in a record of interview and was remanded in custody with bail refused. 
     
      
    31 The sentencing Judge observed that the jointly committed offences by the two offenders were aggravated by the fact that they were committed in company. That made them more serious examples of armed robberies. Further, so far as the applicant was concerned, all of the jointly committed offences and counts 3 and 4 in the February 2002 indictment were committed either while he was on bail or after a warrant had been issued after he failed to attend the District Court for sentence.  
     
      
    32 The sentencing Judge said that it was clear that all the offences were serious offences committed on vulnerable workers, usually in the early morning when the service stations or convenience stores were about to open. While it was submitted that relatively small amounts of property were stolen her Honour did not accept that. Where the Crown had provided the Court with information about the quantity or value of stolen goods it appeared that considerable quantities of cigarettes and on many occasions mobile phone cards had been stolen. In relation to one of the offences, cigarettes worth about $10,000 and mobile phone cards worth anything between $6,000 and $30,000 were stolen. There were also quantities of cash stolen. In some offences these were relatively small quantities but overall it seemed to the sentencing Judge that considerable amounts of property were stolen.  
     
      
    33 On all occasions the victims were put in fear, having knives or bars forced into their backs, being forced to the ground, being threatened and being led into store rooms and the like. The sentencing Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “These people, working as console operators and attendants, were usually young. They were all working alone and they were all of them doing no more than trying to earn a living honestly doing a job which, no doubt, most of us would find unpalatable and which, presumably, is not particularly well paid. The community expects to be able to attend these services stations and convenience stores at all hours of the day and night but expects to be able to do so safely, without risk that they will interrupt such an armed robbery. Further, it seems to me that people who work in these jobs so that the community can have this convenience, ought to be entitled to expect that they will do so without the risk of being threatened, intimidated and even physically harmed or even killed by people such as these [offenders]. The sentences imposed for such offences should send a strong message that armed robbery offences such as these will be punished severely by the courts.” 
        
       
      
    34 Clearly these remarks made by her Honour were appropriate. Severe punishment was called for for the offences in question. Her Honour turned to the factors to be taken into account by way of subjective circumstances and otherwise. She started with the jointly charged matters where late pleas of guilty were entered on the day of trial, though possibly indicated during the preceding week. She acknowledged that they had a utilitarian value nonetheless because the trial was to last three weeks. Moreover, the Crown conceded that it did not have a particularly strong case against either offender particularly Chahrouk. Her Honour considered that the combination of the utilitarian value of the plea, albeit late, and the recognition of the relative weakness of the Crown case gave rise to a discount but no more than a range of between 10 and 15 per cent. Her Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the other matters for which I am sentencing Mr Trad, as I have said, they were before the court originally by way of 51A pleas and are thus entered earlier. They are for that alone entitled to a discount. They are both, however, stronger cases against Mr Trad with identification evidence available from surveillance videos and some other evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        Further, as to all four offences, they only come to be sentenced now after the prisoner has been brought back into custody in July 2000 on warrants after having failed to appear for sentence at the District Court. There has been a considerable delay in sentencing the prisoner in relation to these earlier offences, in part occasioned by the prisoner’s desire to have matters sentenced together following his arrest for the subsequent nine armed robberies and pleas of guilty on the day of his trial. For these reason, it seems to me, that the pleas of guilty in those cases, although early and originally pursuant to s51A of the Justices Act and therefore whilst attracting a discount for their utilitarian value and timing, also only attract a discount in the range of ten to fifteen per cent.” 
        
       
      
    35 Her Honour acknowledged that the applicant at the time of sentencing was twenty-two and had been nineteen or twenty at the time he committed the offences. She regarded his criminal history as of little significance or relevance when sentencing him for the offences. She remarked only that they were not his first offence and it was not the first time he had been before a court. She accepted that all offences were committed by him to fund his addiction to illegal drugs and that more probably than not he was actually drug-affected when committing most of them. There had been several pre-sentence reports prepared. One prepared in October 1999 following his arrest for the first two matters indicated a degree of hope for him. Efforts were made to place him in a drug rehabilitation unit but unfortunately he discharged himself from that course. He did not take advantage of assistance and supervision being offered by the probation and parole service and his family and ultimately failed to appear.  
     
      
    36 The applicant had had a good upbringing although marred by the death of his mother when he was only a few months old. He was well raised by his father, paternal grandmother and older brother. Unfortunately he began to associate with a poor peer group after he left home at about eighteen. He started to use illicit drugs. His family tried to help him to overcome this drug addiction but were unable to do so because he was not prepared to take advantage of their assistance. 
     
      
    37 After leaving school in Year 10 the applicant worked as an apprentice mechanic for about two years and then started a lawn mowing business, which lasted for only a few weeks. He did various other jobs for several weeks at a time, which more often than not came to an end because of his drug use. This started with smoking cannabis at about sixteen years of age. He then started to smoke heroin. His family arranged for him to attend rehabilitation programmes at both the William Booth Centre and Odyssey House, both of which he left after staying only a day. When a little older he started to inject heroin. Up to the time he was arrested for the offences he had taken no real steps to overcome his addiction to drugs even though assistance was being provided by his family. Even during the initial period of his imprisonment the trial Judge accepted that the applicant had not committed himself to overcoming his addiction to drugs and did not indicate any genuine remorse and contrition in relation to the commission of the offences.  
     
      
    38 However Judge Tupman accepted that over time that had changed. She found that in more recent times he had taken positive steps towards his rehabilitation. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He is attending Narcotics Anonymous in gaol. I accept that he has withdrawn from using heroin after going into custody and is taking advantage of those courses that have been available to him as a remand prisoner following his arrest in July 2000. His family has remained supportive. He also now has the benefit of a supportive relationship with a young woman who was a friend as a child but who distanced herself from [him] when he started to use drugs. She has re-established contact and been to visit him in gaol. She has apparently agreed to marry him on his release. She was an impressive witness who was not herself involved in any illegal activities nor drug activities. I accept that she too will operate as a positive rehabilitative factor.” 
        
       
      
    39 The sentencing Judge regarded the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation as relatively good and accepted that he was currently well motivated towards rehabilitation. However, this was entirely dependant on his remaining free of illegal drugs. The Judge sounded a note of caution surrounding his prospects of rehabilitation given the opportunities that he had taken and failed to use properly in the past. She observed that this was his first gaol term. He was young and it would be a gaol term for a relatively lengthy period. She accepted that as a result the applicant would need assistance both whilst in gaol to overcome his drug addiction and would also need a relatively lengthy period of supervision in the community on this release with particular attention to his drug addiction. Her Honour took into account the psychiatric opinion that he suffered from depression and drug dependency which were said both to be in remission. These matters would also need to be addressed by way of supervision and counselling on his release from custody. 
     
      
    40 Taking into account what had been said in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 380 and following and the circumstances surrounding the applicant and the offences her Honour concluded that the appropriate overall penalty of imprisonment would be about three years for the first two offences committed in 1999, within increasingly lengthier sentences for each of the following seven offences, particularly so for the aggravated armed robbery offence committed on 23 March 2000 and the offence count 4 for which the additional four armed robberies were to be taken into account. 
     
      
    41 The sentencing Judge said that there must also be taken into account the circumstances of aggravation relating to the applicant, even with his lesser previous criminal record, lack of previous imprisonment and relative youth. She observed that the applicant could face accumulated sentences of over forty years with a non-parole period of over thirty years. Such a sentence would of course be excessive in the circumstances. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “For Mr Trad, however, it seems to me that the total criminality, taking into account his own circumstances, should reflect in an overall term of imprisonment of twelve years with a non-parole period of eight. … It seems to me at the end of the day in relation to the prisoner Mr Trad that anything less than a non-parole period of eight years in totality would not reflect the objective seriousness of committing thirteen armed robbery offences over a period to two years.” 
        
       
      
    42 Her Honour went on to find that there were special circumstances for adjusting the non-parole period, namely the fact that this was his first gaol term, his youth, the need for a lengthy period of supervision in the community and the fact of accumulation to other terms. On this basis her Honour imposed the sentences that I have already set out. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    43 By his submissions, the applicant accepted that there was no doubt that the number and nature of the offences required condign punishment. There were two grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      A. Her Honour took irrelevant material into account in determining the quantum of the discount to be applied because of the pleas of guilty. 
       
       
      B. The aggregate of the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    44 It was submitted that the proceeds from each of the offences were relatively “modest” amounts of cash, cigarettes and other items usually stocked by those businesses. Her Honour did not so regard them, nor would I. No complaint was made, however, about her Honour’s assessment of the offences. They were, individually and collectively, very serious. It was conceded that the sentencing Judge’s treatment of the subjective material was unexceptional and no complaint was made. So far as the discount for the joint offences it was conceded that 10 to 15 per cent was within the sentencing Judge’s discretion. 
     
      
    45 Ground A was directed to the passage quoted in para 34 above which led her Honour to apply a discount in the range of 10 to 15 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas to the four offences in the 1 February 2002 indictment. Her Honour was said to have conflated two quite distinct principles and this gave rise to error. In that passage her Honour had said that the matters were to be treated as being before the court originally by way of the s51A pleas. For that alone they were entitled to a discount on the basis of her Honour’s acceptance that each of the pleas had been entered at the earliest opportunity. This accords with what was said by Spigelman CJ in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 in a judgment with which the other four members of this Court agreed. At 411-2 Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “115 There is considerable force in the proposition that the combination of utilitarian elements with remorse and witness vulnerability involves the addition of incommensurable factors. The benefits to the criminal justice system as a whole, which flows [sic] from a plea of guilty, particularly an early plea of guilty, are not related to the circumstances of the offence or to the conduct of the offender. Such benefits flow from an act by the offender that is not directly related to any of the multifarious objectives designed to be served by the sentencing process: deterrence, rehabilitation, punishment, etc. Rather, they are a collateral benefits [sic] for the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system as a whole, which require acknowledgement of some character by way of an incentive, so that the benefits will in fact be derived by the system. 
        
       
       
        
        116 The element of remorse which is said to be reflected in a guilty plea and the benefits to witnesses, particularly victims, are of a different quality. Remorse is directly concerned with the circumstances of the offender and may have significant implications for other objectives of the sentencing process. First, genuine remorse would indicate that the element of personal deterrence does not need to be given weight in the particular case. Secondly, it indicates that the prospects of rehabilitation are good. These are sentencing matters pertaining to the individual case, not advantages to the administration of criminal justice.” 
        
       
      
    46 A little later at 412 (para 122) his Honour observed that the public interest served by encouraging pleas of guilty for their utilitarian value was a distinct interest. 
     
      
    47 At 414 (para 131) the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Every part of the complex web of interconnected participants which comprises the criminal justice system will be improved if a greater number of early pleas could be achieved. The benefits include: 
        
       
      
    · Reduce congestion in court lists and permit courts to plan the use of limited resources without overlisting and avoiding the waste of trial court time. 
     
      
    · Reduce the waste of the limited resources available to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Public Defender and legal aid, both by the direct saving of time spent on preparing cases that do not proceed and by the indirect saving of reducing the number of cases not reached due to overlisting. 
     
      
    · Reduce the waste of time of witnesses, amongst whom police constitute the largest single category, in preparing to give evidence and, in many cases, appearing on the day of trial. 
     
      
    · Reduce the waste of time of jurors who are needlessly assembled for trial.” 
     
      
    48 At 416, para 137 the Chief Justice referred to what Hunt CJ at CL said in Winchester v The Queen (1992) 58 A Crim R 345 in relating the strength of the Crown case only to the contrition element of the leniency in sentencing which a plea of guilty affords an accused. Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion his Honour was correct to link the question of the strength of the Crown case only to the issue of contrition or remorse. A ‘recognition of the inevitable’ may qualify the extent of genuine contrition. It does not qualify the utilitarian value of a plea.” 
        
       
      
    49 Having reviewed the extent of discount allowed in cases in New Zealand and other States, the Chief Justice at 418, para 150, said that all these cases referred to a discount that did not involve any separation of utilitarian benefits from other considerations. In his Honour’s opinion, the appropriate range for discount for the utilitarian benefit was from 10 to 25 per cent. There were, however, two circumstances which would generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
        
       
       
        
        The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, for example, on the date fixed for trial unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial. (418 paras 154-5) 
        
       
      
    50 The Chief Justice acknowledged, at 418, para 157, that there are circumstances in which the protection of the public requires a long sentence to be imposed so that no discount for the plea is appropriate. In concluding his judgment at 419, para 160, the Chief Justice remarked that the primary consideration in determining where in the range of discounts for utilitarian value the particular case should fall was the timing of the plea. 
     
      
    51 In that part of the remarks on sentence of which the applicant complains, her Honour, having referred to the pleas being entered at the earliest opportunity, went on immediately to remark that by contrast with the counts in the later indictment the cases in the 1 February 2002 indictment were stronger cases against the applicant.  
     
      
    52 The applicant was positively identified from surveillance videos in relation to three of the four counts. In relation to the fourth the applicant’s fingerprint was located at the crime scene and clothing was found at his residence that had been worn by the offender. On the authority of Winchester, to which I have referred, and R v Thomson, this was not a consideration that should have been linked to the utilitarian discount.  
     
      
    53 The next part of the remarks on sentence challenged referred to the four offences coming to be sentenced “after the prisoner has been brought back into custody in July 2000 on warrants after having failed to appear for sentence at the District Court”. This is a reference, albeit oblique, to the facts that after pleading guilty to the first two offences on 1 September 1999 and having been committed for sentence with bail granted, the applicant absconded, failed to appear for sentence on 20 March 2000 and was finally arrested on a warrant with some resistance on 27 July 2000. During that intervening period he committed the remaining offences on the two indictments and the offences he asked to have taken into account.  
     
      
    54 Judge Tupman next said that there had been a considerable delay in sentencing the prisoner in relation to the earlier offences, in particular occasioned by the prisoner’s desire to have matters sentenced together following his arrest for the subsequent nine armed robberies and pleas of guilty on the day of his trial. As was pointed out in argument, that was irrelevant to any utilitarian discount and to the extent that it had any relevance it would entitle the applicant to a degree of leniency; Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 and R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 (31 August 1999) particularly at para 19. Thus, from saying that for the early pleas alone the applicant was entitled to a discount, Judge Tupman had gone on to refer to the strength of the Crown case, to the delay caused by the applicant absconding and to the considerable delay flowing from the applicant’s desire to have all the matters sentenced together. Having done this, her Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “For these reasons, it seems to me, that the pleas of guilty in those cases, although earlier and originally pursuant to s51A of the  
        Justices Act 
         and therefore whilst attracting a discount for their utilitarian value and timing, also only attract a discount in the range of ten to fifteen per cent.” 
        
       
      
    55 The first and third of the three topics referred to in this passage are irrelevant to the utilitarian discount and should not have been taken into account. To the extent that the sentencing Judge took them into account she erred and I must consider whether some other sentence less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed; s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. I shall come back to the second topic. It is convenient to deal with this after referring to ground B of the appeal. 
     
      
    56 As to ground B of the appeal, the objective seriousness of the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced is quite obvious from the brief account her Honour gave of them. Her Honour gave careful reasons for the sentences she imposed. In particular, she said that in her mind the total criminality taking into account the applicant’s own circumstances should reflect in an overall term of imprisonment of twelve years with a non-parole period of eight. In my opinion, it is impossible to suggest that this total sentence was beyond the range. As her Honour said, a non-parole period less than eight years in totality would not reflect the objective seriousness of committing thirteen armed robbery offences over a period of two years. In fixing the non-parole period, her Honour bore in mind that it was the applicant’s first gaol term, his youth, the need for a lengthy period of supervision in the community and the fact of accumulation to other terms.  
     
      
    57 The central point of the application is that in fixing the sentences for the 1 February 2002 indictment her Honour should have allowed a discount for utilitarian value of 25 per cent. In particular, since all the sentences were fixed sentences this would have a consequence in terms both of the total term on both indictments and the non-parole period of eight years. In my opinion, there are good reasons why this adjustment should not be made. 
     
      
    58 Account must be taken of the disruption to the court process and to the administration of law caused by the applicant’s absconding. It is true that an occurrence such as the present one is not mentioned in R v Thomson as part of the complex web of interconnected participants which comprises the criminal justice system. That is not surprising. In the passage in R v Thomson that I have quoted, the Chief Justice referred, amongst the benefits to be achieved by early pleas, to the reduction of the waste of the limited resources available to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Public Defender and Legal Aid and of the waste of time of witnesses including police witnesses. A discount of 25 per cent is not appropriate where, after pleading guilty, the offender absconds and fails to attend on the date set aside for sentencing. The court time wasted and inconvenience of setting in train the process of arresting the applicant, not to mention the waste in the abortive attempt to arrange some rehabilitation process, are factors which must be weighed in determining what the discount should be. 
     
      
    59 Putting aside any consideration of the strength of the Crown case and of the delays in sentencing when determining the utilitarian discount and bearing in mind the time at which the pleas of guilty were entered and the disruption and inconvenience caused by the offender’s absconding, a utilitarian discount of 10 to 15 per cent was appropriate. In my opinion, the individual sentences imposed and the resultant total sentence and non-parole period her Honour set were warranted in law. No lesser sentences should have been passed. 
     
      
    60 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     REGINA v DUNN 
     
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
       
      The respondent to this appeal was tried in the District Court on four charges: (a) two charges under ss 97(1), 117 and 154A of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900, arising out of offences committed on 17 May 2000; (b) two charges under ss 5(1) and 51(1A) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       1996, arising out of events which took place between 17 and 23 September 2001. 
       
       
      He was sentenced on 27 September 2002. In respect of the May 2000 offences there was imposed a head sentence of 3 years 9 months; in respect of the September 2001 offences, a head sentence of 6 years. 
       
       
      The Crown appealed against these sentences pursuant to s 53 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912. 
       
       
       
      HELD  
      per 
       Meagher JA (Dowd and Barr JJ agreeing):  
      
    i. The sentences imposed by the trial judge were inadequate, despite the fact that his Honour made no error of fact or law.ii. The result is so offensive to one’s sense of appropriateness, so little calculated to deter the proliferation of such crimes, and so inexplicable, that the sentences should be set aside. 
     
      
       
      HELD  
      per 
       Barr J: 
       
        
        The principles enunciated in  
        R v Scognamiglio 
         (1991) 56 A Crim R 81 and  
        R v Letteri  
        (NSWCCA 18 March 1992, unreported), relevant to the sentencing of persons suffering from mental illness or severe intellectual deficit, are not applicable to impulsive and reckless people of average intelligence. As a general rule, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is not a condition which attracts the operation of those principles. 
        
       
       
      ORDERS 
      
    i. In respect of the May 2000 offences, the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge should be set aside, and replaced by an order of imprisonment for a term of 5 years, commencing on 21 July 2001 and expiring on 20 July 2006; 
     
      
    ii. The learned trial judge’s sentences on the September 2001 firearms charges should be set aside and there should be substituted the following:– 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) On the s 51(1A) offence, 7 years imprisonment commencing on 21 July 2004 and expiring on 20 July 2011, with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months commencing on 21 July 2004 and expiring on 20 April 2008, on which date he will be eligible for release on parole. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) On the s 51(1) offence, 2 years 3 months imprisonment commencing on 21 July 2004 and expiring on 20 October 2006. There will be no non-parole period because of the previous sentence.

     REGINA v DUNN 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MEAGHER JA: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to the provisions of s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the sentences imposed on Mr Dunn by his Honour Judge Nicholson SC at Parramatta District Court on 27 September 2002, on the grounds that the sentences are manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    2 The sentences relate to (1) two charges arising out of events of 17 May 2000, under ss 97(1), 117 and 154A of the Crimes Act 1900, and (2) two charges arising out of events which took place between 17 and 23 September 2001 under ss 51(1) and 51(1A) of the Firearms Act 1996. 
     
      
    3 Dispensing with unnecessary detail, the sentences imposed by his Honour were as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. In respect of the May 2000 offences, his Honour imposed a sentence for a term of 3 years 9 months commencing on 21 July 2001 and expiring on 20 April 2005, with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 21 July 2001 and expiring on 20 July 2003; 
       
       
      2. In respect of the two September 2001 offences, a sentence was imposed for the s 51(1A) offence of a term of imprisonment for six years commencing on 21 July 2003 and expiring on 20 July 2009, with a non-parole period of three years commencing on 21 July 2003 and expiring on 20 July 2006, and for the s 51(1) offence for a term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 21 July 2003 and expiring on 20 October 2005. 
       
      
    4 The facts surrounding the May 2000 offences were that between about 1.30pm and 4.00pm on 17 May 2000 the motorcar (a Nissan 200sx sedan) of one Misha Charett, worth about $25,000, was stolen by Mr Dunn from where it was parked at Royal North Shore Hospital. When recovered its front and back panels, and its steering column, were damaged. It was used by Mr Dunn and a group of his friends for the purposes of a bank robbery. They reversed the car into the doors of the Kings Park Branch of the National Australia Bank, which at the time was closed and in which tellers were balancing cash totals for the day. Mr Dunn, dressed in a white sloppy joe pulled up so as to conceal his face and armed with a tyre lever, and accompanied by his friends wearing balaclavas and (mostly) latex gloves, burst into the Bank room. One of them yelled out “Get down to the ground”; the tellers hid under their desks; one of the men demanded that the Bank safe be opened, and tried to open it; altogether the men took nearly $40,000 in cash from one of the tellers’ drawers and shoved it into a backpack. The damage done to the Bank was about $3,000. 
     
      
    5 One of the latex gloves used by the gang was found, and it bore Mr Dunn’s fingerprints. 
     
      
    6 He was twenty years old at the time, and had spent many of those years in criminal activities. 
     
      
    7 He had taken part in planning what was clearly a carefully planned operation. He had supplied gloves and a tyre lever. 
     
      
    8 Although he might have expressed contrition in a perfunctory way to a social worker, he never did anything about it as far as his victims were concerned. 
     
      
    9 His share of the proceeds was $3,500. He did not need that, or any, money. Poverty was not one of his problems. He used it, in an eighteenth century manner, on clothes and “clubbing”. 
     
      
    10 He was an Aborigine, but that seems to have nothing to do with the crime. 
     
      
    11 His childhood was not particularly unhappy. 
     
      
    12 At the time he was subject, at least nominally, to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service, following his release to a supervised Juvenile Probation Order after a previous break, enter and steal. He was, therefore, at conditional liberty. 
     
      
    13 One of the social workers discovered that he was afflicted with the currently fashionable Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, although its existence had been successfully concealed from everyone else who had had anything to do with him. His Honour found that this malady had nothing to do with the commission of either the May 2000 offences or the September 2001 offences. It is, therefore, in my opinion, irrelevant in this appeal. 
     
      
    14 He had the beginnings of an alcohol problem, and was not entirely unacquainted with drugs, but these factors were likewise immaterial. 
     
      
    15 In due course, he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    16 The brute facts, therefore, are that Mr Dunn deliberately planned and committed an appalling robbery, with no subjective factors exonerating him or diminishing his culpability; he did it in company, and he did it whilst armed; the offence itself was one of violence. Its effect on the unfortunate bank tellers can only be imagined. The amount of money stolen was not exiguous. To impose a non-parole period of two years, and a head sentence of less than four years, is, in my opinion, ridiculous. 
     
      
    17 His Honour did not make any mistake of fact or law. Despite this fact, and despite the reluctance which we must exhibit in disturbing a trial judge’s findings; despite considerations of double jeopardy; and despite the supposed principle that Crown appeals should be instituted but rarely, the result is so offensive to one’s sense of appropriateness, so little calculated to deter the proliferation of such crimes, and so inexplicable, that in my view it should be set aside and replaced by an order of imprisonment for a term of five years, commencing on 21 July 2001 and expiring on 20 July 2006. In this respect we should take into account under s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 Mr Dunn’s theft of the motor vehicle. 
     
      
    18 Matters do not improve when one comes to the events of September 2001. In that month Mr Dunn, then on bail, participated in a transaction of sale of firearms. The vendor seems to have been a Mr Sheehan, who operated through an agent, a disgraced prison officer called Archer. The purchaser was apparently a Mr El Saadi, who operated either on his own behalf or through an agent called Mohamed. Mr Dunn was the broker in the transaction, apparently assisted by one of his brothers-in-law called Robson. Most of these figures are shadowy, and seem to have faded into the mists. 
     
      
    19 The circumstances surrounding the transaction are obscure. One does not know how, where or why the firearms were sold, but one might be forgiven for speculating that the purposes were hardly likely to be benign or the participants to be savoury. 
     
      
    20 Mr Dunn, needless to say, had no license or permit to deal in any of the guns; and many of the guns were prohibited weapons. Some had their serial numbers obliterated. Forty weapons in all were detected; one cannot but wonder what sales went undetected. The total sale price seems to have been about $40,000. The weapons included two Baikal guns, one of them a 12 gauge double barrelled shotgun, four Lithgow repeating rifles, one Mauser repeating rifle, one New England firearm rifle, one BSA rifle and one Zado Crvena Zastava rifle. 
     
      
    21 The number and quality of the firearms are truly alarming. The remarks which I have already made about the inadequacy of his Honour’s treatment of the May 2000 offences, apply (perhaps with added force) to the September 2001 offences. 
     
      
    22 In my view his Honour’s sentences on the firearms charges should be set aside and there should be substituted the following:– 
     
      
       
        
        (a) On the s 51(1A) offence, 7 years imprisonment commencing on 21 July 2004 and expiring on 20 July 2011, with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months commencing on 21 July 2004 and expiring on 20 April 2008, on which date he will be eligible for release on parole. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) On the s 51(1) offence, 2 years 3 months imprisonment commencing on 21 July 2004 and expiring on 20 October 2006. There will be no non-parole period because of the previous sentence. 
        
       
      
    23 The intention of the Court is to substitute an overall head sentence of 10 years and an overall non-parole period of 6 years 9 months. The circumstances justifying a non-parole period, which is less than three-quarters of the term of its sentence are the accumulation of sentences and the need of the respondent for an extended period of parole. 
     
      
    24 DOWD J: I agree with Meagher JA and Barr J. 
     
      
    25 BARR J: I agree generally for the reasons given by Meagher JA that the Crown appeal should be allowed and that the respondent should be resentenced in the manner proposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    26 The sentencing judge found that the respondent’s condition, called Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, had no connection with his offences but took it into account in sentencing under a principle by which offenders suffering from mental illness or having severe intellectual deficit are not suitable persons to be made media for example to others. R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81; R v Letteri (Court of Criminal Appeal, New South Wales, 18 March 1992, unreported). So his Honour reasoned that general deterrence was to be given less weight in sentencing the respondent. 
     
      
    27 There was before his Honour a report of a psychologist, Anna Robilliard, which showed that the respondent had been shown at school to be dyslexic and that he suffered from the condition described as Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity. The principal features of that condition were that he was impulsive and restless. He was of about average intelligence. 
     
      
    28 It does not seem to me that impulsive and reckless people who are of about average intelligence fall into the category of persons contemplated by the principle I have mentioned. In making an allowance his Honour relied on the authority of R v Murchie [1999] NSWCCA 424, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal constituted by two judges. Judgments of benches so constituted do not promulgate new matters of principle. I would not regard R v Murchie as authority that as a general rule Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a condition which attracts the principle contended for. I do not think that the respondent was entitled to any mitigation of sentence because of his condition.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment prepared by O’Keefe J with the result of which I agree. On one matter I wish to make some further observations. His Honour has explained that by operation of s34 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 it was open to the sentencing Judge to consider whether as an ancillary order the disqualification period prescribed by s25(2)(d) of the Road Transport (General) Act 1999 (the General Act) should be reduced or extended. I agree with O’Keefe J that the sentencing Judge ordered lifetime disqualification.  
     
      
    2 Section 24(1) of the General Act provides, so far as presently relevant, that subject to s25 of the General Act a Court that convicts a person of an offence under the Road Transport legislation, which includes the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 and the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (s5 of the General Act), may, at the time of the conviction, order the disqualification of the person from holding a driver licence for such period as the Court specifies. The only limitations that s25(2) of the General Act prescribes for the period of the disqualification are on the imposition of a shorter period than the prescribed period of automatic disqualification. Thus, in subs (2)(d) the automatic disqualification is for three years. The Court may order a shorter period “but not shorter than twelve months”. Alternatively, the Court may order a longer period of disqualification. But no statutory limitation is placed on that. As a matter of language it appears to be left entirely to the discretion of the Court, properly exercised, to determine what the longer period of disqualification should be and whether it be measured by calendar periods of time, such as months or years, or otherwise. The word “period” is indefinite and does not indicate how in the particular case it is to be determined. If the expression “longer period of disqualification” stood alone unqualified in s25(2), for reasons such as those given in R v Wallace [1955] NI 137, which O’Keefe J has cited, and bearing in mind the consequences of fettering an expression which in other legislation is regarded as unfettered (compare R v Jolly (1993) 70 A Crim R 527 which O’Keefe J has also cited), I would hold that the Act did permit the Court to order a lifetime period of disqualification. 
     
      
    3 I should observe in passing and with due respect that the conclusion in Ex parte Thomas; Re Arnold (1966) 84 WN (Part 1) NSW 493 at 496 is for textual reasons distinguishable from this case.  
     
      
    4 Section 30 of the General Act deals with the period of disqualification of habitual traffic offenders. Subsection (1) provides that if a person is declared by s28 to be an habitual traffic offender the person is disqualified by the declaration for a period of five years from holding a driver licence except as provided by Div 4. Subsection (2) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the Court that convicts the person of the offence giving rise to the declaration thinks fit, the Court may order a longer period of disqualification (including disqualification for life).” 
        
       
      
    5 If the expression “a longer period of disqualification” in s25 enables the Court to order lifetime disqualification arguably the words in parenthesis in s30(2) might be regarded as otiose but intended to avoid possible uncertainty; compare Corporate Affairs Commission (SA) v Australian Central Credit Union (1985) 157 CLR 201 at 207. However, ordinarily inclusive words are regarded as intended to enlarge the ordinary meaning of the word or phrase they qualify; see Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 5th ed, para 6.56; Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1977) VR 342 at 353. Their presence suggests that the legislature intended that the expression “a longer period of disqualification” when unqualified did not include disqualification for life. In short, the legislature intended that the power to order disqualification for life should be limited to the situation where a Court convicts a person of an offence in circumstances where that person is declared to be an habitual traffic offender. Only in those limited circumstances does such power exist. The structure of the legislation and the special attention given to habitual traffic offenders supports what the legislature must have considered to be a distinct and exclusive grant of power to order disqualification for life. Accordingly, in my opinion, by imposing a disqualification for life his Honour Judge Urquhart QC acted beyond power.  
     
      
    6 Otherwise for the reasons O’Keefe J has given I agree with the conclusion he has reached. 
     
      
    7 JAMES J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of O’Keefe J and Sheller JA. I agree with the orders proposed by O’Keefe J and generally with his Honour’s reasons. As to the purported disqualification of the applicant from holding a driver licence for life, I agree with the conclusion that s 25(2)(d)(ii) of the Road Transport (General) Act does not authorise a court to disqualify a person from holding a driver licence for the period of the rest of the person’s life but I would base this conclusion, at least primarily, on the inference which I consider can be drawn, in interpreting s 25(2)(d)(ii), from the provisions of Div 4 of Pt 3 of the Act dealing with habitual traffic offenders and especially s 30(2). 
     
      
    8 O’KEEFE J:  
     
      
       
      INTRODUCTION 
       
      
    9 This is an application by Ricky Gardner (the applicant) for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 16 August 2002 in respect of offences committed on 27 December 2001 at Forster. The applicant was born on 14 August 1978.  
     
      
    10 The applicant pleaded guilty before a Magistrate at the Taree Local Court on 19 March 2002 to the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Assault with intent to rob whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a shortened .22 calibre rifle, in contravention of s 97(2) of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 (the Act), for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. 
         
         
        (ii) Robbery whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a sawn off .22 calibre rifle, contrary to the provisions of the same section of the Act. 
        
       
      
    11 The applicant also admitted to the commission of eight offences which were set out on a Form 1, and which he asked to be taken into account by the court when dealing with him for the offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. The eight offences set out in the Form 1 document were: 
     
      
       
       (i) assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 17 September 2001; 
       
        
         
        (ii) take and drive conveyance without consent of the owner on 27 December 2001; 
         
         
        (iii) assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 3 January 2002; 
         
         
        (iv) assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 3 January 2002; 
         
         
        (v) drive in a manner dangerous on 4 January 2002; 
         
         
        (vi) drive whilst unlicensed on 4 January 2002; 
         
         
        (vii) assault police officer on 4 January 2002; 
         
         
        (viii) escape from lawful custody on 4 January 2002. 
        
       
      
    12 In the District Court, the applicant adhered to his pleas and the Judge sentenced him to:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) six years imprisonment commencing on 4 January 2002 with a non-parole period of three years and nine months, expiring on 31 October 2005 in respect of the offence referred to in paragraph 10(i) above; 
         
         
        (b) eight years imprisonment commencing on 4 January 2002 with a non-parole period of five years to expire on 3 January 2007 in respect of the offence referred to in paragraph 10(ii) above.  
        
       
       
      As is apparent, the two sentences were concurrent. However in respect of the driving offence referred to in paragraph 11(v) above included on the Form 1, the applicant was disqualified from holding a licence so as “never to be issued with a licence to drive any motor vehicle”. 
       
      
    13 The applicant has sought leave to appeal on two grounds, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) in imposing the sentences, the Judge erred in failing to adequately discount the applicant’s sentence as a result of the applicant’s pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities; 
         
         
        (2) the Judge erred in ordering that the applicant be disqualified from driving so that he is never to be issued with a licence to drive any motor vehicle. 
        
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    14 On 26 December 2001 the applicant went to a home unit occupied by one David Rosser, an acquaintance of his, and a co-offender by the name of Fittler, who was a long-time friend of the applicant. The applicant asked Rosser if he could leave his bags there. This was agreed to and he then left the premises, intending to return about 8pm. He did so, and shortly thereafter Fittler arrived. The version of events advanced by Rosser and Fittler was that all three were drinking, and the applicant appeared hyperactive – perhaps under the influence of a drug. During the course of the evening, the applicant took a sawn off .22 rifle out of one of his bags and a number of rounds of ammunition from another. Thereafter it is said that without warning he discharged first one bullet into the roof of the home unit and then, a short time later, a second bullet.  
     
      
    15 Between 12.30am and 1am on the morning of 27 December 2001, the applicant and his friend Fittler visited premises at Forster that were occupied by a Mr Hammer. One of the men spoke to Hammer and produced a gun which he pointed at Hammer’s face at a range of approximately 15cm (6 inches), asking “what drugs have you got?” Hammer took hold of the gun and pushed it downwards. The gun was discharged, the bullet lodging in a chair on the front veranda. After the gun had been discharged, the assailant turned and ran across the front lawn to the street. As Hammer was in the process of closing the window of the premises, he became aware of the presence of a second man. He emerged from the bushes in the front yard of the house and he too ran away, accompanying the man who was carrying the gun. Both men were seen heading in the general direction of McDonalds at Forster.  
     
      
    16 Subsequently, Hammer was shown a computer photo-board selection and identified Fittler as his assailant – ie, the man who had presented the gun at him and had discharged it. 
     
      
    17 Shortly after 1am on 27 December 2001, a young male employee at the McDonalds store in Forster was loading some boxes into his car in the delivery section of the store. As he was doing so he saw a male some five to eight meters away from him, moving in his direction. The man was carrying a gun. He pointed it at the employee, telling him to get down. The employee crouched down beside his car and the man, pointing the gun at the young employee’s head, pushed him to the ground. The armed man then attempted to close the rear door of the car, but was unable to do so because of the boxes that were in it. In order to overcome this problem, he threw the boxes out of the car, closed the rear door, got into the drivers’ seat and reversed the car into the drive-thru lane of the store. The armed assailant called out to the young employee: “Stay down, don’t fucking move, or someone will shoot you.” Needless to say, the young employee did as he was told. Later, he gave a description of his assailant to the police.  
     
      
    18 At about 1.10am, a 16 year old male employee of McDonalds, who was waiting at the front of the store to get a lift home from the employee referred to in paragraph 17 above, saw two men walk towards the McDonalds store. He gave a description of both. One of the men was carrying a gun. The adolescent employee was witness to the events involving the firstmentioned employee. The young employee, who was clearly terrified, went to ground and was not seen by the man with the gun. However he heard a man call out: “Don’t get up or I’ll shoot you!” and later: “Fuck’n move, you’re dead, cunt.”  
     
      
    19 On 28 December 2001, the young man saw one of the men he had seen on the night of the robbery. He identified the man as Fittler, and subsequently again identified him from computer photo-boards shown to him by police. 
     
      
    20 The manager of McDonalds, a female, saw the two men at a time when one of them was in the driving seat of the firstmentioned employee’s car. He was seen to urge his co-offender to get into the car. When he had done so the car was driven out of the premises and off down the road. The manager then discovered what had happened and called the police. She gave a good description of the man who had been driving the car and when, on 8 January 2002, she was shown a computer photo-board selection, she identified the driver of the car as the applicant.  
     
      
    21 On 27 December 2001 a number of items of property that had been in the firstmentioned employee’s car were pawned at Taree in the name of the applicant. 
     
      
    22 On 4 January 2002, the applicant was arrested and participated in a number of recorded interviews. Initially he maintained that he had participated in the attempted robbery of Hammer not knowing, until it was produced, that Fittler had a gun. However in a second interview he admitted to handling the gun, but denied that he had discharged it at Hammer’s house. In yet another interview, he gave yet another version of what had occurred at Hammer’s house, but he did acknowledge his involvement in the events at McDonalds, stating in the course of doing so that Fittler had also been involved. 
     
      
    23 The various offences on the Form 1 document are detailed in the Judge’s Remarks on Sentence. Those involving assaults occasioning actual bodily harm were quite serious. One involved a male; the others involved a female. The driving offences were extremely serious. Speeds of up to 120 km/h in an 80 km zone, and speeds of up to 160 km/h on the Pacific Highway were recorded. There was a good deal of traffic on the roads at the material times, and overtaking at high speed in restricted speed zones were features of the offences. In the end, however, the applicant was delayed by heavy traffic. He sought to avoid this by mounting the footpath and driving along it. However his progress was arrested by a telegraph pole, whereupon a number of police vehicles surrounded him, and he too was arrested and conveyed to the Forster Police Station. 
     
      
    24 The saga did not end on his arrival at the Police Station. There the applicant assaulted the Custody Manager, a Police Sergeant, then struggled violently, broke free, jumped the enquiry counter, and ran out of the Police Station. He was pursued by police through a carpark, over two fences, through a block of units and into a unit that was occupied by Fittler. A number of police came to the unit and the applicant was again arrested.  
     
      
    25 As can be seen from the foregoing, the offences included on the Form 1 document were serious in themselves and involved a significant threat to the lives and safety of innocent road users and pedestrians. When considered against the background of a record of serious traffic offences from February 1998, it is clear that a substantial period of disqualification from holding a driver’s licence would be appropriate, in addition to the imposition of the custodial sentences referred to above.  
     
      
       
      As to disqualification for life 
       
      
    26 One of the offences included on the Form 1 document was driving in a manner dangerous to the public, contrary to s 42(2) of the Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act 1999 (the Safety and Traffic Management Act). The maximum penalty for such an offence is 20 penalty units or imprisonment for nine months or both in the case of a first offence, or 30 penalty units or imprisonment for twelve months or both in the case of a second or subsequent offence. Another of the offences included on such form was driving whilst disqualified contrary to s 25A(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998 (the Driver Licensing Act). The penalty for this offence is 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 18 months or both in the case of a first offence, or 50 penalty units or imprisonment for two years or both in the case of a second or subsequent offence. In addition to any other penalty imposed, an automatic disqualification of licence is imposed for a period of 12 months for a first offence, and for two years in the case of a second or subsequent offence. Under the Driver Licensing Act a person convicted of driving whilst disqualified may have imposed upon him a disqualification “for such additional period as the court may order” (s 25A(7)(b)).  
     
      
    27 The Judge did not convict the applicant in respect of either of the offences referred to in paragraphs 11(v) and (vi) above, but stated in the last sentence in his Remarks on Sentence that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is so disqualified that he is never to be issued with a licence to drive any motor vehicle.”  
        
       
      
    28 This order was made presumably pursuant to s 34 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides that if a court takes a further offence into account under Division 3 of Part 3 of that Act “the court may make such ancillary orders as it could have made had it convicted the offender of the offence when it took the offence into account, but may not impose a separate penalty for the offence.” 
     
      
    29 Under s 25 of the Road Transport (General) Act 1999 (the General Act), provision is made for the disqualification of a person from holding a driver licence should that person be convicted of driving in a manner dangerous (s25(1)(c) and (2)(d)). The terms of the relevant penalty provision are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) the person is automatically disqualified for a period of three years from holding a driver licence; or 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) if the court that convicts the person thinks fit to order a shorter period (but not shorter than 12 months) or longer period of disqualification – the person is disqualified from holding a driver licence for such period as may be specified in the order.” 
        
       
      
    30 Two arguments were advanced on behalf of the applicant. The first was that the order made by the Judge should not be construed as an order disqualifying the applicant from holding a driver licence for life. This argument turned on the structure of the last sentence in the Remarks on Sentence. However the intent of the Judge is clear and, in my opinion, so too are his words. It was his intention to prevent the applicant from ever driving again. This is apparent from the passage in the Remarks on Sentence that precedes the order made, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider further that the offender should never, ever, have a licence to drive a motor vehicle, and, accordingly, I should impose a disqualification that brings that about.  
        
       
      
    31 The actual form of words used by the Judge when implementing his intention referred to the issuing of a licence, whereas the words of s 25(2)(d)(ii) of the General Act are words of disqualification, namely “order a … longer period of disqualification.” The words of s 25A(7) of the Driver Licencing Act also focus on disqualification. The words used are: “may also be disqualified for such additional period …” 
     
      
    32 Whilst both sections look at the imposition of a disqualification from the point of view of the convicted person, the effect is that such person may not lawfully obtain a licence during the period of disqualification. Furthermore, it is an offence for a person who has been disqualified to make an application for a driver licence during the period of disqualification and omit to mention the disqualification in such application (s 25A(1)(b) of Driver Licensing Act). 
     
      
    33 Whether one looks at the situation from the point of view of the convicted person or from the point of view of the licensing authority, the effect is that the person the subject of disqualification cannot lawfully obtain or be issued with a licence during the period of such disqualification.  
     
      
    34 In my opinion, the words used to convey the intent of the Judge – although not phrased in the precise words of the statutes – are nonetheless adequate to give rise to the applicant being disqualified from holding a licence for the term of his natural life, if this is within power. Accordingly, the first submission in support of this aspect of the applicant’s case fails. 
     
      
    35 The second argument advanced was that, even if the form of words used by the Judge was apt to convey an intent, and purport to have the effect of a lifetime disqualification, there was no power in the Court to impose such a disqualification.  
     
      
    36 The General Act, the Safety and Traffic Management Act and the Driver Licensing Act are all part of the road transport legislation of New South Wales, as that term is defined in s 5 of the General Act. Provision is made for road transport legislation to prevail over any other Act or statutory rule. The clear intent of the statutory scheme is that each of the Acts that forms part of such scheme should be construed so as to be in harmony with the other Acts.  
     
      
    37 The submission advanced on behalf of the applicant is that the word “period” as used in s 25(2)(d)(ii), and elsewhere where unqualified, in the General Act, has a finite connotation – that is, it connotes a duration that is specific in days, years or months. In such circumstances it is capable of being calculated, so that as at the date on which the event occurs, or the order is made, that gives rise to a disqualification, the actual date on which the disqualification will come to an end can be nominated. As a consequence, so the argument runs, it does not connote a duration that is indefinite i.e. which, although ascertainable at some time in the future, is not ascertainable at the time the disqualification commences. Thus, a disqualification for life is said to be outside the ambit of the statutory power conferred by s 25(1)(d) of the General Act.  
     
      
    38 The ambit of the power conferred by the relevant word and phrases used in the statute raises a question of construction, namely the meaning to be given to the word “period” and to the phrase “or longer period of disqualification” (in s 25(2)(d)(ii) of the General Act. The proper construction will depend on the ordinary English meaning of the word and phrase, and where there is more than one possible meaning or application of such word and phrase, on the legislative intent as revealed by the statutory context.  
     
      
    39 Ordinarily the word “period” connotes an interval, length, or portion of time (Barbaro v DPP (1999) 49 NSWLR 68 at 75; affirmed in this respect at (2001) 51 NSWLR 419). It is the measurement of that interval, length or portion of time that is the issue in the present case. Is that measurement to be such that the precise finishing date is ascertainable as at the date of commencement of the disqualification? Or does it include an interval, length or portion of time the duration of which can be measured by reference to a future event, the date of occurrence of which is uncertain? The answer will depend on the legislative intent to be ascertained from the context. In some contexts the word “period” may be construed so as to include an interval, length or portion of time that is measured by the life of a person. Thus in the field of property law a lease for life is a lease for a time certain. The same result may flow in relation to a statute that looks to a time certain (Regina v Tunde-Olarinde (1967) 2 All ER 491). On the other hand a lease “for the duration of the war,” as was not uncommon in some leases entered into in the early days of World War II was held not to be for a period certain. (Lace v Chantler (1944) 1 KB 369 at 371 per Lord Greene MR, with whom McKinnon and Luxmoore LJJ agreed; applied by Jacobs J in Re Lehrer and the Real Property Act (1961) SR (NSW) 365 at 377) The answer to the question of construction will depend on the word or phrase in the context of the statute in question. 40 Part 3 of the General Act deals, inter alia, with licence disqualification. Section 24 empowers the Court to impose penalties for a number of offences, and to impose a disqualification in respect of a conviction for an offence under the road transport legislation. The disqualification that may be imposed pursuant to s 24(1) is for “such period as the court specifies”. However s 24 is expressed to be subject to s 25 of the General Act, to s 40 of the Safety and Traffic Management Act and to ss 25 and 25A of the Driver Licensing Act. In this regard it should be noted that s 40 of the Safety and Traffic Management Act provides for automatic disqualification for 12 months of a person who takes part in, organises or promotes any race, or speed, or competitive trial without approval. A court is empowered by s 40(4)(b) of such Act to “order a shorter or longer period of disqualification” (s 40(4)(b)). The range of offences that falls within the ambit of s 24 of the General Act is wide, indeed wide enough to comprehend minor infringements of the road transport legislation. It would be curious if it were to be the intention of the legislature that the form of words in s 24 should be construed in such a way as to empower a court to impose a disqualification for life on a driver for a minor infringement of the road transport legislation.  
     
      
    41 Section 25 of the General Act deals with more serious offences. They are described as “major offences”. They include such serious offences as manslaughter arising out of the use of a motor vehicle, driving a motor vehicle negligently and occasioning death or grievous bodily harm, and driving a motor vehicle in a manner which is dangerous to the public (s 25(1)). A disqualification may be imposed on conviction for a major offence. The duration of such disqualification varies according to whether the person convicted has or has not been convicted of a previous major offence and the nature of the offence the subject of consideration. Where the convicted person has not been convicted of a previous major offence, the automatic disqualification is for periods of six months (s 25(2)(a)(i)), or 12 months (s 25(2)(b)(i)) or three years (s 25(2)(c)(i) and (2)(d)(i)) depending on the circumstances. The court is empowered to shorten those periods, but the extent of the shortening varies according to the nature of the offence.  
     
      
    42 No power is conferred by s 25(2)(a)(ii) to extend the duration of the disqualification. The phrase used in this subsection is: “is disqualified … for such period as may be specified in the order.” The word “period” in this subsection clearly has a finite connotation. It is the difference between the automatic disqualification of six months on the one hand, and the minimum period of disqualification of three months on the other. The same reasoning applies to the equivalent provisions in s 25(2)(b)(ii) and 25(2)(c)(ii). However, in both those subsections the court is also given power “to order a … longer period of disqualification”. It would not, in my opinion, be sensible to construe this provision in such a way as to give a finite connotation to the noun “period” when qualified by the adjective “shorter”, but not to do so in respect of the same noun in the same subsection when qualified by the adjective “longer”.  
     
      
    43 The provisions of s 25(2)(d)(ii) are in all material respects the same as those of the three preceding subparagraphs of subsection (2) of s 25. The usual rule of construction that should be applied in such circumstances is that expressed in Slazengers (Australia) Pty Ltd v Burnett (1951) AC 13 at 21, namely that it is improbable that the legislature would have intended different meanings to be given to the same word or phrase that is used in successive paragraphs of a particular piece of legislation. Registrar of Titles (WA) v Franzon (1976) 50 ALJR 4 is to a like effect. Mason J, with whom Barwick CJ and Jacobs J agreed, said : 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a sound rule of construction to give the same meaning to the same words appearing in different parts of a statute unless there is a reason to do otherwise” (at 6).  
        
       
       
      (see also  
      McLeish v FT Eastment & Sons Pty Limited  
      (1970) 71 SR (NSW) 178 at 180; Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes 12th Ed 278). Unless a court is forced to a different conclusion, it should give the same meaning to a word or phrase throughout a particular Act of Parliament ( 
      Ministry of Health v Fox  
      (1951) Ch 369);  
      Craig Williamson Pty Limited v Barrowcliff  
      (1915) VLR 450 at 452 per Hodges J). By parity of reasoning the employment of different language in the same Act tends to show that the legislature had in mind different outcomes ( 
      Scott v Commercial Hotel Merbein Pty Limited  
      (1930) VLR 25 at 30). 
       
      
    44 On such an approach to construction, the word “period” as used in s 25(2)(d)(ii) of the General Act would connote a finite time that is able to be calculated so that, at the time at which the disqualification takes effect, the date on which the disqualification is to come to an end is able to be determined. Such a construction would not include a disqualification for life. 
     
      
    45 Such a provisional conclusion can be tested against other provisions in the General Act and previous authority.  
     
      
    46 Division 4 of Part 3 of the General Act deals with habitual traffic offenders. It applies to “relevant offences” as defined. They are defined to include “a major traffic offence” (s 27(1)(a)(i)) as well as an offence under s 25A(1) of the Driver Licensing Act. Thus, one of the offences against the road transport legislation that was included on they Form 1 in the instant case was a relevant offence. The period of disqualification that may be imposed on an habitual traffic offender is prima facie five years. However the court is empowered to extend the duration of the disqualification. The words of empowerment are that “the court may order a longer period of disqualification (including disqualification for life)” (s 30(2)). However before a person can be declared to be an habitual traffic offender, so as to fall within the ambit of s 30(2), the procedures prescribed in Division 4 must be complied with. They include:  
     
      
       
        
        (i) conviction of a relevant offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) at least two other relevant offences having been committed on different occasions in the preceding five years; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) the receipt by the licence holder of a written warning that he or she is liable to be declared to be an habitual offender if convicted of another relevant offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) the declaration of such person as an habitual traffic offender.  
        
       
      
    47 The legislative regime that has been brought into existence as a precondition to the application of s 30(2), with its consequent possibility of disqualification for life, is to be contrasted with the provisions of s 25. It would be a curious construction of the General Act to regard the words “including disqualification for life” in s 30(2) as surplusage or inserted merely for more abundant caution, as would be the case if the phrase which those words qualify, namely “a longer period of disqualification”, already included a lifetime disqualification. The use of inclusive words in the parenthetical phrase in s 30(2) of the General Act would ordinarily be regarded as an indication of a legislative intent to extend the ordinary meaning of the words they qualify (Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1977) VR 342 at 353-354 per McInerney J; Pearce and Geddes Statutory Interpretation in Australia 5th ed 6.56). 
     
      
    48 The inclusion of the parenthetical phrase “including disqualification for life” in s 30(2), in my opinion, has such an effect in the legislative provision under consideration. The fact that it is different in form from s 25(2)(d)(ii), indicates that the legislature intended a different range of possible outcomes under s 30(2) on the one hand and s 25(2)(d)(ii) on the other – the former comprehending the possibility of a disqualification for life; the latter, not. 
     
      
    49 Thus, the contrast between the provisions of Division 3, and in particular s 25 on the one hand, with the provisions of Division 4,and in particular s 30(2) on the other, supports the provisional conclusion arrived at in paragraph 44 above. 
     
      
    50 On turning to authority, the provisional conclusion arrived at in paragraph 44 is, in my opinion, further reinforced. 
     
      
    51 In Ex parte Thomas re Arnold (1996) 84 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 493, the Court of Appeal considered a provision in the then Motor Traffic Act 1909–1937 that is cognate to the provisions presently under consideration. It is a statute in pari materia. Section 10(1)(c) of that Act provided that in the event of a conviction in particular circumstances, “the court may declare (the defendant) disqualified from obtaining a licence for such time as the court thinks fit.” The word “time” in such section was construed “so as to mean a finite period.” (supra at 496 per Wallace P, with whom Jacobs and Asprey JJA agreed). In arriving at this conclusion, the court was of the opinion that the word “time”, as used in a preceding subsection, was clearly directed at a finite time, and that in the light of Slazengers (Australia) Pty Ltd v Burnett (1951) AC 13 at 21 and the dictum of Wynn-Parry in Ministry of Health v Fox (1950) 1 Ch 369 and 378-379 the same meaning should be given to the same word in the subsection under consideration. Although the actual word used in that act and its statutory context were different from that presently under consideration, thus making the decision strictly distinguishable, it is in my opinion of some assistance in the present case in relation to the construction of the statutory provision under consideration. 
     
      
    52 Such an approach to construction gains support from Rex v Fowler (1937) 26 Cr App R 80. In that case, the appellant had been convicted of driving a motor vehicle when under the influence of alcohol contrary to s 51(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1930 (UK). A person who was convicted of an offence under that section was subject to a prima facie period of disqualification of 12 months. Such a disqualification was subject to a qualification as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise, and without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification.” 
        
       
       
      Thus, the section empowered the court to either shorten or extend the duration of the disqualification. Lewis J, with whom Branson and du Parcq agreed, held that there was no power conferred by the section to disqualify for an indefinite period (at 83-84).  
       
      
    53 The view expressed by the court in Rex v Fowler (supra) was echoed by Lord Parker CJ in Regina v Abbott (1964) 1 QB 489 in which he expressed the view that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court has had very grave doubts … whether … a sentence for life can properly be described as a period specified.” (at 494) 
        
       
      
    54 To the contrary is the decision in Regina v Wallace (1955) NIR 137 In that case the court considered certain motor vehicle legislation of Northern Ireland that empowered the court to disqualify a convicted person “for (sic) obtaining such licence for such further time after the expiration of the licence as the court thinks fit”. In overruling the decision of Lord Chief Justice Macdermott in the court below and declining to apply Regina v Fowler (supra), the court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We are of opinion that disqualification for the life of a person convicted is disqualification for a certain and definite period and is authorised by the section. This court would be slow to hold that the legislature intended that a disqualification for 60, 70 or 80 years could be imposed … but not disqualification for life.” 
        
       
       
      In its reasoning, the court made no reference to any other provisions in the relevant legislation. It would thus appear that there were no provisions in that legislation that would give an indication as to the meaning intended by the legislature. As a consequence, and notwithstanding  
      Regina v Abbott  
      (supra), the court gave a meaning to the phrase “such further time … as the court thinks fit” that included the life of the convicted person. 
       
      
    55 In my opinion, Regina v Wallace (supra) is distinguishable from the present case because of the absence of a controlling or limiting legislative context in the Northern Irish legislation. In this regard it should be noted that in Ex parte Thomas re Arnold (supra), the Court of Appeal was not persuaded to apply it to the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act 1909-1937 (NSW), in view of the legislative context of the provision under consideration in such case.  
     
      
    56 The Crown relied on Regina v Jolly (1993) 70 A Crim R 527 in support of its argument that s 25(2)(d)(ii) of the General Act should be construed so as to empower the court to impose a disqualification for life. In that case the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal considered the provisions of s 93 of the Sentencing Act 1993 (Vic). It empowers the court to impose a hospital security order either in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment or by way of sentence. Section 93(1) applies to a situation in which there has been a verdict of not guilty, but the person in respect of whom such verdict has been found appears to be suffering from a mental illness that requires treatment that can be obtained by admission to and detention in a psychiatric in-patient service and the person in question should be admitted as a patient for his or her health or safety or for the protection of the members of the public (s 93(1)(a) and (1)(b)). In such circumstances the court may: 
     
      
       
        
        “(d) instead of passing sentence make an order (a hospital order) under which the person is admitted to and detained in a psychiatric in-patient service as an involuntary patient; or 
         
         
        (e) by way of sentence make an order (a hospital security order) under which the person is admitted to and detained in a psychiatric in-patient service as a security patient for  
        a period specified 
         in the order.” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    57 Brooking J with whom, Teague and Coldrey JJ agreed, considered whether the phrase “a period specified” as used in s 93(1)(e) authorised the making of an order for the term of a person’s natural life. Although the question had not been argued, Brooking J held that the relevant phrase did authorise the making of a hospital security order for the term of a person’s natural life. There is nothing in the legislation in which such phrase occurs that is to the contrary of the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Indeed, the legislation contemplates that the duration of a hospital security order may be the same as the period of imprisonment to which the offender would have been sentenced had such order not been made (s 93(3)). Furthermore, the Act in which the phrase “a period specified” occurs is one that has application to the whole range of criminal offences and as a consequence to a range of penalties that includes imprisonment for life. A power to make a hospital security order for the duration of the life of the relevant offender may be an appropriate alternative to a sentence of life imprisonment or a substitute form of sentence for an offence for which the appropriate penalty would be imprisonment for life. The situation under the Sentencing Act 1991 (Vic) is in contrast with the situation in relation to s 25(2)(d)(ii) of the General Act. As a consequence I am of opinion that the decision in Regina v Jolly (supra) is distinguishable.  
     
      
    58 The Crown also relied on a statement of Austin J in ASIC v Parkes [2001] NSWSC 377. That case concerned s 230 of the Corporations Law by which the court is empowered to prohibit a person who has committed breaches of relevant legislation on at least two occasions when the person was an officer of a body corporate from managing a corporation “for such period as is specified in the order”. Austin J determined that a prohibition for 25 years was appropriate, and then remarked that a prohibition for such period would “effectively prevent the defendant from managing a corporation for the rest of his life.” This is argued by the Crown to support the proposition advanced in respect of the meaning to be given to the phrase “longer period of disqualification” in s 25(2)(d)(ii) of the General Act. I do not agree for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Austin J was not called upon to consider and did not consider whether the section empowered the court to impose a prohibition for life.  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The words quoted are merely a reference to the practical effect of the 25 year prohibition that had been imposed. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The phrase in s 230 of the  
        Corporations Law 
         is different from that in the  
        General Act  
        and does not have the same legislative context as s 25(2)(d)(ii) of the  
        General Act. 
          
        
       
      
    59 As a result of the foregoing analysis, I am of opinion that the meaning to be given to the phrase “longer period of disqualification” in s 25(2)(d)(ii) should be one that refers to a finite duration, the precise date of the ending of which is known as at the date of the imposition of the disqualification. The power conferred by the section does not include a power to disqualify a person from holding a licence for life, and in making such an order, the Judge erred. This part of his sentence must therefore be quashed. 
     
      
    60 Having determined that there is no power to impose a disqualification for life, it is necessary to fix a period of disqualification that is within the ambit of the power conferred by the legislation.  
     
      
    61 The driving record of the applicant is bad. The circumstances of the traffic offences included on the Form 1 were indicative of a total lack of regard for the rules of the road and the safety of road users and pedestrians. There may be more serious cases, but the events in which the applicant was involved were, in my opinion, very high in the order of seriousness and culpability. He has demonstrated a total disregard for the laws of the road. He has shown himself to be a menace on the road. This is, in essence, the same as the view that was taken by the Judge. In these circumstances, what period of disqualification is condign? The applicant will not be eligible for release on parole until 3 January 2007. The full term of the principal sentence extends until 3 January 2010. In the light of his driving history and the offences of which he has been convicted, he is unlikely to be driving on a public road during the period of his incarceration. A disqualification for a period of ten years from the date on which he becomes eligible for parole would, in my opinion, be appropriate. That being so, I am of opinion that the period of his disqualification should be until 2 January 2017. 
     
      
       
      Inadequacy of discount 
       
      
    62 Counsel for the applicant argued that the Judge erred in failing to give an adequate discount to the applicant based on his pleas of guilty and assistance given to the authorities. He pointed in particular to the passage in the Remarks on Sentence in which he noted: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the early pleas of guilty by the applicant; 
         
         
        (ii) that the offender had provided information to police in the course of his record of interview as to the involvement of Fittler in the criminal enterprises, and indicated his preparedness to give evidence at Fittler’s trial; 
        
       
       
      and relied on a passage in the Remarks on Sentence as indicating that the Judge had failed to give a “significant discount for the assistance given by the applicant in view of the fact that a discount of 25 percent should have been allowed for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty”. The passage relied on in this regard is as follows: 
       
       
        
        ‘Having regard to the pleas of guilty and the willingness to give evidence against Fittler, I consider that a discount of one third is appropriate, which means that the sentences for the offences will be six years and eight years.”  
        
       
      
    63 Even an early plea of guilty does not necessarily attract a utilitarian value discount of 25 percent Regina v Thomson; Regina v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 418-419 para 159). The range fixed in Regina v Thomson; Regina v Houlton (supra) is 10 – 25 percent. True it is that a plea of guilty at an early stage may attract a discount at the top of the range, but no single figure is fixed on for the appropriate discount in a given case nor for the appropriate ordinary sentence; ranges are stated. Both such aspects of sentencing involve matters of judgment. In the present case, a discount of less than 25 percent could fall within the parameters of acceptable discretion. A discount of 20 percent, for example, would by no means be inadequate or appellable in the present case.  
     
      
    64 Whilst the applicant’s admissions assisted the Crown case and accepted his involvement in the robbery at McDonalds, his assistance was, at least to a substantial extent, directed at minimising the seriousness of his role and maximising that of Fittler. Furthermore, the extent of the truthfulness of his assistance is open to question. For example, his assertion that he did not know that Fittler was armed (if it was Fittler who had the gun that had been taken out of the applicant’s baggage) does not sit comfortably with the evidence of Mr Hammer concerning the discharge of the gun at his residence at a time when the applicant was in close proximity. Moreover, the denials of specific parts of Fittler’s statement that were put to the applicant are, at least in some respects, also open to question. In a practical sense the value of the assistance given by his indication that he was prepared to give evidence against Fittler was qualified by three considerations. The first is the fact that he was an accomplice. As a consequence, at a trial at which the applicant gave evidence against Fittler, the trial Judge would have been required to give a direction in accordance with s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 that the applicant’s evidence was of a kind that may be unreliable. The second is the usefulness of any evidence he may have given, in view of the effects of drugs on him at the relevant time. Indeed the Judge referred to this in his Remarks on Sentence. The third consideration is that there is an under current that may suggest that the applicant was prepared to give evidence against Fittler because Fittler had already made a statement adverse to the applicant. Such undercurrent is strengthened by the behaviour of the applicant towards Fittler in the cells complex at Taree on 7 January 2002. On that date the applicant was being escorted past Fittler’s cell and on the applicant sighting Fittler he said “You cunt you are going to die for what you have done.” To which Fittler replied, “I did fuckin nothin. You gave statements against me. You did it not me.” Over an above the foregoing considerations is the fact that the applicant’s memory was open to question by virtue of the effect of drugs on him at the relevant time. As the judge remarked that, “That will be a very significant qualification on the reliability (his) evidence.”  
     
      
    65 From the foregoing, it can be seen that there was ample basis for the Judge, whilst having regard to assistance that was given by the applicant, not to give a substantial discount to him in respect of such assistance.  
     
      
    66 To the extent that that the plea of guilty and the assistance given could be regarded as indicative of contrition on the part of the applicant, any such inference could properly be discounted by reference to his behaviour at the police station following his arrest and his further behaviour in relation to Fittler in the cells complex at Taree. Whilst some discount for contrition may have been appropriate, the overlapping of such consideration with the consideration of assistance could, in my opinion, properly be regarded as falling within the additional percentage discount allowed by the Judge for considerations over and above the utilitarian value of the applicant’s pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    67 This Court should not intervene in the sentencing process merely because it may have imposed a different sentence or fixed a different non-parole period. As was pointed out by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704:  
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: ‘If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process’. That is not the statutory formulation. By s 6(3) ( 
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        1912) this Court must form a positive opinion that ‘some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed’. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential precondition for the exercise of the power to ‘quash the conviction and pass some other sentence in substitution therefore’ is not satisfied.’” (at 720-721, para 79, italics added)  
        
       
      
    68 In my opinion it has not been shown that the discount of one third that was allowed by the Judge was so low that this Court should intervene on appeal. Furthermore, I am not satisfied that a sentence less severe than that imposed is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    69 In my opinion, the ground of appeal relating to the discount on sentence given by the Judge and to the sentence imposed fails. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    70 I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed, except in relation to the disqualification of the applicant from holding a motor vehicle driver licence for life. I would propose that the order to this effect imposed by the Judge be quashed and that in lieu thereof the applicant be disqualified from holding a motor vehicle driver licence until 2 January 2017. 
     
      
    71 The orders of the Court are: 
     
      
       
      (i) leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      (ii) the appeal is dismissed, except in relation to the disqualification of the applicant from holding a motor vehicle driver license for life; 
       
       
      (iii) the order disqualifying the applicant from holding a motor vehicle driver license for life imposed by the Judge is quashed; 
       
       
      (iv) in lieu of the order referred to in 71(iii) above, the applicant be disqualified from holding a motor vehicle driver license until 2 January 2017.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of James J with which I agree. Like his Honour, I was favourably impressed by Ms Ghazi’s evidence. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: In this application Shadi Eid applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 19 September 2002 by his Honour Judge Sides QC for an offence of robbery committed on 1 May 2002, to which he had pleaded guilty. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment for four years commencing on 1 May 2002, being the date on which the applicant had been arrested soon after having committed the offence, with a non-parole period of three years. Robbery is an offence under s 94 of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for fourteen years. 
     
      
    3 There was no dispute on the hearing of this application about the objective facts of the offence. The following statement of the facts of the offence is derived from his Honour’s remarks on sentence. 
     
      
    4 On the afternoon of 1 May 2002 the victim of the offence was driving a vehicle in a suburb of Sydney. The victim stopped the vehicle at traffic control lights at an intersection. The applicant approached the victim’s stationary vehicle and pointed to his wrist. The victim, believing that the applicant wanted to know the time, wound down the driver’s window of the vehicle and told the applicant the time. The applicant told the victim to get out of the vehicle.  
     
      
    5 In his statement made to the police the victim said that the applicant had said to him “get out of the car before I hurt you”. In the proceedings on sentence the applicant gave evidence that what he had said to the victim was “get out. I don’t want to hurt you”. In his remarks on sentence his Honour did not resolve this conflict, apparently considering it unnecessary to do so, as, on either version, what the applicant had said to the victim conveyed a threat to the victim. 
     
      
    6 Before the victim could wind up the window of the vehicle, the applicant thrust his hand through the open window and removed the key from the ignition. The victim got out of the vehicle and the applicant entered the vehicle and drove it away. 
     
      
    7 The victim reported the robbery to police. Later that afternoon police officers observed the victim’s vehicle being driven by the applicant. The applicant became aware that he was under police surveillance and he increased the speed of the vehicle. The police pursued the speeding vehicle driven by the applicant. After police had pursued the vehicle for a number of kilometres, the vehicle being driven by the applicant collided with a median strip and then another vehicle. The applicant got out of the vehicle and ran. He was pursued by police on foot. The applicant managed temporarily to elude the police officers but he was located by a police dog and arrested. After he was arrested the applicant was interviewed by police in an electronically recorded interview, in which he made a number of admissions.  
     
      
    8 In both the interview on 1 May 2002 and in his evidence given in the proceedings on sentence the applicant said that he had committed the offence because of a drug debt. The account given by the applicant was that certain persons, who he declined to identify but who he indicated had been his previous drug suppliers, had left with him some item, which he declined to identify but which he said was worth about five or six thousand dollars, but a member of his family, his mother, had found the item and destroyed it. After the persons who had left the item with the applicant had demanded the return of the item, the applicant had had to tell them that the item had been destroyed. Those persons had then told the applicant that he should pay off his debt arising from the destruction of the item entrusted to him, by stealing cars nominated by those persons. 
     
      
    9 In the proceedings on sentence Judge Sides expressed concern about what appeared to him to be an inconsistency between answers given by the applicant in the interview on 1 May 2002 and evidence given by the applicant in the proceedings on sentence, about when it was that the alleged drug debt had been incurred. In his remarks on sentence his Honour found that the item had been given to the applicant while he was on bail for other offences at some time between 27 March 2001 and 5 September 2001 but the demand for the return of the item had not been made, until within a month before the applicant was arrested for the present offence. 
     
      
    10 His Honour found that the applicant could have paid off at least part of the debt, by selling furniture which he had purchased in anticipation of his forthcoming marriage, using money given to him for this purpose by his mother. His Honour said in his remarks on sentence that he could understand why the applicant would have found that method of raising money unpalatable but commented that the applicant had chosen another way to pay off his debt, which involved inflicting financial loss on another person by engendering fear in the victim of the robbery. His Honour accepted an assertion by the victim in his statement that at the time the offence was committed the victim “was scared for his life”. 
     
      
    11 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted some of the subjective circumstances of the applicant. The applicant was born on 4 December 1975. He had left school, without having obtained the School Certificate. After leaving school he had had some casual, unskilled jobs but had been unemployed for significant periods.  
     
      
    12 The applicant was to have been married on 17 May 2002 but the wedding had been cancelled as a result of the applicant’s arrest. However, his relationship with his fiancée had continued and she still intended to marry him, after he was released from prison. 
     
      
    13 In his remarks on sentence his Honour found, importantly, that the applicant had had a long standing history of polydrug abuse. 
     
      
    14 The applicant had what his Honour described as a significant criminal history. This criminal history included inter alia the following entries. In 1994 the applicant had been convicted of being an accessory after the fact to armed robbery with wounding. In April 1996 he had been sentenced to imprisonment for four years for an offence of armed robbery in company. On 4 October 1999 the applicant had been placed on an eighteen months good behaviour bond for possessing a prohibited drug. In February 2000 he had been sentenced to imprisonment for two months for possession of a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    15 On 5 September 2001 the applicant had been sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of eight months on four charges of supplying a prohibited drug. As the applicant had already served the non-parole period fixed, the applicant had been released on parole immediately after he was sentenced, without returning to custody. The applicant was on this parole when he committed the present offence. His Honour rightly regarded the fact that the present offence had been committed while the applicant was on parole as a circumstance of aggravation. The applicant’s criminal history disclosed that the applicant had breached parole on earlier occasions as well. The criminal history also disclosed that he had committed offences in breach of recognisances to be of good behaviour into which he had entered.  
     
      
    16 On 9 August 2002, the first day of the proceedings on sentence, the applicant gave evidence that, although he had previously abused illicit drugs, he was not using illicit drugs at the time he committed the present offence. The applicant gave evidence that, to assist him in overcoming his addiction to heroin, two naltrexone implants had been inserted in his body, the first in about November 2001 and the second only about two weeks before he was arrested on 1 May 2002. 
     
      
    17 On 9 August 2002 the applicant gave further evidence that, as a condition of his parole, he had undergone analyses of samples of his urine and “my urine analysis came back clean with the exception of two”. The applicant said that one of these two exceptions was because he had taken Panadeine Forte, which contains some kind of opiate, and only one of the exceptions was because he had used an illicit drug. 
     
      
    18 By the time the proceedings on sentence were resumed on 19 September two pre-sentence reports prepared by a probation and parole officer had been received by the Court. 
     
      
    19 In one of the pre-sentence reports the probation and parole officer said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is understood that Mr Eid is currently in receipt of naltrexone implants to assist his choice to not use heroin. Treatment beginning prior to being placed in custody. The offender informed this Service that it is his intention to continue such treatment”. 
        
       
      
    20 The sentencing judge commented, in relation to this part of the pre-sentence report, that it was phrased in a very cautious fashion and did not refer to any material independent of the applicant that he had in fact received any naltrexone implant. However, it would appear from his Honour’s remarks on sentence that his Honour did accept that the applicant had received two naltrexone implants.  
     
      
    21 In the same pre-sentence report the probation and parole officer stated that in October 2001 the applicant had admitted using heroin. The pre-sentence report continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Eid failed to report on that date (16 October 2001). On 18 October 2001 the offender informed this Service that he had used drugs since the last contact. He was instructed to report on 19 October 2001. 
        
       
       
        
        On 19 October 2001 he reported to this Service and was instructed to submit to urinalysis within twenty-four hours and admitted to daily marijuana use. The offender was instructed to report to this Service on 3 December 2001: he failed to do so. A letter was sent directing him to report on 12 December 2001.  
        
       
       
        
        On 6 December 2001 results of the urine test were positive to opiates and possibly Codeine. 
        
       
       
        
        On 7 January 2002 results from urine testing were ‘no drugs detected’.  
        
       
       
        
        On 8 April 2002 the offender was directed to undergo urine testing and provide results to this Service. He failed to do so 22 April 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        Urine submitted for testing on 9 February 2002 indicated that the ‘sample’ was ‘not urine’. 
        
       
       
        
        The results of urine testing on 15 April 2002 indicated a positive result for opiates/morphine and that the urine sample may have been ‘diluted’.  
        
       
       
        
        When interviewed on 23 April 2002 Mr Eid admitted to having used illicit drugs. He was directed to submit to a another urinalysis within the week: he failed to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        It is understood that no further drug testing took place prior to Mr Eid being placed into custody for these matters on 1 May 2002”. 
        
       
      
    22 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that it was difficult to reconcile the account which had been given by the applicant in his evidence on 9 August 2002 with the contents of the pre-sentence report. 
     
      
    23 A further matter dealt with by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence was a submission made on behalf of the applicant that he had the support of his family and his fiancée.  
     
      
    24 His Honour would appear to have accepted that the applicant had the support of his family. 
     
      
    25 In the proceedings on sentence the applicant gave the following evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I’ve been on heroin for a long time. I was an addict for a period of ten years where nothing mattered but heroin. I met a girl, incredibly she turned my life around and in a way I owe my life because even though I’m in a bit of trouble right now, there is a big possibility where I would have been in a lot more trouble than what I am …” 
        
       
      
    26 In his evidence in the proceedings on sentence the applicant credited his fiancée with having been instrumental in his decision to have naltrexone implants inserted in his body. 
     
      
    27 His Honour noted in his remarks on sentence that the Probation and Parole officer who had prepared the pre-sentence reports had spoken to the applicant’s fiancée. The applicant’s fiancée was not in court for the proceeding on sentence but an explanation was given of why it had been impossible for her to attend court.  
     
      
    28 In his remarks on sentence his Honour noted that the applicant’s fiancé still intended to marry him, when he was released from custody. His Honour then said, “the fiancée told the probation officer that the offender was not a user of illicit drugs. This is blatantly not the case”. 
     
      
    29 His Honour continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I note also that she has been unable to visit him because Corrective Services staff have barred her from doing so. If she was being genuine, in telling the probation officer that the offender was not using illicit drugs, then, it seems to me, that she was not facing the reality that was presenting to her. The other possible alternative is, that she was seeking to mislead the probation officer. I do not gain a great deal of confidence, so far as this Offender’s rehabilitation is concerned, from the fact that he might receive on-going support from his fiancée”. 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour concluded that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were poor and that there was no basis for a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    31 The only ground of appeal filed on behalf of the applicant was that the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances on the issue of whether there were special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    32 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge had made a mistake in saying in his remarks on sentence that the applicant’s fiancée had told the Probation and Parole officer who prepared the pre-sentence reports that the applicant was not a user of illicit drugs. What the Probation and Parole officer in fact said in her pre-sentence report was that she (that is the fiancée) stated that she was not a user of illicit drugs. The Crown conceded that the sentencing judge had made this mistake. 
     
      
    33 It was further submitted on behalf of the applicant that, on the basis of his mistaken finding about what the applicant’s fiancée had told the Probation and Parole officer, his Honour had found that, either the applicant’s fiancée was not facing reality or she had been seeking to mislead the Probation and Parole officer, and on either view the fiancée would not be likely to assist in any rehabilitation of the applicant. His Honour had then taken this finding into account, in concluding that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were poor and that there was no basis for making a finding of special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Furthermore, as the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were relevant, not only to determining whether there were special circumstances within s 44(2), but were also relevant to determining what total sentence should be imposed, the exercise by his Honour of his sentencing discretion had miscarried generally. 
     
      
    34 In my opinion, these submissions made by counsel for the applicant are well founded and should be accepted. His Honour made a mistaken finding of fact and this mistaken finding of fact was then taken into account by his Honour in concluding that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were poor and the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were relevant to both the total sentence to be imposed and whether there should be a finding of special circumstances. It is, accordingly, necessary for this Court, in the exercise of its own discretion, to determine what sentence should be imposed and in particular whether any lesser sentence should be imposed and whether it should find that there are special circumstances.  
     
      
    35 When this Court finds that an exercise by a primary judge of his or her sentencing discretion has miscarried and this Court has to exercise its own sentencing discretion, this Court can take into account evidence of what has happened since the original sentencing. In the present case the Court received an affidavit by the young woman who is the applicant’s fiancée and she was cross-examined on her affidavit by the Crown Prosecutor. 
     
      
    36 In her affidavit the applicant’s fiancée Fatima Ghazi said that she is twenty-three years old. She works as an administrative assistant at a public hospital. She had been addicted to cannabis and heroin but has not used any illicit drug since December 1999. She has no criminal history apart from a driving offence.  
     
      
    37 She met the applicant in April 2001 and became engaged to be married to him in about the middle of 2001. The wedding was fixed for 17 May 2002 but was not held because the applicant had been arrested and refused bail. 
     
      
    38 The applicant admitted to Ms Ghazi that he had a drug problem. She encouraged the applicant to have naltrexone implants inserted in his body, because it would not then be necessary for the applicant to take oral medication. The naltrexone implants were inserted in the applicant’s body in November 2001 and April 2002. Ms Ghazi said she was disappointed and upset when the applicant told her that he was still using drugs but “I never expected him to be able to beat the habit immediately after all the years he had been using heroin”.  
     
      
    39 In her affidavit Ms Ghazi offered explanations of why she had been barred from visiting the applicant in prison.  
     
      
    40 Ms Ghazi said that in late 1999 or early 2000 she had attempted to visit another prisoner, who was a boyfriend of a friend of hers. At the prison she was subjected to a pat-down search of her body, which she found “very confronting”. She refused to allow a police officer to search her car. She later received a letter notifying her that she was barred from visiting prisons for twelve months.  
     
      
    41 In about September 2002 when Ms Ghazi was visiting the applicant she was told that there was a “red flag” against her name and that she would not be permitted to visit the applicant. 
     
      
    42 In late November or early December 2002 Ms Ghazi drove a car to the prison where the applicant was an inmate. She took her brother, who was to deliver a suit to the applicant. At the gate of the prison she was told by police that she would have to consent to a search of her vehicle, if she wanted to proceed into the prison. She consented to a search of the vehicle. She said in her affidavit that, unknown to her, her sister who was also in the vehicle had a small amount of cannabis in a bag in the vehicle. The bag also contained some items belonging to Ms Ghazi. When the cannabis was found by police Ms Ghazi told police that she had been unaware of the cannabis, her assertion was supported by her sister and police issued a caution to her sister. However, Ms Ghazi later received a letter from the Department of Correctional Services notifying her that she was barred from visiting Correctional Centres for twelve months. Since then Ms Ghazi has not visited the applicant but has regularly communicated with him by telephone or by letter.  
     
      
    43 Ms Ghazi was subjected to a testing cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor. In cross-examination it emerged that Ms Ghazi had not been aware of the debt the applicant had owed until after the applicant was sentenced by Judge Sides, that she had not been aware of the extent to which the applicant had used illicit drugs from his release from custody on 5 September 2001 up to this year or of the extent to which results of tests of samples of the applicant’s urine had been unsatisfactory. Ms Ghazi was also challenged on her evidence about why she had been barred from visiting Correctional Centres. 
     
      
    44 In general I formed a favourable impression of Ms Ghazi and I would be prepared to accept her evidence. I accept that it is likely that she will endeavour to influence the applicant not to use illicit drugs. 
     
      
    45 Earlier in this judgment I summarised the objective facts of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the applicant. I take into account the evidence given by Ms Ghazi on the hearing of this application. I take into account the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    46 In my opinion, the total sentence of four years imposed by Judge Sides is, notwithstanding Ms Ghazi’s evidence, an appropriate sentence and is the sentence which I, in the independent exercise of my own sentencing discretion, would impose. 
     
      
    47 The remaining question is whether there should be any finding of special circumstances. The submission on behalf of the applicant that there should be a finding of special circumstances was based squarely on the applicant’s relationship with Ms Ghazi. 
     
      
    48 It was submitted by the Crown, with some force, that the applicant had committed the present offence, after he had met Ms Ghazi and had become engaged to be married to her and within a few days of the date set for the wedding. After meeting Ms Ghazi and becoming engaged to be married to her, the applicant had nevertheless continued to use illicit drugs and he had been less than frank in disclosing to Ms Ghazi the extent to which he was using illicit drugs or the extent to which he had failed to pass urine tests.  
     
      
    49 I have nevertheless formed the opinion that there should be a finding of special circumstances, on the basis of Ms Ghazi’s relationship with the applicant, her intention to marry him and her intention to assist him in endeavouring to overcome his drug addiction. In particular, I accept the following matters. Ms Ghazi has experience of taking drugs herself and has overcome her own drug addiction. She was instrumental in having the  
     
      
      naltrexone implants inserted in the applicant’s body, to assist him in overcoming his addiction to heroin. She still intends to marry the applicant and communicates with him while he is in prison, as often as she can. There will be a greater prospect of her being able to assist the applicant to overcome his drug addiction, if she is living with him, than at present, when he is in custody and she communicates with him only by letter or telephone. 
       
      
    50 In my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted; the sentence of four years imposed by Judge Sides should be confirmed; the appeal should be allowed in respect of the non-parole period set by Judge Sides and in lieu thereof I would set a non-parole period of two years eight months commencing on 1 May 2002 and expiring on 31 December 2004. The first date on which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole would be 31 December 2004. 
     
      
    51 O’KEEFE J: I have read the draft of the judgment prepared in this matter by James J in which he has comprehensively set out the facts and the arguments advanced. I agree with what James J has said in that regard and adopt it. However, I am unable to agree with his conclusion and the orders proposed by him. In my opinion neither the sentence imposed, nor the non-parole period fixed, by the District Court Judge (the Judge) should be interfered with.  
     
      
    52 The Judge found that the offence that the applicant had committed was “a serious example of robbery”. I agree. The applicant chose to deprive the victim of the car of which he had use, and which belonged to his employer. Its value far exceeded the debt that the applicant claimed was due to his drug associates. The debt was said to be five to six thousand dollars ($5,000 -$6,000). The value of the car was $26,000. It was wrecked in circumstances in which the applicant sought to avoid apprehension. A good deal of damage was done to the property of other people in addition to that done to the car of the victim. The admissions made by the applicant indicated that it was not just one car that he was supposedly being forced into stealing by his drug associates, but “cars”. This does not sit well with the asserted debt and its alleged source. Nor does it bode well for the future. There is nothing to indicate that like pressure will not be applied to him in the future in respect of the very same debt that he alleges remains outstanding. The scepticism of the Judge in relation to such debt was well justified. The applicant had declined to nominate:  
     
      
       
        
        (i) the person or persons to whom the debt was owed; 
         
         
        (ii) the item whose destruction by a member of his family was said to have given rise to such debt;  
        
       
       
      and did not call any evidence from his family in support of his claim in that regard. 
       
      
    53 The Judge found that contrition did play some part in the decision by the applicant to plead guilty, and reflected this in the sentence imposed. However he was not impressed by the evidence of the applicant in relation to his rehabilitation. Indeed, he thought those prospects were poor. I agree.  
     
      
    54 The applicant’s history in relation to drug testing in the past gives no reason for confidence for the future. On no fewer than seven occasions he either failed to report, produced a positive urine test, submitted a false sample, ie one purporting to be urine which was not, or apparently diluted the sample submitted. All of these events occurred in breach of obligations imposed by the law on the applicant. The Judge expressed the view that the applicant was manipulating the system. The undisputed facts support such a conclusion.  
     
      
    55 The applicant’s fiancée gave evidence on the appeal. To the best of one’s judgement she appeared sincere. However, I though she was naïve. It is clear that the applicant had deceived her in relation to his drug taking and his recidivism in that regard. As emerged in her cross-examination, she was unaware of the extent to which he had failed, avoided or falsified drug tests that he had been required to undergo. Whether her resolve to marry the applicant will remain firm in the light of the revelations on the hearing of the appeal is a matter on which one can only speculate. Even if it were to remain firm, the history of deception of her by the applicant does not auger well for his rehabilitation.  
     
      
    56 The applicant said that he had met his fiancée and “incredibly she turned my life around”. However, each of the failures, avoidances and falsifications of drug tests referred to above took place after he had met his fiancée, indeed after they had become engaged. It would thus appear that he was falsely telling her that he had given up drugs. He had not. It is difficult in these circumstances to understand how it can accurately be said that his association with his fiancée had turned his life around so far as his drug addiction was concerned. 
     
      
    57 Whilst the Judge made the error of fact identified by James J (see paras 32 and 33), I do not think that the sentence imposed or the non-parole period fixed was vitiated by such error. The offence committed by the applicant was serious. His history of violence in the past included armed robbery with wounding and armed robbery in company. The offence in the present case was committed whilst the applicant was on parole. His prospects of rehabilitation were found by the Judge to be poor. For the reasons indicated above, I think this is correct. The offence and other matters relevant to sentence call for a substantial term of imprisonment both as to the head sentence and the period of non-parole. The sentence imposed and period of non-parole fixed by the Judge were in my opinion condign. I do not think that some other sentence that is less severe was warranted in law and should have been passed. Accordingly, I respectfully disagree with Sheller JA and James J in relation to the orders proposed. In my opinion, although leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed.

     Regina v Alan Baverstock 
      
    The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence which was imposed upon him after pleading guilty to six counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to section 61A of the Crimes Act 1900. For count 6, his Honour sentenced the applicant, after taking into account four matters on the Form 1, to six years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of two years and six months. It was submitted that in relation to this count his Honour erred in the manner in which he dealt with the offences on the Form 1.The principles to be applied when dealing with matters on a Form 1 can be found in the decision of Spigelman CJ in Regina v Barton (2001) 121 A Crim R 185 and were further enunciated by him in Attorney General’s application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518.The way in which his Honour followed a practice of quantifying the individual sentences in relation to the Form 1 matters and the extent to which the sentence should be enlarged, did depart from the preferred approach. The possibility that his Honour fell into error by adding the sentences from calculating each Form 1 matter individually to the sentence for the primary offence, makes it necessary to review the total sentence for that count. After reviewing the criminality involved in Count 6 and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the sentence could not be held to be manifestly excessive.Orders:1. Leave to appeal granted2.

     Judgment 
     1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Sides on 7 June 2002 in the District Court at Campbelltown. The applicant pleaded guilty to six counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. In respect of count 6, three additional offences of sexual intercourse without consent were taken into account on a Form 1, along with a count of common assault. 
     
      
    2 An agreed statement of facts was tendered which indicated that the applicant had met the complainant in 1998 in China after having been introduced by the complainant's cousin. They married in China on 3 March 1998. Afterwards the applicant returned to Australia. The complainant, however, remained in China awaiting the processing of her immigration visa. She was granted a temporary resident visa on 16 October 2000 after which she came to Australia. Thereafter she resided with the applicant in his unit at Warrick Farm. 
     
      
    3 The series of charges all relate to episodes of somewhat bizarre behaviour by the applicant. In essence, they related to a period between January and February 2001 during which time the applicant forced his wife to engage in acts of bondage where he tied her with neck ties, and/or wrist ties, and/or ankle ties to the bed against her will, and then performed the various acts of sexual intercourse complained of.  
     
      
    4 The applicant was aware of the absence of consent, on the part of the complainant, to these acts since that was evidenced by her continued crying throughout the various incidents, and by her protestations, for example, ""No, no, I'm very scared"" and ""Stop"". On one occasion the applicant said to her, ""Alan happy"" to which she replied, ""Ti not happy"" and added, ""Don't do this to me. Don't make love to me until you untie me"". The applicant replied, ""This Australia, not China"". He also said on occasions, ""Go China"", or words to a similar effect, which she understood to mean that she would be returned to China if she did not comply with his sexual demands. 
     
      
    5 The complainant was overcome by these threats, being vulnerable by reason of her temporary visa status. While she no doubt would have agreed to the individual acts of sexual intercourse, it was the fact of the bondage demands which negated her consent. Apart from her own cries or protestations about his demands, her cousin, had remonstrated with the applicant on one occasion, and had asked him not to tie her up. He had, however, responded that his former wife had enjoyed such practices. He did indicate that he would cease these requests but it was a false promise in that he continued to behave in a similar way.  
     
      
    6 The sentences were set to be served concurrently, although with a one year accumulation of the sentence for count 6. They were as follows:  
     
      
      (a) Counts 1 and 2, sexual intercourse without consent involving incidents of cunnilingus (count 1), and fellatio (count 2) occurring on 15 February 2001, - imprisonment for four and a half years on each count, to commence on 7 June 2002, with non-parole periods of two years, also to commence on 7 June 2002 and to expire on 6 June 2004. 
       
      (b) Counts 3, 4 and 5, sexual intercourse without consent involving incidents occurring on 24 February 2001, cunnilingus (count 3), digital penetration of the vagina (count 4), digital penetration of the anus and vagina (count 5), - imprisonment for three years on each count, to commence on 7 June 2002, with non-parole periods of two years, also to commence on 7 June 2002 and to expire on 6 June 2004. 
       
      (c) Count 6, taking into account four matters on the Form 1, involving a continuation of events on 24 February 2001, during which the applicant digitally penetrated the complainant's vagina and anus for another two minutes, - imprisonment for six years to commence on 7 June 2003 with a non-parole period of two years and six months, to expire on 6 December 2005. 
       
      
    7 The four matters on the Form 1 related to offences occurring as follows: 
     
      
      (a) Early January 2001, common assault involving an incident when the applicant tied the complainant to a bed with neck ties without her consent. 
       
      (b) – (d) A few days before 15 February 2001, sexual intercourse without consent involving incidents of tying the complainant up and then engaging, irrespectively, in penile penetration of her vagina and mouth, and also in cunnilingus.  
       
      
    8 The effective sentencing order was accordingly one of imprisonment for seven years with an effective non-parole period of three years and six months. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – The manner in which his Honour dealt with the offences on the Form 1. 
       
      
    9 When taking the Form 1 offences into account, his Honour had remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “So far as count 6 is concerned, that is the offence for which the Court has indicated it will take the matters into account on a form 1 schedule. As I have said, in my view, the assault would normally, if it stood to be sentenced alone, call for a section 9 bond and I do not see that it is appropriate to extend the sentence for count 6 at all in relation to the assault. 
        
       
       
        
        So far as offences 2 and 3 on the form 1 schedule [they being acts of penile penetration of the vagina and of the mouth] the sentence in relation for count 6 should be extended by two years for each of them.  
        
       
       
        
        The final count is an act of cunnilingus on 15 February. In my view, the sentence should be extended by eighteen months in relation to that matter. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court then needs to consider the question of totality so far as count 6 and the matters on a schedule are concerned. In my view, the sentence for that matter should be extended by two year[s] to reflect the matters on the schedule.” 
        
       
       
        
          
        
       
      
    10 After providing for 12 months accumulation in relation to count 6, so as to allow for the total criminality involved in the various counts, and also to allow for the special circumstances which were found to exist relating to the applicant's age, the fact that this would be his first time in custody, and also the fact of accumulation of sentence, his Honour determined that there should be a non-parole period set for count 6 of two and a half years, equivalent to three and a half years after accumulation. 
     
      
    11 It was submitted that in the way that the Form 1 offences were taken into account, his Honour had failed to give proper effect to the principles which were subsequently expressed in the guideline judgment of this Court in Attorney General's application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518, and in particular to the following passages in the judgment of Spigelman CJ: 
     
      
       
        
        “39. The sentencing court is sentencing  
        only  
        for the ""principal offence"". It is no part of the task of the sentencing court to determine appropriate sentences for offences listed on a Form 1 or to determine the overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and then apply a ""discount"" for the use of the procedure. This is not sentencing for the principal offence. 
        
       
       
        
        40. In my opinion, it is pertinent to identify the elements to be considered in determining the sentence for the primary offence upon which the commission of other offences, for which no conviction is being recorded, may impinge. The case law has identified a number of distinct and sometimes overlapping purposes to be served by sentencing. In my opinion, not all these purposes are relevant to the process of taking other offences into account, when sentencing for a particular offence, i.e. the primary offence. 
        
       
       
        
        41. In  
        Barton  
        at [64], in a passage subsequently referred to in  
        R v AEM Snr  
        at [81] and  
        R v Perese  
        at [81], I made some observations which I repeat. 
        
       
       
        
        42. The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        44. The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences can impinge upon elements relevant to sentencing for the principal offence will depend on a range of other factors pertinent to those elements and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. For that reason it will rarely be appropriate for a sentencing judge to attempt to quantify the effect on the sentence of taking into account Form 1 offences. (See  
        R v Kay  
        at [69].)” 
        
       
      
    12 It is to be observed that his Honour came to sentence the applicant prior to this judgment being handed down, however, he did have the benefit of the decision of Spigelman CJ in Regina v Barton (2001) 121 A Crim R 185, much of which formed the genesis of the guideline judgment. 
     
      
    13 To the extent that his Honour followed a practice of quantifying the individual sentences, in relation to the Form 1 matters, and then indicated the extent to which the sentence for count 1 should be enlarged, it would appear that his Honour did depart from the preferred approach for a sentencing judge which was identified, in particular, in paragraph 44 of the reasons of the Chief Justice in the guideline judgment. When sentencing in relation to the primary count, it is for that offence that the sentence needs to be set. However, consistently with the guideline judgment, there has to be some additional punishment imposed in relation to the Form 1 offences.  
     
      
    14 It is important that sentencing judges do not approach the exercise upon the basis that they are also sentencing individually for the Form 1 matters, and then adding the sentences which would have been considered appropriate for those matters to the sentence that would have been set for the primary offence.  
     
      
    15 It does not seem that his Honour did fall into that error, since, if each of the individual sentences which he had thought appropriate for the Form 1 matters had been added to the sentence which his Honour said was appropriate for count 6, then it might have been expected that he would have extended the sentence for that count by five and a half years, rather than 2 years. However, having regard to a possibility of error in the approach which was taken, I am of the view that it is necessary for us to review the sentence. 
     
      
    16 In that regard, it has also to be borne in mind that, if an error of this kind is shown to have occurred, that does not necessarily mean that the Court will quash the sentence and impose a lower sentence. In Regina v Kay [2002] NSWCCA 286, Carruthers AJ said:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is common ground that the hearing of the appeal, particularly in the light of decisions handed down by this Court, subsequent to the sentencing process, errors of law had been established on the part of the sentencing judge. Counsel for the applicant realistically acknowledged, however, that it is not sufficient for the applicant to establish error before this Court would quash the subject sentences and impose lesser sentences. It is necessary that this Court be satisfied that `Some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed.' (See ss 63 of the 
         Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 and 
         Regina v Simpson  
        2000, NSWCCA 534 at 79 and 89-100)"". 
        
       
       
      Ground 2 – Sentence Excessive 
       
      
    17 It was submitted that in the light of the objective and subjective circumstances, which so far as I can see were sufficiently and carefully noted by his Honour, the sentence for count 6 taking into account the Form 1 matters was excessive. In particular it was submitted that a lesser sentence, perhaps one of five years, would have adequately catered for the elements of general deterrence, and personal deterrence. It was contended that the latter element was of somewhat less significance in a case such as the present, where the applicant was being sentenced for the first time, and had excellent prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    18 The subjective background of the applicant can be briefly summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) At the time of sentence he was 50 years of age and had no relevant criminal convictions.  
       
       
      (b) His parents had separated when he was an infant, and he had not had contact with his father after he had turned four years of age. 
      
     
     
      
      (c) He had left school at the age of 15 and had immigrated to this country from the United Kingdom a year later. 
       
       
      (d) He had married in 1972 and that union had lasted for 13 years and produced two children. 
       
       
      (e) He had remarried in 1989 and had a son and daughter, now aged twelve and ten years from that union. 
       
       
      (f) He had married the complainant in 1998, having been introduced by her cousin. 
       
       
      (g) At the time of sentence he was in a stable and supportive relationship with his de facto partner. 
       
       
      (h) Enquiries made of his first wife and current de facto, had indicated that he had never been sexually violent towards them. 
       
       
      (i) He described a history of consensual sexual relations involving bondage with his other partners. 
       
       
      (j) He had worked in various forms of semi-skilled employment, including truck driving. 
       
       
      (k) He suffered from some ill-health and had been on a disability pension for the six to seven years preceding the sentence, as a result of a back injury, and in addition he had recently undergone heart surgery. 
       
       
      (l) There was no evidence arising from psychological assessments to indicate any current mental illness. 
       
       
      (m) The pre-sentence report noted that: 
       
        
        ""The offender claimed that despite his plea of guilty, he did not rape or at any time assault his wife. He admitted to practising bondage with both his second ex-wife and his current partner and stated that at no time did he force his wife to engage in any activities she did not wish to participate in. He claimed that he was set up in order that his wife might remain in Australia, and the charges were only laid after he told his wife's cousin that he planned to continue his de facto relationship and end his marriage"".  
        
       
      
    19 This latter observation did not indicate much in the way of contrition or remorse. His Honour, however, accepted that the guilty plea did reflect some contrition and that it had also saved the complainant the anguish of having to give evidence in open court in relation to intimate matters. 
     
      
    20 The pleas, his Honour held, justified a discount of 20 percent. It has been submitted that the pleas should have attracted a larger discount having regard to the circumstances in which they were given. In that regard, it appears that there had been an early plea of guilty to one count of intercourse without consent and an arrangement made that the further offences would be taken into account on a Form 1. However, when the matter was later pursued, it is asserted there was some change on the part of the Crown so far as it wished to proceed in relation to other counts.  
     
      
    21 Ultimately after some discussion, the indictment that was before his Honour was presented and the pleas of guilty offered. 
     
      
    22 His Honour took into account all of those matters and came to the conclusion that the 20 percent discount should reflect the utility of the plea. It cannot be said that the plea was a late plea, but I am not persuaded that a 20 percent discount was an inappropriate reflection of utility. The remorse, as I have indicated, was somewhat qualified, and I am not persuaded that error was shown in that regard. 
     
      
    23 Some reference was made to the Judicial Commission statistics which shows that a sentence of six years for a s 61I offence is towards the top of the range. It is not at the top thereof, and by definition, it is not out of range.  
     
      
    24 I would wish only again to repeat that reference to these statistics at best provides some general guidance to sentencing trends. It is not a particularly useful tool in determining the sentence appropriate for an individual case, particularly bearing in mind the different subjective and objective circumstances which are conceded in the statistics, and also bearing in mind that very often the sample is not a large sample.  
     
      
    25 Each case does depend upon its own facts and the present case displayed, in my view, a particularly unpleasant pattern of behaviour by the applicant. 
     
      
    26 The criminality involved in count 6, taking into account the Form 1 matters, in my view was such that the sentence could not be held to be manifestly excessive. In that regard, matters of particular relevance for sentence included the flagrant abuse of the vulnerability of the appellant, the degrading acts involved against her will, and the fact that it had been made perfectly clear to the applicant that, whatever his prior sexual partners or current sexual partners may have enjoyed or accepted, the complainant did not reciprocate his wishes. 
     
      
    27 I would allow leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    28 SIMPSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    29 ADAMS J: I also agree. 
     
      
    30 WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will therefore be as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA:  I agree with James J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: GLB applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 15 November 2002 by her Honour Judge Hock, after he had pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years, namely five years, and one charge of indecent assault on a child under the age of ten years, namely five years. The victim of all four offences was the same child, a daughter of the applicant. For each offence of sexual intercourse her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years commencing on 15 November 2002, with a non-parole period of two years, and for the offence of indecent assault her Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of one year also commencing on 15 November 2002. Sexual intercourse with another person under the age of ten years is an offence under s 66A of the Crimes Act for which at the time the offence was committed the maximum penalty was imprisonment for twenty years. Indecent assault on a child under the age of ten years is an offence under s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    3 All of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced were committed on 12 or 13 October 2000, while the applicant, who was separated from the victim’s mother, had temporary custody of the victim and her older sister. All of the three offences of sexual intercourse were committed by the applicant licking the child’s vagina. The offence of indecent assault was committed by the applicant, while bathing the child, putting his hands between her legs and rubbing her vagina. 
     
      
    4 As the sentencing judge noted in her remarks on sentence the offences were unusual in the way in which they had come to light. On 16 October 2000 the applicant had voluntarily attended a police station and confessed to having kissed his daughter on the vulva. At the time he made this confession there had not been any previous complaint or report to the police that the applicant had committed any offence against his daughter. 
     
      
    5 On 16 October 2000 the applicant took part in a long electronically recorded interview by police. On that day the applicant, on the basis of the admissions he had made, was charged with an offence of aggravated sexual assault. After being charged, the applicant was released on bail. 
     
      
    6 In December 2000 police interviewed the applicant’s daughter. The child told police that the applicant had licked her vagina on more than one occasion and had shown her magazines with pictures of women engaging in such behaviour. 
     
      
    7 After the interview of the applicant’s daughter police sought a further interview with the applicant but the applicant declined to be interviewed again. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was admitted to the Cedar Cottage Rehabilitation Programme for sex offenders on 23 July 2001 but within a few days he declined to attend the Programme. 
     
      
    9 On 30 July 2001 the applicant took part in another electronically recorded interview by police. In that interview he disclosed three further offences committed by him on 12 and 13 October 2000. He also disclosed that he had committed at least one other indecent assault on the complainant 
     
      
    10 In the following year the applicant was again assessed as suitable for admission to a rehabilitation programme for sex offenders but he did not attend that programme. Finally, on 15 November 2002 the applicant was sentenced by her Honour. 
     
      
    11 In her remarks on sentence her Honour noted that the offences committed on 12 and 13 October 2000 were not isolated incidents. She found that there had been some premeditation, in that the applicant had admitted in the interview of July 2001 that he had shown pornographic magazines to the complainant on a number of occasions. Her Honour observed that the offences had not involved penile or digital penetration of the child but the objective seriousness of the offences was increased by the gross breach of trust and the very young age of the child. 
     
      
    12 In her remarks on sentence her Honour recorded some of the subjective circumstances of the applicant. He was thirty-seven years old at the time he was sentenced. He had no previous criminal convictions. He had been born with cerebral palsy which affected his mobility and dexterity. The applicant had never worked and had been receiving a Social Security disability pension since he was eighteen years old. He had met the woman he later married, when they were both members of a church group. However, he and his wife had separated about two years before the offences were committed. 
     
      
    13 Her Honour found special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in that the applicant was thirty-seven years old, he had never been to prison before, he had physical disabilities and because of the nature of his offences his sentences would be served on protection. 
     
      
    14 Her Honour found that the applicant’s pleas of guilty had been entered at the first available opportunity and that the applicant was therefore entitled to a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas.  
     
      
    15 After referring to the utilitarian value of the applicant’s pleas of guilty her Honour, in a passage in her remarks on sentence which is crucial to the determination of this application, said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A further significant matter which is evidence of remorse and which entitles the offender to leniency is the fact that he voluntarily disclosed his behaviour and thus it was as a direct consequence of his own actions that the offence on 13 October came to light. See  
        Ellis 
         (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. Quite obviously he did not initially make a complete confession to his activities and indeed he resisted a further interview after the police had spoken to his daughter in December 2000 and it then became apparent that this was not an isolated incident. However, given the tender age of the child and the well documented reluctance of victims of such conduct to come forward for many years, there is no question that the offences may have remained undiscovered for a long time, if not forever, had the offender not contacted the police as he did”. 
        
       
      
    16 The grounds of appeal relied upon by counsel for the applicant were:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to allow a sufficient and adequate discount in respect of those matters which were voluntarily disclosed by the applicant. 
        
       
       
        
        2. A less severe sentence was warranted in law”. 
        
       
      
    17 It is convenient to deal with these grounds of appeal together, because the contention that a less severe sentence was warranted in law was based on the contention that an insufficient discount had been allowed for the applicant’s voluntary disclosure of his guilt of the offences. 
     
      
    18 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that, in the passage in her remarks on sentence which I have quoted, her Honour had wrongly limited the effect of the applicant’s voluntary disclosure of his guilt of the offences to its being evidence of contrition on the part of the applicant. It was true that the applicant’s voluntary disclosure of his guilt was evidence of contrition on his part. However, it was submitted, quite apart from its effect as evidence of contrition, the applicant’s voluntary disclosure of his guilt entitled him to a separate discount or added element of leniency in sentencing, which was independent of his contrition. 
     
      
    19 It was further submitted that the applicant should have received a “significant” or “considerable” discount or added element of leniency by reason of his voluntary disclosure of his guilt and that the sentencing judge should in her remarks on sentence have made it clear that the applicant was receiving such a significant or considerable discount.  
     
      
    20 In support of these submissions counsel for the applicant referred to R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604; the judgment of Kirby J in Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 267; and R v CDH (unreported) 2002 NSWCCA 13. 
     
      
    21 On this application the Crown made various submissions. It was submitted that on 16 October 2000 the applicant had disclosed only one offence and had understated that offence as being merely an offence of indecent assault and that the subsequent disclosure by the applicant on 30 July 2001 had been made after the complainant had been interviewed by the police and had told police that she had been sexually assaulted by the applicant on a number of occasions.  
     
      
    22 It was further submitted by the Crown that, on a fair reading of the passage in her Honour’s remarks on sentence, her Honour had not limited the effect of the applicant’s voluntary disclosure of guilt to its being evidence of contrition and had considered what further leniency should be extended to the applicant under the principles stated in Ellis. 
     
      
    23 It was also submitted by the Crown that on this aspect of the appeal in Ryan Kirby J had been in a minority and this Court should apply the views, not of Kirby J, but of the majority and the majority had concluded that, although a sentencing judge should allow some discount for a voluntary disclosure of guilt, a sentencing judge was not obliged to allow a significant or considerable discount on this ground. 
     
      
    24 Having outlined the submissions made by counsel, I will proceed to determine the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    25 In a well known passage in his judgment in R v Ellis Street CJ said at p 604:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has said on a number of occasions that a plea of guilty will entitle a convicted person to an element of leniency in the sentence. The degree of leniency may vary according to the degree of inevitability of conviction as it may appear to the sentencing judge, but it is always a factor to which a greater or lesser degree of weight must be given. 
        
       
       
        
        When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilty of that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The leniency that follows a confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned”. 
        
       
      
    26 It is clear that voluntary disclosure by a person of his guilt of an offence entitles that person to a discount or added element of leniency in being sentenced for the offence, which is separate from the leniency he is entitled to for having pleaded guilty or for having demonstrated contrition. However, I do not consider that, on a fair reading of the passage in her Honour’s remarks on sentence, her Honour made the error which it was contended she had made, of limiting the effect of the voluntary disclosure of guilt by the applicant to its being evidence of contrition on the part of the applicant. Apart from the interpretation urged by counsel for the applicant, the opening words of the passage in her Honour’s remarks are open to the interpretation that her Honour was saying that a further significant matter (apart from the early pleas of guilty) was that the applicant had voluntarily disclosed his guilt and that matter was evidence of contrition and entitled the applicant to leniency under the principles stated in Ellis. Her Honour’s reference to Ellis and her discussion of the relevance of Ellis to the applicant’s case indicate, to my mind, that her Honour correctly understood the principles in Ellis, was not limiting the effect of the voluntary disclosure of guilt to its being evidence of contrition and was allowing a separate discount under the principles in Ellis. 
     
      
    27 In Ryan v The Queen the sentencing judge had said in his remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown’s case against him in relation to many of his victims rests solely on his admissions to police. His admissions show his desire to make a complete disclosure of his conduct. These things go to his credit, show his contrition and entitle him to a discount in punishment”. 
        
       
      
    28 In Ryan Kirby J said at pars 91-98:- 
     
      
       
        
        “91. I turn to the specific errors which, in my opinion, are demonstrated in the reasons of the sentencing judge which the Court of Criminal Appeal failed to detect and correct. The first of these is that the sentencing judge failed to make  
        substantial 
         allowance for the appellant’s acknowledgment of offences that were otherwise unknown to the authorities. 
        
       
       
        
        92. Clearly, it is in the public interest that the law should encourage offenders to acknowledge, and bring to official notice, offences not previously known to the authorities. In part, this interest derives from the saving of costs in the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences. In part, it is because it helps to improve the clear-up rate for crimes and vindicates the public process of punishing and deterring crime….”. 
        
       
       
        
        93. The applicable public interest also includes a growing concern of modern criminal law and practice with a consideration that is of particular relevance to a case such as the present. I refer to enlarged attention to the position of the victims of crime. A confession by an offender allows a victim a public vindication. In the particular matter of serial criminal offences against children and young persons, a confession by the offender may also facilitate the provision, where appropriate, of community assistance to the victim or the payment of compensation and an extension of greater family understanding and support. Medical reports tendered in the appellant’s sentencing proceedings indicated that some of the persons abused by him as boys were considered, years later, still to be in need of psychiatric treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        94. Unless persons such as the appellant are encouraged to bring unreported cases to notice, the likelihood is that, in the great majority of instances, such crimes will not be reported. They will therefore go unpunished. Accordingly, both from the point of view of society and of the victims of crime, there are strong reasons of policy why the law should encourage offenders to make full confessions. It should certainly not discourage them. Encouraging a full confession may also be an important first step in securing help for, and counselling of, the offender. This is, likewise, one of the objectives of criminal punishment and thus of judicial sentencing. 
        
       
       
        
        95. In  
        R v Ellis 
         it was said that a ‘considerable’ or ‘significant added’ element of leniency is required in sentencing an offender in respect of offences disclosed that were otherwise unknown to the authorities. It is true that it was accepted in that case that the precise extent of that element will ‘vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered…[and] guilt being established’ against the person concerned. But take the present case as an illustration. Many victims later named by the appellant had not come forward earlier. This was despite local publicity and the widespread knowledge that inferentially would have followed the earlier proceedings before Judge Rummery. These facts tend to suggest that most of the offences to which the appellant confessed would not have come to light at all but for his confession. This inference is reinforced, in part, by the difficulties which police experienced in securing statements from most of the persons named by the appellant in his confession. In the sentence imposed on the appellant by Judge Nield, the greater part of the minimum term of incarceration concerned offences against persons that were previously unknown to the authorities Of those persons, most were either not found or did not make any statement to police. Therefore, in respect of the offences against those persons, the appellant’s conviction and punishment effectively rested on his own admissions alone. 
        
       
       
        
        96. It follows that, in the words of McHugh J in  
        AB v The Queen 
        , (1999) 198 CLR 111 the appellant was entitled to  
        ‘considerable 
         leniency because of his confession’. The sentencing judge did not express matters in those terms. Instead, the appellant’s confession was simply considered in the context of the ‘discount’ to which a prisoner is ordinarily entitled for a guilty plea. There was no reference to  
        R v Ellis 
        . There was no indication that ‘ 
        considerable’ 
         or  
        ‘significant added’ 
         leniency was allowed. The Court of Criminal Appeal did not suggest that there had been a reference to the particular consideration of ‘lenience because of his confession’. Neither in the reasoning of the sentencing judge, nor in the resulting sentence, do I consider that the principle in  
        R v Ellis 
         was applied. It follows that, on the face of things, a specific error of sentencing principle has occurred which the appellant identified and the Court of Criminal Appeal failed to correct. 
        
       
       
        
        97. To say this is not to fall into a mistake of ascribing to the words of Street CJ in  
        R v Ellis 
        , or of McHugh J in  
        AB v The Queen 
        , a rigid or inflexible application. However, words represent images that conjure up ideas. The words ‘ 
        significant’ 
         and ‘ 
        considerable’ 
         are adjectives of degree. Prima facie a large deduction in sentence is appropriate in such a case. Otherwise, the judges concerned, when they expressed the applicable rule, could have used lesser adjectives, such as ‘modest’ or ‘minimal’ or perhaps the ever enigmatic ‘appropriate’. For a long time now it has been the law – correctly in my view – that a ‘significant’ discount should be given in a case such as the present. That is the law that should have been applied in the sentencing of the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        98. Lawyers often boast that, for the common law, even an hour of liberty lost without full lawful justification is intolerable. Where a difference between ‘credit’, on the one hand, and ‘ 
        considerable’ 
         or  
        ‘significant added’ 
         lenience, on the other, may amount, in practical terms, to an increased loss of liberty not of hours but of months or years, there is no reason, in my respectful view, to decline appellate correction. This Court should uphold the appellant’s appeal on this ground. He is entitled to a ‘considerable’ or ‘significant’ deduction in the sentence otherwise applicable by reason of his bringing to the notice of the authorities offences which were not previously known and which, but for his confession, would probably have remained unknown”. 
        
       
      
    29 However, as was submitted by the Crown on this application, Kirby J was alone in considering that the appeal should be allowed on this ground. 
     
      
    30 At par 15 of his judgment McHugh J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant’s argument based on the trial judge’s failure to indicate that he was giving the appellant ‘a significant added element of leniency’ reflects a misunderstanding of the use that can properly be made of statements by judges in other cases. Judgments are not to be read as if they were Acts of Parliament. In  
        Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome  
        (1972) AC 1027 at 1085, Lord Reid pointed out that it is not the function of judges ‘to frame definitions or to lay down hard and fast rules’. Their function is ‘to enunciate principles and much that they say is intended to be illustrative or explanatory and not to be definitive’. The statement in  
        Ellis 
         that ‘the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency’ is a statement of a general principle or perhaps more accurately of a factor to be taken into account. It is not the statement of a rule to be quantitatively, rigidly or mechanically applied. It is an indication that, in determining the appropriate sentence, the disclosure of what was an unknown offence is a significant and not an insubstantial matter to be considered on the credit side of the sentencing process. How significant depends on the facts and circumstances of the case”. 
        
       
      
    31 At par 63 Gummow said that he agreed with Callinan J on this aspect of the appeal. At par 185 of his judgment Callinan J said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant also submitted that Judge Nield failed to give due weight to the appellant’s voluntary disclosure of offences other than those with which he had been charged. But Judge Nield did state that the appellant’s admissions entitled him to a ‘discount in punishment’. The Court of Criminal Appeal observed that Judge Nield had taken into account in favour of the appellant his disclosure of offences and ‘gave him credit for that’. The appellant submitted however that he should have been given an identifiable, more substantial discount than the small unquantified one that in reality he must have been given by the sentencing judge. The appellant relied on  
        R v Ellis 
         in which the Court of Criminal Appeal said that voluntary confessions should lead to a ‘significant added element of leniency’. The fact is that in this case the sentencing judge did make it clear that he would have imposed a greater sentence but for the disclosures made. For myself I do not think good reason will always exist for an abstention from stating the quantum of such a discount. In a case in which it is one of relatively few relevant ‘subjective factors’ it may be helpful to do so, and should not interfere with the intuitive process that sentencing involves. Not to identify the discount or credit for disclosure will not generally provide a ground for appeal however and certainly does not do so here”. 
        
       
       
      
    32 At pars 152 and 153 of his judgment Hayne J said;- 
     
      
       
        
        “152. A second issue was raised in the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and to this Court. Here it was said that the Court of Criminal Appeal should have found that the sentencing judge did not take sufficient account of the fact that the appellant was sentenced for offences of which the authorities would not have known had the appellant not confessed to them. It is enough to say of this complaint that, as the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out, the sentencing judge referred specifically to this matter as going to the appellant’s credit, showing his contrition and entitling him to a discount in punishment. There is no substance in this contention. 
        
       
       
        
        153. The fact that the sentencing judge made no express reference to  
        R v Ellis 
         (to which he was referred in the course of the plea) and did not use an epithet like ‘considerable’ or ‘ significant’ when referring to the credit he gave on this account does not demonstrate error. Error could be discerned only if it could be seen that the sentence imposed was excessive….”. 
        
       
      
    33 On the basis of the judgments of the judges in Ryan who formed the majority on this aspect of the appeal, I consider that, although a sentencing judge should allow some discount for a voluntary disclosure of guilt, a sentencing judge is not required, in every case in which there has been a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the offender, to allow a considerable or significant discount because of the voluntary disclosure of guilt or to say in the judge’s remarks on sentence that the judge has allowed a considerable or significant discount on this ground. 
     
      
    34 I consider that the opinions I have just expressed are in accordance with the judgment of Smart AJ in R v Oades (2003) NSWCCA 155, with which I concurred (see especially pars 16 to 24 of Smart AJ’s judgment). The opinions I have just expressed are not in accordance with some recent two judge decisions of this Court, including R v CDH, in which, to judge from the judgments delivered, the members of the Court were referred to the judgment of Kirby J in Ryan but not to the judgments of the other members of the High Court in Ryan. 
     
      
    35 I have concluded that the sentencing judge did not make any of the specific errors alleged by counsel for the applicant. However, the question remains of whether, taking into account the applicant’s voluntary disclosure of guilt and making an allowance for it and also taking into account all the other circumstances of the case, the sentences imposed by her Honour were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    36 As noted by her Honour, the offences were objectively serious and circumstances aggravating the objective seriousness of the offences included some premeditation on the part of the applicant, the very young age of the victim, that the offences had been committed in breach of a relationship of trust and that the offences were not isolated incidents. 
     
      
    37 It is necessary to take into account, as her Honour did, the applicant’s early pleas of guilty, his contrition, that he had no previous criminal history and that he had physical disabilities which would make the conditions of his custody more onerous. 
     
      
    38 The applicant was entitled to a discount or added element of leniency in sentencing, by reason of the disclosures he made on 16 October 2000 and 30 July 2001. Her Honour found that, if the applicant had not gone to the police, the offences the applicant disclosed might have remained undiscovered for a long time, if not forever. On the other hand, the disclosure made by the applicant on 16 October 2000 was a qualified, and not a full, disclosure and the further disclosures made by the applicant on 30 July 2001 were made after the complainant had been interviewed by police and had made allegations against the applicant. 
     
      
    39 I consider that in the circumstances of the present case the applicant was entitled to a substantial, in the sense of a not insignificant, discount for his voluntary disclosure of offences he had committed. It would appear to me from her Honour’s remarks on sentence and the relatively short length of the sentences passed by her Honour that her Honour did allow such a discount. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion, taking into account the applicant’s voluntary disclosures of guilt, the sentences imposed by her Honour were within the range of a proper exercise of her Honour’s sentencing discretion and were not manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    41 In my opinion, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: I agree with James J 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Graham Sherne Totten applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 12 September 2002 by his Honour Judge McGuire for an offence of aggravated indecent assault, the circumstance of aggravation being that the victim was under the age of sixteen years, and an offence of sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and sixteen years, who was under the authority of the applicant. For the first offence his Honour imposed a sentence of a fixed term of imprisonment of eighteen months commencing on 12 September 2002 and for the second offence his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for five years four months, also commencing on 12 September 2002, with a non-parole period of four years. Aggravated indecent assault is an offence under s 61M of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for seven years. Sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and sixteen years who is under the authority of the offender is an offence under s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    3 The objective facts of the two offences can be briefly stated. The victim of both offences, who I will refer to simply as “the victim” or “the complainant”, was a girl who was born in November 1985. In about 1994 the complainant’s mother began working for the applicant in a caravan hire business he conducted and the complainant’s mother and the applicant became friendly.  
     
      
    4 On an occasion some time between January 1996 and January 1998 the complainant, who was then between ten and twelve years old, accompanied the applicant as he delivered a caravan to a customer in the course of his business. The applicant asked the complainant to move into the centre of the front bench seat of the vehicle the applicant was driving and the complainant complied. The applicant then put his hand down the front of the complainant’s shirt and on to her breast. While doing this, the applicant made a lewd comment. The applicant told the complainant not to tell her mother about the incident. This incident was the subject of the first offence charged against the applicant. 
     
      
    5 In about November 1997 the complainant’s mother entered into a sexual relationship with the applicant and in about January 1998 the applicant, the complainant’s mother and the complainant began living together. 
     
      
    6 On an occasion at some time between 1 June 1998 and 13 November 1998, when the complainant was twelve years old, the complainant accompanied the applicant to a building which the applicant used as his business premises. The applicant told a friend of the complainant, who was with her, to go to her home and he asked the complainant to go with him into the building. When inside the building, the applicant asked the complainant to go to a room, where a number of mattresses were stored. In this room the applicant spread two mattresses on the floor and told the complainant to sit on them. The applicant removed the complainant’s clothing, told her to open her legs and, when she had complied, the applicant committed cunnilingus on the complainant. After a time the applicant stopped, saying that his tongue was getting sore. The complainant dressed and the applicant took her home. This incident was the subject of the second offence charged against the applicant. 
     
      
    7 The complainant made a complaint to her mother about the applicant’s conduct but her mother did not believe her. On 11 October 1999 the complainant reported the incidents to police. The complainant went to live with her father at her father’s home. However, it was not until 14 December 2000 that police arrested and charged the applicant. After being arrested the applicant declined to be interviewed by police. On 24 August 2001 the applicant was committed for trial in the District Court. On 10 May 2002 when the applicant was arraigned in the District Court, he pleaded guilty to both offences. 
     
      
    8 Although a number of character witnesses gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence, there was actually little information before his Honour about the subjective circumstances of the applicant. As I have already indicated, the applicant had declined to be interviewed by police and he did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. In the proceedings on sentence the applicant’s counsel objected, successfully, to a tender by the Crown of a pre-sentence report about the applicant. 
     
      
    9 In his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to the few subjective circumstances of the applicant which were disclosed by the material before his Honour. The applicant had no relevant criminal history and the sentences of imprisonment his Honour was about to impose would be the first prison sentences the applicant had served. The applicant was a person of previous good character, as testified to by the character witnesses, whose evidence his Honour accepted. The applicant had had children by two previous relationships. 
     
      
    10 There was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence a victim impact statement prepared by a psychologist. In the victim impact statement the psychologist recorded that the complainant had described episodes of sexual abuse by the applicant against her from late 1997 to October 1999. While the abuse was taking place, the applicant had experienced significant difficulties in her personal life and at school, but, after going to live with her father and changing schools, “her circumstances have significantly improved”.  
     
      
    11 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that the sexual molestation of children demonstrated criminality of a high order and was aggravated when the molestation involved the breach of a relationship of trust between the victim and the offender.  
     
      
    12 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said that he would give credit for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s pleas of guilty, even though they were belated, particularly as the complainant had been saved from having to give evidence at a trial. His Honour also said that he was prepared to infer that the applicant’s pleas of guilty reflected some contrition on his part. In the absence of evidence, his Honour found it difficult to determine what the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were. His Honour said that he had considered the question of special circumstances and could find none. 
     
      
    13 On this application counsel for the applicant relied on a number of specific grounds, which I will consider in turn. I will deal firstly with the grounds which I consider can fairly readily be disposed of and will then deal with what I consider to be the more substantial grounds.  
     
      
       
      His Honour was in error in failing to take into account the length of time between the commission of the offences and the sentencing.  
       
      
    14 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that delays had occurred between (1.) the occurrence of the offences at some time between January 1996 and January 1998 and at some time between 1 June 1998 and 13 November 1998 and the victim complaining to police in October 1999 (2.), between the victim complaining to police in October 1999 and the applicant being arrested on 14 December 2000 and (3.), between the applicant being arrested and the applicant being sentenced; and that his Honour had erred in not taking those delays into account in favour of the applicant in sentencing the applicant. I note that no submission of this kind was made before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    15 It does not seem to me that the delays complained of were unusual. The time which elapsed between the commission of the offences and the making of a complaint to police was in fact much less than often occurs in the case of sexual offences committed against children. I accept that some delay did occur between the making of a complaint to the police and the police arresting the applicant. The delay between the arrest of the applicant and the sentencing of the applicant would not be an unusual delay in proceedings in which the accused person had been granted bail and did not plead guilty until he was arraigned in the District Court. 
     
      
    16 Counsel for the applicant cited R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 at 519, where Street CJ said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Moreover, where there has been a lengthy postponement, whether due to an interstate sentence or otherwise, fairness to the prisoner requires weight to be given to the progress of his rehabilitation during the term of his earlier sentence, to the circumstance that he has been left in a state of uncertain suspense as to what will happen to him when in due course he comes up for sentence on the subsequent occasion, and to the fact that sentencing for a stale crime, long after the committing of the offences, calls for a considerable measure of understanding and flexibility of approach – “. 
        
       
      
    17 The present case is clearly distinguishable from Todd. In the present case there was no evidence before the sentencing judge about any progress in the applicant’s rehabilitation; any state of suspense the applicant might have been in as to what would happen to him in the criminal proceedings would only have been between the date of his arrest and the date of his sentencing, a period of less than two years; and the applicant’s offences were not “stale” crimes, as compared with the crimes for which Todd was sentenced. 
     
      
    18 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      His Honour was in error in considering that the offences were not isolated instances 
       
      
    19 As I have already noted, in the victim impact statement which was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence the psychologist who prepared the statement said that the complainant had described episodes of sexual abuse by the applicant against the complainant, occurring from late 1997 to October 1999. 
     
      
    20 In written submissions in the proceedings on sentence the Crown submitted that the two offences were not isolated incidents, so that, while the applicant was not to be punished for offences of which he had not been convicted, the applicant lost the benefit he might otherwise have had of being sentenced for the two offences of which he had been convicted, on the basis that the two offences were isolated aberrations.  
     
      
    21 In his oral submissions in the proceedings on sentence counsel for the applicant, who is an experienced criminal counsel, referred to this passage in the Crown’s written submissions and said it was true that the offences for which the applicant was being sentenced were not isolated incidents. 
     
      
    22 On this application it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour should not have had any regard to the passage in the victim impact statement and that the concession made by counsel for the applicant in the proceedings on sentence was an “extraordinary” concession, for which there was no basis in the material before his Honour. 
     
      
    23 I would reject this ground. 
     
      
    24 Although counsel for the applicant in the proceedings on sentence objected to the tender of the pre-sentence report, no objection was made to the tender of the victim impact statement. The victim impact statement not being objected to, his Honour was entitled, under s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to receive and consider the victim impact statement, if he considered it appropriate to do so. 
     
      
    25 I do not consider that the concession made by counsel for the applicant in the proceedings on sentence was “extraordinary”. I would infer that the concession was made, only after counsel had received instructions from the applicant. Sentence proceedings are usually conducted informally and it often happens that counsel for the prisoner, on instructions from his client, makes admissions and concessions about matters which are not strictly proved by evidence. In Weininger v The Queen (2003) HCA 11 Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in their joint judgment referred at par 21 to “the well known and long established procedures in sentence hearings in which much of the material placed before the sentencing judge is not proved by admissible evidence”. 
     
      
       
      His Honour was in error to speculate about the applicant’s response after the complainant reported his conduct to her mother 
       
      
    26 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s to be noted from the victim impact statement that she (the complainant) reported the offender’s conduct to her mother yet was not believed. Presumably the prisoner had denied his sexual assaults upon her’. 
        
       
      
    27 It was submitted that there was no evidence that the complainant’s mother had ever confronted the applicant with the complainant’s allegations and there was no evidence that the applicant had denied the offences and that, accordingly, his Honour’s remark, that the applicant had denied sexually assaulting the complainant, was sheer speculation. 
     
      
    28 I would accept that there was no evidence that the applicant had denied sexually assaulting the complainant and an inference that the complainant’s mother had confronted the applicant with the complainant’s allegations and that the applicant had then denied that he had sexually assaulted the complainant was not the only inference which it was reasonably possible to draw. For example, the complainant’s mother might simply have disbelieved the complainant and not even mentioned the complainant’s allegations to the applicant. Consequently, his Honour should not have made the remark that he did. However, it could properly be inferred that the applicant had not made any admission that he had sexually assaulted the complainant. In any event, I would regard his Honour’s remark as a mere aside, which had no material effect on his Honour’s reasoning process. 
     
      
    29 I would reject this ground. 
     
      
    30 I will now turn to the two grounds of challenge to the sentences which were principally relied on by counsel for the applicant. These two grounds can conveniently be dealt with together. 
     
      
       
      His Honour was in error in declining to take into account that the applicant would be likely to serve at least some of his sentence in protective custody 
       
       
      His Honour failed to take into account the likelihood that the applicant would spend some or part of his sentence in protective custody as a consideration relevant to the issue of “special circumstances”  
       
      
    31 In the course of counsel for the applicant making oral submissions in the proceedings on sentence, the following exchange occurred between counsel and the sentencing judge:- 
     
      
       
        
        “STRATTON: Lastly your Honour if there is a term of imprisonment that’s fixed in relation to this matter my submission is that he will have to serve it on protection. I would ask you Honour to take that into consideration because-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well why would I accept that Mr Stratton? 
        
       
       
        
        STRATTON: Because that’s what happens/ 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Is it? 
        
       
       
        
        STRATTON: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Or is it what happens is that offenders of this type are put in a special section of Long Bay where conditions are substantially more advantageous than they are for the general prison population. 
        
       
       
        
        STRATTON: Well if your Honour knows that, your Honour knows more than me but that’s not surprising. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well that’s what I have – that’s what the last two times such a matter has come before me that’s what I’ve been told I don’t know. I don’t know – what I do know is that I have been told, there has been evidence before me that offenders of this type are put in with similar offenders – like offenders in a special section, there’s no protection involved, they get the advantage of not being in the general prison population, they have more advantageous conditions with regard to employment, education, rehabilitation et cetera et cetera, so if there is to be some - if I’m take that into account Mr Stratton -- 
        
       
       
        
        STRATTON: Well I haven’t drawn any evidence all I know is that I don’t make a practice of doing these cases but the last one I did – I did it before another District Court judge and he thought that was terribly important. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes I know it’s terribly important, because people do as you are doing now and I’m not suggesting any attempt to mislead because you wouldn’t do that but it’s generally accepted that that’s the situation. I’m told that it’s not the situation. 
        
       
       
        
        STRATTON: Alright okay well I’ll withdraw that, I’ll take it out…”. 
        
       
      
    32 The remark attributed to counsel for the applicant “well, I haven’t drawn any evidence” may contain a transcription error and I consider that the remark should be read as equivalent to counsel saying “well, I haven’t called any evidence (about protection)”. 
     
      
    33 In his remarks on sentence his Honour made no reference to whether the applicant would serve any part of the sentences in protective custody. 
     
      
    34 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that this Court has often said that a person sentenced to imprisonment for an offence of sexually assaulting a child is likely to spend at least part of the sentence in protective custody; that while in protective custody the prisoner will be subject to conditions of custody which are more onerous and more disadvantageous than those to which prisoners in the general prison population are subject; and that that circumstance is relevant both to determining the length of the sentence which should be imposed and to whether the sentencing judge should find that there are special circumstances such that the balance of the term of the sentence should exceed one third of the non-parole period of the sentence. Counsel for the applicant referred inter alia to R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 148 at 151 per Hunt J and R v Scott (unreported [2003] NSWCCA 28) especially at pars 21 to 26 per Bell J. 
     
      
    35 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that if, in sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge, on the basis of what he had been told in other cases or even on the basis of evidence adduced in other cases, had taken into account, to the disadvantage of the applicant, a view that the applicant’s conditions of custody would be likely to be more advantageous than the conditions of custody to which prisoners in the general prison population are subject, then his Honour was in error. 
     
      
    36 It was further submitted on behalf of the applicant that, even if his Honour had not made that first error, his Honour had been in error in not taking into account, in favour of the applicant, the circumstance that part at least of his sentences would be likely to be served on protection, both in determining the length of the sentences to be imposed and in determining whether there were special circumstances. 
     
      
    37 It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that in the proceedings on sentence counsel for the applicant had withdrawn the submission that the sentencing judge should take into account that the applicant’s sentences would be served on protection; that the sentencing judge had not made either of the errors ascribed to him; that the conditions of custody to which the applicant would be likely to be subject would be much less disadvantageous to him than the conditions of custody to which the prisoners in some of the reported cases would have been subject and that this was the point his Honour had been endeavouring to make in his exchange with counsel for the applicant; and that it could safely be inferred that an experienced sentencing judge such as his Honour would not have failed to take into account the likelihood of the applicant having to serve part of his sentence in some form of protective custody in determining whether there were special circumstances and that this circumstance did not require his Honour to make a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    38 It is the position that sentencing courts and this Court have often taken into account, in favour of a person sentenced for an offence of child sexual assault, that the whole or part of a sentence of imprisonment is likely to be served in some form of protective custody and that the conditions of that protective custody are likely to be more disadvantageous or onerous for the offender than the conditions of custody to which prisoners in the general prison population are subject. These matters have been taken into account, both in determining the length of the sentence which should be imposed and in determining whether there should be a finding of special circumstances. In many such cases there has been no evidence before the sentencing judge about the likely conditions of custody under any prison sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    39 In R v Burchell Hunt J, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, referred at p 151 to:- 
     
      
       
        
        “the well known fact… that child molesters are subjected to severe physical assaults by the inmates of the regular gaols and they usually are obliged to serve their sentences under heavy protective guard and often in isolation, even from those other inmates on protection”. 
        
       
      
    40 The use by Hunt J in this passage of the expression “well know fact” suggests that his Honour considered that the fact was sufficiently notorious for a court to take judicial notice of it, without the need for evidence. 
     
      
    41 In the recent decision of R v Scott, a decision of a two judge bench of this Court, Bell J, with the concurrence of O’Keefe J the other member of the Court, said at par 26, citing authority including R v Burchell:- 
     
      
       
        
        This Court has held that the circumstance that a sentence of imprisonment is likely to be served in conditions of protection is a matter that is relevant both to a consideration of the length of the term and to the question of whether special circumstances exist to justify a departure from the statutory proportion between the sentence and the non-parole period”. 
        
       
      
    42 In R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253, a decision of a two judge bench of this Court consisting of Wood CJ at CL and Howie J, the case turning largely on whether the sentencing judge should have made a finding of special circumstances, Howie J with the concurrence of Wood CJ at CL, said at par 20:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…but it (that the applicant is in protective custody) should be considered and taken into account on the question of whether in a particular case special circumstances exist which warrant a lesser non-parole period than the statutory relationship prescribes”. 
        
       
       
      Howie J made it clear that such a circumstance does not always require a sentencing judge to find special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. 
       
      
    43 There are difficulties in a sentencing judge taking into account a circumstance that part or all of a sentence of imprisonment is likely to be served in some form of protective custody. Taking such a circumstance into account involves the sentencing judge in making a prediction about how the offender will be dealt with in the Correctional system. The sentencing judge’s prediction may not be fulfilled. Furthermore, as Bell J pointed out in her judgment in Scott, there are within the Correctional system not just one form of protective custody with fixed conditions of custody but a number of different kinds of protective custody, the conditions of which vary considerably in the extent to which they depart from the conditions of custody to which prisoners in the general prison population are subject. Not all forms of protective custody involve the serious disadvantages referred to by Hunt J in Burchell, such as being obliged to serve the sentence under heavy protective guard and in isolation, even from other inmates on protection. In some forms of custody which are described as protective custody the prisoner is kept in a Correctional Centre or an area of a Correctional Centre in which the other inmates are prisoners who have been sentenced for similar offences and the prisoner is able to mix freely with those other inmates and to have access to programmes conducted by the Department of Correctional Services. I would agree with what Bell J said in par 34 of her judgment in Scott that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is appropriate for a sentencing court to take into account the circumstance that a sexual offender may spend his custody in conditions subject to some form of ‘protection’ status. Evidence as to the likely conditions of custody is important if the Court is to make an informed assessment of the extent to which the offender’s custody will be more onerous than that of prisoners housed in the general prison population. The concerns of which Hunt J spoke in  
        Burchell 
         would seem to be significantly lessened for sexual offenders who are placed in special facilities such as the MSPC…”. 
        
       
      
    44 Notwithstanding the difficulties in a sentencing judge taking into account, especially without the benefit of evidence, a circumstance that part or all of any sentence of imprisonment imposed is likely to be served in some form of protective custody, I consider that it is a well entrenched principle that it is a circumstance that a sentencing judge should take into account, in favour of the prisoner, both in determining the length of the sentence to be imposed and in determining whether there are special circumstances. That a sentencing judge may not have expressly referred to this circumstance in his or her remarks on sentence should not necessarily give rise to an inference that he or she has failed to take the circumstance into account. What weight the circumstance should be given will depend very much on all the circumstances of the particular case. 
     
      
    45 In the present case I do not consider that the sentencing judge made the first error ascribed by counsel for the applicant, that is that the sentencing judge took into account, to the disadvantage of the applicant, a view he had formed from what he had been told in other cases or from evidence in other cases, that the applicant’s conditions of custody would be likely to be actually more advantageous than the conditions of custody to which prisoners in the general prison population are subject. However, I do consider that his Honour did make the second error ascribed by counsel for the applicant, that is that his Honour did not take into account, in favour of the applicant, the circumstance that part at least of the applicant’s sentences would be likely to be served in some form of protective custody, both in determining the length of the sentences and in determining whether there were special circumstances. 
     
      
    46 It is true that in the proceedings on sentence counsel for the applicant withdrew his submission about the likelihood of a prison sentence being served on protection but, in my view, counsel withdrew this submission, only after the sentencing judge had made it plain that the submission had no prospect of success and after the sentencing judge had intimated that, if he did take into account the circumstance that a sentence would be served on protection, he might take the circumstance into account in a way which would be disadvantageous to the applicant. I am satisfied from the terms of the exchange between the sentencing judge and counsel that the sentencing judge rejected the submission made by counsel “I would ask your Honour to take (that the prisoner will have to serve the sentence on protection) into account”. Contrary to a submission made by the Crown on this application, his Honour was not merely making the point that there are different kinds of protective custody which vary in the degree to which they are disadvantageous or onerous. 
     
      
    47 As I consider that his Honour failed to take into account a relevant factor, his Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried and it is necessary for this Court to determine what sentences should be imposed on the applicant and in particular whether lesser sentences should be imposed. 
     
      
    48 The Court received some additional evidence on the basis that it would be admissible in any re-sentencing of the applicant. 
     
      
    49 In an affidavit by the Deputy Superintendent of the Metropolitan Special Programme Centre (MSPC) Long Bay the Deputy Superintendent said in part:- 
     
      
       
        
        “5. The Applicant in these proceedings was placed on protection on 12 September 2002. This protection order expired on 11 December 2002. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The Applicant is not currently on protection, however, he is accommodated in Area 5 of the MSPC which is a designated SMAP (Special Management Area Placement) area. These areas accommodate inmates who are all convicted of a similar offence. In the case of Area 5 and Area 3 in the MSPC, all inmates are sex offenders. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Whilst accommodated in Area 5 in the MSPC, the Applicant has full access to the services offered by Education, AOD, Welfare and Psychology. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The inmates in this area also have the opportunity to be employed in a number of industries based with the MSPC, such as, the Textile Unit, the Technology Unit and the Food Services Unit. Employment is also offered as domestic sweepers in the Centre”. 
        
       
      
    50 Records were produced by the Department of Corrective Services showing that the applicant had not been moved from the Junee Correctional Centre to the MSPC Long Bay until 28 May 2003 and that while he had been at the Junee Correctional Centre the applicant had not had access to any programmes. 
     
      
    51 In an affidavit by the applicant, on which he was not cross-examined, the applicant said that he had spent the first three days of his custody at the Bathurst Correctional Centre in a non-association cell and had not been allowed out of the cell. He had spent the next two weeks of his custody in a strict non-association pod at the Bathurst Correctional Centre. On 29 September 2002 the applicant had been transferred to the Junee Correctional Centre. At the Junee Correctional Centre he was placed in a pod where he could mix with other prisoners. 
     
      
    52 The applicant said in his affidavit that on or about 29 October he had noticed that other prisoners were staring at him and he was accused of being a “rock spider”. He telephoned his sister and was informed that an article about his case had been published in a newspaper. On the advice of a prison officer, the applicant locked himself in his cell. 
     
      
    53 The applicant said in his affidavit that he was in a strict protection pod between 29 October 2002 and 28 May 2003. During this period he was too frightened for his safety to use a recreation area and he did not take part in any programmes or courses.  
     
      
    54 The applicant accepted in his affidavit that the conditions of custody in the MSPC were much better than they had been at Junee. In the area in which he is housed there are only sex offenders, there is no harassment and the applicant has taken some courses. 
     
      
    55 I consider that the evidence establishes that the applicant’s conditions of custody, at least for the first eight months of his sentence, were more onerous and disadvantageous than the conditions of custody of prisoners in the general prison population.  
     
      
    56 A report by a psychologist which was prepared before the applicant was sentenced but which was not tendered in the proceedings on sentence was admitted in this Court, in the event of the Court re-sentencing the applicant. In the report the psychologist expressed the opinion that the applicant has a borderline personality disorder and should receive very close monitoring and supervision by the Probation and Parole Service over an extended period of time. 
     
      
    57 I have referred to the objective facts of the offences and certain subjective circumstances of the applicant earlier in this judgment. I have now referred to the further evidence this Court admitted as relevant to re-sentencing. I have taken into account the matters referred to in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have concluded that a somewhat lesser sentence should be imposed for the principal offence and that the Court should find special circumstances in the applicant having served at least the first eight months of his sentence in more than usually disadvantageous conditions of custody and in the applicant’s need for close monitoring and supervision by the Probation and Parole Service after he is released on parole. 
     
      
    58 In my opinion the following orders should be made:- 
     
      
    59 1. Leave to appeal granted. 
     
      
    60 2. Confirm the first sentence imposed by his Honour, that is the sentence of eighteen months commencing on 12 September 2002 for the offence of aggravated indecent assault. 
     
      
    61 3. Quash the sentence imposed by his Honour for the offence of sexual intercourse with a child between the age of ten years and sixteen years and in lieu thereof the applicant should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years commencing on 12 September 2002, with a non-parole period of three years six months commencing on 12 September 2002 and expiring on 11 March 2006. The earliest date on which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole would be 11 March 2006. 
     
      
    62 O’KEEFE J: I agree with James J.

    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of heroin. He also asked the sentencing judge to take into account, on a Form 1, a related offence of supplying a commercial quantity of cocaine. He was sentenced to imprisonment for eleven years and three months to date from 3 August 2000, when he was taken into custody, with a non-parole period of eight years and six months. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
    3 The facts are helpfully summarised in the written submissions of the Crown and I do not understand there to be any dispute with that summary of the facts on the part of senior counsel for the applicant. It is sufficient to say that the applicant was involved, at a managerial level, in a major drug trafficking enterprise over a period of some four months. He was not the principal in the enterprise but his role does not appear to have been very much less than that of a principal. The drugs were actually sold by other offenders but they were supplied to those offenders by the applicant and he maintained a supervisory role over them. 
     
      
    4 Over the relevant period about four kilograms of heroin were sold and a very substantial quantity of cocaine. On any view of it the two offences, and in so saying I include the cocaine offence on the Form 1, were very serious. 
     
      
    5 The learned sentencing judge was of the view that the appropriate starting point for sentence was fourteen and a half years. However, his Honour had regard to the applicant’s plea of guilty and his finding that the applicant had exhibited a degree of remorse. He also had regard to some assistance which the applicant had rendered to the authorities. The evidence of that was before his Honour in the form of a sealed envelope from the New South Wales Crime Commission. 
     
      
    6 In the light of the plea, the remorse and the assistance, his Honour reduced the sentence which he would otherwise have passed to eleven years and three months, a reduction of about twenty-two and a half per cent. 
     
      
    7 The document from the New South Wales Crime Commission records that much of the information supplied by the applicant was already known to the Commission. Other information was of such a general nature that it was unable to be verified. Nonetheless, the Commission passed such information as could be verified on to other law enforcement agencies and accepted that the applicant’s attempts to provide assistance were genuine. It should be said, however, that the applicant declined to give evidence against the principal in the drug distribution enterprise for which he stood for sentence. 
     
      
    8 One of the applicant’s co-offenders, one of the persons actually involved in the sale of the drugs, was also dealt with by his Honour and he appealed to this Court. For reasons which the we have found persuasive, the name of the applicant will not be published and, for the same reasons, it is preferable not to name the co-offender. That offender had been sentenced by his Honour to imprisonment for ten years with a non-parole period of seven and a half years. This Court reduced the non-parole period of that offender to six and a half years, in large part to achieve a measure of parity with yet another offender, also one of the sales persons who had been dealt with. The co-offender’s antecedents were relevantly similar to that of the present applicant and he had, like the present applicant, pleaded guilty. The Court which heard that appeal expressed the view that his plea of guilty should merit a reduction of something of the order of twenty per cent. He, unlike the applicant, had not provided assistance to the authorities. It should be noted that the non-parole period which this Court fixed in respect of that offender was about sixty-five per cent of the head sentence. 
     
      
    9 Mr Odgers SC for the applicant submits, firstly, that his Honour’s overall reduction of the sentence otherwise appropriate by some twenty-two and a half per cent for the factors to which I have referred is simply inadequate. Mr Odgers submits that that is so when the matter is viewed in isolation, but he submits that that view is reinforced by the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal who dealt with the co-offender, that Court expressing the view that that offender was entitled to a discount of twenty per cent purely for the plea of guilty, without the added factor of assistance to the authorities. 
     
      
    10 Mr Odgers also submits that the present applicant would have a justified sense of grievance when his non-parole period is compared to that imposed upon the co-offender by this Court. In the present case the sentencing judge found no special circumstances and fixed a non-parole period in accordance with the normal statutory proportion, whereas, as I have said, the co-offender had the benefit of a non-parole period which was only some sixty-five per cent of the head sentence. 
     
      
    11 In so far as this application turns upon a comparison of the disposition of this applicant and that of the co-offender, relying upon the familiar principles relating to parity of sentence, I am unpersuaded that this Court should intervene. The fact is that the role of the present applicant was very much more serious than that of the co-offender and an assessment of the present applicant’s criminality bore not only upon the appropriate head sentence but, of course, also on the non-parole period. 
     
      
    12 In so far as the application asserts generally that his Honour’s discount of some twenty-two and a half per cent for the factors to which I have referred was inadequate, I must say that, on the face of it, that submission has some force. 
     
      
    13 The applicant’s assistance to the authorities was by no means as significant as one sees in some cases but it was of some significance. A discount of some twenty-two and a half per cent is certainly modest as a recognition of that assistance and the applicant’s remorse, as his Honour found it, and of the plea of guilty. It certainly would have been open to his Honour to have allowed a greater reduction of sentence for that combination of factors. On the other hand, it must be said that it would equally have been open to his Honour to have fixed a considerably higher starting point for sentence before any such reduction was made. 
     
      
    14 The view which I have reached at the end of the day is that, within the terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, no less a sentence than that which his Honour passed is warranted in law. I say so because of the obvious gravity of the offence on the indictment, coupled with the offence on the Form 1, and the very significant role which the applicant had to play in that episode of criminality. 
     
      
    15 It is for those reasons that I am of the view that leave to appeal should be granted but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    16 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree. 
     
      
    17 SULLY J: I too agree. 
     
      
    18 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant was sentenced by Coolahan DCJ after pleading guilty to two offences of supplying the prohibited drug, methylamphetamine, contrary to s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for each offence is imprisonment for 15 years. His Honour sentenced the Applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) With respect to the supply on 4 October 2001 of 19.68 grams of methylamphetamine, imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of three years from 15 January 2002 and the non-parole period to expire on 14 January 2005 
       
       
      (2) With respect to the supply of 21.32 grams of methylamphetamine on 16 January 2002, imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of four and a half years from 15 January 2004 and the non-parole period to expire on 14 July 2008. 
       
      
    2 With respect to the second count certain matters on a Form 1 were taken into account being two offences of goods in custody and one of self-administer drugs. 
     
      
    3 As a consequence of the manner in which his Honour cumulated the sentences, the Applicant was sentenced to a total period of eight years with an effective non-parole period of six years and six months. She would be eligible to be considered for release on parole on 14 July 2008. 
     
      
    4 With respect to each count the non-parole period is 75 per cent of the head sentence in accordance with statutory ratio. However, by reason of the manner in which the sentences were cumulated, the effective non-parole period is just over 80 per cent of the effective head sentence. 
     
      
    5 On 4 October 2001 police executed a search warrant at the Applicant’s home in the suburb of Nelson Bay. They found 54 small resealable dealing bags of methylamphetamine located in her bedroom, either in her handbag or under her pillow. During the search other items were located indicating a course of preparing to supply, including numerous plastic resealable bags, scales with powder residue on them, and $1,952 in cash, despite the Applicant’s unemployed status. The Applicant refused to make any comment and spent one day in custody and was granted bail with respect to the first charge. 
     
      
    6 Three months later on 16 January 2002, whilst the Applicant was still on bail on the first charge, police again searched her house. Whilst the premises were under observation a number of persons were seen entering and leaving. 
     
      
    7 When the police entered they found on the premises the Applicant, her eldest son Brett Roby, and a man called Glen Brown, who the Applicant later told police had resided in the house for four to five months. On this occasion 60 resealable plastic bags of methylamphetamine were found. One was retrieved from a flushing toilet into which Brett Roby had thrown an unknown number. Another 14 were found in the pocket of Glen Brown. Some 40 others were found concealed in the hollow section of tubing attached to a plant stand in the kitchen and a number were found in the Applicant’s handbag. The plastic bags and powder found in the tubing of the plant stand were identical to the bags and powder found in the Applicant’s handbag. $590 in cash was also found in the handbag. 
     
      
    8 In a record of interview, where she selectively answered questions, the Applicant admitted ownership of the 14 plastic bags that were found in Brown’s pants pocket. She said that he had taken possession of these bags from the dining room table at the time the police entered the premises to execute the warrant. 
     
      
    9 During the sentence hearing the Applicant did not give evidence. Her youngest son, Shannon Roby, gave evidence of longstanding abuse of drugs by her and her comparative ill health. This was to be contrasted with one of the questions she chose to answer during the record of interview in which she denied drug dependency but did state that she had used drugs and had snorted “a quarter of a weight” the morning before. 
     
      
    10 Two of the matters on the Form 1 were her admission of administering the drug to herself and the cash of $1,952 found in her handbag on the first occasion. The third matter on the Form 1 was the $590 found in her possession on the second occasion. 
     
      
    11 His Honour was correct to conclude on the basis of the evidence that the Applicant was “actively involved in the supply of amphetamines for reward” and “she was an active drug dealer in the Nelson Bay area”. His Honour also noted that the commission of the second offence on bail was an aggravating factor. Disregard for the law was demonstrated by her criminal history. 
     
      
    12 The Applicant was at the time of sentencing 54 years of age. Her first drug offence was recorded in 1986 for cultivation, possession and use of Indian Hemp. In 1994 she was sentenced for the supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine and other drug matters. Her sentences were reduced on appeal, the longest comprising a minimum of four years and an additional term of three years. It was less than 12 months from the expiry of the full term of that sentence that the offender committed the first of the offences presently before the Court. 
     
      
    13 The decision of this Court in the first appeal was before the sentencing judge. His Honour noted the significance of the earlier sentence in the finding by the sentencing judge, upheld by this Court, that the Applicant was then genuine in her intention never to offend again and what was described by the sentencing judge on the first occasion as an “extraordinary subjective case”. 
     
      
    14 That personal background included the suicide of a person whom she then believed to be her mother in circumstances where her mother blamed the Applicant and the boy raised as her brother. The father, who was a serving member of the Army, when he returned home supported the proposition that the children were to blame for the suicide. 
     
      
    15 Upon migration to Australia as a teenager, she had associations and marriage with a series of men and was brutalised by her male companions. There were other distressing aspects throughout her life and periods of prostitution. 
     
      
    16 The cumulative affect of all of these matters was such that Grove J in this Court supported the sentencing judge’s finding that the subjective case was quite “extraordinary”. The sentencing judge on the first occasion indicated that he would find special circumstances by reason of that history, but varied the statutory proportions to a quite small degree. This Court upheld her appeal in this regard. The total term of seven years was not varied but the minimum term component was reduced from five years to four years. 
     
      
    17 These matters were before Coolahan DCJ in the present proceedings. His Honour referred to them in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “... The Court of Criminal Appeal maintained a finding of special circumstances made by the learned sentencing judge based upon strong subjective circumstances, which in my view  
        can no longer be of any relevance so far as these offences are concerned 
        , and also by a belief of the sentencing judge that she had strong prospects for rehabilitation, something which has also proven to be incorrect.” 
        
       
      
    18 The Applicant submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. There was no aspect of the objective circumstances of the offences upon which the Applicant relied in this regard. Indeed, nor could any such reliance be placed. His Honour was entitled to approach the sentencing task on the basis of his finding that the Applicant was a “trafficker to a significant degree” and had “for many years ... been running a drug dealing business for reward”. 
     
      
    19 The Applicant relied on what was said to be a failure on the part of his Honour to give appropriate recognition to the subjective case of the Applicant, particularly in the way it had been accepted by this Court on the previous occasion. It was also submitted that his Honour failed to give weight to the prospect of rehabilitation in determining the relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
     
      
    20 Given the history of the matter, it was, in my view, open to his Honour to refuse to give significant weight to the prospects of rehabilitation, about which there was only evidence from the Applicant’s son before him. It was, in view of the history, open to his Honour to conclude, as he did: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not prepared ... to accept that she is either remorseful or has any intent to remain crime free in the future.” 
        
       
      
    21 On this appeal the Applicant gave oral evidence before this Court that she had participated in drug counselling whilst in custody. This is a hopeful sign, but given the history one cannot give significant weight to the prospect of rehabilitation. One hopes that the combined effect of the counselling and the personal deterrence involved in a significant period of custody will have that effect. The past history suggests that that hope may very well be disappointed but, nevertheless, it is a matter that is entitled to some consideration in the decision of this Court. 
     
      
    22 The issue of rehabilitation was put by the Applicant’s counsel in terms of the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. The sentence actually imposed allows a period of 18 months under supervision. A longer period under supervision may have been appropriate in the case of a person whose conduct was driven by addiction or otherwise. However, what his Honour did by allowing for 18 months was well within the reasonable range of the exercise of his discretion on the circumstances of the case before him. 
     
      
    23 The evidence that has been given in this case on this appeal, which was not before his Honour, is a matter to be taken into account only if the Court decides that his Honour did err in some respect and the Court has to re-sentence the Applicant. 
     
      
    24 Contrary to the submissions on behalf of the Applicant, I do not understand his Honour to have rejected the evidence given by her son as to the Applicant’s drug use. What his Honour did was to refuse to accept that such evidence as there was of her use, which he did not doubt, was not such as to put her in a category where she should be sentenced on the basis that she was a user/dealer who conducted the activities to fund her own habit, as distinct from making a profit. His Honour was entitled to reject any such inference and to conclude that she had been running the drug dealing business for reward. His Honour was entitled to sentence her on that basis. 
     
      
    25 Where, as here, an offender has received the benefit on one occasion of a finding that the prospects of rehabilitation were such that a sentence, otherwise suggested by the objective circumstances of the offence should be reduced, then on a subsequent occasion after re-offending such assertions of the prospects of rehabilitation must be treated with some scepticism and given little, if any, weight. 
     
      
    26 I am, however, concerned with his Honour’s flat rejection of the continued “relevance” in any way of the Applicant’s personal circumstances, on which the sentencing judge and this Court relied, in the sentencing task on the previous occasion. I can accept that such a personal background is entitled to less weight in the sentencing task and that the requirements of general and personal deterrence are entitled to more weight, on a subsequent occasion, but that is not, however, what his Honour appears to have done. He asserted that the personal subjective circumstances of a tragic early personal history were completely irrelevant. Whilst I agree they are entitled to less weight, I do not agree that they should be regarded as entirely spent, as his Honour appears to have done. 
     
      
    27 I would not myself, but for this error, have regarded the sentences actually imposed as manifestly excessive, but I do believe by determining that the Applicant’s personal history was no longer of any relevance in the sentencing exercise before the Court, there was a legal error entitling this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    28 For the reasons summarised in his Honour’s remarks on sentence, which it is not necessary to fully set out, the head sentences imposed on each count are appropriate and I would not intervene. In my opinion, no lesser penalty is warranted in law pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    29 However, the effect of the way in which his Honour cumulated the sentences is such as to fix the period of release under supervision as 18 months. In the event that has the effect of creating a relationship between the effective head sentence and the effective non-parole period of about 80 per cent when, with respect to each individual offence, the sentencing judge refused to vary the statutory ratio of 75 per cent. 
     
      
    30 Although I would not disturb his Honour’s factual finding that the Applicant was not a person driven to dealing by reason of addiction, there are other reasons why a longer period of supervision on parole may be appropriate. She will be over 60 years when released to the community and will need assistance to adjust to life without the need to resort to illegal means of obtaining money. 
     
      
    31 In my opinion, a period of two years of supervision on parole would be appropriate in the light of all of the subjective circumstances. The longer period of being at risk if she should re-offend will also provide more time to develop a settled crime-free lifestyle. Notwithstanding the scepticism, which I share with the sentencing judge as to her present intention to reform her ways, the Court is entitled to act on the basis that the experience of at least six years in detention will have the effect of personal deterrence that is intended. 
     
      
    32 The possibility that she will move away from the Nelson Bay area to reside near her son, Shannon Roby, in the way he described in his evidence, will unquestionably assist her, should she pursue that course. 
     
      
    33 Although, as I have said, I would not disturb the head sentences specified by the sentencing judge, I would vary the sentence on the second count by reducing the non-parole period by six months. The effective non-parole period will then be 75 per cent of the effective head sentences. 
     
      
    34 Accordingly, the orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      2. Sentence on Count 1 affirmed. 
       
       
      3. Sentence on Count 2 quashed and the following substituted: 
       
       
        
        “Six years imprisonment to commence on 15 January 2004 and to expire on 14 January 2010, with a non-parole period of four years to commence on 15 January 2004 and to expire on 14 January 2008”. 
        
       
      
    35 SULLY J: I am of the contrary opinion. I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal against sentence. I can put my position in that regard simply and as follows: 
     
      
    36 The learned sentencing Judge at p6 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence says this: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentences which were imposed upon (the applicant) for the prior offences, clearly and absolutely had no deterrent effect whatsoever. Within a relatively short period of time the offender was back in the drug trafficking business. As I said she has shown persistent disregard for the law."" 
        
       
      
    37 It was not contended, - and as I respectfully think a contention to the contrary could not have been maintained, - that there was any error in any of those perceptions on the part of his Honour. 
     
      
    38 Given that background, it seems to me that this Court is not warranted, even assuming the presence of error as identified by his Honour the Chief Justice, in now intervening in a way that has the effect of adjusting the proportion between the stipulated parole and non-parole periods from something like 80 percent to something like 75 percent. 
     
      
    39 It seems to me that an intervention of that kind, if not, perhaps, in a precise semantic or conceptual sense an example of tinkering, is all of a piece with an intervention that would properly be characterised as tinkering. 
     
      
    40 It seems to me that a level-headed view of this applicant’s situation comes down simply to this. If she is going to, as it were, turn herself around and lead, upon release, a drug free life, 18 months will be more than sufficient to put to the test the resolve which she now says she has in that regard. If she is not, in truth, going to turn herself around in 18 months, then I fail to see how the additional six months of supervision is likely to make any, or any significant, difference to that state of affairs. 
     
      
    41 For the whole of those reasons, and even assuming the presence of error in the analysis of the learned sentencing Judge, I am not persuaded that a case has been made out for intervention by this Court. I would, therefore, favour the orders that I stated a moment ago. 
     
      
    42 HIDDEN J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    43 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as I indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 IPP JA: This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a decision by Robison DCJ refusing to admit the evidence of a statement by one Vikram Gujral. 
     
      
    2 The three respondents are facing trial in the District Court on three charges. The third count on the indictment is that each of the three accused on 13 May 2001 at Fairfield, being then armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a shotgun, did rob Vikram Gujral of certain property, namely a large number of mobile telephones, as well as telephone accessory kits, the property of Mayne Nickless Limited. 
     
      
    3 The statement of Mr Gujral tendered by the Crown is crucial to the Crown case. Without that evidence the Crown will not be able to prove the charge. 
     
      
    4 At the trial the Crown submitted that Mr Gujral’s statement was admissible under either s 65 of the Evidence Act 1995 or s 289 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Robison DCJ refused to admit the statement. Section 65(1) of the Evidence Act which provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact”. 
        
       
       
      The expression “taken not to be available” is defined in the Dictionary to the Act. Clause 4(1) of Part 2 of the Dictionary provides: 
       
       
        
        “4(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if: 
        
       
       
        
        .... 
        
       
       
        
        (e) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or to secure his or her attendance, but without success”. 
        
       
      
    5 The respondents put in issue the question whether the Crown had taken all reasonable steps to find Mr Gujral and secure his attendance. 
     
      
    6 Section 65(2) of the Evidence Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) .... 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 The respondents put in issue whether the statement was taken in circumstances that made it unlikely that the facts asserted therein were fabricated. 
     
      
    8 As regards the availability of Mr Gujral, the police made extensive inquiries as to his whereabouts within Australia and, in my view, there can be no criticism of the steps they took in that regard. 
     
      
    9 Robison DCJ was concerned about the fact that the police had not made inquiries as to Mr Gujral’s whereabouts in India. This was relevant, as Mr Gujral left Australia on 28 August 2001 aboard a Malaysian Airlines flight for that country. 
     
      
    10 On behalf of the respondents, it was forcefully submitted that the police had been neglectful in only commencing their inquiries on 26 July 2003. The trial commenced on 5 August 2003 and, as I have pointed out, Mr Gujral had left Australia nearly two years before that date. 
     
      
    11 I accept the submission that the police should have commenced making their inquiries at a far earlier date, particularly having regard to the fact that the case was listed for trial last year. However, any inquiries made by the police at a time earlier than August 2001, as regards Mr Gujral’s whereabouts in Australia, would have proved to be fruitless. 
     
      
    12 The information as to Mr Gujral’s whereabouts in India is non-existent. It is not even known in which city he resides. It would have been a lengthy and expensive task for the police to make appropriate inquiries as to his whereabouts in that country. In my view it was not incumbent on the police to make inquiries in India. I do not mean to suggest, in expressing this view, that the police would never be required to attempt to ascertain the whereabouts of a witness, once it was learned that that witness was in another country. In the particular circumstances of this case, however, where nothing was known as to the individual’s address or business or family, and where the country concerned was as large and as populous as India, I think it is understandable that the police did nothing more. 
     
      
    13 Thus, in my opinion, the delay on the part of the police in making inquiries does not constitute a failure to take reasonable steps within the meaning of cl 4(1) of Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    14 Robison DCJ raised another consideration, namely, the purported lack of evidence as to the ability of Mr Gujral to speak and understand the English language. This, it seems to me, is a consideration relevant to s 65(2)(b) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    15 The only grounds on which it was suggested that Mr Gujral may not be fully competent in the English language is that he has an Indian name, travels on an Indian passport and left Australia for India. In this day and age I do not think that these matters are sufficient in themselves to give rise to any relevant doubt as to a person’s ability to speak English. Of course, it would be open to a person seeking to oppose the admission of a statement under s 65 of the Evidence Act to adduce some evidence casting doubt on a proposed witness's grasp of English. Once there was some evidence to this effect, the burden would then be on the party seeking to tender the statement to prove that the maker properly understood and spoke English. There is no such evidence in this case. The only matters raised are those to which I have referred. Moreover, there is nothing in the content of the statement itself which suggests that the words are not the very words spoken by Mr Gujral himself. In his statement, Mr Gujral repeats words used by the persons robbing him. These persons were speaking English. There was no suggestion on his part that he could not understand what they were saying. 
     
      
    16 In my view, Robison DCJ’s reliance on some lack of ability on Mr Gujral’s part to speak and understand English was misplaced. 
     
      
    17 In the written submissions put on behalf of the respondents, reference was made to the prejudice the respondents would sustain were the statement to be admitted. Particular attention was drawn to the assertion in Mr Gujral’s statement that he saw a car with a registration number “similar to AJ-12A”. 
     
      
    18 Another charge faced by the respondents involves the theft of a motor vehicle registered AJP-13A, which took place a few days before the stealing from Mr Gujral. I accept that Mr Gujral’s statement about the registration number is a matter of considerable significance to the Crown case on that count. Nevertheless, I do not consider that that fact constitutes relevant prejudice for the purpose of determining whether the statement should be admitted. 
     
      
    19 In all the circumstances, I consider that Robison DCJ erred in his discretion in refusing the admission of the statement. I propose that an order be made that the order made by his Honour, ruling that the statement of Vikram Gujral dated 13 May 2001 was not admissible in evidence, be vacated. 
     
      
    20 GROVE J: I agree. 
     
      
    21 DOWD J: I also agree. 
     
      
    22 IPP JA: The order of the Court will be as proposed by me.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: Harry Robinson appeals against his conviction at the Supreme Court Sydney on 20 April 2000 of the murder of John Thomas Kennett. On 16 June 2000 Justice Graham Barr sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a term of twenty-two years commencing on 12 December 1999 and expiring on 11 December 2021. His Honour set a non-parole period of fifteen years. The appellant will therefore become eligible to be released on parole on 11 December 2014. 
     
      
    2 The appellant was arraigned before his Honour and a jury of twelve at the Supreme Court Sydney on 3 April 2000 upon an indictment containing one count, namely the murder of John Thomas Kennett (to whom we shall refer as “the deceased”). The trial followed an earlier trial in the preceding March which culminated in the discharge of the jury. Neither counsel for the Crown nor counsel for the appellant before this Court were counsel at the trial. 
     
      
    3 The offence allegedly occurred at the Junee Correctional Centre on 17 September 1998. The deceased was serving a sentence imposed for several sexual offences committed upon young boys during his time as a teacher. This fact became known among fellow inmates at the centre, of whom the appellant was one. The deceased was therefore classified as a paedophile. On the day of the offence, the deceased was bashed in his cell. He received injuries, principally upon the head, from which he died. The Crown case was that the appellant killed the deceased by punching him, and, when the deceased went to the floor, “stomped” on his head repeatedly. There was no issue at the trial that the deceased was murdered. The issue was whether the appellant was responsible. 
     
      
       
      Summary of the Evidence. 
       
      
    4 The Crown Prosecutor called five persons who were prisoners at Junee at the time of the offence. Generally, the testimony of this group included evidence as to the appellant entering the deceased’s cell and attacking him, and statements made by the appellant before and after the murder. DNA evidence was called as to the presence of DNA on the sole of one of the appellant’s Nike runners consistent with being that of the deceased. Other evidence related to separate comments, claimed by the Crown to constitute admissions, made by the appellant to a Correctional Service Officer, Phillip Bouffler and to a Police Prosecutor, Senior Constable Barron, when he was taken to the Wagga Wagga courthouse. 
     
      
    5 The fellow inmates called by the Crown were Mathew Digby who deposed that he had actually seen the appellant attacking the deceased in the deceased’s cell. Secondly, Noel Roach, who gave evidence implicating the appellant. Thirdly, Franciscus Soonius, a Dutch national who also gave evidence implicating the appellant. Fourthly, Leendert Van Hofwegan, also a Dutch national, who also gave evidence implicating the appellant. 
     
      
    6 The fifth inmate witness was one Mark Brazel whose evidence was such that the Crown was given leave to cross-examine him as an unfavourable witness. 
     
      
    7 The area of the Junee Correctional Centre which is relevant to the present appeal is B Unit, which is also referred to as B Pod. It is classified as “normal protection”. B Pod is divided into four parts, A, B, C and D. Each inmate has his own cell. There are two levels. The bottom level consists of cells numbered individually B1 to B16. The top level consists of individual cells numbered B17 to B32. On each level the cells are against two walls at right angles to each other. On the ground level there is a shower block. There are two stair wells running from the top level to the ground level. Telephones are also located on the ground level. 
     
      
    8 With one exception the inmates to whom reference was made in the evidence were housed in cells on the top level. 
     
      
    9 The first witness called by the Crown was Matthew Digby (B25). He deposed that shortly after 5 pm on the evening of Thursday, 17 September 1998 he was in the cell occupied by Leo Tonelli (B23). Also present were Terry Johnson (B7), another person identified as “another Mat” and Damien Hopper (B30). They were drinking home brew and playing the guitar and cards. Digby said he was not drinking. At some stage Terry Johnson left the cell and went to the cell of the deceased (B20). 
     
      
    10 Digby also noted that other inmates in the cell were Noel Roach (B24), Mark Brazel, Mark Johnson, a person named Michael and the appellant. They appeared to be reading statements. The deceased was not present. 
     
      
    11 Digby overheard discussion initiated by Brazel to the effect that they had to get rid of the deceased out of their section of the gaol.  
     
      
    12 The inmates then all left the cell. 
     
      
    13 Shortly thereafter Digby saw the appellant and Brazel enter the deceased’s cell, walking single file. The cell door was closed and Digby looked through the glass observation window in the door. He observed the deceased lying on the floor and both the appellant and Brazel bending over and punching him. Brazel was punching the lower part of the body and the appellant was punching the head. The deceased did not try to defend himself in any way. Following the punching he observed the men kicking the deceased. Digby said: “Harry was, like, stomping kind of on his head and Brazel was kicking into his stomach kind of.” 
     
      
    14 He thought that the appellant stomped on the deceased’s head no more than twenty times. Digby said he was stunned. 
     
      
    15 The door then opened and the two men walked out of the cell. Digby said that the appellant grabbed him and said: “What am I doing kind of and got me to get going”.  
     
      
    16 Digby said that the appellant was wearing “gaol greens”. He was wearing shorts and Digby noticed that he had an elastic support on one of his knees. He said that he was wearing black shoes but could not say what kind of shoes. He then identified black running shoes (which had been removed by investigating police officers from the appellant’s cell later that evening) as being “like the same kind of shoes”.  
     
      
    17 The alarm was activated and a female correctional officer went to the deceased’s cell. She screamed and radioed for assistance. Other correctional officers then came to the scene. All the inmates were then locked in cells, not necessarily the cell which they normally occupied. 
     
      
    18 Whilst the locking up process was going on Digby said that the appellant came up to him and said: “Just that he was spewing up that he couldn’t jump on his head properly because of his sore leg.” 
     
      
    19 About this time, according to Digby, the appellant “was yelling out, you know, compliments: ‘Sucko, Rocky’”. “Rocky” or “Rock Spider” are colloquial terms for a paedophile. 
     
      
    20 Digby said that later that evening the appellant passed him a note which had written on it “Just not to say anything, be cool, you know, be sweet; when the officers come around don’t say anything”. He burnt the note and put it down the toilet after he had read it. 
     
      
    21 A few weeks or so after the incident Digby was taken to the correctional centre at Kirkconnell. Digby there spoke to a psychologist and then made a statement to the police setting out his version of what had happened on the evening in question.  
     
      
    22 A considerable amount of the cross-examination of Digby was directed to the suggestion that Terry Johnson was the person responsible for the murder. This was denied by Digby. 
     
      
    23 The Crown also called Noel Roach who had been a fellow inmate with the appellant at either Bathurst or Goulburn Correctional Centres prior to their both being at Junee together. He was aware that the appellant suffered from a disability in his right knee which required him to wear a knee brace. 
     
      
    24 On the afternoon of September 17 1998, Roach was with a group of fellow inmates playing cards in Evan Collier’s cell (B28). Also present were the appellant, Terry Johnson, Troy Erskine and Matthew Digby. 
     
      
    25 Terry Johnson entered the cell with some tobacco which he said that he had got “from his boyfriend”. This was a reference to the deceased. When it was suggested to Johnson that he should repay the deceased, Roach said that his response was “he wasn’t sure because he believed he (meaning the deceased) was a joy rider”. This is another colloquial term for paedophile. 
     
      
    26 Terry Johnson then left the cell and went to the deceased’s cell where he obtained copies of transcripts of legal proceedings involving the deceased which contained references to his being involved in sexual relations with young males. 
     
      
    27 After some discussion the appellant said “that he was going to go thump him”. This prompted Roach to indicate that the card game was over. He picked up the cards and walked out of the cell. 
     
      
    28 Roach returned to his own cell and was watching television. He then heard “tremendous loud thumps”. He said “about four or five”. He looked outside his cell and saw Digby standing close to the deceased’s cell door. No-one else was in the vicinity on the landing. 
     
      
    29 Roach then returned to his cell. Later, on the landing he saw inmates milling around. Someone said: “The cunt’s not getting up”. In response, the appellant said: “That he couldn’t stomp on his head hard enough because he has a sore knee”. 
     
      
    30 Roach said that from what he remembered at the relevant time the appellant was wearing “a black pair of old work boots”.  
     
      
    31 Franciscus Soonius, a Dutch national, was also called by the Crown. He was housed in cell B22, two cells down from the deceased’s cell. On the afternoon of 17 September he heard conversations taking place on the landing of the top floor of the wing outside cell B26 (the appellant’s cell) “about what the deceased was in custody for”. Terry Johnson was also there. 
     
      
    32 The witness saw Johnson searching for paperwork in the deceased’s cell. The paperwork was located and it was being read in the appellant’s cell. The witness heard conversation emanating from the cell that the deceased was a “rock spider” and “we must get rid of him”. The appellant was present when these words were uttered.  
     
      
    33 Later that afternoon the witness was standing with Leo Van Hofwegan (B29) on the landing outside cell B29. From this position the witness had a view of the landing outside cells B17 to B23. 
     
      
    34 Mr Soonius’ evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can you tell the Court exactly what you saw at that time? 
         
        A. I saw two persons walking up to Mr Kennett’s cell. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you recognise either of those two people? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who were they? 
         
        A. One was Harry Robinson and the other one was Mark Brazel. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Had you seen him before? 
         
        A. I had seen him before but I didn’t know his name at that time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have learnt his name since that time? 
         
        A. Since that time I have learnt his name. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was he housed in that area? 
         
        A. No, he was housed in the A section. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. They were walking together, or separate? 
         
        A. No, together. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where did they go to? 
         
        A. To Mr Kennett’s cell. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see Mr Kennett at any stage? 
         
        A. I could see Mr Kennett in front of the cell. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened then? 
         
        A. There was a very short conversation and then Mr Kennett stepped in his cell and Mr Robinson and Mr Brazel stepped in too. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I take it the door was open at that stage? 
         
        A. The door was open at that stage. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did something happen in relation to the door? 
         
        A. Not at that moment. First I could hear some scraping of a chair. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Scraping? 
         
        A. Yeah, some noise of -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were those cells equipped with furniture? 
         
        A. We have got plastic furniture 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do I take it from that, you are talking about a plastic chair? 
         
        A. Yeah, plastic chairs. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say you [heard] the scraping of this? 
         
        A. Yeah, scraping of it. That’s it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened then? What did you hear next, or see next? 
         
        A. I heard something hard hit something hard and I heard a noise from something hard hit something hard. Could be anything. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was the door of the cell open, or closed at this stage? 
         
        A. The moment we heard the bang, the door closed completely. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You told the Court about the scraping noise of the chair? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was the door open at that time, or closed at that time. If you don’t know just simply say you don’t know? 
         
        A. I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Could you see anything happen in Mr Kennett’s cell, from where you were? 
         
        A. No, not when the door closed. You couldn’t see nothing any more. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you, after the door closed, did you hear anything else happening in Mr Kennett’s cell? 
         
        A. Yeah, you could hear that there was a kind of struggle going on. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you hear any particular noise? 
         
        A. Yeah that noise, that something hard hit something else hard. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was the next thing you saw? 
         
        A. The next thing I say saw was the face of Mr Brazel coming to the window of the door again, to probably open the door but the door was closed and so that face turned back out the window again to go to – there is a button in the front of the window in the cell, where you can push a button and four, five seconds you go to the door, open the door yourself. So he had to go back to open the door with the button, with the buzzer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You saw his face initially. He turned? 
         
        A. Yes, he turned. I can see nothing any more. Then I saw him come back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I take it from what you tell the Court the door was open? 
         
        A. The door opened again and they walk both out. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what is your recollection of which direction they went? 
         
        A. I saw Harry and somebody, not next to him, but somebody with him walking back on the balcony. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. This is what direction? 
         
        A. In the direction of my cell. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about, was anyone moving in any direction? 
         
        A. I thought Mr Brazel went straight away up (sic) the stairs in front of Mr Kennett’s cell, walked downstairs, but I am not sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You mentioned three people. You say Mr Robinson appeared to walk, as I understand your evidence, with somebody else is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see when this other third person got into the area of Mr Kennett’s cell? 
         
        A. No, not really. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t notice that person? 
         
        A. No, I was not looking at him, let’s say that way. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How were you feeling at this point of time? 
         
        A. I was very nervous. I knew something, what happened. I was feeling nervous. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And after you saw the two people walk along towards your cell and other man leave, I take it you were still in that general area near the balcony outside? 
         
        A. Yes, but I was going back to the cell, inside the cell. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you actually go back inside? 
         
        A. Yes, I went back inside. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Leo was still inside? 
         
        A. Leo was still inside. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you see Leo out on the balcony? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about the man, David Young? 
         
        A. Yes, but he went also inside again. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Right and I take it there was some conversation when you got inside. I don’t want you to tell the court about that? 
         
        A. Yes, I had conversation in English first and then in Dutch. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And after that, what happened next? 
         
        A. Just when I talked to him I had small conversation in Dutch with Leo and how much after that I don’t know, but Harry brought some pot into the cell. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I want you not to tell the court what he said if he said anything. I want you to tell the Court what he did initially? 
         
        A. He went for coffee can (sic). 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where was that situated? 
         
        A. Good question, where was it at that moment. I think on the bench. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say he went to the coffee can? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You meant he went and grabbed the coffee can? 
         
        A. Yes, he went to grab the coffee. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Prior to taking the coffee did he ask if you could have some coffee? Just say yes or no? 
         
        A. No, he didn’t ask anything. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then after he got the coffee did he have a conversation at that time with Leo? 
         
        A. Yes, he little bit apologised that he grabbed the coffee without asking. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And I think he said, ‘Please give me some coffee’. Listen to these words. I don’t want you to say anything else. Did he say those words? 
         
        A. Yes, he said that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And then did he say something else and then did he say, ‘I did it. I hit, I knocked him. He is unconscious’? 
         
        A. That’s what he said. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. ‘I knocked him’? 
         
        A. ‘I knocked him’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. ‘He is unconscious’? 
         
        A. He is unconscious’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was Mr Young still present when those words were said? 
         
        A. Yes, he was present. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did Mr Robinson appear at that time? 
         
        A. He was fairly nervous. That is what he said too. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you notice what he did in relation to the coffee? 
         
        A. He put it in his cup. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he use one spoon or two? 
         
        A. Two spoons, I think. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he actually stay there and have the coffee at that time? 
         
        A. No, he didn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. By that, I take it, he walked? 
         
        A. He walked out. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he come there with a mug? 
         
        A. Did he come with a what? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. With a coffee mug? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He brought one into the cell? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And at that particular time he was in quite close proximity to you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you tell the Court if you noticed what he was wearing, Mr Robinson? 
         
        A. Yes, he was wearing not the gaol issue greens, but some darker sweater and shorts. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Greens, I think green is the uniform? 
         
        A. Light green, but, say, dark green. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I take it we can say prisoners, if they have green shorts of their own, are entitled to wear their own green shorts? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is what happened on this occasion, Mr Robinson was wearing his own green shorts? 
         
        A. Yes, correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about his footwear? Do you recall what he was wearing on his feets (sic)? 
         
        A. Black shoes, I call them basketball shoes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what about any other item of clothing or anything he was wearing? 
         
        A. Yes, he had a brace around his knee. He had some knee problems. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember which knee it was? 
         
        A. It is a long time ago, 18 months ago, but I thought it was his right knee. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you describe this type of brace to the court? What colour was it? 
         
        A. It is a blue elastic brace.” (T119-122) 
        
       
      
    35 The Crown called Leendert Van Hofwegan, who was housed in cell B29. He confirmed that Soonius was in his cell with him around 5 pm. Soonius went outside the cell and the witness then heard a big bang. After the bang Mr Soonius walked back into the cell. About thirty seconds later the appellant came into his cell and asked for coffee. The appellant said: “I just bashed a rock spider ... and that the cunt is unconscious”. 
     
      
    36 Later that evening, just before they were locked in, the witness was alone in his cell when the appellant came in and asked for a bit of tobacco. The witness gave it to him and asked him if the man was dead. The appellant hit the wall with a clenched fist on the notice board on the wall and said: “Fuck”. He then had to leave because the officers were at his cell to lock him in. 
     
      
    37 The Crown called Mark Brazel, who, at the relevant time, had been an inmate of cell B4 of A pod and had access to B pod. Reference has already been made to the evidence of Digby implicating Brazel in the death of the deceased.  
     
      
    38 In his evidence in chief Mr Brazel was referred by the Crown Prosecutor to a lengthy ERISP between the witness and police officers at Junee Police Station on 28 September 1998. Brazel responded that it was “all fictional and I made the whole thing up”. 
     
      
    39 After Brazel gave evidence on the voir dire, his Honour granted leave to the Crown Prosecutor pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 to treat the witness as an unfavourable witness. His Honour also granted to the witness a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act granting him privilege against self incrimination in other proceedings. 
     
      
    40 In cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor the witness was referred to the record of interview to which we have made reference. Particular attention was directed to question 19 in which the witness was asked what he knew about John Kennett. He replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I seen a few prisoners geeing ... um ... Harry up ... a prisoner. And I seen him storming off towards the bloke’s cell.” 
        
       
      
    41 The answer continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Umm ... I followed Harry ... a couple of ... say five, six seconds later, I was following him. I’ve heard a couple of loud bangs and I’ve walked into the cell and I said, ‘What are you doing Harry”. By this time the man was knocked out in his chair ... um ... and I’ve heard a bang behind me and the door shut, and I’ve seen Harry hit him once around the head, temple area and I’ve seen him kick him twice, really hard in the side of the head. And I’ve grabbed Harry by the back and shook him and that and said ‘what are you doing mate. Common (sic), get out of here. He’s had enough.’ And ... umm ... when he looked at me his eyes had rolled back in his head and I sort of spun out a bit.” (T176) 
        
       
      
    42 The witness insisted that the above answer was untruthful. 
     
      
    43 In cross-examination the witness was directed to further statements in answers to police officers’ questions which implicated the appellant in the murder of the deceased. All such answers were contended by the witness to be untrue.  
     
      
    44 His Honour admitted the contents of the statement as evidence implicating the appellant, if the jury accepted that what the witness told the police officers was truthful. 
     
      
    45 During the course of addresses, the Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury that they should accept such material as the truth. Defence counsel contended, however, that the jury should not accept any part of the statement as being true.  
     
      
    46 At no stage during the course of his evidence did Brazel deny that what was in the statement was material which he had told the police officers. One will never know of course whether the jury accepted the Crown’s contention. If the jury did accept that what Brazel had said to the police officers was the truth, then of course it was very damning evidence against the appellant.  
     
      
    47 No other inmates were called by the Crown. However, the appellant called David Young, who was housed in cell B14. This witness gave evidence that at about 7.30 pm on the evening of 17 September 1998, he was in Van Hofwegan’s cell with Soonius also present. The appellant came in and asked for a cup of coffee. The appellant said: “I think a rockie has just been crushed, belted”. [“Crushed” is prison jargon for belted.] Soonius said to him, “Who did it?”. The appellant replied, “I don’t know”.  
     
      
    48 Soonius then said, “Did you do it?”. The appellant replied, “No”. 
     
      
    49 Young said that when the appellant came into his cell at 7.30 pm, he had on a pair of thongs, a knee guard and shorts and a shirt. 
     
      
    50 The appellant was taken to Junee Police Station on 18 September 1998. After having exercised his right to silence, the appellant was charged at approximately 2 pm that day. 
     
      
    51 On 19 September at about 4 pm Correctional Officer Phillip Bouffler with officers Uebel and Hindmarsh were responsible for escorting the appellant to the police cells at Wagga Wagga and then to the immediately adjacent Wagga Wagga Local Court. They travelled in a Ford Falcon station wagon. 
     
      
    52 Bouffler gave evidence that during the journey the appellant said to him, “I didn’t do it but I’m taking the rap for it”. Bouffler replied, “That’s pretty stupid”.  
     
      
    53 After the Local Court hearing, the appellant was leaving the police cells whilst handcuffed. According to the witness, the appellant said, “When do I receive my medal?”.  
     
      
    54 The witness made no contemporaneous notation of the conversations. His evidence was given purely by recollection. 
     
      
    55 Senior Constable David Barron was the “on-call prosecutor” for Wagga Wagga Court on 19 September. He was present when the three correctional officers escorted the appellant from the police station to the courthouse, via an alley running between the two. He described in evidence a roller door which can be lowered and block the view of the public to the alleyway. As they walked through the alleyway, he said to the appellant, “That’ll be down on Monday”, indicating the roller door. The appellant replied, “What for the cameras?”. Barron said, “Yeah, I’ll make sure it’s down on Monday for you”. The appellant then said, “Do I get my medal then? That’s what I should get, that I knocked him”. 
     
      
    56 Shortly thereafter Barron, according to his evidence, wrote down on a piece of paper in the court room the remarks which had passed between him and the appellant, and placed the paper in a police file. Whilst in the court waiting for the Duty Magistrate to arrive, Barron deposed that the appellant said to him, “I don’t know why you’re prosecuting me. You should be thanking me.” Barron said that he made a note of the comment on the police file. On the following Monday he typed up a formal statement. We shall refer to certain aspects of Constable Barron’s evidence subsequently. 
     
      
    57 Robert Goetz, the senior forensic biologist with the Division of Analytical Laboratories, gave evidence that he received a blood sample of the deceased and various samples from the appellant. He also received a pair of Nike runners, a T-shirt, shorts, rugger shorts, sloppy joe and hair that came from the Nike runners. 
     
      
    58 Mr Goetz determined that the hair was not suitable for DNA analysis because it did not have a root or follicle. He obtained preliminary results for blood on the Nike runners and the T-shirt. He could not detect any blood on the other items of clothing. He determined that the blood on the T-shirt did not come from the deceased. There was no blood on the left shoe. He found three small areas on the sole of the right shoe which gave positive results for blood. There was no blood on other areas of the shoe. It was possible that if someone had trodden in blood and left damp prints in blood over the surface they were walking on, and then came and walked over it, that would be sufficient to leave prints. 
     
      
    59 Mr Goetz conducted DNA testing on those areas of staining underneath the shoe and it was his opinion that there was a mixture of DNA which came from two people. He also conducted then a testing on the sample of blood coming from the deceased. He said that the deceased could not be excluded as being a contributor to that blood.  
     
      
    60 Mr Goetz then gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. If I may look at that in a different way, it is quite clear in your mind there are two people’s DNA on the shoe? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If we take one possibility of it being Mr Kennett’s and somebody else’s and another possibility of being two people neither of whom are Mr Kennett, can you tell the jury the sort of odds of that occurring? 
         
        A. Yes, I have calculated these. It is approximately a million times more likely to have found this in fact came from Mr Kennett and an unknown than from two unknown individuals. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you tell us step by step how you came to that result, it involves mathematics? 
         
        A. Yes, it does. It requires a knowledge of the different frequencies of the different DNA types I detected and then working out the two hypotheses you brought up, the chance of finding that profile it came from Kennett and an unknown, and the second hypothesis what is the probability if it came from two unknown people in the population. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You work it out from a base sample of the population at large? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It is a system which has been recorded as providing a reliable source of information for you in your calculations? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It is quite a large sample of people in the population? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You then calculate the odds for one probability and the odds for the other? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You combine -- 
         
        A. Combined one with the other and came up with the answer of a million.” 
        
       
      
    61 In cross-examination Mr Goetz (inter alia) gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. If someone walked in blood they transferred an area and left a bit of blood there and someone touched it with their shoe you could see? 
         
        A. Yes, qualifying the blood was wet when the person walked with these shoes into this stain. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So it is a question of time? 
         
        A. That’s correct.” (T384-385) 
        
       
       
      The Appellant’s Case. 
       
      
    62 In written submissions to this Court the appellant’s case was summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “11. The Appellant’s case may be summarised as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        The Appellant did not give evidence at his trial. 
        
       
       
        
        It was the Appellant’s case that the witnesses Soonius and Van Hofwegan came forward to obtain a benefit, some special treatment in the prison system, perhaps some reduction in their sentence. (p38) 
        
       
       
        
        In cross-examination of Mr Digby it was suggested that he was asked by Mr Johnson to stand outside the cell of the deceased and keep watch. Mr Digby gave evidence that he knew Terry Johnson to be a violent man and that he had tried to seek sexual favours from the deceased and that he was being ‘geed up’ by other prisoners about this. He agreed that Terry Johnson was angry when they found out that the deceased was a rock spider. He also agreed that Mr Johnson had been drinking alcohol on that day. Mr Johnson told Mr Digby that he spat on the body of deceased. He also stole the deceased’s watch when he was in the shower (p45). He said that Mr Johnson had asked everyone to keep watch as a cockatoo. He couldn’t remember hearing any noise come from the cell of the deceased. (p54)” 
        
       
      
    63 Reliance was also placed on the evidence of David Young set out above. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal. 
       
      
    64 In all there were fifteen amended grounds of appeal filed on 24 April 2003. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 2: Directions on prison informers and accomplices. 
       
      
    65 It is convenient to deal with the first two grounds of appeal together. Ground one is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The directions given by the learned trial Judge on the approach that the jury should take to the evaluation and assessment of the evidence of prison informer witnesses were inadequate by reason of their failure to meet the standards established by the High Court of Australia in  
        Pollitt v The Queen 
         (1993) 174 CLR 558 and insufficient to satisfy the requirements of s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995.” 
        
       
      
    66 The second ground is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The directions given by the learned trial Judge on the approach that the jury should take to the assessment of the evidence of witnesses who might reasonably be regarded as accomplices were inadequate and insufficient to satisfy the requirements of s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 regarding the directions on the potential unreliability of the evidence of witnesses who are criminally concerned in the events the subject of the charge.” 
        
       
      
    67 The relevant passages from his Honour’s summing-up with regard to the first two grounds of appeal are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It will be apparent to you that some of the witnesses who gave that evidence were also inmates of the prison. Some others were not. Mr Barron was not. He was a police prosecutor you will remember on duty on the Saturday following and the prison officer Mr Bouffler was not. His duty was to take the accused to and from the Court for the purposes of charging and bail application. 
        
       
       
        
        I want to say something to you about these kinds of witnesses and about this kind of evidence. First of all, I want to deal with the evidence of prison informers. You will appreciate that each of the witnesses, Digby, Roach, Soonius, Van Hofwegan and Young, was an inmate at the prison, and Mr Brazel. The experience of the Court demonstrates that evidence from prison informers is potentially unreliable because such witnesses are first likely to be of bad character and motivated to fabricate evidence against an accused person by the perception perhaps of a likely benefit in their sentence or by reason of pressure put upon them in the prison system that may not be apparent to you the jury. It will be quite clear I think from the evidence of prisoners and what you have seen of the prison that there was a relatively large number of young men living in that prison in a fairly closely confined area. It was a fairly close social group and you can imagine that if pressure were put upon a member of it, that pressure might be in all the circumstances hard to resist. You have heard about prison culture. You have heard about pressure against people dobbing in their mates. You have heard the expression ‘dog’ used several times during this trial but there might be pressure the other way, pressure of which you do not and cannot know. You should understand that those things might possibly operate on the mind of a prison informer, a person who gives a statement to the police and comes and gives evidence in a court, and for those reasons, as I say, the evidence is potentially unreliable. 
        
       
       
        
        I think you must be aware, if you are not generally at least from some of the evidence that has been given in this case, that it is possible for a prisoner, who assists the authorities in a formal way such as giving evidence in a serious criminal trial such as this one to obtain benefit, to put up a case to the authorities perhaps to lessen his sentence or to deal with him in some favourable way. There is no secret about that; it is something that is officially and properly done because it is in the interests of the community to encourage such people to give evidence in a manner that assists the administration of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        Because for the reasons that I have given you the evidence of a prison informer is potentially unreliable, it is necessary for you to be cautious about relying on evidence and to scrutinise it very carefully. Now, there [defence counsel] has pointed to Mr Soonius and Mr Van Hofwegan in particular and says that you should conclude that they gave their evidence in anticipation of receiving some benefit in the way that they were officially dealt with in the prison system. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not know that there is any evidence that Mr Soonius actually received a benefit. There is evidence that Mr Van Hofwegan did. You remember he got ten months taken off his sentence. The point may not be what actually happened, however, but what was in the mind of the person when that person decided to assist the police, give a statement and in due course come to Court and give evidence, what was in the mind of the prisoner at the time.” (S/U 24-26) 
        
       
      
    68 And later: 
     
      
       
        
        “When a prison informer gives evidence of admissions like these, it is necessary for me to warn you that in the absence of substantial confirmation by independent evidence that each such admission was made, it is dangerous to convict the accused on the evidence of the witness concerned. Independent evidence of the kind that is desirable is not likely to be provided by other prison informers because they are likely, for the same reasons, to be motivated to concoct their evidence as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, there is evidence of admissions which is given by witnesses who are not prison informers, namely, Senior Constable Barron and Mr Bouffler. Police and Correctional Service Officers do not fall into a special category of witnesses who, by their very nature, may be unreliable, so I do not give you any special warning about the treatment of their evidence. However, the evidence of Mr Barron and Mr Bouffler still has to be approached by you with caution for the reasons I have given you about admissions generally, that they are very easy to fabricate, virtually impossible to test and difficult to refute. 
        
       
       
        
        The final warning I have to give you about witnesses whose evidence may be unreliable because of the position they find themselves in are those who may reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events out of which the charge arose. It is a matter for you as the judges of the facts whether any witness was criminally concerned in the attack on the deceased. [Defence counsel] submits to you that two of them were, namely, Mr Digby and Mr Brazel. The Crown agrees about Mr Brazel; disagrees about Mr Digby. 
        
       
       
        
        I give you this warning: If you think that a witness was criminally concerned in the attack on the deceased, you should understand that the evidence of that witness may be unreliable because such a witness has a motive to try and minimise his own part and shift the blame from himself by putting the blame on to somebody else or exaggerating the part played by that other person. Such a witness may also fabricate evidence because of dislike of the accused or to get some revenge on him for some reason and for these reasons you should scrutinise such evidence very carefully. 
        
       
       
        
        I think it will be obvious to you that this warning applies to any witness whom you think was criminally concerned in the events. Both counsel agree, and it seems pretty obvious, that Mr Brazel was criminally concerned in the events so you will have to heed this warning so far as you consider Mr Brazel’s evidence. Whether this warning applies to Mr Digby’s evidence, however, depends upon the view you take of him, whether he was criminally concerned, and I will come back to deal with the respective arguments about Mr Digby but I can summarise them just for the moment by saying that [defence counsel] says that he was not there by accident, just sticky-beaking, that is unbelievable, but that having first offered to Mr Johnson to bash the deceased he accepted the invitation to go and be the cockatoo, if he was there.” (S/U 28-29) 
        
       
      
    69 The Crown conceded that all witnesses who were prison inmates “fall into the category of prison informers” (SU 15). 
     
      
    70 The leading case on the appropriate warnings to be given to a jury in respect of evidence of prison informers is, of course, Pollitt v The Queen (1991-1992) 174 CLR 558. 
     
      
    71 The relevant principles as enunciated by the various members of the High Court are conveniently set out in the headnote at 560-561, the relevant portions of which we set out hereunder: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of prison informers 
         
         
        Per  
        Brennan, Dawson and Gaudron JJ. In all but the exceptional case it is necessary for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting on the evidence of a prison informer unless it is corroborated by other evidence connecting or tending to connect the accused with the offence charged. ( 
        Per Brennan J 
        . A warning is required to be given whenever one is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of a miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case.) 
         
         
        Per  
        Deane, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ (and semble Brennan J). In cases where the issue is whether the informer has given an account of a conversation or incriminating conduct, that did not occur, to be of real use, the warning must be in terms which direct attention towards the need for material which substantially confirms the actual making or doing of the confessional statement or incriminating conduct. 
         
         
        Per  
        Deane J. The warning as to the likely unreliability of the evidence of a prison informer should be moulded to fit the circumstances of the case. There will be cases where the minimum necessary warning will be in unqualified terms which draw attention to the fact that the evidence is of its nature potentially unreliable, which stress the need for very careful scrutiny of it and which warn that it would be dangerous to base a conviction on it. 
         
         
        Per 
         Toohey J. The warning should be couched directly in terms that it is dangerous to convict upon the evidence of a prison informer, that such evidence should be scrutinized with great care and that the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, having regard to the potential unreliability of the evidence of a prison informer and the risk of a miscarriage of justice by attaching too much importance to it. The direction should be properly tailored to the circumstances of the particular case. This will ordinarily require the judge to refer specifically to those facts that are likely to render the evidence of the witness unreliable. 
         
         
        Per 
         McHugh J. A jury must ordinarily be directed that it is dangerous to act on the evidence of a prison informer where his account is not substantially confirmed by independent evidence. Only in the most exceptional circumstances, if at all, could the evidence of a fellow prisoner be regarded as independent evidence. Further more, the jury should be warned not only of the inherent or general danger of acting upon the evidence of a prison informer but, where appropriate, instructed to consider any specific matters which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the credibility of the witness. Its attention should also be drawn to any matters which could reasonably be regarded as confirming the evidence of the prison informer. 
        
       
       
        
        Per 
         Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ (and semble Brennan J). There is no rule of law or practice that evidence which attracts a corroboration warning cannot corroborate or be corroborated by other evidence attracting the same warning.” 
         
        
       
      
    72 Additionally, McHugh J said at 616: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        McKinney 
         (1990-1991) 171 CLR at 476, this Court held that a trial judge was bound to direct the jury that: 
         
         
          
          ‘they should give careful consideration as to the dangers involved in convicting an accused person in circumstances where the only (or substantially the only) basis for finding that guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt is a confessional statement allegedly made whilst in police custody, the making of which is not reliably corroborated.’” 
           
          
         
        
       
      McHugh J then emphasised in  
      Pollitt 
       (at 616-617) that such a direction was required even though the Court made it plain that there was no suggestion (at 478) “that police evidence is inherently unreliable or that members of a police force should, as such, be put in some special category of unreliable witnesses” (citing  
      McKinney 
       478). Further, because evidence by prison informers is inherently unreliable, it follows that a confession allegedly made to a prison informer must be the subject of a direction at least as stringent as that required when a disputed confession is alleged to have been made while the accused was in police custody. 
       
      
    73 Following Pollitt, this Court in R v Clough (1992) 28 NSWLR 396 considered appropriate directions to be given to juries in respect of the evidence of prisoner informants.  
     
      
    74 At 405, Hunt CJ at CL (with the concurrence of Carruthers and Mathews JJ) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) Evidence of a prisoner informant that the accused has confessed his guilt to him is potentially unreliable because: 
        
       
       
        
        (i) the witness is likely to be of bad character; 
         
        (ii) the evidence is easily concocted; 
         
        (iii) The witness is likely to have been motivated to concoct such evidence either: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) by his perception that he will derive some benefit in terms of sentence, treatment or release from custody if such evidence is given, or 
           
          (b) by reason of pressures upon him – which may not readily be apparent to the jury – arising from his prison environment, where conventional standards of conduct are replaced by a culture in which values such as truth and respect for the rights of others have little relevance; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (iv) there is usually no way in which the accused can meet such evidence except by his own denial.” 
        
       
      
    75 And further, at 406: 
     
      
       
        
        “(5) The traditional direction given in relation to the evidence of accomplices – that it is dangerous to convict upon their evidence unless it is corroborated in that  
        usual 
         sense – is not appropriate in relation to the evidence of a prisoner informant. Indeed, because of the usual availability of such corroborative evidence in such cases, a warning in those terms may mistakenly convey to the jury an invitation to accept the evidence that the confession was in fact made by the accused to the prisoner informant. 
        
       
       
        
        The various judgments delivered in  
        Pollitt v The Queen 
         discuss different aspects of the nature of the direction to be given wherever the Crown places significant reliance upon such evidence of a prisoner informant. It must be said (with due respect) that they are not always wholly consistent. Considerable assistance is nevertheless given, both in those judgments and in the joint judgment in  
        McKinney v The Queen 
         – where similar emphasis was placed upon the issue as to whether the confession was in fact made rather than upon corroboration in the usual sense. 
        
       
       
        
        The direction to be given must be moulded to fit the circumstances of the particular case, and not follow any set formula. It should, however, include warnings: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that the experience of the courts over the years has demonstrated that the evidence of such witnesses is potentially unreliable, together with the explanation as to why that is so; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that it is for that reason necessary to scrutinise the evidence of the particular witness in question with great care; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that, in the absence of substantial confirmation provided by independent evidence that the confession was in fact made, it is dangerous to convict upon the evidence of that witness; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) that such independent evidence is unlikely to be provided by a fellow prisoner, because he is likely to be motivated to concoct his evidence for the same reasons; and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) that, having regard to the potential unreliability of the evidence, there is a risk of a miscarriage of justice if too much importance is attached to it. 
        
       
       
        
        The judge must as well instruct the jury to consider any specific matters which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the credibility of the witness.” 
        
       
      
    76 Hunt CJ at CL concluded (at 406-407): 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, the judge should also draw to the jury’s attention any matters which could reasonably be regarded as confirming the evidence of the prisoner informant. Finally, the judge should direct the jury that, notwithstanding the absence of corroboration of the fact that the confession was made, they may nevertheless convict the accused upon the evidence of the prisoner informant if, after taking all of those warnings into account, they remain satisfied by that evidence beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    77 Since the above two cases were decided, the Evidence Act 1995 has come into operation. Section 165(1) includes as “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”: 
     
      
       
        
        “(d) Evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding, and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) Evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer.” 
        
       
      
    78 The Dictionary does not define “prison informer”. 
     
      
    79 Counsel for the appellant referred us to the judgment of Batt JA in the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Brooks (1999) 103 A Crim R 234 at 252 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, it was held by a majority of the Justices in  
        Pollitt 
         that, in cases (of which this was one) where the issue is whether a prison informer has given an account of a conversation or incriminating conduct that did not occur, to be of real use, a warning that must be given to the jury of the danger of convicting on the evidence of a prison informer unless corroborated, must be in terms which direct attention towards the need for material which substantially confirms the actual making or doing of the confessional statement or incriminating conduct.” 
        
       
      
    80 Counsel for the appellant rely particularly upon the above passage because it does not draw any distinction between incriminating conduct and incriminating conversation. Secondly, it emphasises the need to look for independent evidence which confirms that words were said or things were done.  
     
      
    81 It was submitted that the risk of a jury not appreciating the culture of the prison environment was high. The chance of an innocent person being wrongly accused is, therefore, high. The need to give a comprehensive warning is therefore much greater. Having regard to all of the considerations above, it was submitted that, in order to meet the requirements of s 165, the directions and the warning to the jury must achieve the following objectives: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) They must identify the witness who has the particular characteristic requiring a warning and identify those parts of the evidence of the witness upon which the Crown relies to establish its case against the accused person. 
         
        (2) They must inform the jury that the experience of the courts has demonstrated that evidence of a particular kind given by the witness may be unreliable. 
         
        (3) They must inform the jury of the reason, and more usually, all the reasons, why the evidence in question may be unreliable. 
         
        (4) They must inform the jury of the need to subject that part of the evidence of the witness which supports the Crown case to careful scrutiny: see  
        Jamieson, Elliott and Blessingdon 
         (1992) 60 A Crim R 68 at 76 and  
        R v Baker 
         [2001] NSWCCA 151 at [27]-[28]. 
         
        (5) They must identify any specific matters which undermine the credibility of the witness in a manner whereby the authority of the trial judge is used to impress the significance of the matter on the collective mind of the jury: see 
         Domican v The Queen 
         (1991-1992) 173 CLR 555 at 562. 
         
        (6) They must warn the jury that in the absence of substantial confirmation provided by evidence which is independent in a true sense, it would be dangerous to convict the accused on the basis of that evidence. 
         
        (7) They must in the case of prison informers, warn the jury that in order for there to be substantial confirmation it is not sufficient that two or more prisoners tell the same story, for the opportunity for concoction is clear and the conditions within a prison are fertile for making false allegations; and finally 
         
        (8) They must, in the case of a prison informer, convey to the jury all of the matters referred to above in  
        Clough 
        , together with the additional matters referred to above. 
        
       
      
    82 Generally, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that his Honour did not adequately comply with the well established principles set out in the cases to which reference has been made. The directions did not, it was said, provide the complete guidance required for a jury in order to guard against the risk of miscarriage of justice by reason of the evidence of prison informer witnesses.  
     
      
    83 Specifically, it was contended that there was insufficient discussion of the “pressure” that may be felt by a person in a prison environment, and the nature of the risk that false evidence may emerge from that environment. Although his Honour referred (at SU 25) to “pressure of which you do not and cannot know”, it is argued that this was oblique in the extreme. The jury needed to be told of the different forms of pressure which might be productive of unreliable or deliberately false evidence. 
     
      
    84 It was submitted that it is not enough to direct a jury in general terms about “the prospect of a discount” or “pressure”. Where available, the detail needs to be spelt out in order to inform the jury of matters of which they have no knowledge: see R v Sullivan [2003] NSWCCA 100 at [96]-[97]. 
     
      
    85 Further, it was argued that the directions given do not distinguish between the evidence given by the prison informers which was favourable to the appellant and that which supported the Crown case. Indeed the evidence of Mr Young, which is almost entirely favourable to the appellant is treated in equivalent terms to those witnesses whose evidence supports the Crown case. Similarly the evidence of Mathew Digby, Noel Roach and Mark Brazel, some parts of which are favourable to the appellant, and some parts of which are favourable to the Crown, are the subject of a general warning rather than a warning fashioned in a manner which distinguishes the different parts of their evidence. 
     
      
    86 The directions, it was argued, did not convey with sufficient force, and “an unmistakeable and firm voice”, the message that it would be dangerous to convict on this evidence unless there was some independent support for its truth and accuracy. The directions as a whole, it was submitted, do not give the jury a clear warning that the evidence of the prisoner witnesses may have been concocted for the purpose of protecting the true perpetrators of the crime. 
     
      
    87 Thus, applying Sullivan it was argued that the directions about Mr Soonius and Mr Van Hofwegan should have pointed out the extent of reduction in sentence that each of these prisoners was seeking by their co-operation with the authorities. Mr Van Hofwegan received an actual discount of ten months from the sentence that was imposed on him in the District Court. The directions speak of a “reward”, a “reduction in sentence” or a “benefit”. The actual reduction is not expressly referred to as the ten month period by which his sentence was reduced until a later stage in the summing-up. Perhaps the most important point is that each of these men was seeking to obtain, and in one case in fact received, a discount which represented the whole of the remaining time they had left to serve under their sentences. 
     
      
    88 Counsel for the appellant submitted that Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules should not operate as a bar to the first two grounds of appeal, albeit further directions were not sought at the trial. The request by counsel at the trial that a direction on this issue be given clearly denoted that this was a real issue in the appellant’s case. It was submitted that the reliability of evidence given by prison informers was not merely an issue in this case, it was fundamental to the determination to be made by the jury. Any deficiency in the directions given to the jury on this topic must therefore be regarded as a fundamental flaw in the trial proceedings. The length of time that the jury spent considering its verdict in this case would suggest, it was argued, that there were issues which took some time for the jury to resolve. It could not be said that if the jury had been given more complete directions on the task of evaluation and assessment of the evidence of prison informers, then it would have inevitably made the same decision. Putting this another way, it could legitimately be said that the failure to give adequate directions on this topic deprived the appellant of the chance of acquittal that was reasonably open to him.  
     
      
    89 It should be noted that prior to commencing the relevant part of his summing-up, his Honour raised with counsel the appropriate warnings to be given under s 165(1)(a),(d) and (e). It is clear from the transcript that unanimity was reached. This explains, no doubt, why no application was made for any further direction at the conclusion of his Honour’s summing-up. 
     
      
    90 Dealing firstly with the submissions that have been made under these grounds of appeal, it must be respectfully acknowledged that in certain respects there was room for expansion in the summing-up. In particular: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) When dealing with the reasons why evidence of the prison informers was potentially unreliable, there was no reference to the fact that as a prisoner, the witness is necessarily of bad character, and being of bad character, that is a factor which should be taken into consideration in determining his reliability and honesty as a witness. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) When speaking of prison culture, the point which is generally made is that conventional standards of conduct are replaced by a culture in which values, such as truth and respect for the rights of others, have little relevance. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The circumstances called for a direction that alleged admissions in the prison context, in particular, are easy to make and difficult to deny. A possible reason for a false allegation of confession is that the witness himself may fear that he will be blamed for the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) No reference was made to the fact that the experience of the Courts over the years has demonstrated that the evidence of prison informers is potentially unreliable. 
        
       
      
    91 That takes us then to the question of independent evidence supporting the evidence of the informers and asserted accomplice. The point should immediately be made here that in Pollitt, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ (and semble Brennan J) held that there is no rule of law or practice that evidence which attracts a corroboration warning cannot corroborate or be corroborated by other evidence attracting the same warning. (Nevertheless, see the remarks of Dawson and Gaudron JJ at 600, and the cases there cited.) It goes without saying, however, that the Court must look with circumspection upon the situation where a witness requiring independent evidence of support can only find it in the evidence of another witness likewise requiring independent evidence of support. 
     
      
    92 In the instant case the prison informer with the most incriminating evidence of the appellant is Digby. He does receive some support, however, from Roach, Soonius and Van Hofwegan. If the jury were to accept that the statement which Brazel made to the police officers was truthful then, of course, confirmation of Digby’s evidence can be found in that source.  
     
      
    93 The Crown also relied upon the evidence of the alleged admissions made to Officers Bouffler and Barron, together with certain video and DNA evidence, to which reference will be made later in this judgment.  
     
      
    94 Particularly bearing in mind that Rule 4 applies to these grounds of appeal, the Court does not consider that, in the circumstances, any miscarriage of justice has been established. Accordingly, grounds one and two are rejected. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 3 and 4: Alleged oral admissions to Police Prosecutor and Corrective Services officer. 
       
      
    95 The third and fourth grounds of appeal may conveniently be dealt with together. 
     
      
    96 The third ground of appeal is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of admissions said to have been made by the appellant to 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Senior Constable Barron 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Corrective Services Officer Bouffler” 
        
       
      
    97 Ground four is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge erred in his directions to the jury on the approach they should take to the assessment and evaluation of admissions already made by the appellant to 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Senior Constable Barron 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Corrective Services Officer Bouffler 
        
       
       
        
        at times when the appellant was effectively in the custody of those officers.” 
        
       
      
    98 We have already referred to the evidence of admissions allegedly made by the appellant to Barron and Bouffler.  
     
      
    99 His Honour ruled on 27 March 2000, during the course of the earlier trial, that admissions to the prosecutor, Senior Constable Barron, made by the appellant whilst on the way to the court room and in the court room were admissible as they were not “in the course of official questioning” (as required by s 108 (now s 281) Criminal Procedure Act 1986) and were volunteered by the appellant rather than as a result of questions put to him. His Honour had earlier ruled (on 22 March 2000) that there was no impropriety on the part of Barron in the recording of the conversations or in not inviting the appellant to give some formal acknowledgement of their accuracy. 
     
      
    100 Section 281 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        281 
         (1) This section applies to an admission: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that was made by an accused person who, at the time when the admission was made, was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that was made in the course of official questioning, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) that related to an indictable offence, other than an indictable offence that can be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Evidence of an admission to which this section applies is not admissible unless 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) there is available to the court: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in subparagraph (i) could not be made, a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission, being an interview about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995) do not prevent a tape recording from being admitted and used in proceedings before the court as mentioned in subsection (2). 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In this section:

    101 As stated earlier, his Honour’s judgment concerning the evidence of Senior Constable Barron in light of [s 281] of the Criminal Procedure Act was delivered on 27 March 2000. His Honour accepted that the appellant’s statement to Barron as set out above constituted “admissions”, and that the requirements of pars (a) and (c) of subsection (1) had been satisfied. However, as we have indicated, his Honour concluded that the admissions had not been “made in the course of official questioning” as required in par (b) of the subsection. 
     
      
    102 As to the first admission made to Barron while walking with the appellant to the courthouse, his Honour noted that there was no questioning of the appellant by Barron and that the appellant’s words were not said in response to anything said by Barron. The comment of the appellant appeared simply to have been a statement volunteered by the appellant. 
     
      
    103 The second conversation in the court room was, his Honour found, initiated by the appellant. The relevant admission was not made in response to any question asked by Barron, and his Honour found that nothing Barron said had been calculated to bring forth any information, let alone the comment made by the appellant. His Honour concluded, therefore, that neither of the admissions allegedly made by the appellant had occurred during the course of official questioning, and that therefore [s 281] did not apply. 
     
      
    104 A similar conclusion was reached by his Honour in the judgment of 11 April 2000 as to the admissions allegedly made to Corrections Officer Bouffler. At the outset of the judgment, his Honour made reference to the earlier judgment relating to admissions made to Senior Constable Barron. Counsel for the appellant suggests that his Honour appears to have done so to indicate that similar considerations applied to the admissibility of the statement made to Bouffler, as had been held to apply to those made to Barron. However, we do not consider that his Honour intended to suggest that s 281 applied to Bouffler, who was not a police officer. Probably, his Honour meant to indicate that there was no impropriety on the part of Bouffler. 
     
      
    105 Section 424A of the Crimes Act (which was the precursor of and in identical terms to s 281) was considered by this Court in Horton (1998-1999) 104 A Crim R 306. In that case, s 424A was held to be applicable to the situation where the appellant was informed at the scene that she was under arrest for murder after she volunteered the relevant admission in response to a question by an investigating police officer. In the absence of proof of the existence of a reasonable excuse for the absence of either of the tape recordings contemplated by s 424A, the evidence was not admissible to show that the appellant had made the admission alleged. Horton was applied by this Court in Moffatt (2000) 112 A Crim R 201 at 207-208. 
     
      
    106 In Moffat the admissions were volunteered by the appellant while he was in the dock at the police station, subsequent to having been charged and cautioned by a police officer. The admissions were noted at the time but the appellant was never given the opportunity to adopt them. The Court noted (at 208) that absent proof of a reasonable excuse for the absence of either of the forms of tape recording contemplated by the section, “the evidence was not admissible to show that the appellant had made the admissions described”. Although the Court did not specifically refer to the question, it must be assumed that the Court was satisfied that the admissions were made in the course of official questioning because the appellant had been informed that he was under arrest for murder and cautioned before he volunteered the admissions. 
     
      
    107 In Marlow & Kelly (2001-2002) 129 A Crim R 51 (a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, Tasmania) Slicer J held (in a dissenting judgment) at [143], [150] and [153] that the words “in the course of official questioning” should be given the widest possible meaning to ensure accused persons are protected from what are colloquially referred to as “verbals” as the legislation was introduced for this specific purpose and in consequence of the decision of the High Court in McKinney, to which reference has already been made. 
     
      
    108 In Marlow & Kelly, the relevant admission was volunteered shortly after the conclusion of a formal video-taped interview. The majority (Underwood and Evans JJ) held, however, that the volunteered statements by the appellant Kelly at that stage did not amount to a confession or admission made “in the course of official questioning” within the meaning of s 8 of the Criminal Law (Detention and Interrogation) Act. 
     
      
    109 At pp 75-76 Underwood J (with the concurrence of Evans J) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, with respect to the admissibility of the evidence, the task of the learned trial judge was, and the task of this Court is, to ascertain the intention of parliament as enacted by the provisions of the  
        Criminal Law (Detention and Interrogation) Act 
        , s 8(1). It is quite clear that parliament did not intend to provide that no admission or confession would be admissible unless its making is recorded on video tape. Had parliament intended this, then it would have said so. Further, it is clear that parliament did not intend that volunteered admissions should fall within the scope of s 8: see  
        Julin 
         [2000] TASSC 50. The provisions of s 8(1) make it perfectly clear that parliament only intended to inhibit the admission of confessions that were made in the course of questioning by a police officer in connection with the investigation of the commission, or possible commission, of an offence. The plain fact in this case is that the impugned admission was volunteered by the appellant Kelly and was not made in the course of any questioning at all. The questioning had clearly come to an end at the time the appellant Kelly left the video interview room and set off for the charge room. The evidence was that no other question was asked of him by Detective Lopes or Detective Pretyman thereafter. It would be straining the language of the legislature to hold that, by reason of the matters advanced by Mr Proctor, the course of official questioning was still in progress when the impugned admission was made. I detect no error in the ruling of the learned trial judge in this respect.” 
        
       
      
    110 Questions of fact and degree necessarily arise when considering whether an admission has been volunteered other than in the course of official questioning. Moffatt may be taken to be, perhaps, an extreme situation. 
     
      
    111 Whatever the true construction of the phrase “in the course of official questioning”, it could not extend to the present situation, which was subsequent to the formal declaration by the appellant of his election to remain silent and the consequential termination of any questioning. 
     
      
    112 Thus, the argument by the appellant based upon s 281 must be rejected.  
     
      
    113 It is convenient at this stage to note that his Honour gave a direction to the jury regarding the admissions the subject of these two grounds of appeal, immediately following the directions which he had given to the jury in relation to prison informers and accomplices. Specifically, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, there is evidence of admissions which is given by witnesses who are not prison informers, namely, Senior Constable Barron and Mr Bouffler. Police and Correctional Service Officers do not fall into a special category of witnesses who, by their very nature, may be unreliable, so I do not give you any special warning about the treatment of their evidence. However, the evidence of Mr Barron and Mr Bouffler still has to be approached by you with caution for the reasons I have given you about admissions generally, that they are very easy to fabricate, virtually impossible to test and difficult to refute.” (S/U 28) 
        
       
      
    114 At a later stage of the summing-up his Honour summarised the evidence of Barron and the relevant submissions by defence counsel to the effect that the jury would reject his evidence, and then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is the evidence of Mr Barron. The question for you is: Were the words said? If they were said, do they bear the meaning contended for by the Crown, that these words were said in full recognition that he, the accused, had done the act about which they were concerned.” (S/U 48) 
        
       
      
    115 His Honour then turned to the evidence of Bouffler, and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Bouffler, who remembered nothing about that conversation, did give evidence of two other conversations, however, on the same day. He was part of the escort. On the way to the Court he has the accused saying ‘I’m taking the rap. I didn’t do this but I’m taking the rap for it’ and on the way back, apparently after having left the police cells and about to be transported back to the place where he was kept in the prison, he said, ‘When do I receive my medal?’ Again, the Crown would contend for, first, a conclusion that the words were said. Secondly, that whatever he meant when he said he did not do it, he was taking the rap for it, there was no doubt about what he meant when he was asking when he would receive his medal. 
        
       
       
        
        [Defence counsel] does not submit to you that the accused did not say those words, ‘I didn’t do it. I’m taking the rap for it’. He asks you to doubt whether the accused said the other words, ‘When do I receive my medal?’ He points out to you that Mr Bouffler’s statement was not made until March 2000 and that he is recounting events eighteen months later and you have to be cautious about relying on the memory of somebody who at first begins to think about something in detail eighteen months after it happened, if it happened.  
        
       
       
        
        They are the arguments, I think, about those two conversations.” (S/U 48-49) 
        
       
      
    116 It is now necessary to deal with the submission that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion to admit the evidence of the alleged admissions. It is convenient to deal first with s 90 of the Evidence Act which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    117 In order to determine whether there is any substance in the submission on behalf of the appellant that it was unfair to the appellant to use the evidence of Bouffler and Barron in relation to the alleged admissions, it is necessary to consider closely certain of the evidence which was given by the relevant witnesses in this regard.  
     
      
    118 Bouffler was the first of the relevant witnesses called. It will be recalled that he gave evidence that during the journey to Wagga Wagga the appellant said to him “I didn’t do it but I’m taking the rap for it”, and the witness replied, “That’s pretty stupid”, and later, when escorting the appellant from the cells to the motor vehicle for the trip back to the Correctional Centre the appellant said “When do I receive my medal?”. This was said just prior to the appellant leaving the cells.  
     
      
    119 Insofar as Bouffler’s evidence is concerned, the alleged statements by the appellant might be considered to clearly be exculpatory in the sense that the appellant was intending to convey to Bouffler that he considered himself entitled to a medal for taking the rap.  
     
      
    120 However, the alleged admissions made to Barron completely change the significance to be attached to the appellant’s assertion that he was entitled to a medal. This is simply because, according to Barron, the appellant asserted that he was entitled to a medal because he “knocked” the deceased.  
     
      
    121 It is convenient now to look at certain cross-examination of Bouffler, which established that whilst the appellant was being escorted to the courthouse from the police cells, his hands were handcuffed in front of him and Bouffler was beside him holding on to the handcuffs. Officers Uebel and Hindmarsh were reasonably close. Hindmarsh was in front of the appellant and Bouffler. Uebel was behind them and he was armed.  
     
      
    122 Bouffler deposed that “a police officer” was with them (this was obviously Barron) but Bouffler heard no conversation between the police officer and the appellant, despite their physical proximity.  
     
      
    123 Barron was called two days after Bouffler gave evidence. The following passages from his examination in chief are important: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. It’s the position that in all police stations there’s an officer in charge of prisoners who might be in custody? 
         
        A. Yes, in the cell complex. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you speak to him? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After speaking to him did you do something? 
         
        A. Yes, I had a further – Sergeant Macrae had a short conversation with the defendant. I was present during that and than the three correctional officers and myself escorted the defendant to the courthouse, which is adjacent to the police station. There’s an alleyway running between the two so we walked through the doorway from the police station towards the courthouse. There’s an alleyway running between the two with a roller door that can come down to block the view from that alley - from the street, from the public. 
        
       
       
        
         As we walked through the alleyway I said to the defendant, ‘That’ll be down on Monday’ – indicating the roller door. He said, ‘What, for the cameras?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’ll make sure it’s down on Monday for you’. He said, ‘Do I get my medal then? That’s what I should get, that I knocked him’. I didn’t say anything in reply to that. We were still walking through and continuing going through to the courthouse. 
        
       
       
        
         We came up through the tunnel into the courtroom, which is similar to this, and I put my papers on the bar table and came up to the Bench. I had forgotten to take a pen with me to Court that day so I went up to the Bench to find a scrap of paper and actually found a pen on the bench. It was this one (produced). It was a green pen. I took the pen and wrote down immediately the words that he had said to me on the way through on a piece of paper that I had found on the Bench. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I hand you these two documents (shown). You say you made some sort of written record, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Which one are you looking at now? 
         
        A. I’m looking at a white piece of paper. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Don’t worry about what’s on the back at this stage? 
         
        A. With the green writing that I recorded when I returned to Court. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I take it that that writing, in effect, records exactly what you have told the Court about now? 
         
        A. This records the words that the defendant said to me, ‘do I get my medal then? That’s what I should get, that I knocked him’. 
        
       
       
        
        MFI #17 WHITE PIECE OF PAPER IDENTIFIED BY SENIOR CONSTABLE BARRON.” (T360-361) 
        
       
      
    124 Barron was then asked to draw a sketch plan of the area traversed between the police station and the court, which sketch was tendered as an exhibit. Barron’s examination in chief continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You say you made a notation on that piece of paper, MFI 17, and did you do something with that piece of paper after you had written on it? 
         
        A. Yes, the Court papers that I referred to receiving when I got to the police station, were kept in this manila folder. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’re indicating a yellow manila folder in your hands now? 
         
        A. Yes, that was in there with all the other paperwork and a covering sheet on the front. I put that piece of paper in with the papers in that manila folder. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I take it then that the bail hearing took place? 
         
        A. Yes, Mr Adams was the Registrar that day. He arrived shortly after I made the note and put it in the folder that the bail hearing proceeded. The defendant was unrepresented. He made no application for bail. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Just answer the question you’re asked. You were only asked if the bail hearing took place? 
         
        A. It did. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. I think just prior to the arrival of the gentleman Mr Adams that you referred to a moment ago, you had a further conversation with the accused? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I want you to just take it step by step. For a start he asked you a question? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was that? 
         
        A. Initially – this is before Mr Adams arrived – he said to me, ‘Are you the prosecutor?’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I want you to take it step by step. I think at that stage you gave a response? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said? 
         
        A. I said, ‘Yeah’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say something else to you at that stage. Just tell the Court what he said to you? 
         
        A. He said, ‘I don’t know why you’re prosecuting me. You should be thanking me.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Q. At that point of time I think you made some brief comment to him and then you also once again made a record of that second conversation that took place? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did you make that second record? 
         
        A. I made it on the manila folder. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that the same manila folder you held up before? 
         
        A. Yes, that’s the case. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you record the exact words which you just told the Court about a moment ago? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        MFI #18 MANILLA FOLDER. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I think after you had made that particular notation on the manila folder, it was at that stage that the gentleman Mr Adams arrived? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The bail hearing proceeded in its normal way? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It, in due course, came to an end and I think at that stage the accused was then returned to his former cell? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you travelled with him and the correctional officers that were with him? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I think at that stage when you got back into the police station you had another conversation with someone. Did you speak to somebody else at that stage? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who was that person? 
         
        A. Acting Sergeant Macrae. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you, when you spoke to him, show him something? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you show him? 
         
        A. I showed him the white piece of paper that I made the first notation on. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As a result of that, did he tell you to do something? 
         
        A. Yes, he suggested something. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And after speaking to him did you in fact do something? 
         
        A. No, I attempted – I did go to a computer and attempted to make a statement at that time but I was unable to access the macro on the computer. In my role as a police prosecutor, I don’t make statements generally, so I wasn’t used to it. I don’t know if it was the computer or me but, for whatever reason, I couldn’t access the macro to make the statement. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You had trouble pulling up the template? 
         
        A. On the computer, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Having tried to do that and not succeeding what did you do then? 
         
        A. I thought I’ll leave it till Monday, I’ll do it over on my computer in the office where there’ll be people who might assist me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that in fact what you did do? 
         
        A. Yes, that Monday, two days later, I made the statement then.” (T361-363) 
        
       
      
    125 The following evidence given by Barron in cross-examination is also important.  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. As a police officer you are, of course, issued with official notebooks, aren’t you? 
         
        A. Not at that stage. As a prosecutor I didn’t have a police notebook. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you have nothing upon which you could have officially noted something? 
         
        A. Well, no, all that I had with me were the court papers themselves. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I understand that. Why is it that you wrote one note on a piece of scrap paper and one note inside the folder? Why the two different places for the writing of the note? 
         
        A. As soon as I got into the courtroom I looked for a piece of paper to write it on because I didn’t want to mark the Court papers. That was why I didn’t make the first note on the Court papers but then when he made the second comment, I had the folder open and the pen in my hand so I scribbled it down quickly immediately. There was a clean side on the open page of the manila folder so I just scribbled it there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you put any date on the piece of paper -- 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. – that you made the note on? 
         
        A. No, but at that time all of the Court papers were still attached so the date was on those. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On the piece of paper? 
         
        A. No, I didn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Any date? 
         
        A. No, I didn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why not? 
         
        A. It didn’t occur to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. It didn’t occur to you as a trained officer. You think you have heard something of importance; you go to the trouble of writing it down, you tell this jury, but you don’t even put a date on it? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That means it could have been written any time, doesn’t it? 
         
        A. Well, except I know when I did it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. We have only got your word for that, haven’t we? 
         
        A. In the same way if you say a date was there, you could say I had written that at any time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You kept the pen for two years or more? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. To show this jury? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you didn’t even date the paper? 
         
        A. Yeah, that’s the case. I didn’t specifically keep it for that purpose but when I found I had taken it home, I kept it by the phone and then I -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Please finish your answer? 
         
        A. I put it by the phone at home and I (sic) was there for some time and then I put it in my jacket when I came to Court on the last occasion and I’ve left it there since. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just to convince someone that the green ink in the writing is the same as the green ink in the pen in your hand? 
         
        A. No, just because it was there and I thought it may be relevant, so I thought I’d bring it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did it occur to you at any time as a trained police prosecutor to give this man the opportunity of reading to him what you say he said to you? 
         
        A. No, it didn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You’d have to agree that is normal police procedure, is it not? 
         
        A. I’m not specifically trained in that area so I’m not certain if that is a part of that training or not but it’s not a part of my training. I’m trained as a prosecutor. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. For example, if he had signed it we’d have some pretty strong evidence that he knew and agreed what he had said, wouldn’t we? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q,. Did you ever get any opportunity to do that? 
         
        A. No, that, unfortunately, didn’t occur to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. A police prosecutor; it didn’t occur to you, is that right? 
         
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Trained to be in Courts; know how everything is admitted into evidence? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Know what the meaning of corroboration means? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Didn’t occur to you? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about the folder; did it occur to you to give him the benefit of reading what was in the folder? 
         
        A. No, it was in the same position. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I mean, you went to the trouble, you tell this jury, to bring this to the attention of another policeman, didn’t you? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why didn’t you go to the trouble of bringing it to the attention of the man you say used the words? 
         
        A. The only time that I ever mentioned it, I think in the defendant’s presence, was a bail application – in a bail application. I’m certain that I did mention it then but I’m not certain when or where. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You didn’t mention that in your statement, did you? 
         
        A. No, the statement was made two days after the event. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who asked you to make a statement, do you remember? 
         
        A. It was always my intention to make the statement. Sergeant Macrae suggested to me in addition on the Saturday that I make it and also on the Monday I spoke with Detective Sergeant Jones about the matter. I’m not certain if that was before or after I made the statement but I certainly either told him I’d made it or told him I would make it; I’m not certain which. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you tell Sergeant Jones about the note? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you show it to him? 
         
        A. Well, not on the Saturday. I didn’t see him on the Saturday but on the Monday – I’m not certain if I showed it to him or just delivered it to his office.” (T366-368) 
        
       
      
    126 At a later stage of the cross-examination, reference was made to the words allegedly uttered by the appellant in the walkway. The cross-examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Are you sure they are the words, sergeant? 
         
        A. Yes, definitely. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. On your assertion this man suddenly just tells you he has committed a murder? 
         
        A. Yes, that is why I wrote them down straight away. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No conversation leading up to it? 
         
        A. No.” (T370) 
        
       
      
    127 And later: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Wasn’t the fact however, detective, this accused said that the bloke who did this deserves a medal? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s what he said? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that you have changed that to: ‘I deserve a medal’? 
         
        A. No, I wrote the words down straight away word for word what he said. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did not give the man the opportunity to read them to say whether he agreed with it or sign it? 
         
        A. No, that didn’t occur to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How long have you been a police officer? 
         
        A. I have been in the Police Service for 12 years but almost all as a police prosecutor so I am not used to that side of -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You know about getting someone to sign a statement, you know the benefit of one? 
         
        A. In hindsight I wish I had. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Every day police come to court and say: ‘I spoke to the man who had the accident, I spoke to him and asked him to sign this.’ You see that every day? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You did not speak to the accused? 
         
        A. Not at the time, no.” (T371) 
        
       
      
    128 Phillip Steven Uebel, the third Correctional Services officer involved in the escort, was then called. His evidence was relatively brief but we note the following passage from his examination in chief: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now, I think there were a number of other officers involved in that particular transportation? 
         
        A. Yes, with that sort of rating of the inmate there was three of us. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is a standard number? 
         
        A. Hm mmm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you have a clear recollection of forming the escort? 
         
        A. It is a fair while ago, I even forgot about the whole thing, but as time went by I remember going on the escort. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What can you remember about the role you performed? 
         
        A. The only thing I can, other thing I can think of is he was handcuffed to Barron, (sic) I equate Barron with being smaller, and he was handcuffed to the inmate, and I carried the weapon. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. As a result of you carrying the weapon did you keep a distance away? 
         
        A. Yes, there is a safety distance you must maintain whenever you carry a weapon even if the inmate is handcuffed. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you remember the distance? 
         
        A. You must remain in sight of the inmate, but usually about five feet is the distance. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you have any recollection of any conversation that took place at any stage while you were performing that role? 
         
        A. Well, the inmate was fairly talkative but for the life of me I can’t remember what he said. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you actually go into Court that day? 
         
        A. It’s the first time I’ve actually been in a Court. I remember walking up steps; it was all strange to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You remember walking up steps? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You cannot assist the Court with any conversation that occurred that day? 
         
        A. If I could I would. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is something you have done before? 
         
        A. The only thing I do remember he was talking I believe but, as I said, being the first time I was in Court that was unusual. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That sticks in your memory? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That the accused was talking a lot? 
         
        A. Yes, he was talking quite a lot but nothing sticks.” (T372-373) 
        
       
      
    129 Correctional Services Officer Hindmarsh, who was the third member of the escort party was not called and no explanation was given by the Crown for the fact that he was not called. 
     
      
    130 Sergeant Harvey McRae was the final witness called on this issue. In evidence in chief he was asked what occurred after the court hearing was concluded and Barron approached him: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Tell the Court what occurred, not what was said, what occurred? 
         
        A. When Sergeant Barron, the Junee correctional officers and the accused returned, I was approached by Mr Barron, the prosecutor -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. He spoke to you at that stage? 
         
        A. Actually he had a bit of a stunned look on his face. 
        
       
       
        
        OBJECTION QUESTION PRESSED ALLOWED 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I do not want you to tell the Court what was said? 
         
        A. That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Unless it was in the hearing of the accused? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where was the accused at that particular time? 
         
        A. I believe the actual accused would be about two to three yards away. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I will not press that, but you noticed something about the expression of Mr Barron you told the Court about. Did he speak to you? 
         
        A. Yes, the actual prosecutor told me certain things. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he do anything else at that stage? 
         
        A. Yes, actually when he walked in he made a comment to me, which amazed me quite a bit, and from the document he had with him he actually read a phrase. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I would be obliged if you would just answer the question that you are asked. 
        
       
       
        
        Ladies and gentlemen, it is not a matter for you whether Sergeant McRae was amazed at anything or not, put that out of your mind. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. In terms of the documents, the prosecutor had with him the actual court papers? 
         
        A. Papers or I think it was a vanilla (sic) folder with the actual charge and an exhibit, other papers. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did I understand from what you said before he read something from that paperwork to you? 
         
        A. Yes, he made a comment to me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he actually show you any paperwork? 
         
        A. Not that I remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you have a brief conversation with him – don’t tell me what was said? 
         
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he at that stage then leave? 
         
        A. I believe so, yes.” (T375-376) 
        
       
      
    131 It is necessary when considering the question of unfairness to consider the combined effect of the abovementioned witnesses. The significant matters which have to be considered in this regard are, in our view, as follows: 
     
      
    · Despite the circumstances in which the alleged admissions were made the Crown was unable to call any witness to support the relevant evidence of Bouffler or Barron that the statements in question were made to them.· The fact that in giving his evidence Bouffler was entirely reliant upon his recollection of events occurring one year and eight months earlier. The appellant was never offered the opportunity to confirm or deny that he had made the alleged statements to Bouffler.· There are grave problems about Barron’s evidence in that despite his lengthy experience as a police prosecutor (who must be assumed to have a working knowledge of the relevant laws of evidence in criminal proceedings) no opportunity was given to the appellant to respond to the words written on the scrap of paper and the manila folder.· There is a discrete problem about the scrap of paper and the manila folder. Neither of these documents was admissible: see Driscoll v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 517; Stephens v The Queen (1985) 156 CLR 664. They were, however, marked for identification, and it is obvious from the quoted portions of the transcript of Barron’s evidence that it was made abundantly clear to the members of the jury what the contents of the documents were and that the words were written in green ink. They were prominently displayed in the court, having been marked MFI 17 and MFI 18 respectively. At one stage Barron read from the scrap of paper (MFI 17). The manila folder was not only produced but it was held up before the jury. The evidence was that the folder recorded the exact words which the witness had earlier related to the court. There was an added embellishment to the above in that Barron produced the green pen which he said he had used to make the relevant notations on the documents. · Barron’s evidence received implied support from Sergeant McRae to whom the contents of at least one of the documents were read out. He noticed the “stunned look” on Barron’s face when he first spoke to him. Interestingly, at that time the appellant was only two or three yards away from McRae and Barron but neither officer seems to have considered the appropriate course was to make the document available to the appellant for his response to be recorded.· No consideration seems to have been given to the fact that Barron’s responsibility was to present, impartially and independently, to the duty magistrate the case for the prosecution in what was a bail hearing. The fact that no application was made for bail is not here to the point. It must have occurred to Barron that in the circumstances which occurred he became a potential significant witness in any future proceedings against the appellant. It would have been clear from the documentation available to Barron that the appellant had declined to be interviewed and Barron, according to his evidence, found himself in possession of evidence of a critically damning nature against the appellant. These exceptional circumstances imposed a very considerable responsibility upon Barron to exercise maximum care to avoid any unfairness or prejudice to the appellant by reason of what had happened within the precincts of the court.132 In the case of the alleged admission made to Bouffler he did not make any written note of the conversation until 24 March 2000, and testified solely from his memory. Accordingly, no question arose of the appellant being asked to acknowledge the correctness of the alleged admission having been made.  
     
      
    133 The locus classicus on the principles applicable to an appellate court dealing with the exercise of a discretion such as in the present situation is the following passage in the joint judgment of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR at 505: 
     
      
       
        
        “It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.” 
        
       
      
    134 Section 90 of the Evidence Act vests the trial judge with a discretion to refuse to admit evidence by the prosecution of an admission if, having regard to the circumstances, it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence. Particularly since the judgment of the High Court in Driscoll v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 517 dealing with the admissibility, in particular, of unsigned records of interview with the accused, there has been much learning from the High Court and Courts of Criminal Appeal on the concept of unfairness in such circumstances. 
     
      
    135 The question of unfairness was recently revisited by the High Court in Swaffield and Pavic v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 159. In the majority judgment (Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ), their Honours said at 189: 
     
      
       
        
        “Unfairness  
         
        [53] The term ‘unfairness’ necessarily lacks precision; it involves an evaluation of circumstances. But one thing is clear:  
         
         
          
          ‘[T]he question is not whether the police have acted unfairly; the question is whether it would be unfair to the accused to use his statement against him ... Unfairness, in this sense, is concerned with the accused's right to a fair trial, a right which may be jeopardised if a statement is obtained in circumstances which affect the reliability of the statement.’  
          Van der Meer v The Queen 
           (1988) 62 ALJR 656 at 666; 82 ALR 10 at 26, per Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ.  
           
          
         
        [54] Unfairness then relates to the right of an accused to a fair trial; in that situation the unfairness discretion overlaps with the power or discretion to reject evidence which is more prejudicial than probative, each looking to the risk that an accused may be improperly convicted.” 
        
       
      
    136 When their Honours turned to consider s 90 of the Evidence Act they noted (at 193) that the concept of fairness has been expressed in the widest possible form in that section. Having quoted the section, their Honours then said (at 194): 
     
      
       
        
        “[68] Neither in s 90 nor anywhere else in either Act is there to be found a definition of unfairness. Part 3.11 — ‘Discretions to Exclude Evidence’ contains a number of provisions of a general nature empowering the court to refuse to admit evidence or to limit its use. In particular s 138(1) prohibits the admission of evidence obtained  
         
         
          
          ‘(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law; or  
           
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law;  
           
          
         
        ... unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained’.  
         
         
        This expresses in the widest terms the policy discretion developed by the common law. It is true that an approach, expressed in such terms, lacks certainty. But as the Law Reform Commission of Canada has said: see Australian Law Reform Commission Report No 26, Evidence (1985), vol 1, p 534.:  
         
         
          
          ‘there is an undeniable advantage in granting judges discretionary power, since it keeps the courts continually in touch with current social attitudes and may lead to the eventual evolution of the rules as the courts adapt them to changing social realities.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    137 As we have previously explained the real sting in the use by the appellant of the word “medal”, is to be found not in the evidence of Bouffler but in the evidence of Barron, a well experienced police prosecutor. There can be no doubt that, at times, suspects or accused persons from time to time voluntarily and independently of any interrogation make statements to police officers amounting to admissions. On such occasions the responsibility is then imposed upon the relevant police officers (well knowing the forensic significance of such admissions) to take such procedural steps as are necessary in the circumstances to avoid any unfairness to the suspect or accused. A fundamental requirement in this respect is to record the statement in a notebook or other document and provide the suspect or accused with the opportunity, without delay, to inspect the entry and to acknowledge in writing the accuracy of the entry. A formal record should be kept of the response by the suspect or accused. Such a procedure is wholly consistent with the case law which has developed over the last twenty-five years.  
     
      
    138 In fairness to Barron he acknowledged in cross-examination that he wished that he had taken such a course. However, his failure to do so together with the other aspects of concern about the reliability of his evidence, in our view, required the rejection of his evidence. In our respectful view, the exercise of discretion miscarried so that a potential injustice (albeit unwittingly) has been established. 
     
      
    139 In the event of a new trial, a question may well arise as to the admissibility of Bouffler’s evidence in the absence of Barron’s evidence. 
     
      
    140 Accordingly, for present purposes it is sufficient if this Court rules that ground three is upheld in relation to the evidence of Senior Constable Barron. 
     
      
    141 In the circumstances it is not necessary to deal with ground four. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 5 and 6: Admissibility and reliability of evidence of witness Brazel declared an unfavourable witness. 
       
      
    142 It is convenient to deal with grounds five and six together. Ground five is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of the witness Brazel, or alternatively, erred in ultimately leaving his evidence to the jury.” 
        
       
      
    143 Ground six is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The directions given by the learned trial judge on the evidence of the witness Brazel were inadequate.” 
        
       
      
    144 It will be recalled that the evidence of the witness Mark Anthony Brazel was given against the background that he had initially made a statement (in the form of an ERISP) to the police, in which he gave a version implicating the appellant, but then claimed later to have no recollection of the events about which he had spoken, and then at a later stage claimed that he did recall those events sufficiently to say that the version he had given to the police was untrue. 
     
      
    145 At an early stage of the summing-up, in the absence of the jury, his Honour raised with counsel the question of appropriate directions relating to Brazel’s evidence. In this regard the following discussion took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: I suppose Young falls into that same category of gaol informer. Brazel might. I don’t know what weight my friend places upon Brazel. On one version he said quite a lot. Obviously your Honour is going to have to give some direction to the jury as to what they make of the evidence he gave to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I chose my words very carefully when I was summing up just now on matters of fact and my opinion. I told the jury that I did not generally intend to comment upon disputed questions of fact. I’m wondering about Brazel, whether I should say something about my view of the credibility of his evidence. I might say that my view is that he is incredible. 
        
       
       
        
        [DEFENCE COUNSEL]: Could your Honour put it a bit more mutually than that and say on one version he says this and on another version he says this; that on one version he says very little and on another he says a lot. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I still haven’t decided whether I will comment on his evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I do think his evidence falls into the category of a gaol informer and I think Young does too. 
        
       
       
        
        [DEFENCE COUNSEL] : I have no objection to that, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But the evidence I was referring to was we have three lots of evidence from him. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Which version falls into that category? 
        
       
       
        
        [DEFENCE COUNSEL]: The difficulty is which one does the Crown rely on. 
        
       
       
        
        [DEFENCE COUNSEL]: I will leave that to your Honour. I will see what falls from your Honour and if there is something I may want to ask I will consider that later.” (S/U 16-17) 
        
       
      
    146 In his summing-up to the jury his Honour said in relation to the evidence of Brazel: 
     
      
       
        
        “The last of the prison informer witnesses is Mr Brazel. He was by any account criminally involved so you must treat his evidence with the greatest caution. But quite apart from that, you know that he gave one statement to the police at Junee. In it he put himself inside the deceased’s cell, not taking part in the attack but pulling the accused off the deceased saying he had better get out. The second version was that he remembered nothing of the events at all. He did not remember even who the accused was, didn’t remember whether he had close relatives, children. The third version told of a miraculous recovery of his memory in which he told you that, yes, he did remember being there, he did know the accused, he did go to the police station, he did make the statement which was read to you – that is the transcript of the electronically recorded interview – but that none of it was true. 
        
       
       
        
        You remember the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined him about that and he conceded some parts of it were true, for instance, that he was at Junee on that day but none of it was true as far as it puts him in the cell or the accused in the cell. 
        
       
       
        
        It was submitted to you by the Crown Prosecutor that notwithstanding the obvious, perhaps insuperable, difficulties of knowing what you could believe in the evidence of such a witness, you could accept that he was in the cell, not because of anything he said necessarily but because that is what he said in the first place to the police and there seems no reason he would give a lying version putting himself in the cell, why would he do that, but, more particularly, because of the other evidence that he was in the cell, not only of Mr Digby who saw him there doing what he was doing and of Mr Roach who saw him walking along towards the cell in the presence of the accused and going into the cell. So the Crown says you can accept some things in the statement he made to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        [Defence counsel] says that Mr Brazel gave quite a frank answer to a question that he asked him, the effect of which was that he would say anything if he thought he could get an advantage. He said that you should reject his evidence out of hand. It is just so obviously suspect that you do not know where the lies end. You should not accept any of that evidence.” (S/U 42-43) 
        
       
      
    147 No redirection was sought by Defence counsel. 
     
      
    148 It is convenient now to refer to the interlocutory judgment which his Honour gave on 5 April 2000 during the course of Brazel’s evidence in chief granting the Crown leave to cross-examine Brazel generally as an unfavourable witness in reliance upon each of the three paragraphs in s 38(1) of the Evidence Act. Section 38(1) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        38 Unfavourable witnesses 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    149 His Honour’s interlocutory judgment is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. HIS HONOUR: Before this trial began the Crown made application to cross-examine one of its own witnesses, Mark Anthony Brazel, and to tender as a prior inconsistent statement the record of an interview he gave to Detective Sergeant Jones at the Junee police station on 28 September 1998. I granted leave to the Crown to cross examine him and to have read in court the contents of the interview, though I did not give leave to tender the record of interview as a document. I gave reasons for my decision on 27 March 2000. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The basis of my reason for deciding as I did was that I took the view that Mr Brazel was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence on a matter that he knew about. It was also common ground that his evidence was unfavourable to the party calling him, namely the Crown, and that his interview with Detective Sergeant Jones was a prior statement inconsistent with evidence he then proposed to give, namely that he had no memory at all of the events at Junee in September 1998, having at least six months retrograde amnesia from a car collision in which he was involved in March the following year. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Thus all the conditions of section 38(1) of the Evidence Act applied. For reasons which do not need to be explained there has been a substantial delay between my decision and the calling of Mr Brazel to give his evidence before the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        4. He has been called this morning and counsel on both sides have been taken by surprise because his evidence has changed significantly. He now says that he remembers the events at Junee Correctional Centre in September 1998, whereas before he did not. He says that he remembers being interviewed by Detective Sergeant Jones, whereas before he did not. What he now says is that although the record of interview with Detective Sergeant Jones correctly records what he said, it is not true insofar as it deals with any part that he played. 
        
       
       
        
        5. When the change became apparent I interrupted the trial and asked the jury to withdraw because it seemed to me that the basis upon which the Crown had its leave to cross-examine Mr Brazel and to use the contents of the interview might no longer exist, and that the accused might have an opportunity to put something against my continuing to hold out the leave which I had granted the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Mr Brazel has been examined on the voir dire. His evidence is now as I have summarised. It is true, as [defence counsel] has submitted, that the fact that a witness has made a prior inconsistent statement is not of itself sufficient to ground a conclusion that that witness is not doing his or her best to tell the truth about something he or she knows about. However, there is much more here. In view of the contents of the interview, of the evidence of Mr Brazel on the voir dire and of his evidence this morning, which put forward three entirely different factual states of affairs, I am quite satisfied that he is still making no attempt to tell the truth about a subject matter he knows about. 
        
       
       
        
        7. I think that the three conditions of paragraph 38(1) of the evidence Act continue to be (sic) apply. The Crown will continue to have leave to cross-examine Mr Brazel, if it wishes, and to read the contents of his interview with Detective Sergeant Jones if it wishes.” 
        
       
      
    150 During the course of the cross-examination of the witness by the Crown Prosecutor the critical aspects of his ERISP were put to him so that that material came before the jury. It clearly implicated the appellant in the murder of Mr Kennett.  
     
      
    151 That situation having arisen a question then arose (however, it was not adverted to by counsel) for the judge to determine whether he should exercise the jurisdiction vested in the Court under s 136 of the Evidence Act to limit the use of the evidence to the issue of the witness’ credibility. If the evidence were limited to the witness’ credit a direction along the following lines would have been appropriate.  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Brazel was called as a witness by the prosecution but gave evidence which was unfavourable to the prosecution case, the prosecution was therefore allowed to cross-examine him to show that he had earlier made statements which were inconsistent with the evidence he has now given in court. The contents of those statements are not part of the evidence in the trial except for the parts of them which he has told you are true. Those statements were put before you by the prosecution solely to throw doubt on the reliability of his evidence in the court. 
        
       
       
        
        You have to decide, in the light of the challenge to his credibility, whether you can accept any part of the evidence which he has given in court and, if so, what part of it. If you decide that there is such a serious conflict between the evidence he gave you and the statements previously made by him, you may think that you should reject his evidence altogether.” 
        
       
      
    152 In the absence of such a direction, as happened here, the material in the ERISP implicating the appellant in the murder went before the jury on the basis that they could accept such material (if they believed it was true) as evidence going directly to the guilt of the appellant. This is so even though the witness asserted that that material was untrue. Those parts of the ERISP which the witness accepted to be true had no effective probative value insofar as the Crown case was concerned. 
     
      
    153 The reality of the situation is that the direction which his Honour gave to the jury was not the subject of any objection by defence counsel. However, it should be remembered that there was an initial objection by the defence to leave being granted on any basis under s 38 for the Crown to cross-examine Brazel. 
     
      
    154 It was suggested on this appeal by the Crown that defence counsel obviously wished to take forensic advantage of the varying nature of Brazel’s accounts as to what happened at the crime scene, to emphasise unreliability in the Crown case. 
     
      
    155 It is argued on appeal that his Honour should have excluded the evidence on the basis of s 137 of the Evidence Act which does not provide the trial judge with a discretion but provides that the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
     
      
    156 Alternatively, the appellant has argued that Brazel’s evidence should have been excluded under the general discretion vested in the judge under s 135 of that Act on the basis that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial to the appellant. 
     
      
    157 There is no doubt, as the Crown has emphasised before this Court, that his Honour had cautioned the jury to take care with the evidence of all prison informers, including Brazel, as set out earlier in this judgment.  
     
      
    158 Further his Honour complied with defence counsel’s request and juxtaposed summaries of the three versions given in evidence by Brazel. His Honour’s summary, indicating the changes in tack of the witness clearly illustrated defence counsel’s point. 
     
      
    159 There is no doubt that Mr Brazel’s changes of tack created problems not only for the learned judge but also for both counsel.  
     
      
    160 It was clearly within his Honour’s discretion to allow the Crown to cross-examine Brazel generally under s 38 of the Evidence Act. It is (with respect) unfortunate, however, that more careful consideration was not given at the conclusion of his evidence as to the basis upon which it was to go to the jury, or, indeed, whether it should be taken away from the jury. A real question arose as to whether its prejudicial nature outweighed its probative value. Its probative value depended wholly upon the jury accepting that the incriminating statements made in the ERISP by Brazel were truthful. Otherwise the evidence was of no value. 
     
      
    161 As the Court has determined that a new trial is necessary, further consideration of this ground is unnecessary to avoid any complication arising in the re-trial. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: Reliability of evidence of witness Digby. 
       
      
    162 Ground seven is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The directions given by the learned trial judge on the assessment of the evidence of Mathew Digby were inadequate in that those directions failed to draw to the attention of the jury: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that to the extent that the Crown case depended on observations of the assault upon the deceased, it depended in its entirety on the evidence of Mathew Digby; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) specific weaknesses in the evidence of Mathew Digby, in particular the inconsistency of the versions he had given of relevant events; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) that the version of events given in the trial by Mathew Digby was contradicted by the evidence of the video tape recordings, Exhibits J and K.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    163 There is no doubt that Digby was an important witness in the Crown case. Indeed, as counsel for the appellant contends, his evidence was “crucially important”. 
     
      
    164 During the course of his summing-up, his Honour analysed in considerable detail the evidence given by Digby and adequately summarised the competing arguments about it. However, it is argued that in his Honour’s analysis there is no clear direction to the jury that in order for the jury to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt on the basis of his observed conduct, it was necessary for them to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the evidence of Mathew Digby. Further, in order to underline the importance of that direction, it was also important for the jury to be told that no other witnesses had given a version of events which supported that given by Mathew Digby.  
     
      
    165 Having carefully examined the detailed analysis that his Honour made of Digby’s evidence we are unable to conclude that his Honour was under an obligation to say anything further.  
     
      
    166 The video tapes, Exhibits J and K, reproduced images from some of the security cameras within the Correctional Centre. A technician explained in evidence that the surveillance system digitalized the images from each unit and recorded them on videotape from one camera after another. The viewer sees a frame from each camera, updated every couple of seconds. Images of people are too blurred to enable any individual to be identified. Of the two video tapes in evidence the more important is Exhibit K, derived from two cameras in B Pod, in which can be seen the deceased’s cell and the area around it. 
     
      
    167 It was the Crown case at the trial that the movement of inmates seen on this video was consistent with Digby’s account. Defence counsel contended that it was not. Having viewed the video ourselves, we can understand the basis of the defence argument. However, the video is not a continuous photographic representation of movement in the relevant area, as a normal videotape would be, and, in our view, it could not be relied upon either in support of the Crown case or in contradiction of it. Its probative value appears to us to be slight. In any event, his Honour dealt adequately with this aspect of the evidence. 
     
      
    168 We reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8: Directions concerning identification of shoes alleged to be worn by appellant at time of offence. 
       
      
    169 Ground eight is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge erred in the directions given to the jury as to the identification of the shoes which were Exhibit G in the trial proceedings as being shoes worn by the appellant at the time of the alleged offence.” 
        
       
      
    170 Relevantly to this ground of appeal, the Court notes the following portion of his Honour’s summing-up: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submitted to you that the video will satisfy you that nobody went into that cell after the alarm was raised and that if the accused’s shoe had not been in there at the time of the attack, how could the blood have got on it? But there is no concession that the shoe was the accused’s, I might say, that the evidence is that it was taken from the cell and I think no strong submission was put to you about that by [defence counsel].” (S/U 49) 
        
       
      
    171 The manner in which the shoes were dealt with in counsel for the appellant’s address can be discerned from a discussion between his Honour and counsel in the absence of the jury during the course of the summing-up.  
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: [Defence counsel] you didn’t make any submission that the shoes, Exhibit G, were not the accused? 
        
       
       
        
        [DEFENCE COUNSEL]: No, as far as I know they look to be the same shoes. That’s the best we can do, so I didn’t say it wasn’t.  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You didn’t make any submission that the jury ought to doubt whether they are the accused’s shoes? 
        
       
       
        
        [DEFENCE COUNSEL]: No, I only raise the difference in the evidence, as your Honour has done, one with thongs and one with work boots. That’s all I did. Perhaps I should have but I didn’t. Your Honour can only deal with what I did do.” (S/U 44) 
        
       
      
    172 The reference to “thongs” is of course a reference to the evidence of Young. The reference to “work boots” is a reference to the evidence of Roach. 
     
      
    173 Accepting that it was essential to the Crown from the DNA point of view to establish that the shoes belonged to the appellant, it was submitted that the evidence was insufficient to establish this fact.  
     
      
    174 Reliance was placed upon the principle enunciated by this Court in R v Clout (1996-1997) 41 NSWLR 312 that the frailty of identification evidence, and the consequent need for directions, applies equally to objects as it does to people. 
     
      
    175 The major difficulty which the appellant faces for this ground of appeal is that evidence given by Detective Coleman that the black Nike runners (Exhibit G) were taken from the appellant’s cell on the evening of 17 September 1998 was never challenged. Nor was the evidence of Soonius who was shown Exhibit G in the witness box that the shoes belonged to the appellant challenged. 
     
      
    176 No warning was sought as to the dangers of identification of the shoes which is perfectly understandable in the circumstances. 
     
      
    177 The final reference by his Honour to the shoes in the summing-up was immediately prior to the jury retiring to consider their verdict. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the jury room you will have with you all the exhibits, including those shoes. I haven’t sent them out with you so far. You may not need to take them out of the paper bag, I don’t know what value you would have from taking them out and looking at them. The evidence about them has not been such that you would have to. I would warn you to be careful about handling them. I don’t say that in any way derogatory of the accused. There are blood products on them.” (S/U 58) 
        
       
      
    178 Those comments which were not the subject of any objection by defence counsel reflect the reality that by the time the jury retired there was no issue about Exhibit G constituting the appellant’s shoes. Inherent in this situation must be the assumption that Roach and Young were mistaken, when they asserted that the appellant was wearing different shoes. 
     
      
    179 This ground of appeal is rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9. 
       
      
    180 This ground, concerned with an aspect of the cross-examination of the witness, David Young, was not pressed. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10: directions regarding evidence favourable to the appellant by prison inmate David Young. 
       
      
    181 This ground complains that the trial judge erred in his directions relating to the evidence of Mr Young. 
     
      
    182 It will be remembered that David Young was called in the appellant’s case and gave evidence favourable to him (pars 47-49 of this judgment). Nevertheless, in the passage of the summing-up quoted at par 67 his Honour included Mr Young in the category of prison informers. Later in the summing-up he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There seems to be no suggestion that Mr Young received any benefit from giving evidence but his evidence is to be treated in the same way as that of the other prison informers because he made a statement to the police and held himself out as being able to give evidence in this matter and he is therefore likely to have been motivated in the way the others might have been motivated.” (S/U 41) 
        
       
      
    183 Earlier (par 81), we referred to Jamieson & Ors (1992) 60 ACrim R 68 at 76 and R v Baker [2001] NSWCCA 151 at pars 27-28. Those were cases dealing with the evidence of an accomplice, and the passages referred to are authority for the proposition that a warning about evidence of that kind is apposite if it is relied upon by the Crown, but not if it is led in support of the defence case. The same must be so of other categories of evidence calling for a warning in the interest of fairness to an accused. The reasons of policy which dictate such a warning when the evidence is led in proof of guilt have no application when it is relied upon in favour of an accused. Of course, the testimony of Mr Young was challenged by the Crown prosecutor at the trial and the jury would have been entitled to examine it with a critical eye. However, it was not appropriate that they should do so against the background of a direction by the trial judge that it was evidence of a kind which, in the experience of the courts, might be unreliable. The same must be said of aspects of the evidence of the other prisoner witnesses which was favourable to the appellant (referred to at par 85).  
     
      
    184 We are not dissuaded from that conclusion by the fact that defence counsel sought no redirection and, indeed, raised no objection to a direction of that kind in discussion at an earlier stage of the summing-up. From the transcript of that discussion (set out at par 145) it appears that neither counsel assisted his Honour by reference to the relevant law. This ground is made out.  
     
      
       
      Ground 11: Admissibility of evidence of presumptive testing for traces of blood on appellant’s clothing. 
       
      
    185 This ground is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence that various items of clothing matching the descriptions of those said to have been worn by the appellant had tested positive to a presumptive test for traces of blood should not have been admitted, having regard to other expert evidence which established that the items of clothing in question did not contain traces of blood.”  
        
       
      
    186 A physical evidence officer observed what appeared to be recent stains on a number of items of the appellant’s clothing apart from the shoe which was the subject of DNA testing. Those stains reacted positively to a field test for blood and the clothing was submitted for testing by the forensic biologist, Mr Goetz. As recited above (par 58), one stain proved to be blood, but not that of the deceased. The other stains were not blood.  
     
      
    187 The complaint on appeal was that the evidence of the presumptive testing by the police officer had no probative value and could have been unfairly prejudicial to the appellant. However, the evidence was not objected to and it is not apparent how the appellant could have been unfairly prejudiced by it. The limited significance of presumptive testing was explained to the jury, and the tests by the police officer were put in their proper perspective by the evidence of Mr Goetz. The evidence was not entirely devoid of probative value, in so far as it explained why those items of clothing were submitted for biological testing. 
     
      
    188 Evidence of this kind is frequently led in murder trials. This is not to suggest that it should be led as a matter of course, without consideration of its relevance to the issues in the case at hand. In the present case the evidence was of little significance and, no objection having been taken to it, we would reject this ground.  
     
      
       
      Ground 12: Directions regarding DNA evidence. 
       
      
    189 This ground is that the trial judge’s directions on the approach that the jury should take to the DNA evidence were erroneous and inadequate.  
     
      
    190 The ground arises from his Honour’s directions to the jury about the evidence of Mr Goetz, summarised at pars 59-61 of this judgment. The relevant passage from the summing up is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Goetz’ opinion was that the DNA matched the DNA of the deceased. There was also present the DNA of somebody else. He could not say who that was and the question for him was: Was this any two people in the community or was it one random person and the deceased and he said the chances of it being two random people, neither of which were the deceased, was a million to one against. I do not know whether I have put that right.  
        It was a million times more likely that the deceased was one of the contributors to the DNA on the shoe 
        . (Our emphasis) (S/U 52) 
        
       
      
    191 The complaint is that the last sentence of that passage falls into the error known as the “prosecutor’s fallacy” explained by Mason P in R v GK (2001) 53 NSWLR 317 at par 47ff: see also JCG (2001) 127 A Crim R 493 at par 79ff and Keir (2002) 127 A Crim R 198. Mr Goetz’ evidence of the chance of the DNA being that of two random people in the community, neither of them the deceased, was admissible. However, it was argued, to reason from that evidence that it was a million times more likely that some of the DNA was that of the deceased was impermissible. 
     
      
    192 The Crown prosecutor in this Court acknowledged as much but argued that, in the circumstances of the case, the error did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. Following the passage quoted from the summing-up, his Honour warned the jury in general terms about their approach to this statistical evidence, pointing out that a “statistical distribution” may not be “factual distribution”. More importantly, however, while there was no concession by the defence that the DNA on the shoe was that of the deceased, that does not appear to have been a live issue. What was put to the jury was that some of the deceased’s blood may have got on to the appellant’s shoe innocently as a result of the movement of people in the area immediately after the killing. 
     
      
    193 One can well understand why defence counsel took that course. Given that the appellant and the deceased were members of a confined prison community, the probability that the DNA was that of the deceased was high indeed. In this respect there is some parallel between this case and JCG, which involved an allegation of sexual assault within a group home operated by the Department of Community Services. No redirection about the matter was sought. In all the circumstances, we are persuaded that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned by this part of the summing-up and we would not uphold this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 13: Directions regarding defence case that fellow inmate Terry Johnson had not been excluded, on the evidence, as the perpetrator. 
       
      
    194 This ground is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge erred in failing to fully leave the defence case to the jury, in particular the alternative hypothesis available on the evidence that the inmate Terry Johnson had not been excluded as the perpetrator.”  
        
       
      
    195 It will be remembered that Terry Johnson was referred to in the evidence of several of the prisoners, especially in cross-examination of Matthew Digby. Reference to the effect of that cross-examination is to be found in par 62 of this judgment. Clearly, it was the defence case that it was at least reasonably possible that it was Mr Johnson who killed the deceased.  
     
      
    196 In summing-up his Honour dealt with that aspect of the case as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “In addition, [defence counsel] says to you that Mr Johnson had a motive to kill the deceased. He was sexually attracted to him. It had been discovered he was a paedophile. Mr Johnson had become an object of ridicule for that reason. He was by disposition an angry and violent man. He was the one who went into the cell to find out if it was really true that the deceased was a paedophile. His clothes were not examined. Mr Johnson is the principal suspect. They are [defence counsel’s] submissions to you.  
        
       
      
    197 This, of course, was no more than a reference to defence counsel’s argument. The submission on appeal was that his Honour should have left the proposition that Mr Johnson was the killer as an alternative hypothesis and should have directed the jury that, unless it could be excluded beyond reasonable doubt, the appellant must be acquitted. In our view a direction about the evidence relating to Johnson was called for. His Honour gave the conventional directions about the burden and standard of proof and the drawing of inferences, but there are trials in which those directions should be related not only to the elements of the offence charged, but also to a particular factual issue which might be decisive of the case. This was such a trial, and an appropriate direction was necessary to ensure that the defence case was properly put.  
     
      
    198 Whether the evidence was capable of raising a reasonable possibility that Johnson was the perpetrator was a matter for his Honour to determine. If it were not so capable on his Honour’s determination, the issue should not have been left to the jury. However, it appears to have been common ground at the trial that the issue did arise. That being so, his Honour should have directed the jury that the appellant must be acquitted unless that possibility was excluded beyond reasonable doubt. Of course, his Honour would have been required to make it clear that the appellant bore no burden of establishing that Johnson was the killer and that the question was whether, on the whole of the evidence, including that relating to Johnson, they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant. 
     
      
    199 While defence counsel did ask his Honour to deal with the evidence relating to Mr Johnson, he did not seek such a direction. Nevertheless, the matter is of such significance that we have concluded that this ground also should be upheld. 
     
      
       
      Ground 14. 
       
      
    200 This ground arises from the fact that the jury experienced technical difficulties viewing the security video tapes after they retired to consider their verdict. As we have decided that there must be a new trial, it is not necessary to deal with it.  
     
      
       
      Ground 15: Whether verdict of guilty was unreasonable having regard to the evidence. 
       
      
    201 This final ground asserts that the verdict is unreasonable, having regard to the evidence. We have given this ground careful consideration, assisted by comprehensive summaries of the evidence provided by the Crown and counsel for the appellant, but we have determined that it is not made out.  
     
      
    202 In arriving at that conclusion, we have left out of account the inadmissible evidence of Snr Const Barron. We recognise that the evidence of Mark Brazel was of little value, and we consider the security camera video to be equivocal. Nevertheless, the combined effect of the evidence of the other prisoners and the DNA evidence is such that it would still be open to a jury, properly directed, to be satisfied of the appellant’s guilt to the requisite degree.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion. 
       
      
    203 It may be that none of the grounds which we have upheld, standing alone, would be sufficient to require the verdict to be set aside. Viewed in combination, however, they satisfy us that the trial miscarried and that there must be a new trial. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a new trial is ordered.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: Mr Button has put the applicant’s case well and at its highest. I am, however, unpersuaded that the sentencing judge fell into any appellable error in this matter. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was arraigned on an indictment containing two counts: 
     
      
       
        
        1. malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33 of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        ;  
        
       
       
        
        2. in the alternative, driving a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to another person or persons where by the vehicle was involved in an impact causing grievous bodily harm contrary to s 52A(3)(c) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        . 
        
       
      
    3 The offences charged occurred on 17 April 2001 and the victim was Mr Peter Mawer. To this indictment the applicant pleaded not guilty to the first count, but guilty to the second count in the presence of the jury. The plea was not accepted by the Crown. A trial ensued spanning several days. 
     
      
    4 The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count, not guilty on the statutory alternative to the first count of malicious wounding, and guilty on the second count, which had been the one to which the applicant had originally pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    5 The maximum penalty for the offence on which the applicant was found guilty is seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    6 The victim, Mr Peter Mawer, had been in an ongoing custody dispute with the applicant’s girlfriend, Ms Gaffney, in relation to a ten year old daughter of the couple, Tymara. Ms Gaffney had two other children, one of them an infant child by the applicant. The three children were living with Ms Gaffney. 
     
      
    7 Ms Gaffney had planned to move with the three children to live in Port Macquarie. Mr Mawer obtained an interim injunction preventing the move so far as Tymara was concerned. The custody dispute came on for final determination in the Family Court on the morning of 17 April, that is, the date of the offence. An order was made by consent that Tymara’s custody be vested in Mr Mawer’s mother, with whom Mr Mawer resided. This order was to take effect from 1 pm the following day. 
     
      
    8 During the afternoon of 17 April, Tymara had gone to the pictures with her older half-sister. The arrangement was that when the girls got back to Mortdale station, they would ring home to Ms Gaffney to arrange to be picked up by car. This happened and Ms Gaffney asked the applicant, who was at her home at the time, to pick up the children. The applicant knew of the consent orders made in the Family Court that day. The prospect of losing custody of Tymara was a serious disappointment to Ms Gaffney and her emotional upset was shared by the applicant. This factor, it seems to me, is relevant to the issue of moral culpability, but it tends to point in two directions.  
     
      
    9 As it turned out, unbeknown to the applicant in advance, Mr Mawer was also at the station speaking to Tymara at the roadside. He was recognised by the applicant. The applicant struck him with the car and severely injured him. The precise details of the accident and the inferences to be drawn as to the applicant’s intention were key issues in the trial. 
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge had to act consistent with the jury’s verdicts and its view of the facts adverse to the applicant, if established beyond reasonable doubt. The learned sentencing judge held that the verdicts had acquitted the applicant of intention to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr Mawer, and had also excluded a deliberate or reckless act of wounding. 
     
      
    11 Davidson ADCJ was, however, satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant recognised the man speaking to the two children as Mr Mawer. He further concluded that it was this which, added to his knowledge of what had transpired in the Family Court earlier that day, caused him to drive in the unlawfully dangerous manner that the jury found he did. 
     
      
    12 Mr Mawer was speaking to the two girls near a telegraph pole, which was just on the kerb at a point where Morts Road formed a T-intersection with streets running to its left and right. There is a relatively small area of road where cars can park near the kerb in order to pick up and let down passengers. Just before the turning area there is a raised pedestrian ramp, obviously designed to slow down traffic to enable a left or right hand turn to be made. 
     
      
    13 If such turn is not made with safety, there is a clear potential danger to pedestrians on the footpath opposite the intersection and near the telegraph pole. At the time in question there were a number of people in that area, as well as Mr Mawer and the two daughters of Miss Gaffney. Davidson ADCJ made the following findings about the accident: 
     
      
       
        
        “There were eyewitnesses who attested to the speed at which the prisoner approached and traversed the pedestrian cross speed bump. Although there was a good deal of discrepancies in this part of the evidence, as is frequently the case in a charge of this sort, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was a speed which exceeded that which was safe in all the circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
         
        If the prisoner was intending to make a right hand turn in order to park close to and parallel with the kerb so he could take aboard the children, then he failed to do so. Instead, he continued on over the intersection and collided with the pole and also with Mr Mawer’s leg, causing painful injury to Mr Mawer. 
         
         
        Although there was some factual dispute traversed at the trial, whether he hit the pole and then Mr Mawer, I, in my view, find it unnecessary to determine this, although the objective circumstances of Mr Mawer’s injuries seem to me to clearly point to the car coming into contact with Mr Mawer’s leg and his leg coming into contact then with the pole. 
         
         
        The prisoner’s behaviour after the incident in which Mr Mawer, in obvious and extreme pain, hobbled in a bleeding state to a nearby tobacconist, was indicative, in my view, of no remorse for what had occurred as a result of his handling of this motor vehicle. 
         
         
        Indeed, the evidence of witnesses as to his behaviour towards Mr Mawer indicated that he regarded Mr Mawer as having got his just desserts for daring to speak to Tymara Lee, when in the prisoner’s mind he had no right to do so until the following day at about 1 pm.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    14 His Honour approached the sentencing discretion with the guideline judgments of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and Queen v White (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 in view. He recognised the judgments were not prescriptive like a statute. It is unnecessary to set out the details of the reasoning in the two cases, because the matter at issue in this application for leave to appeal relates to his Honour’s characterisation of the facts which he found. I do not understand the applicant to contend for appealable error if that characterisation was properly made.  
     
      
    15 The sole ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erroneously characterised the driving of the applicant immediately prior to the impact as an “abandonment of responsibility”. That ground was, of course, developed in ways which I shall address. 
     
      
    16 In R V White the leading judgment was given by the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice’s discussion of the factors calling for custodial sentence is at pages 284-6. He concluded at page 286: 
     
      
       
        
        “.... The guideline this Court should give pursuant to section 37A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  
        with respect to the typical case identified above is: A custodial sentence will usually be appropriate unless the offender has a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgment ... “. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    17 The Chief Justice then offered the numerical guidelines. He referred at page 286 to the second limb of the guideline in R v Jurisic (at 231E) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “... With a plea of guilty, however, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional....” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    18 A list of aggravating factors are then mentioned, including: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
         
         (ii) Number of people put at risk. 
         
         (iii) Degree of speed. 
         
         (iv) .... 
         
         (v) Erratic driving 
         
         ....” 
        
       
       
      and eight other factors. The Chief Justice pointed out that references to passages in  
      Jurisic 
       that the question whether or not there was an abandoning of responsibility involved an element of judgment on which sentencing judges could reasonably differ.  
       
      
    19 After discussing various cases the Chief Justice said at 287 [229] – [230]: 
     
      
       
        
        “...The guideline for offences against s 52A(1) and s 52A(3) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
         for the typical case identified above should be: 
         
         
        “Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.’ 
         
         
        In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    20 I return to the reasons of Davidson ADCJ. His Honour held that from the time the applicant recognised Mr Mawer, who was standing at the roadside: 
     
      
       
        
        “... his driving from there on, I find may properly be described within the meaning of the guideline judgment in White’s case, was erratic, in that his emotive impasse was to allow him to take over the role of his motor vehicle to an extent. I do not use the words ‘road rage’ to describe the circumstances as I find them, but there was, in my view, a strong emotive content to his handling of the vehicle from that point on.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    21 After referring to the particular circumstances of the accident and its immediate aftermath, the learned sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “... In those circumstances, I am unable to approach this matter as one in which there was low moral culpability, as indicated by circumstances of momentary inattention or misjudgment, a view of the facts which Mr Crawford-Fish presses upon me. 
         
         
        There was, although for a short period whilst the prisoner was driving along Morts Road, and certainly from the time he negotiated the speed bump, an abandonment of his responsibility. 
         
         
        In my view the prisoner not only put at potential risk Mr Mawer, but perhaps the children and perhaps other persons who were on the footpath in the vicinity of the telegraph pole by his manner of driving.... “ 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    22 Later the offence was characterised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “...The offence was a serious one involving, as I have said, not an insignificant level of moral culpability. It involved for a short period in any event, after he traversed the speed bump in Morts Road until the impact an abandonment of responsibility occasioned by his permitting emotive factors to overcome his control, proper control of the vehicle... “ 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    23 Consistently with the White guideline his Honour also addressed the extent and nature of the injuries suffered by Mr Mawer. Considerable attention had been paid to this in the sentencing proceedings. There had been a victim impact statement and extensive cross-examination. His Honour found that Mr Mawer had suffered serious injuries in the sense that they resulted in pain and an element of continuing disability. That disability had affected Mr Mawer’s capacity to continue in employment, at least to a degree. 
     
      
    24 His Honour also adverted to the fact that the applicant’s driving had put at risk not only Mr Mawer but the two children standing nearby, and perhaps also others. This is indicated as an aggravating factor within the White (supra) guideline. 
     
      
    25 Davidson ADCJ allowed a 20 per cent reduction having regard to the guilty plea, adding that it would have been an acceptance of the inevitable. He then addressed matters personal to the applicant and dealt with them in a manner attracting no criticism in this Court. Good character was taken into account as well as the material concerning the applicant’s current family and psychological state. The applicant is aged forty-two, and is suffering from a level of depression. 
     
      
    26 His Honour determined that the custodial sentence was appropriate and he declined to suspend it. He considered the available Judicial Commission statistics, observing that 47 per cent of persons convicted received a sentence of other than full time custody. His Honour said that he considered a suspended sentence did not meet the objective circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    27 The sentence was backdated to take account of the period of pre-trial custody. Davidson ADCJ imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment to date from 20 August 2002 and set a non-parole period of eighteen months. He declined to displace the statutory term of licence disqualification. 
     
      
    28 The applicant does not dispute the primary findings of fact with regard to speed, recognition of the victim by the applicant and emotion on the part of the applicant. It is accepted that the applicant was going too fast when he went over the speed bump, losing control in the process. Counsel did, however, refer us to evidence at trial to the effect that the speed at the time of impact was between 5 and 15 kilometres an hour. He did not, however, suggest that the finding that that speed was too dangerous in the circumstances was erroneous. 
     
      
    29 The applicant submitted, however, that it was an error on the sentencing judge’s part to have described the unexpected entering into an emotional state for a matter of seconds as an abandonment of responsibility. He submitted that this phrase must have a “more potent meaning” in the Jurisic/White context. Counsel submitted his Honour’s conclusions were not reasonably open in light of the primary facts. He submitted that this was not a case of high moral culpability, or an abandonment of responsibility. 
     
      
    30 It seems to me that this submission involves the type of close parsing of the guideline judgments that is incompatible with their fair reading and inconsistent with the emphasis they make upon the concept of “abandonment of responsibility” involving an element of judgment on which sentencing judges could reasonably differ. Sentencing remains a product of a particular appropriately informed discretion, sometimes referred to as an intuitive synthesis.  
     
      
    31 I am not persuaded that the sentencing judge erred in his characterisation of the particular offence, or his decision to apply the White guideline. There were aggravating features, including substantial injury to Mr Mawer, erratic behaviour, excessive speed and the putting at risk of several people.  
     
      
    32 The conclusion of substantial moral culpability was well open in light of the primary facts. Merely because the dangerous driving was of only a few seconds duration, does not preclude such characterisation. This case involved more than momentary inattention. 
     
      
    33 In White at 284 [205], the Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “... in determining the appropriateness of full time custody and the length thereof, the sentencing judge must give close attention to the degree of moral culpability involved. This is a critical component of the objective circumstances of the offence.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    34 In this case the sentencing judge gave close attention to the degree of moral culpability involved. He did not approach the matter in a mechanistic way. No error has been shown. The Crown is correct to assert the relevance of the fact that this victim was not a stranger and the very qualified remorse of the offender. 
     
      
    35 Although not a substantial ground of appeal, counsel took us to the sentencing statistics. Those statistics do not really bolster the primary attack, nor cast any doubt on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. For one thing, they are not an indicator of individual levels of moral culpability in this range of offences. For another, they show that the custodial sentence that was imposed is at least within the range to the extent that one can speak of a range from those statistics. 
     
      
    36 For those reasons I would grant leave, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    37 HIDDEN J: This was a most unusual case, posing a very difficult sentencing exercise for the trial judge. I must say that this application has troubled me. However, for the reasons identified by the President, it does seem to me that his Honour’s assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability was one which was open to him, and that the sentence imposed was clearly within the range of his Honour’s discretion. I agree with the orders proposed. 
     
      
    38 SHAW J: In my view judicial discretion in sentencing is a vital element of the criminal justice process, and that is so whether other minds might think a sentence was too lenient or too severe. I might not have given a sentence in this case, but that is not the relevant question, and in all the circumstances I agree with the reasons and orders proposed by Mason P. 
     
      
    39 MASON P: The orders of the Court will be as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: I invite Hidden J to give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Jason Chong Hun Chin, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of supplying a commercial quantity of ecstasy, which carries a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment, and a charge of supplying cocaine, which carries a maximum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment. He also asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 a charge of goods in custody. His Honour sentenced the applicant on the first charge, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of three and a half years. On the second charge his Honour sentenced the applicant to a concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for three years. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. 
     
      
    3 The facts can be stated briefly. The first charge arose from the applicant’s supply of ecstasy in tablet form to a number of men over the four-month period between February and June 2001. It is conservatively estimated that over that period he supplied a little under 478g of the drug. On three of those occasions he supplied the drug to a man called Andrew Manser, to whom it will be necessary to refer a little later. In this enterprise the applicant received fairly substantial sums of money. Upon his arrest on 1 June 2001 the applicant was in possession of $7,000, which he had received from Mr Manser for the purpose of one of these transactions, and it was that amount of money that was the subject of the goods in custody charge on the Form 1. 
     
      
    4 The second charge arose from his dealing with cocaine over a period of about a month between April and May 2001. Over that period he supplied about four and a half grams of that drug but he also offered to supply some twenty-nine grams. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was twenty-five years old at the time of the offences and is now twenty-seven. In his earlier adult years he had had a severe gambling problem, which had led to his incurring significant debts. At the time of the offences he was himself abusing drugs but that was not the motivation for his drug supplying. The reason for that was to repay a friend and some family members who had earlier covered substantial debts he had incurred while gambling.  
     
      
    6 His subjective case otherwise was favourable. He had no criminal record of any significance. He came from a supportive family and had a girlfriend who, at the time of sentence, was faithful to him. His Honour found him to be remorseful. He had prospects of rehabilitation and the relationship of the non-parole period to the six-year head sentence on the first charge demonstrates that his Honour found special circumstances warranting that course. 
     
      
    7 His Honour was of the view that an appropriate starting point for sentence was seven and a half years imprisonment and his Honour appears to have intended that to be an appropriate global starting point for both offences. That figure his Honour reduced by twenty per cent so as to arrive at the head sentence of six years on the first charge, in the light of the applicant’s pleas of guilty, although they were not early pleas. 
     
      
    8 Counsel for the applicant in this Court has challenged the sentences on two bases. It is said that they are manifestly excessive and it is also said that the effective sentence of six years is markedly disparate from sentences later imposed on the man Andrew Manser; so disparate as to provide this applicant with a legitimate sense of grievance. 
     
      
    9 As to the first ground, it must be said that the starting point of seven and a half years is high and that the sentences actually passed on each of the offences viewed individually are high. In so saying I am mindful that the first count was, in effect, a rolled up charge embracing a pattern of drug supply over a four month period, and that in passing that sentence his Honour was required to take into account the additional offence on the Form 1. 
     
      
    10 Nevertheless, the practical approach taken by counsel for the applicant is that the ultimate question for this Court is whether the six-year sentence is an appropriate global reflection of the whole of the applicant’s criminality. Put another way, the question for us is this: if his Honour had passed more moderate sentences on each of the charges but had made those sentences wholly or partly cumulative, so as to arrive at an overall sentence of six years, would that global sentence be manifestly excessive? I am not persuaded that it would. 
     
      
    11 There is very little information about the pattern of sentencing for the supply of ecstasy, somewhat surprisingly. We have been referred to no decision of this Court and the Judicial Commission statistics embrace only six cases. On those statistics the sentence passed upon the present applicant is the highest. Nevertheless, looking at the six-year sentence as a global reflection of the applicant’s criminality and, in particular, having regard to the seriousness of the first offence involving the supply of ecstasy over a considerable period, I am not persuaded that that sentence was outside the proper exercise of his Honour’s discretion. 
     
      
    12 The effective non-parole period of three and a half years is undoubtedly a long time in gaol for a young man. Nevertheless, the non-parole period itself must reflect the criminality involved and in my view this non-parole period properly does. In addition, the manner in which his Honour has structured the sentences leaves the applicant with a substantial period of parole eligibility during which his rehabilitation can be fostered. 
     
      
    13 The other challenge to the sentences, as I have said, raises the question of parity with sentences imposed upon the man Andrew Manser. Manser was dealt with by another judge for a charge of also supplying a commercial quantity of ecstasy and a related charge of supplying a relatively small amount of amphetamine. He was sentenced effectively to two years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of eighteen months, to be served by way of periodic detention. The sentencing judge arrived at that lenient result because Manser made out a particularly favourable subjective case, including substantial co-operation with the authorities.  
     
      
    14 The only link between Manser’s criminality and that of the applicant is that part at least of the ecstasy with which Manser was involved was ecstasy supplied to him by the present applicant. In every other respect the offences are separate and distinct. In no sense could Manser be described as a co-offender with the applicant. There is no suggestion that they were acting in concert, in some kind of drug supplying enterprise.  
     
      
    15 No doubt every offender who supplies drugs has got them from someone, but that does not make that someone a co-offender so that an appellate court should look upon the sentences imposed upon each of them and determine whether there is an appropriate relativity between them. For that reason, in my view, the argument based upon parity is misconceived. In any event, as I have said, Manser made out a very favourable subjective case. It does not appear to me that any parity argument could properly be based in the present case because the episodes of criminality of the two men, while in one sense linked, are entirely separate. 
     
      
    16 For those reasons I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but I would dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by Susan Diane Carter against her conviction on one count of ongoing supply of prohibited drug contrary to s 25A (1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, and an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon her following such conviction. The s 25A (1) is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person who, on 3 or more separate occasions during any period of 30 consecutive days, supplies a prohibited drug (other than cannabis) for financial or material reward is guilty of an offence.  
         
        Maximum penalty: 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both” 
        
       
      
    2 It is not disputed that there was evidence available to satisfy the jury that on three occasions during the relevant period of thirty consecutive days the appellant supplied a prohibited drug namely heroin. The issue in the appeal is whether there was evidence from which it was open to the jury to find that she did it on the third of those occasions for financial or material reward. The relevant facts may briefly be summarised as follows. 3 An undercover police officer referred to in the trial and hereafter as “Sally” went to Allsop Park in Nimbin at about 9.30am on 21 April 2001. She subsequently spoke to a person, Cindy McHattan, and Sally followed her to where the appellant sat at a table in the park. Sally heard Ms McHattan say, “She wants 50 of H,” and saw Ms McHattan hand to the appellant $50 which she, Sally, had previously given to her. The appellant then reached into a bag and took out a small clear plastic bag of white powder which was later analysed as heroin which she gave to Ms McHattan and Ms McHattan gave the bag to Sally who was sitting next to her.  
     
      
    4 On 2 May 2001, Sally again went to a bus stop near Allsop Park where she was approached by a man, Robert Tannock. After they had a conversation he went across the road into a newsagency from which he later emerged with the appellant. He returned to Sally and she gave him a $50 note. Sally saw him give the $50 note to the appellant who then gave to Mr Tannock a small plastic bag the contents of which were later analysed and found to be heroin.  
     
      
    5 On 10 May 2001, Sally again went to Nimbin where she arrived at Allsop Park at about 10.20am. She had a conversation with Melissa Pearson and then watched Ms Pearson enter the Freemason Hotel opposite the park. Shortly afterwards Ms Pearson came out of the hotel with the appellant. Sally saw the appellant remove something from her bag and hand it to Ms Pearson. Ms Pearson returned to Sally and gave her a small plastic bag containing what was later analysed and found to be heroin and Sally gave Ms Pearson $50. As Sally left the park she saw Ms Pearson walking in the direction of the Freeman Hotel.  
     
      
    6 In each instance Sally spoke to the intermediary (Cindy McHattan, Robert Tannock, Melissa Pearson), the intermediary spoke to the appellant, the appellant handed the heroin to the intermediary, and the intermediary handed the heroin to Sally in exchange for $50.  
     
      
    7 In the first and second instances, the intermediary was seen to hand the $50 to the appellant, whilst in the third instance, the intermediary was seen heading back to the hotel from which the appellant had emerged, to hand the heroin to the intermediary and to which she had returned, and the handing over of the $50 by the intermediary to the appellant was not observed.  
     
      
    8 It can be conceded that in the first two instances, Sally gave the $50 to the intermediary before the appellant gave the heroin to the intermediary to give to Sally whereas in the third instance, Sally gave the $50 to the intermediary after the appellant gave the heroin to the intermediary but this, in my opinion, is a minor difference of no significance. 9 In summing up, his Honour directed the jury as to the elements of the offence. He told them (SU 16) that the first element of which they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt was that on three separate occasions within thirty consecutive days the accused supplied a prohibited drug, namely, heroin.10 He explained to them the meaning of “supply” in that context, and that heroin was a prohibited drug. He then told them that the other element of which they had to be satisfied was whether the accused supplied the heroin for financial or material reward. He told them that these words have their ordinary meaning, and went on (SU 17): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown says that in each case the accused received or was going to receive $50 for the heroin she supplied. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was the case in respect of each of the three acts of supply, then the Crown has proved this element of the charge and you would be entitled to find her guilty, otherwise she would be entitled to be acquitted of this charge.” 
        
       
      
    11 Much has been made on the hearing of the appeal of the fact that on the third instance there was no evidence of anyone actually seeing the intermediary, Melissa Pearson, hand the $50 to the appellant; and it has therefore been submitted that it was not open to the jury to find that that the appellant received the $50 or any part thereof.  
     
      
    12 However, juries are regularly invited, and properly so, to use their commonsense. It would, in my opinion, to be inconceivable to anyone using their commonsense that on returning to the hotel, Melissa Pearson would not pass the $50 or at least part thereof onto the appellant, the person from whom she had received the heroin.13 It was, therefore, in my opinion open to the jury to find all the essential ingredients of the third instance of supply established and I would, therefore, propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed.14 There was discussion during the course of submissions as to whether or not on a charge under s 25A, it is necessary for it to be the person who supplies the drug to receive, or to intend to receive, the financial or material reward, or whether it is sufficient if some other person receives or intends to receive such reward. For the purposes of this case, it is not necessary to resolve this issue and I express no concluded view upon it. 15 There is also an application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence. The maximum penalty for an offence under the section is imprisonment for twenty years. His Honour imposed a sentence of 3 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months to date from 21 June 2001. The applicant is eligible to be admitted to parole on 20 March 2004.  
     
      
    16 The sole focus of challenge is that the decision not to provide a longer period of supervision by way of special circumstances was in error. It was submitted that the age of the appellant and her prospects of rehabilitation from her drug history required the extension of a longer period of supervision than would be provided by the usual relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period as specified in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 17 The applicant is now aged 41 years and has a lengthy history of drug use and a number of convictions including, more particularly relevant in relation to this matter, a conviction on eleven counts of supply dangerous drug in the Supreme Court of Queensland in January 1993, for which she was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment suspended for the 4 years. She also has convictions in 1997 for driving whilst under the influence of drugs and in 2000 for failing to dispose of a hypodermic needle used in connection with the administration of a dangerous drug. The Pre-Sentence Report disclosed a lengthy history of multiple drug use.18 The submission made really amounts to this, that because of her age, her drug addiction and repeated offending, the ratio prescribed by s 44 should be varied by reducing the non-parole period in the hope that, with a longer period of supervision on parole, she may be less likely to re-offend in the future.  
     
      
    19 This is not a case where there was any firm commitment to undertake any intensive rehabilitation course on her release, nor was it a case where it could be predicted with any confidence that she would be more likely to avoid re-offending if she had a longer non-parole period. It was nothing more than a pious hope.  
     
      
    20 Offenders cannot expect to have the non-parole period reduced to facilitate their rehabilitation unless there are significant positive signs which show that, if allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and not merely a possibility.  
     
      
    21 There was evidence before the learned sentencing judge that she had been attending drug and alcohol sessions whilst in prison but many prisoners do this. What was of greater significance, in my view, was that she had on 2 occasions tested positive for drugs in her urine and warders had observed her apparently affected by drugs on other occasions.  
     
      
    22 She wishes to take up a position of employment in the Northern Territory, but this apparently has only arisen since her arrest. Until then she was happy to remain in Nimbin with its drug culture and take an active part in the supply of drugs. If she is sincere and genuinely believes that the job in the Northern Territory will be beneficial to her there is no reason why she cannot go there and take up that position on her release whenever it may be. There is no evidence that the position will not still be available to her.  
     
      
    23 I can see no error in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion, and I therefore, propose that the appeal against the conviction be dismissed; I would grant leave to appeal against the sentence but would dismiss the appeal and confirm the sentence.24 IPP JA: I agree.25 GREG JAMES J: I agree.26 IPP JA: The order of the Court will be as proposed by Dunford J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: On 9 October 2002 the applicant and his co-offender Thy Theth each pleaded guilty to 10 counts of robbery whilst armed on indictment before his Honour Judge Goldring in the District Court. Each offender asked the Judge to take into account a number of matters on a Form 1. The applicant asked the sentencing Judge to take into account 6 matters in that manner and the co-offender asked the sentencing Judge to take into account 9 matters in that matter. Each of the matters taken into account on the Form 1 was a count of robbery whilst armed.2 On 21 October 2002 his Honour sentenced the applicant as follows: in relation to the counts where no matters were taken into account on the Form 1, that is all counts except count 9, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years from 26 November 2001 until 25 November 2007, with a non-parole period of 3 years from 26 November 2001 until 25 November 2004. In relation to count 9, his Honour imposed a partially concurrent head sentence of 7 ½ years from 26 November 2003 until 25 May 2011, with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months from 26 November 2003 until 25 August 2004.3 On the same day his Honour sentenced the co-offender as follows: in relation to the counts where no matters were taken into account on the Form 1, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 6 years from 26 November 2001 until 25 November 2007 with a non-parole period of 3 years from 26 November 2001 until 25 November 2004 and in relation to the counts where there were matters to be taken into account on the Form 1, a partially concurrent sentence of 7 ½ years from 26 November 2003 until 25 May 2011 with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months from 26 November 2003 until 25 August 2007. The result was that the overall sentences imposed on each offender were the same, namely a head sentence of 9 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months.4 The only ground of appeal relied on is that in imposing identical sentences upon the applicant and the co-offender, Theth, when Theth was older and had 3 more matters being taken into account on a Form 1, his Honour erred, and that such error gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant. It was not submitted, nor could it be, that the sentences were otherwise excessive or that any other error was shown.  
     
      
    5 The applicant, as I have said, was being sentenced for 10 matters on an indictment and 6 matters on a Form 1. The co-offender, Theth, was being sentenced to 10 matters on an indictment and 9 matters on the Form 1. To put it another way, the total number of matters before the Court in relation to the applicant was 16, whereas for the co-offender, Theth, the total number was 19. It was not submitted to the learned sentencing Judge, nor to us, that either offender was less culpable than the other and his Honour agreed with this assessment. His Honour also found that each offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.6 The applicant was born on 25 February 1984 and so was seventeen during the relatively short period during which the robberies were committed, that is between 11 and 25 November 2001. The co-offender, Thef, was born on 17 November 1983 and so was eighteen years old when most of the offences were committed. There was in fact a difference of approximately three months in their respective ages and the co-offender’s eighteenth birthday was on the same day on which the first offence in his indictment was committed.7 It was submitted that given that the offender had 3 fewer armed robbery matters being taken into account than his co-offender, and given that the applicant was a “child” at the time of the offences, the applicant should have received a shorter sentence than the co-offender, and that the failure to impose a shorter sentence gives rise to a “justifiable sense of grievance”, and Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 were referred to.  
     
      
    8 The applicant had four matters on his criminal record, all of which were Children’s Court matters. On 14 December 2000 he had been given a 5 months Control Order for 2 counts of possess prohibited drug, one count of supply prohibited drug and one count of being carried in a stolen vehicle. There were no prior matters of this kind. Theth had only one conviction, and that was for driving whilst suspended.9 In a careful Judgment, his Honour, took into account all relevant factors. The difference in the number of offences on the Forms 1 was of minimal significance, particularly when one considers that they were both engaged in a course of conduct in committing this series of armed robberies over a short period. Most of the offences were committed together. Moreover the differences in their ages was minimal and although of minimal significance the applicant had the worse record. For these reasons I am satisfied that there was no error in his Honour fixing the same sentences for each accused.10 It is however erroneous to say, as suggested in the submissions, that no distinction was drawn between the 2 offenders. His Honour, recognising the applicant’s youth, directed, pursuant to the Childrens (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 s 19, that the term of imprisonment imposed on the applicant be served in a juvenile detention centre until he reaches the age of 21 years. This was of significant benefit to the applicant compared with his co-offender, who must serve the whole of his sentence in an adult institution. I do not doubt that if he had the power, his Honour would have made a similar order in respect to the co-accused, but he was not able to do so and did not do so.  
     
      
    11 As I say, I see no error in identical sentences being imposed on each of the offenders. I would therefore grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.12 GREG JAMES J: I agree. In the careful Judgment to which the presiding Judge has referred, delivered by the trial Judge, the trial Judge had regard to the principles of parity between the accused and such submissions as had been put before him at the sentencing hearing concerning how each of the offenders should be treated. In his remarks, he refers to the principle in Postiglione (1996) 189 CLR 295 and the submission as to the distinction between each of the offenders that the present applicant was a young person and considers the prior criminal record of each of the two offenders. In considering the roles of each, his Honour said, “There is no question that each is equally culpable of their participation in the joint criminal enterprise and the charges against each are roughly equal in weight and number.”13 It is apparent that the matter went forward before his Honour on the basis that they would be treated alike except when it came to consideration of that additional three months of age which disqualified the co-offender from the prospect of such an order as the applicant obtained, enabling him to serve a substantial portion of the custodial portion of his sentence in a juvenile institution. Those matters persuade me that when the matter was dealt with before the trial Judge, all matters to which his attention was directed were taken into account and further it appears to me, that had there been put to him some submission such as is put to us, that there should have been a variation in treatment for the different number of offences taken into account, his Honour would have ruled against that upon the perfectly sensible ground that each of the two were engaged in commission of the joint criminal enterprise involving as it did numerous armed robbery offences. The detail of which was, as between the two, inconsequential to the total penalty to be imposed upon each of them.14 I add these remarks to what have been put by the presiding Judge, lest it be thought that his Honour in anyway fell into error or failed to have regard to all relevant matters. I agree that the application should be granted and the appeal dismissed.15 DUNFORD J: The order will be as I have indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an application by Nathan Dennis Collins for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him by his Honour, Acting Judge Mahoney QC, in the District Court at Gosford on 27 November 2002 following his plea of guilty to one count of Dangerous Driving Occasioning Grievous Bodily Harm contrary to s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 which offence carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment.2 At the time of sentencing his Honour was asked to, and did, take into account 2 further offences on a Form 1, namely, drive whilst disqualified and failure to stop.3 The applicant was sentenced to 4 years 6 months imprisonment to commence on 7 September 2002 and to expire on 6 March 2007. A non-parole period of 3 years and 4 ½ months to commence on 7 September 2002 was imposed. 4 The grounds of appeal are:(1) That the sentence is manifestly excessive.(2) That his Honour erred in failing to have regard to the guideline judgments of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343, 55 NSWLR 252.(3) His Honour erred by failing to allow a sufficient discount for the applicant’s plea of guilty.5 On the evening of 5 and 6 January 2002 there was a large party at an address on the Central Coast near the applicant’s home. At about 12.45 am on Sunday 6 January one Michael Robinson walked to the applicant’s house, knocked on the door and confronted the applicant with an allegation that he had stolen Mr Robinson’s car.6 An argument ensued which ended when the applicant produced a baseball bat and struck Mr Robinson with it. Mr Robinson then ran back to the party. His girlfriend, Ms Roberts, left the party and was walking past the applicant’s house on the way home. She and the applicant argued and Ms Roberts was punched by the applicant’s girlfriend, Ms Sutton, resulting in Ms Roberts falling to the ground. 7 At about this time a large group of twenty-five or more people from the party, including Mr Robinson, were returning to the applicant’s house. The applicant got into the driver’s seat of a white Commodore sedan parked in the driveway. As the group approached him he shouted out at the group and then reversed out of the driveway and drove off at high speed. As the car left the driveway someone from the group threw a metal pole at the car which hit the roof on the driver’s side.8 The applicant accelerated west along Narambi Road and mounted the offside gutter. In so doing he narrowly missed a small group of people on the nature strip there and he collided with a water main causing it to burst and spill water. He went back on to the roadway and at the intersection of Nacooma Road turned the vehicle around and accelerated back down the street from whence he had come.  
     
      
    9 He mounted the gutter near where another group of people were standing. Most of the people in the group managed to jump out of the way with the exception of a Mr McQuarrie who was struck in the leg and suffered a fracture of the left tibia and fibula. His leg was broken in seven places, and at the time of sentence the leg had not healed properly, he had been unable to resume his prior employment and the prognosis was uncertain. The applicant, who was at the time a disqualified driver, drove off and failed to stop. 10 In sentencing the applicant the learned sentencing judge summarised the facts, noted the need for the sentence to reflect the elements of punishment, rehabilitation, general and personal deterrence and referred to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    11 He then noted a number of matters that had been urged in mitigation, namely:(1) The appellant would have felt some anxiety and panic when this mob of people came to the door of his place after the earlier confrontation.(2) That he felt threatened at the time.(3) He felt it would be safer for his de facto wife and her children who were in the house at the time if he drove away from the premises.(4) Because of his prior criminal record he could not have expected the police to respond if he called them for help. 
    12 His Honour referred to testimonials from his de facto wife and her sister and a lady attached to the Wesley Centre, and an offer of employment from an electrician. He noted the early plea of guilty and that the applicant was serving his time in protective custody. He then noted his extensive criminal record.13 His Honour took as a starting point a head sentence of 5 years and allowed 10 per cent reduction on account of the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty, thus reducing it to 4 ½ years and in accordance with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act he fixed a non-parole period of 3 years 4 ½ months.14 In sentencing the applicant his Honour made no direct reference to R v Jurisic or R v Whyte or to R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 guideline judgments concerning this offence and appropriate allowances for the utilitarian value of pleas of guilty.15 The failure to refer to these cases by name or to the specific criteria referred to therein does not necessarily reflect an error of law, but the failure in the judgment to refer to the judgments or to the guidelines or specifically to the various aggravating or mitigating features can suggest that they were not fully appreciated by the learned sentencing judge at the time.16 This was a very serious instance of an offence of drive manner dangerous causing grievous bodily harm because of the dangerousness of the driving and because it arose from what can be seen as an angry or panic reaction to the approach of the other people. It can in my view fairly be described as a “rage” incident.17 The applicant claimed he was merely attempting to get away from those whom he believed were threatening him, but if this is so it is difficult to see why he would turn around at the intersection and come back to where the mob was heading towards his house.  
     
      
    18 Although apparently not affected by alcohol he was enraged, angry and upset when he got into the car and drove accordingly, going on to the footpath on the incorrect side of the road and hitting a water main; then not responding to the seriousness of mounting the footpath and hitting the water main, which should have caused him to realise that he was not driving properly and to slow down, he turned around and came back and again went on to the footpath.19 The offence is aggravated by the fact that he was disqualified from driving, and so should not have been driving at all. It was in my view a clear case of an “abdication of responsibility” as that phrase is used in R v Jurisic and R v Whyte. I say this notwithstanding the element of provocation and the approach of others.20 The applicant has an appalling criminal record, as noted by his Honour including 6 convictions for assault, 3 for break, enter and steal, 6 for stealing including stealing of a motor vehicle, 2 for receiving and one for escape lawful custody and a 1994 conviction for drive in a manner dangerous.21 On 5 March 2001 he was sentenced at Campbelltown Local Court for drive manner dangerous, unlicensed driver, take and drive conveyance, break, enter and steal, be carried in conveyance, and a number of other matters and was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months on the charge of drive in a manner dangerous with a non-parole period of 9 months and for the offence of take and drive conveyance to imprisonment for 6 months. There were other concurrent sentences also imposed at the same time.22 Owing to a clerical error, only the warrant for imprisonment for 6 months was issued, and consequently he was released at the end of that time and not on parole. If the warrant had been issued correctly he would have been on parole at the time of the commission of these offences. In fact, he had been released and, as I say, not on parole.23 By the time he stood for sentence before his Honour he had also been convicted of various matters at Wyong Local Court when he failed to appear, and subsequently sentenced for those and convicted and sentenced for other matters at the Campbelltown Local Court on 9 May 2002. Those offences included 3 counts of driving whilst disqualified and one of maliciously destroy or damage property and it appears that all of those offences were committed after this offence.24 Jurisic and Whyte set out guidelines for offences of this nature and indicate a head sentence of not less than 2 years imprisonment, but those guidelines are said to be referable to young offenders of good character with no, or limited, prior convictions, genuine remorse and a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value: Whyte at [204]. Here the applicant was not a young offender, and was not of good character with no or limited previous convictions. Indeed, he had a conviction one year previously for this very offence, for which he had been sentenced to prison.25 He expressed remorse in his letter to the sentencing judge but, as I say, in the meantime had committed further offences; although it must be conceded that that was apparently before he was actually charged with this offence.26 There were aggravating features compared with Jurisic and Whyte, particularly the extent and nature of the injuries inflicted, the number of people put at risk though only one was injured, the degree of speed, the erratic driving and the ignoring of the warning which should have been apparent from previously hitting the water main et cetera, and the failure to stop. These were all aggravating features. 27 I note the psychologist’s report relating to his family history and the testimonials from his de facto wife and his sister and the lady from the Wesley Centre and his own letter to the sentencing judge. 28 In the light of those matters I feel there is a good prospect that at his age, which is now just turned 30, on his release he will make a genuine attempt to lead a law abiding life with the support of his said wife, and that he has reasonable prospects of doing so.29 Material filed in the affidavits indicate that he is serving the sentence on protection and, subject to the restrictions imposed by being on protection, he is using his time in gaol usefully and avoiding drugs. The sentence must be heavier than would otherwise be the case to allow for the matters on the Form 1: Attorney General’s Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518, 56 NSWLR 146, but allowance must be made for the harsher impact of service of the sentence on protection.  
     
      
    30 Jurisic and Whyte have built into them an allowance for a late plea of guilty of limited value: Thomson at [161], but in my opinion this is an appropriate case where a discount of something in the vicinity of 20 per cent should have been allowed.31 Taking all these factors into account I am satisfied that his Honour erred in only allowing a 10 per cent discount, and the sentence overall is manifestly excessive. I would take as a starting point a sentence of a period of 4 years and allow a discount for the plea of guilty, including its utilitarian value, of approximately 20 per cent, thus reducing the head sentence to 3 years and 3 months. Three quarters of this is 2 years and 5 months but I consider that the rehabilitation of the applicant would be facilitated by at least 12 months on parole under supervision, and to this extent I find there are special circumstances and I would fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months.32 I therefore propose that leave to appeal be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentence quashed. Taking into account the matters on the Form 1 I propose that the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 3 years and 3 months to date from 7 September 2002, and I would fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, so that the date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 6 December 2004. I would confirm the period of disqualification. 33 GREG JAMES J: I agree.34 DUNFORD J: The order of the Court will be as I have indicated.

   DECISION : 
   It is appropriate for this court to intervene and to pass in lieu of the sentence passed by the learned trial judge a sentence of six and a half years to date from 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 April 2010 with a non-parole period of four years to commence on 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 October 2007. The sentence for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm of a two year fixed term should stand but commence upon 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2004. This would mean that there would be an overall sentence of some seven and a half years imprisonment with a five year non-parole period. The sentence would commence on 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2010, the non-parole period to commence the same date but would expire on 14 October 2007. The earliest date upon which the applicant might be eligible for parole would be 14 October 2007.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
    1 GREG JAMES J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Nield QC in the District Court of New South Wales at Parramatta following a trial at which the offender pleaded not guilty to two charges, the first being a charge of robbery in company, the second being a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
     
      
    2 Following the verdict of the jury which was a verdict of guilty on each charge, his Honour sentenced the offender for the offence of robbery in company, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, to a term of imprisonment of eight years commencing 15 October 2003 and expiring 14 October 2011. In respect of that sentence his Honour imposed a non-parole period of five years expiring on 14 October 2008.  
     
      
    3 For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, his Honour sentenced the offender to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years to commence on 15 October 2002 and to expire on 14 October 2004. It can therefore be seen that one year of the sentences overlapped. The effective total sentence thus passed by his Honour was one of imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had been at the time of the commission of the instant offences on parole. He had on 15 November 2001 failed to appear at Burwood Local Court in relation to a matter for which he was on bail to that court to that date. The Parole Board ordered the revocation of the applicant’s parole and directed that the parole order be treated as having been revoked on 4 August 2001. He was arrested on 6 December 2001 and when arrested was charged with the matters the subject of this appeal. He has been in continuous custody since.  
     
      
    5 In a careful and closely reasoned judgment his Honour the trial judge reviewed the circumstances of the offence and all the matters to which he was required, particularly by s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, to have regard. His Honour referred to the circumstances of the commission of the offence in the following way:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As to the robbery of and assault upon the victim this, stated briefly, is what happened. Shortly after he had left a train at Lidcombe railway station, Mr. Wong was accosted by two males of Asian appearance, one of whom was the offender. The offender’s co-offender told Mr. Wong that he had a knife and that he, Mr. Wong, must go with them. The offender’s co-offender took Mr. Wong’s wallet and mobile telephone and demanded that Mr. Wong tell him his personal identification number for his telephone. Being fearful of what might happen to him, Mr. Wong told them the personal identification number for his telephone. As they walked along, they came upon some people walking towards them. After they had passed these people, Mr. Wong ran off in the hope of escaping from the offender and his co-offender. However, he was chased and caught and attacked by the offender and his co-offender. The assault took place in the driveway of 3 Railway Parade at the corner with Clarence Street at Lidcombe just as Ms. Donna Natale was driving her car into the driveway. Notwithstanding Mrs. Natale’s presence, the offender and his co-offender continued their assault upon Mr. Wong and, as they did so, the offender put his hand on the driver’s side of the bonnet of Mrs. Natale’s car, leaving a fingerprint on it. His fingerprint linked him positively to the robbery of and assault upon Mr. Wong. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr. Wong lost his wallet containing his identification papers, $40 Australian, $1,000 Hong Kong and his mobile telephone.” 
        
       
      
    6 It is apparent that not only were there two charges but there were two critical events in this period of criminality separated by Mr. Wong’s attempt to escape and the chase by the offenders of him after the robbery and prior to their assault upon him. As his Honour’s remarks make clear in a later passage, Mr. Wong suffered some considerable injury during the punching and kicking by the offender and the co-offender of him in the assault. Other material not referred to by his Honour in the judgment makes it clear that Mr. Wong woke up from a period of unconsciousness in hospital with his face covered with blood, although he did not sustain any facial fractures.  
     
      
    7 The learned trial judge enumerated matters that he took into consideration. It is not necessary to review these in detail as no challenge has been made to his Honour having taken into account the particular matters nor is it suggested that he failed to take into account any particular matter.  
     
      
    8 It is, however, submitted that his Honour fell into error in three ways. Firstly, that the sentence, and in particular the sentence for the offence of robbery in company, was manifestly excessive; secondly, that his Honour erred in failing to have sufficient regard to the applicant’s subjective circumstances; thirdly, that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in accumulating the sentences for the year that he did and in accumulating these sentences upon the head sentence the applicant had been serving on parole at the time which the offence was committed.  
     
      
    9 It is convenient to turn initially to the second ground. The learned trial Judge set out the relevant subjective circumstances to which counsel has taken us in his remarks on sentence. He noted that the offender was 27 years and five months at the time of the commission of the offence. He had been born in South Vietnam and was the eighth of his parents nine children. His father died during 1990. His mother died on 24 January 2002. Other material in the trial papers indicates that the offender was disturbed at being unable to visit his mother in Vietnam prior to her death. The offender was raised in a rural setting and escaped from Vietnam in 1987 when aged 13 years. He lived in a refugee camp in Malaysia for some nine months and emigrated from there into Australia with his brother and sister toward the end of 1987.  
     
      
    10 He had been educated at Chester Hill High School, Canterbury High School and then Marrickville High School having lived in Sydney with an uncle but was expelled from each High School for disobedience. He had a limited education not completing Year 10. He had held one job for a period of time as a press operator and had apparently enjoyed good health. 
     
      
    11 His Honour specifically rejected that matters referred to in a psychologist’s report were of useful bearing from the point of view of sentence upon the circumstances of the offender’s commission of the subject offence. 
     
      
    12 He is a single person with no dependents who had when young commenced the use of alcohol and drugs. He had attempted apparently to cease the consumption of alcohol and drugs but had been found twice with a prohibited drug in his urine sample whilst in gaol.  
     
      
    13 As against these, the trial Judge referred to the applicant’s prior criminal record. He had been dealt with for some 22 offences, nine in the Children’s Court, four in the Local Court and nine in the District Court. The offences included an offence of aggravated robbery with wounding, an offence of malicious wounding, two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, four offences of assault, one offence of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, offences of kidnapping, breaking, entering and stealing and using a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear beyond doubt that the offender has learned nothing whatsoever from his previous convictions and the penalties imposed upon him therefore.” 
        
       
      
    14 The subjective circumstances to which his Honour referred were the subject of a submission that the applicant’s history of dislocation as a refugee from Vietnam, the loss of his parents, his drug addictions and the expression of regret by him in his evidence for having committed this offence were such as to show that the sentence exceeded that which was appropriate for that reason alone. I do not accept that submission, particularly when one has regard to the applicant’s prior offences and the commission of this offence whilst on parole.  
     
      
    15 It is convenient then to turn to the question of cumulation. It was submitted that his Honour had erred in passing, as he was required to do, consonant with Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, separate sentences for the offences of robbery in company and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and then cumulating, to the extent that he did, those sentences since it was submitted that the offences were so close in time, involved the same victim and the same offenders as to constitute a single continuing episode. Even should that be accepted, though as I have already referred to the two events were separated by the victim’s attempt to flee, nonetheless it does not seem to me that it was not open to his Honour acting in accordance with a sound discretion to have passed sentence in a way which involved a degree of cumulation and I do not see that complaint might properly be made about an effective additional component of one year of full-time custody to reflect the additional offence. In my view, that ground also should be dismissed.  
     
      
    16 That takes me then to the last submission made which was in support of ground one in the notice of appeal. The trial judge concluded that having regard to what he had said concerning the offences and the offender and balancing those features:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have determined that the sentence for the robbery in company offence must be imprisonment for eight years and the sentence for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence must be imprisonment for three years.”  
        
       
      
    17 His Honour then had regard to the principle of totality and determined that the overall sentence must be imprisonment for nine years. His Honour reached the conclusion that this sentence must be passed particularly in the light of what his Honour said concerning his expectation that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As history has the habit of repeating itself his history of criminal offending will repeat itself after his release from prison.” 
        
       
      
    18 In his view there had to be passed a sentence with a substantial and condign deterrent aspect. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In view of the offender’s criminal record, including, as it does, twice having breached his parole, he must be reminded yet again and loudly and clearly that repeat offending will not be condoned nor tolerated. The sentences imposed upon him must stand as a warning to others who may think of doing what he has done.”  
        
       
      
    19 His Honour doubted the offender’s protestations of contrition and doubted any motivation towards any rehabilitation. His Honour treated the breach of parole as an aggravating feature of the offences and having regard to s.21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 his Honour was plainly right to do so. Even though his Honour’s direction that the sentences should commence at the expiration of the parole period, parole having been revoked, and his Honour having treated the breach of parole as an aggravation and the Parole Board having revoked the parole, means that in three different ways the appellant must pay for his breaching parole by the commission of this offence, it does not seem to me that that is not what the law provides for. Indeed it is a consequence of having enjoyed conditional liberty upon an undertaking to be of good behaviour that, if you breach that undertaking, you aggravate your culpability for offence you commit which constitutes the breach, you surrender the prospect of liberty which you have enjoyed conditionally upon your not committing a breach and you must expect to serve in custody the sentence from the custodial nature of which you had been liberated conditionally.  
     
      
    20 That being said when I turned to the actual facts of the offender’s involvement in the offence of robbery it can be seen that it did not include his performing the role of threatening the victim explicitly and it did not include his involvement in any direct application of corporal violence, even to the extent of his personally taking the victim’s property. He did punch and kick the victim and in this regard I see no possible error in the sentence of a fixed term of two years for the assault. However, I have come to the conclusion, notwithstanding the able submissions put by the learned Crown Prosecutor, that the sentence of eight years for the robbery in company offence was well in excess of that governed by the exercise of a sound discretion having regard to the offender’s role and the objective circumstances of that offence, notwithstanding the applicant’s prior record and that the offence had been committed on parole.  
     
      
    21 I would, therefore, consider that it is appropriate for this court to intervene and to pass in lieu of the sentence passed by the learned trial judge a sentence of six and a half years to date from 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 April 2010 with a non-parole period of four years to commence on 15 October 2003 and to expire on 14 October 2007. The sentence for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm of a two year fixed term should stand but commence upon 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2004. This would mean that there would be an overall sentence of some seven and a half years imprisonment with a five year non-parole period. The sentence would commence on 15 October 2002 and expire on 14 October 2010, the non-parole period to commence the same date but would expire on 14 October 2007. The earliest date upon which the applicant might be eligible for parole would be 14 October 2007.  
     
      
    22 Such a sentence of course means that I accept, as the trial judge did, that there are special circumstances arising from the accumulation and from the dating of the sentence commencement date such as warrant a non-parole period of the length to which I have referred.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon the applicant by his Honour Judge Bellear. The applicant stood trial before his Honour and a jury on an indictment containing three counts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Aggravated break and enter of a dwelling house and commit a serious indictable offence, contrary to s 112(2) of the  
        Crimes Act. 
         
        Count 2: Demanding money with intent to steal, contrary to s 99 of that Act; 
         
        Count 3: Maliciously damaging property, contrary to s 195 of that Act. 
        
       
      
    2 On 13 September 2002 the applicant was convicted of each offence on the indictment. The applicant, therefore, became liable to a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment in respect of the first count, 10 years imprisonment for the second count and 5 years imprisonment for the third count. 
     
      
    3 On 21 March 2003 Judge Bellear sentenced the applicant in respect of the first count to 6 years imprisonment. He backdated the sentence to commence on 13 September 2002 the date upon which the applicant entered custody. His Honour specified a non-parole period of 3 years to expire on 12 September 2005. In respect of the other two counts, his Honour imposed fixed sentences of 2 years and 12 months respectively, both of those sentences to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for the first count. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had stood trial with a co-offender, named Michael Traynor. He was charged with the same three offences and was also convicted of them by the jury. His Honour imposed upon Traynor the same sentences as he imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
    5 On the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal, the applicant, who is unrepresented on the hearing of this matter, stated that she believed that the sentence was manifestly excessive and severe and that Judge Bellear had dealt with her “rather harshly”. She has since filed written submissions setting out the basis upon which she claims that the sentence imposed upon her was too severe and has also addressed us this morning in amplification of the written submissions that she had sent to the Registry. I will deal with the particular matters she raises in the submissions shortly. 
     
      
    6 The facts giving rise to the offence of which the applicant was convicted can be stated briefly and are drawn from the sentencing remarks of Judge Bellear. In June 2001 the victim of the offences was living in a townhouse with her 10-month old child. She advertised for a female person to share her accommodation. The applicant answered the advertisement and shortly thereafter commenced living with the victim at a rent of $100. A condition of the applicant moving into the premises was that she pay a bond of $400 and two weeks rent. However, as she was unable to immediately meet these payments, an agreement was reached that she pay $300 the first week and a further $300 when she was paid. 
     
      
    7 Shortly after the applicant moved into the flat Traynor, who was then her boyfriend, started visiting the premises almost every day. On 3 July 2001 the victim complained to the applicant of receiving threatening phone calls from Traynor and indicated that he was no longer welcome at the townhouse. Later that day the victim asked the applicant to move out. This resulted in a heated confrontation between them during which the applicant demanded the return of her bond money. The argument concluded with the applicant storming out of the unit. 
     
      
    8 The next day, while the victim was watching television, she heard several loud bangs on the front security door. She went upstairs to look through a window and after returning downstairs heard further banging on the door. It was at this stage that Traynor opened the door and entered armed with a hockey stick, swung the weapon in the victim’s direction and struck her to the back of the head. He then pushed her causing her to fall on to the lounge. As the victim got up, she saw the applicant entering the room armed with a baseball bat. The applicant swung the bat at the victim hitting her on the left side of her left leg just below the knee. The applicant then demanded that the victim get her purse as they were going out to an establishment called Quix to obtain some money. The victim, however, refused to leave her child. The applicant again struck the victim this time on her left hand in the vicinity of her wrist. She said words to the effect of “If I am not going to get the money I am going to take $400 worth” and then commenced to smash items in the premises with the baseball bat. Traynor intervened to prevent the applicant from damaging further property and they left the unit. The serious offence alleged in the first count was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the victim. 
     
      
    9 The applicant and her co-offender denied that they had attended the victim’s premises on the night in question. 
     
      
    10 As a result of the attack upon her, the victim suffered an injury to her head that was described as extra-cranial soft tissue injury which did not cause any loss of consciousness or neck pain. The victim, however, complained of suffering headaches as a result. Clearly this injury resulted from the blow struck to her by Traynor. The victim also suffered soft tissue injuries to the left wrist and hand and left lower limb and a small scratch to the left little finger. Some of these injuries were a result of the attack upon her by the applicant. His Honour described the injuries as serious although there was no suggestion of any permanent damage. 
     
      
    11 Although the circumstance of aggravation alleged in the first count was that the applicant was armed with an offensive weapon, the base-ball bat, Judge Bellear took into account, as he was entitled to do, other circumstances of aggravation listed in s 105A of the Crimes Act and which were present when that offence was committed. These included that the applicant was in company, that corporal violence was used against the victim and that the applicant knew that the victim was in the premises when they entered it. 
     
      
    12 His Honour found that the applicant had shown no remorse whatsoever. Unlike her co-offender, the applicant continued to deny any wrongdoing on her part when interviewed by a Probation Officer for the purpose of preparing a pre-sentence report. In her written submissions to this Court, the applicant has admitted her involvement to the extent of damaging the victim’s property and expressed her shame and remorse for that behaviour. However, it is apparent that she is still attempting to minimise her criminality. She claims that she had no intention of assaulting the victim but that the victim stepped in the way as the applicant attempted to swing the baseball bat at the television. 
     
      
    13 In sentencing the applicant, his Honour noted that she had no prior criminal record but he was of the view that the offences were extremely serious and that general deterrence had to play a large part in the sentencing of the applicant and her co-offender. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The community demands that offences such as these must command penalties that tell others contemplating committing such offences that these offences are abhorrent to community standards and that they can expect little sympathy from this and other courts.” 
        
       
       
      Notwithstanding submissions made by the applicant today before us as to the fact that there was no requirement for his Honour to impose a sentence upon her by way of general deterrence, in my view, his Honour was clearly correct in his assessment of the role to be played by both general deterrence and denunciation in the determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the applicant and her co-offender. The offence was a serious example of its kind and required the imposition of a severe sentence notwithstanding that a strong subjective case was placed before the sentencing judge on the applicant’s behalf. 
       
      
    14 The applicant was aged 21 years at the time of sentencing and there was no suggestion that she had displayed violence to any person or property before committing these offences. She is the mother of a child now aged 15 and a half months and who was aged 12 months at the time the applicant appeared for sentencing. The father of the child is her co-offender. During the applicant’s remand in custody pending sentence the child had been in the care of different persons and at the time of sentence was with the applicant’s mother. In her written submissions the applicant concedes that Judge Bellear took this matter into account, but she contends that he did not give it enough weight. She points to the fact that on more than one occasion during his sentencing remarks his Honour referred to the child’s age as being 12 years rather than 12 months and asserts that this showed “a lack of understanding” on his Honour’s part. 
     
      
    15 It is clear from a reading of the transcript and the remarks that his Honour was well aware of the child’s true age and that he showed throughout the sentencing proceedings that he was conscious of the detrimental effect on the child of forced separation from the applicant and concerned to minimise it if he could. His Honour went so far as to make a recommendation that the applicant be admitted to an establishment within the prison system called Jacaranda House where there was at the time, and is currently, a programme accommodating prisoners with very young children. Although the applicant complained to us that his Honour made this recommendation and therefore appeared to take into account her need to be with her child after he had sentenced her it is the normal case that such a recommendation would be made after sentence was in fact imposed. The applicant states that this recommendation cannot be given effect because of the violent nature of the offence. But that is not of itself a ground for interfering with the sentence or a matter that this Court can address. 
     
      
    16 A pre-sentence report placed before his Honour disclosed that the applicant had a difficult up-bringing in what was described as a “dysfunctional family”. She had suffered a history of neglect and abuse both from her family and in other personal relationships in which she had been involved prior to the commission of the offences. However, she presented as a having a strong and independent character. Despite the fact that the applicant had received counselling in respect of the abuse from which she had suffered in her youth, the probation officer was of the view that the applicant could benefit from further professional assistance in that regard. 
     
      
    17 A psychological report, which was in evidence, dealt in detail with the applicant’s unfortunate background to which it is unnecessary to refer for the purposes of determining this appeal. The applicant was found to rank highly on intelligence tests administered to her but personality testing indicated that she felt isolated and had low self-esteem. The psychologist concluded that she required on-going counselling to address these problems. It was recommended that the applicant attend an anger management course in order to learn how to deal with conflict more effectively. 
     
      
    18 Judge Bellear found that there were special circumstances by reason of a combination of matters subjective to the applicant including the need for her to be reunited with her child as soon as possible. As a result his Honour reduced the non-parole period to one of three years, which, on its face, is the least period of imprisonment that could reasonably reflect the seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    19 The applicant has submitted that his Honour made some factual errors that affected his assessment of both the objective seriousness of the offence and her role in it. She complains that his Honour stated that the victim’s child was in the lounge room at the time of the assault whereas the true situation was that it was upstairs. I see no substance in this complaint. The only relevant matter so far as the child was concerned was its presence in the house at the time the victim was assaulted not where in the house it was. In any event it was not a matter that his Honour relied upon as an aggravating factor and it cannot reasonably be assumed that the error could have affected his Honour’s assessment of the applicant’s criminality or the appropriate sentence to reflect it. 
     
      
    20 The applicant also disputes that the attack was as serious as his Honour found it to be. She sets out in her written submissions the injuries suffered by the victim in support of this contention although she fails to refer to the injury to the head. Although, as I have indicated, that injury was occasioned by the blow administered by Traynor, this was a joint criminal enterprise to attack the victim with weapons and the applicant bears criminal responsibility for all the injuries inflicted during it. In any event, it was a matter for the trial judge to determine the facts and there has been no reason shown for this Court to interfere with his findings in this regard. But whether the applicant struck the victim once or more than once is of no great moment in light of the violent activity in which she and her co-offender were involved. 
     
      
    21 The applicant takes issue with Judge Bellear’s finding that she was the main instigator in the attack upon the victim. His Honour’s reasons for forming that opinion were that the applicant had been staying at the house, that she paid the bond money and wanted it back, and that she had been described as the dominant person in her relationship with Traynor. This last matter appears to have come from the pre-sentence report in respect of Traynor and was thus not admissible against the applicant. In my view that finding could not be used by the judge to determine the facts upon which the applicant was to be sentenced. 
     
      
    22 The applicant has submitted that she and the co-offender should have been considered to have the same level of criminal responsibility for the offences. She refers to the fact that it was Traynor who made threatening phone calls to the victim which brought about the dispute between the victim and her, that it was Traynor who first entered the room and assaulted the victim and that he intervened to stop the applicant damaging more property which, the applicant submits, indicated his control over her. She also points to findings by the psychologist which, so the applicant contends, reveal that her personality was such that she would not have been the dominant person in her relationship with Traynor. 
     
      
    23 While there might be some merit in the applicant’s complaint about the basis upon which his Honour concluded that her level of culpability was greater than that of her co-offender, I do not believe that a finding that the applicant and the co-offender were equally culpable would have made any difference to the sentence imposed upon her. The applicant’s involvement in the offence included attacking the victim with the baseball bat, intentionally inflicting injuries upon her, demanding that she go with the applicant to obtain money and then, when she refused, proceeding to damage property of the victim until Traynor intervened. In any event, his Honour held that Traynor was “not that far down the ladder in culpability” and imposed the same sentence on him. 
     
      
    24 I do not believe that the applicant has any reasonable basis to complain about that result. I note that Traynor had a prior offence for inflicting harm for which he received a bond in 1998. But there were matters in Traynor’s favour not present in the applicant’s case. He had to some extent admitted the offences by the time he came to be sentenced and had expressed remorse and some insight into his behaviour. There were also psychiatric issues in Traynor’s case relevant to the assessment of the sentence to be imposed upon him. In my view there is no basis for this Court to interfere with the sentence imposed by Judge Bellear by reason of any of the factual findings he made and about which the applicant complains.25 Finally, the applicant in her written submissions submitted that his Honour could not have given sufficient weight to her previous good character because she was not given the chance by way of a bond or suspended sentence to prove herself. She pointed to the fact that she had been on a lengthy period of bail and had always attended court hearings. The simple answer to that complaint is that the offence was so serious, however it might be described, that his Honour had no alternative but to impose a heavy sentence despite the applicant’s good record and the other subjective matters taken into account by him. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion there is no error shown in his Honour’s remarks on sentence or in the sentence actually imposed which would justify the intervention of this Court. The applicant claims that she is now remorseful and that steps have been undertaken, or can be undertaken on her release, to advance her rehabilitation. She has addressed the Court this morning on the basis that the twelve months that she has been in custody has acted as a deterrent to her ever involving herself in criminal activity again. Unfortunately for the applicant these matters cannot avail her in the absence of appealable error being shown. The impact of imprisonment upon the welfare of the applicant’s child and the difficulties that may be experienced by the applicant’s mother in caring for the child are not sufficiently exceptional so that they can be taken into account in reducing what is an otherwise appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    27 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

     Regina v Jason Andrew Burt 
      
    The appellant was found guilty of five counts of assault with an act of indecency under s61L of the Crimes Act 1900, and one count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent under s61I of the Crimes Act, all of which relate to incidents that took place on 26 October 2001 at the complainant’s house. The appellant now appeals against those convictions.Directions relating to the Standard of ProofThe appellant accepted that his Honour correctly directed the jury as to the need for the Crown to prove each allegation beyond reasonable doubt, but submitted that this standard was undermined by an implicit suggestion in the directions that if they preferred the complainant’s version over that of the appellant, they should then determine whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, without regard to the appellant’s evidence. Held, refusing leave to argue the ground, a proper balance was maintained in the summing up and the jury were directed in a way that meant that they would not have fallen into the error of simply choosing one version of events over another, or of assessing the Crown case without reference to the evidence of the appellant.Murray DirectionIn cases of sexual assault, where there is a conflict between the evidence of the complainant and the accused, it is desirable and common practice for a Murray direction to be given, although the need for it depends upon the circumstances of the case – R v Connors. Held, while it may have been desirable in this case for such a direction to be given, there was sound consideration of the , the jury were made aware of the need to examine with great care the complainant’s evidence. Leave to raise this ground refused.Whether the absence of any instruction in relation to the appellant’s knowledge, or recklessness, as to the complainant’s lack of consent resulted in a miscarriage of justiceIt was submitted that the directions given to the jury were insufficient and did not adequately deal with the element of knowledge concerning lack of consent. The primary issue whether the complainant was ‘forced’ by the appellant to carry out or submit to the acts alleged was explained in detail to the jury. The secondary issue whether the appellant had known that the complainant had not been consenting, or had been reckless as to whether he had consented was not addressed in the summing up, nor was any direction in that respect requested on behalf of the appellant.An appeal is not to be approached as a microscopic examination of everything which was said by a trial judge in an attempt to find a technical omission or error – R v ITA. Moreover, leave should not be given to challenge a conviction, simply by reference to the failure of a trial judge to give a direction, which was not sought at trial, unless that failure has caused a miscarriage of justice, the proof of which lies on the appellant – R v PAH, Saffron v The Queen and R v Button.Although it may have been desirable for directions, concerning awareness of lack of consent or recklessness in relation thereto, to have been given, the omission did not, in the context of the issue fought at trial, give rise to a miscarriage of justice – Holland v The Queen (1993) 117 ALR 193Orders:1. Leave to argue Ground 1 to 4 refused.2. Appeal dismissed

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The appellant stood trial at Bathurst District Court before his Honour Judge Nield and a jury, on five counts of assault with an act of indecency (s 61L Crimes Act 1900) and one count of sexual intercourse without consent (s 61I Crimes Act). The latter count was substituted for the count originally preferred of sexual intercourse without consent, when leave was given to the Crown to amend the indictment, at the conclusion of the evidence called from the complainant. 
     
      
    2 The appellant was found guilty of all counts, and sentenced in relation to three counts of indecent assault to fixed terms of imprisonment each of 6 months, to date from 4 November 2002. In relation to the two remaining indecent assault counts, fixed terms of 6 months were imposed, cumulative on the first mentioned sentences. For the count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year, was fixed, and was directed to be served cumulatively upon the first mentioned sentences, and concurrently with the sentences which had been directed to be served cumulatively upon them. The effective sentencing order was accordingly one of 3 years imprisonment with a non parole period of 18 months.  
     
      
       
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 The complainant gave evidence that on the day of the offences, Friday 26 October 2001, he had been aged 17 years old. He was living in Rankin Street Bathurst by himself. His account of the events that day may be noted. 
     
      
    4 At about 3.30 that morning he was asleep on the sofa. He had purchased some cannabis the previous day and shared it with three others. The effect of the cannabis had lasted a couple of hours, and he was unaffected when he went to sleep. He heard the phone ring but did not answer it. Instead he pressed “*10#” and found that the call was from a mobile. Shortly afterwards he heard knocking and then bashing on the front door, where he found the appellant, whom he knew. He said that the appellant was carrying a bottle of Bundaberg Rum and Coke mixed in a two litre Coke bottle, a stick of marijuana and a pouch of White Ox tobacco. Together they went into the lounge room where the appellant sat on one lounge and the complainant sat on the other. They smoked some cones. 
     
      
    5 The appellant then started talking. He came over to the complainant and put his hands on the wall near his shoulders and said “What would you do if I tried to fuck you up the arse?” The complainant said “I’d smash you”. 
     
      
    6 The appellant sat back down and he and the complainant resumed talking. They smoked some more cones. The appellant then instructed the complainant to come over and sit between his legs and to rub his penis. The complainant said that at this stage he felt a bit scared. The appellant added that he would bash him if he did not do what he told him to do. The complainant described feeling as if adrenalin was going through him and said that he just froze. 
     
      
    7 The complainant sat between the appellant’s legs and the latter started rubbing his chest and shoulders and sucking his left ear. He removed the complainant’s shirt and started rubbing his chest. He then asked the complainant to take his pants off. The complainant complied because he was scared of what would happen if he refused. The complainant stripped to his boxer shorts but the appellant said, “Take them off as well”. The complainant said that it was too cold and the appellant replied, “Do it or I am just going to bash you”.  
     
      
    8 At this time the appellant was stroking the complainant’s chest and shoulders. The appellant undid his fly and asked the complainant to rub his penis. The complainant declined, but the appellant took his right hand and put it on his [the appellant’s] penis. The complainant rubbed the appellant’s erect penis up and down (Count 1). The appellant grabbed the complainant’s penis and started to masturbate him (Count 2). Then he instructed the complainant to “wank him”. The complainant did this and the appellant ejaculated onto the top of his pants and leg near his hip (Count 3). 
     
      
    9 The complainant informed the appellant that he would get some tissue paper to clean himself up. He walked outside to the toilet, which was out the back. He did not run away as he was too scared, although he conceded that he could have done so. The complainant returned with some toilet paper, which the appellant used, and then placed in a ball beside the lounge.  
     
      
    10 The appellant and the complainant both put their clothes back on. The appellant said that he wanted to go to the Chinese bakery on George Street to get some pies. At this time it was about 5.00 am. They both walked to the bakery and bought some pies. It was the complainant’s account that they walked down Rankin Street and cut across the car park of the RSL club. He drew on Exhibit 2 a route that would have taken them past the Police Station. The complainant conceded that he was near to the Police Station but says that he did not run, as he was too scared to do so. It was his account that during their walk to fetch the pies, the appellant suggested that the complainant was going to “dog” him, that is, tell somebody what had occurred. When the complainant denied having any intention, the appellant, on his account, said that he was going to “hospitalise” him when they got back to his house.  
     
      
    11 The complainant and the appellant returned to the flat in Rankin Street. The appellant said to the complainant, “Go make a cup of tea for me and I might not flog you”. The complainant started walking to the kitchen when the appellant said, “You can bring everything out here and make [it] in front of me because you might do the runner.” The complainant obtained a teabag, cup, sugar, milk and kettle and the appellant watched him make the tea. 
     
      
    12 The complainant spilt the sugar and said, “fuck”. The appellant asked, “what did you say that for?” The complainant’s reply, “I accidentally spilt the sugar on the floor” appeared to have annoyed the appellant, who swung his elbow at the complainant. It did not make contact. At this stage the complainant thought, “He’s not playing”. 
     
      
    13 The appellant then told him to take his pants off, and he complied, although unable to believe what was happening. The appellant started masturbating him. He did not have an erection and the appellant asked him why he “was not getting off”, to which he replied that he was not gay and did not like it (Count 4). The appellant then took his own clothes off and demanded that the complainant suck his penis and “pull him off”. 
     
      
    14 The complainant placed his mouth over the appellant’s penis for a second only. The penis was on the outside of his mouth only, with the outside of his lips touching it (Count 5). Although in chief, the complainant said that this occurred after they returned from the bakery, in cross examination he appears to have said that this event preceded the bakery trip, and before the occasion of ejaculation. It was not however explained whether there were separate incidents of this kind, nor did the appellant make any mention of such an event occurring consensually. 
     
      
    15 The complainant and the appellant eventually went to bed. The appellant started hugging and touching him, and playing with his anus with his finger. He then said, “Let me put it in”, to which the complainant said “No”. At that time he could feel the appellant’s erect penis rubbing against the back of his legs (Count 6). The complainant moved towards the end or side of the bed, at which point the appellant went to sleep. At this time the complainant said that he was thinking of killing himself, and of getting up and running away.  
     
      
    16 The complainant left the bed about an hour later and had a shower. When he came back the appellant was awake and lying in bed. The appellant rang his girlfriend to ask her to pick him up. At about 9.00 am Scott Nicholls, one of the complainant’s friends, arrived, bringing with him a loaf of bread and a cake. Soon after the appellant left with his girlfriend, but not before saying that he was going to come back. 
     
      
    17 The complainant then left the house with Mr Nicholls and went to the house of a friend, Steven Raymund. Thereafter he went to the library “to do some thinking”.  
     
      
    18 After leaving the library the complainant went to Veritas House, a refuge, and spoke to Rob McCallery. He asked if he could ring his mother to see if he could get out of Bathurst. 
     
      
    19 He spoke by phone to his mother who asked him why he wanted to leave town. He replied that “something bad” had happened, that he could not say what it was, and that he was scared. Later in that phone call he described to her what had happened. She agreed that he should go to her home for a while. She then spoke to Mr McCallery. When the call was finished, Mr McCallery spoke to the complainant and asked whether he was willing to go to the police about this, to which the complainant replied in the affirmative. He and Mr McCallery wrote a statement in Mr McCallery’s office (Exhibit A). Mr McCallery then made arrangements to purchase a ticket for the complainant so that he could go to his mother’s home. At 7.55 pm he left Bathurst. 
     
      
    20 The complainant’s mother, who lived in Grenfell, gave evidence in which she described receiving a phone call from him. She did not remember the exact date. She recalled him telling her that he wanted to come home but did not want to tell her the reason. She said that he could not come home unless he told her what was going on. He said that he did not want to tell anyone.  
     
      
    21 Later in that call he said that he had not wanted to tell her because she would think that he was gay. He went on to say that a fellow had come around to his flat the night before, that they were drinking and smoking pot, and that this fellow had made advances to him, which he had resisted. The fellow had threatened to hurt him if he did not do what he wanted, so he complied. He disclosed that this fellow had made the complainant suck him. She asked him where he was ringing from because he sounded frightened. He replied that he was ringing from the refuge. She asked whether there was anyone there and he offered Rob McCallery’s name. She then spoke with Mr McCallery and a bus ticket was organised for the complainant to come home that evening.  
     
      
    22 Scott Anthony Nicholls gave evidence that at about 9.00 am on the Friday he had attended at the complainant’s home, taking a loaf of bread for him. The complainant was on the veranda and seemed to be very stressed, although not giving any appearance of being stoned or affected by alcohol.  
     
      
    23 Nicholls said that he had known him for a few years and had never seen him like that before.  
     
      
    24 He went into the house and saw the appellant lying on a bed under a blanket, without a shirt. About 10 minutes later he saw the appellant had dressed and seemed ready to leave the premises. He left at the same time as the complainant and Nicholls. As he was leaving Nicholls saw a pile of tissues on the lounge. Nicholls stayed with the complainant for approximately an hour.  
     
      
    25 In cross examination Nicholls agreed that he knew the appellant, and had stayed with him earlier that year before being asked to leave because of “his conduct”.  
     
      
    26 Robert John McCallery gave evidence that he was a youth worker and manager at Veritas House. At about 2.00-3.00 pm on Friday the complainant had arrived at the office appearing agitated and fearful. He indicated that he wanted to get out of town for a number of weeks. When Mr McCallery asked him what the problem was he replied that it was a secret, that he was fearful, and that if he said anything he would get bashed. The complainant said that he wanted to go to his mother’s home, and Mr McCallery said that he would need to phone her to organise that. Mr McCallery left the office while the complainant made a phone call to his mother. A short time later, when he returned to the room, the complainant indicated that this mother wished to talk to him.  
     
      
    27 After doing so, Mr McCallery then had a further conversation with the complainant, in the course of which the complainant said that he wanted to leave town because he was fearful. Mr McCallery said to him, “Your mother has indicated that you were sexually assaulted and that you were forced to give a head job to some male, 27 years of age”. He replied “That’s right” and added that it was the appellant who had assaulted him. He said that he was scared and worried about getting bashed and he just wanted to get out of town.  
     
      
    28 Mr McCallery asked the complainant if he would be willing to tell him what had happened, and he would write it all down. They went into another office and sat down. Mr McCallery asked him to tell him what happened, slowly, so that he could record it. The only thing which Mr McCallery said during this exercise was “can you slow down a little”, and “what happened next?” He acknowledged that he had given the complainant every opportunity to say all that he wanted to say, and that he recorded all that he had said in the document which became Exhibit A.  
     
      
    29 That document consists of a four page handwritten document in which the complainant outlined the allegations and the telephone call to his mother. The document was signed by the complainant and by Mr McCallery.  
     
      
    30 Mr McCallery made arrangements for a railway ticket to be issued, for the complainant to return to his mother’s home. Some time later he went with the complainant to his flat. He was shown some tissues sitting on top of a rubbish bin in the kitchen. He was not sure whether they were tissues or toilet paper, but whatever it was appeared to be crumpled up and to have been used on something. They obtained some clothing from the flat and then left. Mr McCallery asked the complainant whether he would report the matter to police and he replied in the affirmative.  
     
      
    31 Mr McCallery went to the Police Station where he made a verbal report to a Constable who made some notes. A couple of days later, when he spoke to the complainant on the telephone, the latter indicated that he wanted to pursue the matter. Mr McCallery asked for, and obtained, his permission to take the statement (Exhibit A) to the police station. 
     
      
    32 Detective Senior Constable Terrence James Cosgrove gave evidence that on Tuesday 30 October 2001 he attended Veritas House and spoke to Mr McCallery, who handed to him the original handwritten notes which he had made, as dictated by the complainant. On 12 November he obtained statements from the complainant and from Mr McCallery. 
     
      
    33 There was no inspection made of the premises at Rankin Street, as the matter was reported 2 weeks later and the premises had been cleaned. The appellant was however charged on 15 February 2002. 
     
      
    34 The appellant gave evidence in the trial and was cross-examined. He said that, at roughly 2.00 am or 2.30 am on 26 October 2001, he had gone to the flat of the complainant. 
     
      
    35 Prior to doing so, he said, he had been having a drink at the home of his cousin Peter Cole in Rocket Street. He had been drinking Kentucky Gold Bourbon and Cougar Bourbon. With two other men he drank a bottle of Cougar Bourbon between 6.00 pm on 25 October and 1.30 am to 2.00 am on the following morning. He walked down Rankin Street, on his account, to “say g’day” to the complainant and to have a drink. He had with him a 2 litre bottle of Coke mixed with bourbon, that he had mixed together whilst still at his cousin’s house, and some White Ox tobacco.  
     
      
    36 He was staying at the Vic Hotel in Bathurst, which was opposite the station and was some distance away.  
     
      
    37 He denied having any marijuana, or going to Rankin Street to have sexual activity with the complainant. He also denied that he had wanted to get the complainant drunk or stoned so that he could have his way with him. 
     
      
    38 He had been to the complainant’s flat before, knew that he lived on his own, and that there was only one way out of the terrace, which was the front door. 
     
      
    39 When he was outside the flat he noticed through the glass of the front door that the TV was on. Because of this he knocked on the front door. He had a mobile phone at the time, but had not used it to ring to warn the complainant.  
     
      
    40 When he knocked on the door the complainant answered and invited him in. The complainant asked him if he had a smoke, and he gave him a smoke of White Ox tobacco. He asked the complainant for a couple of cups. He sat on the lounge. The complainant returned with the cups and sat down on the floor beside the lounge room table. They had a drink, and over the night 4 cups of bourbon and coke or thereabouts were consumed, while they conversed. The complainant smoked some cones, but the appellant did not know how many. 
     
      
    41 He denied that he assaulted the complainant, but said that there was mutual masturbation between them, which occurred before they went to the bakery. 
     
      
    42 In that respect he gave evidence that the complainant, who had been staring at him, crawled across the floor to the lounge on which he was lying. While they were talking, he touched the complainant on the outside of his clothing, in the area of his penis. He asked the complainant if he liked that. According to him, the complainant replied in the affirmative and said that his brother used to do it to him. 
     
      
    43 They each stood up and undressed, and masturbated each other while standing. 
     
      
    44 The appellant then lay down on the floor and masturbated himself, while the complainant stood over the top of him, masturbating himself. The appellant ejaculated onto his stomach. 
     
      
    45 He said that the complainant jumped up, put on his shorts and went out the back to get some toilet paper. He came back and gave the toilet paper to the appellant, who cleaned himself up. He then dressed. The complainant had already dressed and had moved into the kitchen. The appellant went to the toilet, out the back door. When he returned he suggested that they go and get some pies. 
     
      
    46 The appellant said that he borrowed a jumper from the complainant. After he put it on, they left to get the pies.  
     
      
    47 At approximately 5.00 am he said they went out on to Rankin Street, cut through the RSL car park, and came out next to the pie shop in George Street, between Russell and Howick Streets. He said that they walked past the police station, on the other side of the road. Once at that pie shop, they purchased a couple of pies and some drinks. They then returned to the complainant’s flat, eating the pies and drinking the drinks on the way home. 
     
      
    48 The appellant agreed that there had been a conversation with the complainant on the way back from the pie shop, in the course of which he had asked him what he was going to do that day. The complainant had replied that he was going to the refuge. He denied saying that the complainant was going to “dog” him, or that he would “hospitalise” him. He denied that the complainant had asked him not to hurt him. He also denied that he had assaulted the complainant when they returned from the bakery. 
     
      
    49 He agreed that the complainant had made a cup of tea for both of them, but said that he had done this in the lounge room because it was cold. He denied saying “Make me a cup of tea and I might not flog you”. According to him, the complainant had then offered to go to bed. As he was tired, he went to bed. He denied however that he had gone to bed to have sex with the complainant. Each undressed in the lounge room. He had followed the complainant to bed and had “crashed out” in the same room as him. 
     
      
    50 At approximately 9.00 am he said that he had woken up and found that the complainant was not in the bed. He remained there for a minute and then got dressed and rolled a smoke. The complainant came out of the shower drying his hair. The appellant used the house phone to phone his ex wife, to pick him up. He then walked outside with the complainant, but felt bad, so he went back to lie down on the bed. 
     
      
    51 He said that when Mr Nicholls arrived he was lying on top of the bed, fully clothed. His ex wife arrived soon after, so he got up and said goodbye to the complainant, and to Nicholls, and left.  
     
      
    52 The Crown relied on the alleged act of the appellant in forcing the complainant’s hand onto his penis, and making him masturbate him, in forcing the complainant to masturbate him, and in placing his own hand onto the complainant’s penis and attempting to masturbate him, each occurring towards the beginning of the encounter, as the indecent assaults giving rise to counts 1 to 3. 
     
      
    53 Count 4 related to the alleged repetition of an attempt by the appellant to masturbate the complainant, while the remaining act of indecent assault (Count 6) related to the appellant’s alleged act of rubbing his finger against the complainant’s anus, while placing his erect penis on the legs of the complainant.  
     
      
    54 Count 5 related to the alleged attempt by the appellant to force the complainant to commit fellatio upon him.  
     
      
    55 The appellant appeals against the convictions but not against sentence.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – The trial judge erred in the directions to the jury in relation to the way in which they should apply the standard of proof.  
       
      
    56 The appellant accepted that his Honour correctly directed the jury that the onus was on the Crown to prove each of the allegations beyond reasonable doubt. However, it was submitted that the directions given, as to how they should assess whether the Crown had done so, were erroneous. In this regard attention was drawn to the following passages in the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, you have a fact finding exercise. You have been presented with a body of evidentiary material and you were asked to make decisions about the evidentiary material. The decisions that you make about the evidentiary material will lead, almost as night follows day, to your verdict in the trial.” 
        
       
       
      And: 
       
       
        
        “You are asked to determine whether what the complainant has said or what the Accused has said should be  
        accepted 
        . Of course, a criminal trial is not the mere weighing up of one version of events against another version of events but, in order to determine the facts within the totality of evidentiary material, there must be a comparison of one version of the events against the other version of the events. There must be the comparison between the people giving the versions of events… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, if it should be that, when you compare the versions and you compare the givers of the versions, if it should be that you prefer the versions given by the Crown’s witnesses, then you must ask yourselves this question, ‘Does  
        the evidence that we accept 
         satisfy us beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused?’ And the reason that you must ask yourselves that question is, as you know, you cannot find the accused to be guilty unless the  
        evidence that you accept 
         satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt. It might be, members of the jury, and only you can decide, that, even if you accept the version given by the Crown witnesses, that version itself might not satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt. Of course, if it is, at the end of your deliberations, that you prefer the version given by the Crown’s witnesses and that version satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt, then you will find the accused to be guilty.” 
        
       
      
    57 Later, his Honour said, in relation to the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        “You assess him and his evidence in the same way as, for example, you assess the complainant and his evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        And I repeat, members of the jury, I know that I am repeating myself, if, when you consider all of the evidentiary material, you decide that you prefer the evidence given by the Crown’s witnesses, you must ask yourself that question, ‘ 
        does the evidence that we accept 
         satisfy us beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused?’ And you must ask that question because you cannot find the accused to be guilty  
        unless the evidence that you accept 
         satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt.” (The emphasis is added). 
        
       
      
    58 It was submitted that the standard of proof was undermined by an implicit suggestion that, if they preferred the version of the complainant over that of the appellant, they should then determine whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, without regard to the appellant’s evidence. 
     
      
    59 It was necessary, so it was submitted, for the trial judge to instruct the jury that even if they did not positively believe the evidence for the appellant, they were not entitled to find against him on any issue, if his evidence gave rise to a reasonable doubt on that issue – see Liberato v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 507 per Brennan J at 515, and Deane J at 519-520.  
     
      
    60 No complaint was made at the trial in relation to this direction, and leave is required to argue it.  
     
      
    61 I am not persuaded that there is any merit in this ground, or that the dissenting judgments of Brennan and Deane JJ in Liberato v The Queen  compel the giving of a direction in the terms formulated by the appellant. What Brennan J said in Liberato was in fact not altogether dissimilar from the direction given in this case, so far as his Honour observed (at 515): 
     
      
       
        
        “When a case turns on a conflict between the evidence of a prosecution witness and the evidence of a defence witness, it is commonplace for a judge to invite a jury to consider the question: who is to be believed? But it is essential to ensure, by suitable direction, that the answer to that question (which the jury would doubtless ask themselves in any event) if adverse to the defence, is not taken as concluding the issue whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the issues which it bears the onus of proving. The jury must be told that, even if they prefer the evidence for the prosecution, they should not convict unless they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of that evidence. The jury must be told that, even if they do not positively believe the evidence for the defence, they cannot find an issue against the accused contrary to that evidence if that evidence gives rise to a reasonable doubt as to that issue.” 
        
       
      
    62 The present case was one where the jury had been given repeated directions concerning both the onus and the standard of proof. Additionally his Honour stressed that the issues were to be decided on the “evidentiary material”, which was identified with some precision, including the evidence of the appellant. 
     
      
    63 There is no rigid formula to which judges must adhere when dealing with the inevitable and obvious clash between a complainant and accused in a case involving an alleged sexual assault. Indeed, as Deane J also observed in Liberato v The Queen: 
     
      
       
        
        “Provided they are accompanied by clear and unequivocal directions, about the criminal onus and standard of proof, express [or] implied references in the summing up to a ‘choice’ between particular witnesses are no doubt unavoidable and commonly unobjectionable.”  
        
       
      
    64 I am satisfied that a proper balance was maintained, and that the jury were adequately directed in a way that meant that they would not have fallen into the error of approaching their task as one involving a simple choice between the versions given by the complainant and appellant. The clear direction that the evidence which they accepted left them satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt, necessarily carried with it the message that if the complainant’s evidence gave rise to a reasonable doubt, they must acquit. 
     
      
    65 Moreover, I am not persuaded that there was a risk of the jury understanding the directions as requiring the two step approach suggested – that is, of deciding whether they preferred the version given by the complainant to that of the appellant; and then determining whether the complainant’s version, standing alone and without reference to that given by the appellant, satisfied the requisite standard of proof. To so read the relevant passages in the summing up would, in my view, require a degree of sophistry, since an initial acceptance of the complainant’s evidence inevitably meant that the jury had considered the appellant’s evidence, and disbelieved it. The line of reasoning now suggested by the appellant involves what I would regard as requiring an exceedingly literal and artificial approach, and contrary to the general tenor of the summing up.  
     
      
    66 I would refuse leave to argue this ground.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - 
       
      
    67 There were two issues presented in the trial, namely whether the acts of mutual masturbation, which were the subject of Counts 1 to 3, had been consensual, and secondly whether the second series of acts occurred at all.  
     
      
    68 The Prosecution case depended upon the word of the complainant, supplemented by the evidence of his prompt complaint and distress, and the evidence of Mr Nicholls as to the state of undress of the appellant when he saw him in the bedroom. The evidence in those first two respects was capable of supporting the complainant’s version, although it depended, for its force, upon his veracity, and upon the genuineness of, and reason for, any distress which he displayed. The evidence of Mr Nicholls otherwise was independent, and the case was not one where the prosecution case depended solely upon the evidence of the complainant. 
     
      
    69 It was submitted however, that the trial judge should have given a direction of the kind which was discussed by Lee J in R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19, following the enactment of s 450C of the Crimes Act, which had abolished the requirement of a warning in relation to corroboration for prescribed sexual offences: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact that a judge does not comment upon the absence of corroboration of the complainant’s evidence cannot, in my view, in the case of those offences to which s 405C applies now be made the basis of a criticism of his summing-up, but again this does not mean that the judge cannot or should not, as is done in all cases of serious crime, stress upon the jury the necessity for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the witness who stands alone as proof of the Crown case. In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness’ evidence is unreliable. 
        
       
       
        
        There will be cases where the failure to bring home to the jury the position of the uncorroborated witness will undoubtedly lead to the verdict being set aside…” 
        
       
       
      
    70 No request for a Murray direction was made, although that does not necessarily foreclose the issue, since a trial judge is under a duty to give such directions as the case properly requires: BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275 per Gaudron J at 302, McHugh J at 306 and Kirby J at 330.  
     
      
    71 Where an appropriate direction was not given or sought at trial, the question for an appellate Court, in deciding whether to grant leave, will be whether or not the omission resulted in a risk of miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    72 While it is obviously desirable, and also common practice, for a Murray direction to be given in cases of sexual assault, where there is a conflict between the evidence of the complainant and the accused, the authorities do not mandate the giving of such a warning. The need for it, and the nature of any warning, depend upon the circumstances of the case: R v Connors [2000] NSWCCA 470. 
     
      
    73 The clear tenor of the instructions given in this case was to the effect that the jury must carefully evaluate the evidence of the complainant. In that regard attention was drawn not only to the matters of complaint and distress which tended to provide support. Additionally, his Honour drew attention to the appellant’s evidence and to the inconsistencies which existed between the accounts which the complainant had given to Mr McCallery, and to Police, and his evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    74 While it may have been desirable, for his Honour to have given a Murray direction, there can be little doubt that the jury were made aware of the need for them to examine the complainant’s evidence with great care.  
     
      
    75 I would refuse leave to raise this ground.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury in relation to the indecent assault counts, that they must be satisfied that the complainant was not consenting to the physical contact, and that the appellant knew that to be the case or was at least reckless as to whether that was so.  
       
      
    76 It was submitted that the directions given to the jury were insufficient in so far as his Honour did not adequately deal with the element of consent. Clearly the lack of consent and knowledge thereof, or recklessness in relation thereto, were essential elements in the proof of the relevant counts, as was confirmed in decisions of this Court in R v Bonora (1994) 35 NSWLR 74 per Finlay J (at 75) and Abadee J (at 80); Fitzgerald v Kennard (1995) 38 NSWLR 184; and see also R v Kuckailis [2001] NSWCCA 333 (at para 18).  
     
      
    77 In summarising the necessary elements of the indecent assault counts his Honour gave an appropriate direction in relation to what constituted an act of indecency, and then gave the following direction as to what was meant by an “assault” in the context of a charge of indecent “assault”: 
     
      
       
        
        “And I should tell you that indecent assault does not require necessarily the use of force. It is strange that lawyers use the word assault in relation to indecent assault because assault conjures up the idea of the use of physical force by one person on another. That is not required in relation to indecent assault although,  
        in this case, the Crown alleges 
        , in relation to the first and second counts of the indictment, that  
        there was force 
         in the sense of enforcement or the use of power by the Accused upon the complainant  
        to get the complainant to do something to the Accused 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to [the first] three counts of the indictment the Accused’s case is that it was one episode of consensual mutual masturbation. So, there is the difference, if I may use that word, between what the Crown alleges occurred and what the accused says occurred. The accused is not denying that he – I know the word “initiated” was used in evidence and whether that’s an appropriate word or not only you can determine – but the Accused agrees that he did something towards the complainant which resulted in other things occurring. The Accused denies that it was done with any force. The Accused says that it was not done contrary to the wishes of the complainant. In all sexual relationships between people there has got to be somebody that starts the sexual activity, whether it’s consensual or otherwise. Here, learned counsel for the Accused has put to you that the evidence shows that what occurred was consensual, mutual masturbation. That’s not what the Crown puts to you occurred.” (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    78 After repeating what was in issue in relation to the first three counts, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, members of the jury, as learned Crown counsel said to you before the trial started in his opening statement, if  
        somebody uses force to obtain another person to do something and that other person does the something then that act was not done with consent, because the use of force vitiates consent 
        . So that, if, as the Crown alleges, the Accused  
        forced 
         the complainant to do the sexual act and the complainant did the sexual act  
        because he felt that he was under force 
         to do so, then that cannot amount in law to consent.” (Emphasis added).  
        
       
      
    79 There can be little doubt that the jury understood that the primary issue concerning those counts was whether the complainant had been “forced” by the appellant to carry out or to submit to the acts alleged.  
     
      
    80 There still remained a secondary issue concerning whether or not the appellant had known that the complainant had not been consenting, or had been reckless as to whether he had consented. That question however would inevitably have been answered unfavourably to him as a result of the finding as to lack of consent, since it was the Prosecution case that threats or force had been applied, in order to procure the complainant's co operation. Unless the complainant had been believed by the jury in relation to the existence of those threats they would have returned verdicts of not guilty. 81 These observations were made in relation to the first three counts, which concerned the events occurring before the trip to the bakery. 
     
      
    82 When his Honour proceeded to deal with the post bakery allegations which gave rise to counts of 5 and 6, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown says three further acts of sexual misconduct occurred after they returned home from the pie shop. The Accused's case, as I understand his evidence and his counsel's submissions, is that none of those acts of sexual misconduct occurred. So, this is not a case now of considering whether there was consent to the other acts of sexual conduct because the Accused’s case is that these acts of sexual conduct never occurred. So, members of the jury, the issue is whether those acts of sexual conduct occurred - and the Accused's case is that they did not occurred - if you're  
        satisfied that they didn't occur, then consent does not enter into the picture 
        ."" (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    83 This final observation was erroneous if read strictly, although not necessarily so, if understood in the context of the way that the case was conducted. Satisfaction by the jury of the commission of the acts alleged was but one of the essential elements. They still needed to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that the complainant had not consented to them or had been reckless in that regard. However, once again the answer to that question was inevitable, in the context of the way that the trial was fought, in the event of the jury accepting the complainant's version of having been “forced”, following threats by the appellant, to submit to these further demands.84 That is reinforced by the emphasis, which was given by his Honour in the following passage, to the circumstance that it was the Crown case throughout that the complainant's co operation had been secured by ""force"". In this regard, his Honour said relevantly for these further counts: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now, members of the jury, the Crown's case in relation to the other acts are these - that after returning from the pie shop the Accused  
        forced 
         his hands on the complainant's penis and attempted to masturbate him, the Accused  
        forced 
         the complainant to put his lips against the complainant's penis in an attempt to get the complainant to suck his penis and the Accused rubbed one of his fingers against the anus of the complainant. So, they are the three acts that the Crown says occurred after the return from the pie shop. These are the acts that the Accused denied ever having taken place."" (Emphasis added).  
        
       
      
    85 It was submitted, on appeal, that the question of the appellant’s awareness of the lack of consent, or recklessness in relation thereto, was important in this case, because of the consumption by the appellant of alcohol and by the complainant of alcohol and cannabis. This does not, however, appear to have been a matter addressed in the summing up, nor to have been a matter, given the silence of defence counsel, that was pressed on behalf of the appellant. There were no doubt good tactical reasons for that not to have been at the forefront of the defence case. 86 This again was a situation in which the trial counsel saw no fault in the directions given, and leave is required for the ground to be raised.87 In R v Chai [2002] 76 ALJR 628, the High Court held (at para 18) that, while it is not necessary for a trial judge to direct the jury as to ""principles of law going beyond those which the jurors need to understand to resolve the issues that arrive for decision"" it was necessary for the trial judge to: 
     
      
       
        
        ""explain to the jurors so much of the law as they needed to know in order to decide the issues that arose from the charges, the evidence, the case for the prosecution and the defence case."" 
        
       
      
    88 Clearly that is correct. However, a summing up always needs to be understood in the context of the trial, and by particular reference to the manner in which issues are raised and contested. As Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Toohey JJ said in Holland v The Queen (1993) 117 ALR 193, at 200: 
     
      
       
        
        “A failure by a trial judge fully to direct the jury about all the elements of an offence does not automatically mean that, in the event of a conviction, there has been a miscarriage of justice. To determine whether there has been a miscarriage, regard must be had to all the circumstances of the case, including the conduct of the trial.” 
        
       
       
       See also,  
      BRS v The Queen  
       per Kirby J at 330.  
       
       
        
          
        
       
      
    89 An appeal is not to be approached as a microscopic examination of everything which was said by a trial judge in an attempt to find a technical omission or error. This Court recently had occasion, in R v ITA  [2003] NSWCCA 174 to give consideration to Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the judge presiding at the trial, shall, without leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal in an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal"". 
        
       
      
    90 Ipp JA with whom Buddin and Shaw JJ agreed, cited with approval a consistent line of approach to Rule 4, in passages (Paras 93 to 98) which bear repetition in toto: 
     
      
       
        
        ""93. In  
        R v DH 
        , Stein JA observed [at 115]:  
         
          
          'Again, rule 4 applies because no point was taken at trial. In  
          Jeffrey 
           (Unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 16 December 1993), Mahoney JA made some pertinent observations about the role of rule 4 where an appellant relies on misdirections or non-directions to which no objection was taken at trial. They bear repeating. His Honour said: 
           
            
            '[It] is proper to emphasise the importance of the principle embodied in r 4. 
             
              
             
            In my opinion this principle plays an important part in the criminal trial process. It is important that any objection to the summing up or that any defect or omission at the trial which can be cured or mitigated by steps taken at the trial, be raised at the time of the trial. The judge should be asked to, and should have the opportunity to, correct any error or deficiency of this kind. 
             
              
              ... 
               
              
             
            Errors will occur and r 4 provides for them. But unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and  
            unless the possibility of real injustice 
             appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level. But infrequently, this Court is asked to act under r 4 when the reason why the defect was not dealt with at the trial has not been established and where it is at least possible that there were tactical reasons why it was not. It is not easy for the Court of Appeal to satisfy itself that the reason why the matter was not raised was error rather than choice. In such circumstances, the court should be slow to act under r 4 ...’”.

        Fuge 
         (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Heydon JA and Sully J agreed) said at 319:  
         
          
           
          “It is timely for this Court to repeat the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in  
          Abusafiah 
           (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 and of Gleeson CJ in  
          Sanderson 
           (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 18 July 1994), in relation to the positive obligation which rests upon trial counsel to assist the court in the conduct of a trial, and in relation to the need to give meaning to r 4, whose validity was confirmed in  
          Esposito 
           (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 23 July 1990). 
           
           
          In  
          Abusafiah 
          , Hunt CJ at CL said (at 536; 429-430): 
           
            
            'The requirements of r 4 of the  
            Criminal Appeal Rules 
             do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside. One purpose of the requirement that no misdirection or non-direction may, without leave, be allowed as a ground of appeal unless objection was taken at the trial is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which he or she is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury. If a summing-up contains some error which could easily have been cured once the judge's attention had been drawn it, and if counsel for the accused to whose detriment the error operates fails to comply with his or her duty to draw the judge's attention to that error ... , any suggestion that such detriment automatically entitles the accused to a new trial does not strike a sympathetic cord (sic) in the hearts of those who see the right to a fair trial as operating in favour not only of the accused but also of the Crown, which prosecutes on behalf of the whole community. The  
            Criminal Appeal Act  
            1912 (NSW) does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted under one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which he could and should have raised at the first trial. There are, of course, cases in which the error made is of such a nature that, notwithstanding the failure of counsel for the accused to comply with a duty leave will be granted to avoid a miscarriage of justice.' 
            
           
           
          The caution given by Gleeson CJ in  
          Sanderson 
           was to the following effect: 
           
            
            'This case provides a striking and clear illustration of the reason for the presence in the  
            Criminal Appeal Rules 
             of r 4. If trial counsel had apprehended that there was any significant risk that the jury might have misunderstood the true nature of their function in relation to this matter of corroboration then the point was available to be taken by trial counsel. If the point had been taken, and if there really had been a problem, it was a problem that was capable of simple correction. It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.'"" 
            
           
          
         
         
        Wood CJ at CL went on to refer to a number of other authorities where similar sentiments had been expressed.  
         
         
        95. The approach which his Honour indicated should be taken to r 4 accords with that adopted by McHugh J in  
        Papakosmas v R  
        (1999) 196 CLR 297 where his Honour said at 319:  
         
         
          
          ""There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made  
          an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice 
          . Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant"". 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        96. See also  
        R v Roberts 
         (2001) 53 NSWLR 138 where Carruthers AJ said at 150-151:  
         
          
           
          ""It is now more than ever imperative that trial counsel recognise and discharge the responsibility which they owe to the trial judge to provide whatever assistance he or she may require in order, so far as possible, to ensure that the directions to the jury are such that it can be said the accused has had a trial according to law. 
           
           
          For years this Court has emphasised in the strongest possible terms the need for trial counsel to take objections to the summing up or the admissibility of the evidence at the trial itself so that, if they are of substance, the judge may correct them and thus avoid appeals to this Court and possible second and sometimes third trials"". 
          
         
         
        These views were reiterated in  
        R v Hokafonu 
         [2002] NSWCCA 92, in  
        R v 
          
        Pearson 
         [2002] NSWCCA 429 and in  
        Giri  
        at 588 to 589.  
        
       
       
        
        97. It is disturbing that so often no account is taken of the clear warnings that have been given by this Court. It is not unusual for appellants, without making any application for leave under r 4, to proceed blithely to argue grounds that should have been raised by counsel at trial but were not. There is usually, as in this case, no explanation whatever for the omission to raise the perceived difficulties with the trial judge.  
        
       
       
        
        98. The existence of r 4 and s 99 [ 
        Criminal Procedure Act]  
        imposes a duty on counsel to inform the trial judge of all points that arise from the summing up that reasonably could give rise to an appeal. It will not lightly be assumed that this duty has been breached. Rather, unless there is good reason to hold the contrary, it will be inferred that decisions not to raise such matters with the trial judge are taken for sound forensic reasons. No more need be said than to repeat and emphasise the remarks of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v 
          
        Sanderson 
         (unreported, NSWCCA 18 July 1994) that:  
         
          
           
          ‘It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances, to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred’.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    91 Reference may also be made, in this context, to R v PAH, NSWCCA 10 September 1998, Saffron v The Queen (1988) 17 NSWLR 395 and R v Button (2002) 54 NSWLR 455, each of which confirm a consistent line of authority to the effect that leave should not be given to challenge a conviction, by reference to the failure of a trial judge to give a direction, which was not sought at trial, unless that failure has caused a miscarriage of justice, the proof of which lies on the appellant.  
     
      
    92 As in the case of R v ITA, the appellant was here represented by competent counsel, and the transcript demonstrates that the defence was conducted in a professional and thorough way. No explanation has been given for the omission to seek the directions, which it is now submitted should have been given, either in relation to this ground or the three other grounds of appeal.93 The only inference open is that, in the light of the complainant’s evidence concerning the threats made, his stated resistance and the forced manipulation of his hand or person, and of the issues presented for trial, the outcome would have been no different had the additional directions sought been given. In those circumstances I am not persuaded that the omission to give the directions complained of, concerning awareness of lack of consent or recklessness in relation thereto, although desirable, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. 94 I would refuse leave to argue this ground. 
     
      
      Ground 4 - A miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge, in relation to the count of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, to instruct the jury that they must be satisfied that the complainant did not consent and that the appellant knew that the complainant did not consent, or was, at least reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting or not. 
      
    95 Precisely the same point arises in relation to Ground 3. Yet again no point was taken at trial, and for the same reasons as those given in relation to that ground, I would refuse leave to raise this ground.96 For those reasons I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    97 GREG JAMES J: I agree.  
     
      
    98 HOWIE J: I agree that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    99 WOOD CJ at CL: The appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN, CJ: I will ask Greg James, J. to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GREG JAMES, J: These are applications for leave to appeal against sentences in each case imposed upon the applicants by Levine, J. in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in consequence of pleas of guilty in each case to the crime of murder. 
     
      
    3 Similar sentences were imposed on each of the applicants by his Honour, those sentences providing for sentences of 16 years to date from 26 February 2000, the date upon which the applicants went into custody, to expire on 25 February 2016, and associated with each sentence were non-parole periods of 12 years imposed by his Honour, commencing upon that date and expiring 25 February 2012. 
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty provided by the Crimes Act 1900 for the crime to which each of the applicants pleaded guilty was imprisonment for life.  
     
      
    5 His Honour, in his remarks on sentence, referred to the circumstances of the commission of the crime for which each of the applicants came forward. I summarise what his Honour said in this regard. 
     
      
    6 At about 3.00 am on the morning of 26 February 2000, the deceased, a taxi driver, had been hailed at Dulwich Hill by four young men, two of whom were the two applicants. They had been to a 21st birthday party. They were all highly intoxicated. They had decided that they would not pay the taxi driver, but would run away. 
     
      
    7 The cab being stopped at a street in Granville, the offenders alighted from the cab. The driver also alighted. Thereafter there was a physical altercation, during which the driver challenged the applicant Ratu with a punch and was thereupon set upon by both of the applicants, who kicked and punched him. 
     
      
    8 There was material before the trial judge showing the extent and the severity of this episode of kicking and punching, and in Mr. Ratu’s second electronically recorded interview a description of the actions that he used. The trial judge concluded that the acts of kicking and punching continued over a period of at least 10 minutes, during which period the deceased became helpless on the road. The deceased died some 12 hours later from the combined effects of the kicking and punching, and also of a stabbing. As to that latter, the trial judge said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is unquestionably the case that Mr. Singh Suri was stabbed. It is equally unquestionably the case that the Crown has no case against these offenders in relation to that stabbing. Both denied it. The stabbing is, therefore, a factor which is set to one side completely.” 
        
       
      
    9 It is apparent that the trial judge in his consideration of what course should be taken set aside the stabbing as he had said, and we too, after examination today, of such medical material as there was before the trial judge, should treat the matter as the trial judge did in respect of each applicant. That is to say, by putting aside the stabbing and having regard to the trial judge’s findings that this, in each case, was a case of a kicking or punching, accompanied by no intent to kill, but an intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    10 The trial judge found in the applicants’ favour there was no intention to rob. He found that they were drunk. He held, and there could be no quarrel with this finding, that the deceased died as a result of a drunken, cowardly, vicious physical attack, which exploded suddenly when he sought to prevent fare evasion. His Honour referred to the human tragedy and to the gravity of the crime, and the necessity the courts have emphasised in case after case that assaults on taxi drivers will not be tolerated by the courts. 
     
      
    11 He expressed his view of the offence that it was a homicide of a taxi driver in an explosion of drunken violence, as involving conduct which requires punishment; punishment which requires due weight to be given to general deterrence. 
     
      
    12 His Honour referred to the subjective circumstances of the two applicants. In the case of the applicant Ratu, he was 18 at the time of the offence, with no relevant antecedents, stable family background, but had apparently embarked upon drinking and drug taking without realisation, his Honour found, of the perils that presented for his future. His Honour gave weight to the applicant’s plea of guilty as having been made at the earliest possible opportunity. 
     
      
    13 The Crown case rested upon admissions made by him. The trial judge reached the view those circumstances should be taken into account when considering the discount for the early plea. He found too, evidence of remorse and contrition in a most genuine sense. He was of the view that an appropriate discount in the circumstances for the plea of guilty was a discount in the order of 25%. He found the applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation to be good, and he found that the applicant had, whilst young, a self-awareness of his wrongdoing and had continued to evince remorse and contrition whilst in custody. 
     
      
    14 Of the applicant Holmes his Honour noted that he was 21 years of age, coming from a stable family and community background, and whilst he had some prior antecedents they were not such as needed to play any role in the disposition of the punishment for the crime. He was dangerously drunk, his Honour found, and although initially less than co-operative, when he, as with the other applicant, learned the truth of what had happened to Mr. Suri, became co-operative with the police. 
     
      
    15 His Honour made the same findings as to the timing of the plea of guilty in his case as he did with the applicant Ratu, and similarly found contrition and remorse. His Honour adverted to the application of the matters that he had found, to the need for personal deterrence, but reached a view that such a crime required a substantial element of general deterrence. 
     
      
    16 His Honour concluded, having regard to all considerations, in particular his observation that he should not draw a distinction between the offenders, and that it was not a case that called for the throwing away of the key, nor for undue emphasis on considerations personal to the offenders, that an appropriate sentence, recognising the gravity of the crime, required a head sentence in each case of 16 years, as I have said. 
     
      
    17 In relation to the question of the appropriate non-parole period, his Honour reflected upon submissions as to special circumstances, but in the end concluded that there were no special circumstances requiring any further extension of that parole period additional to the lengthy parole period that would by statute apply to the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    18 In the passage in his remarks on sentence dealing with this matter, there appears a reference to a lengthy “non-parole period”. In the submissions of senior counsel for the applicants it is accepted that that is a misprint or misstatement, such that his Honour must have been referring to the period during which the applicants might have the opportunity to be liberated on parole after the expiry of their non-parole period, and before the expiration of the head sentence. 
     
      
    19 On the appeal the submissions have been confined to the question of the appropriate non-parole period. Written submissions have been filed in respect of each applicant, each of those submissions have set out important aspects of each applicant’s circumstances to which the court’s attention has been drawn, which are matters which might have been considered by the trial judge as special circumstances. In each set of submissions it has been contended that the trial judge fell into error in having failed to identify special circumstances in the matters adverted to, and thus having erred in imposing the non-parole period that he did. 
     
      
    20 It has been submitted that a shorter non-parole period could have been imposed, notwithstanding the head sentence of 16 years, and that that non-parole period would be at or in excess of a non-parole period of some 10 years. 
     
      
    21 It is not necessary in my view to reiterate in this judgment the numerous matters referred to by Mr. Odgers, SC. in his written submissions, as being matters which are capable of amounting to special circumstances. As I understand the submissions put by the Crown, no issue is taken with those matters as being capable of constituting special circumstances in an appropriate case, either individually or in combination. 
     
      
    22 There are contended to be two grounds upon which it is asserted his Honour erred in principle in the way he dealt with the matters so capable of being found to be special circumstances. The first matter asserted is that it is contended that his Honour didn’t consider whether there should have been a shorter non-parole period, in that the principle he appears to have applied in the passage to which I have referred in the remarks on sentence seems to have required him to identify as special circumstances only such circumstances, the effect of which, would operate to lengthen the parole period, and to reject circumstances which would have had more direct impact upon producing a shorter non-parole period. 
     
      
    23 His Honour’s decision was reached on the day prior to this court providing guidance to sentencing judges by the decision of the court constituted by five judges in Regina v. Neil Andrew Simpson (2001) 126 A. Crim. R. 525, where detailed consideration was given to the concept of special circumstances, as that concept has been used in relation to the proportions, minimum terms and non-parole periods have borne to head sentences under various sentencing regimes, since the concept of a non-parole period was introduced into New South Wales law. 
     
      
    24 As it happened, Simpson (supra) concerned specifically the legislation as it stood at the time that his Honour was required to sentence the applicants. Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it then stood, is set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice, a judgment with whom the other justices of the court agreed, Sully, J. adding some remarks for himself. As s.44 stood at the time, it was incumbent upon a sentencing judge, firstly, to set the term of the sentence and then, secondly, to set a non-parole period for that sentence. That period is referred to by s.44(1)(b) as being the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence. 
     
      
    25 Section 44(2) provides that the non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence, unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less. It is those words “special circumstances” as there used, on which the applicants’ applications for leave to appeal in the present matters focus. 
     
      
    26 The second error asserted is that his Honour unreasonably failed to find as special circumstances the various matters to which I have made reference, which were matters which it was conceded his Honour took into account in fixing the head sentences, but apparently, so it is asserted, rejected as possibly amounting to special circumstances, either individually or in combination, when he turned to fixing the non-parole periods. 
     
      
    27 It is accepted that the head sentences could not be considered to be manifestly inadequate and beyond the range of a proper sentence in each case. It is accepted in the argument that the non-parole period on its face, so far exceeds a proper sentence that it too, should be characterised as manifestly excessive. The course taken, however, was that counsel referred us to a number of cases in which the same factors as were submitted were required to be considered here were found by other trial judges, or this court, to be special circumstances and to have had appropriate application such as to reduce the non-parole period/head sentence proportion, with a view to seeking to establish that his Honour’s views in relation to those factors were so far out of accord with other views, as to show error. 
     
      
    28 But it was conceded in the argument that the question of whether or not a matter or matters taken in combination did nor did not constitute special circumstances remains a matter for the discretionary judgment of the trial judge, and that there was no blanket rule the trial judge was compelled to follow. Nonetheless, it was asserted that in these two ways in these cases, his Honour fell into error, such that this court should interfere upon the basis referred to in s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that some other non-parole period warranted in law should have been passed. 
     
      
    29 All the relevant matters to which the court was referred in the cases cited seem to be found in the facts here, including: that these were the first times in custody; the youth of the applicants; their prospects of rehabilitation; the very extensive length of the sentences; the probable necessity for special attention whilst on parole; the lack of premeditation; the crimes having been committed whilst intoxicated and during a short burst of furious criminality not otherwise indicated by the applicants’ record, and are clearly capable of constituting special circumstances, and are clearly capable of being taken into account to shorten the non-parole period that might have been imposed. 
     
      
    30 Although there is nothing in Simpson (supra) suggesting to the contrary, there is nothing to suggest that it was incumbent on a sentencing judge to find such facts and to give them that effect.  
     
      
    31 I am not persuaded that although those facts were present, the trial judge fell into error by unreasonably failing to find that they were special circumstances, even in the context that other courts and other judges in other cases had. 
     
      
    32 I return to that passage to which I had earlier referred in the trial judge’s remarks on sentence. I do not, for myself, read that passage as an expression by the trial judge that he had adopted a principle which would require him to disregard those matters which are otherwise relevant, unless he concluded that they had to have, whether considered individually or in combination, the effect of requiring an extension to the parole period. 
     
      
    33 Another way of my putting this is to say that I don’t see that the trial judge failed to have regard to those matters as possibly warranting a reduction in the non-parole period. In Simpson (supra) there is reference in the judgment of the Chief Justice to the necessity to bear in mind that there is some artificiality involved in approaching the issue in two steps. At 539 his Honour referred to the point of making a finding of special circumstances:- 
     
      
       
        
        “... The only point in making a finding of ‘special circumstances’ is to make the ‘decision’ for which s.44 provides. By s.44(2) the non-parole period is not to be less than three-quarters of the head sentence ‘unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less’. This qualificatory clause requires a ‘decision’ by application of the composite requirement that the ‘circumstances’ be sufficiently ‘special’ for the statutory proportion to be reduced.” 
        
       
      
    34 His Honour went on to hold that the case law does not justify a restrictive approach to the scope of considerations relevant to the determination by the court of what constitutes special circumstances in a particular case. 
     
      
    35 He had regard, as I have said, to the purpose of the task of identifying special circumstances. He referred to the nature of the statutory guide or fetter which operates in only one direction. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a hurdle to be overcome if a lower proportion than that for which the statute provides is to be determined .... “ 
        
       
      
    36 That is a hurdle which may or may not be overcome in the judgment in the exercise of discretion of an individual sentencing judge. There is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself in some way appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence. It would be an error to consider that the same factors affect both non-parole period and head sentence, without there being any variation in the effect of those factors on each, but it is to allow for that variation that special circumstances were provided as an exception to the statutory proportion. 
     
      
    37 In the event that there is an application for leave to appeal on such a ground as a trial judge falling into error in the exercise of a discretionary judgment in identifying and evaluating that what is said to amount to special circumstances, it is necessary to see, as the Chief Judge put it, at page 540 in Simpson (supra), whether the challenge is on the basis of legal error, including in terms of quantum alone, that it was manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate. This will, as the Chief Justice pointed out, often be the primary issue. 
     
      
    38 He referred to the disputation that has occurred as often confusing matters of fact and matters of judgment with propositions of law. He referred to the nature of the decision for the trial judge. The decision is first one of fact to identify the circumstances and secondly, one of judgment:- 
     
      
       
        
        “... to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter, there are unlikely to be many cases in which this court will interfere, unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive."" 
        
       
      
    39 I have given this matter anxious consideration but in my view I am not persuaded that this is one of those cases in which the court is entitled by application of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to interfere, and particularly is that so because I am not persuaded, having regard to the decision in Simpson (supra), that the trial judge fell into the errors asserted, and it is conceded that neither the head sentences nor the non-parole periods are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    40 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeals. 
     
      
    41 SPIGELMAN, CJ: I agree. 
     
      
    42 HIDDEN, J: I agree. 
     
      
    43 SPIGELMAN, CJ: The order is that leave to appeal is granted. The appeals are dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 MEAGHER JA: The facts are appropriately set out in the judgment of Kirby J, which I have read. However, with regret, I am unable to agree with it. 
     
      
    2 The crucial fact in the case is that the appellant, in company with other little thugs, was engaged in the group-terrorising of innocent shopkeepers in the Parramatta area. The way they did it, by demanding protection money and enforcing such demands by violence, is reminiscent of the behaviour of the Nazi thugs in Berlin in the thirties, or of Mafia groups in modern Sicily. If civilised democracy is to survive in this country, such behaviour must be suppressed. The first step to do so is to impose very heavy prison sentences on those who glory in it. 
     
      
    3 In the present case, a magistrate, recreant to her duty, imposed a ridiculously light sentence on one of these thugs. Then Bellear DCJ imposed on another of them a sentence which was only slightly less ridiculous. Then his Honour Bellear DCJ sentenced the present applicant to sentences which totalled two years 6 months, with a non-parole period of one year six months. Now, if you please, he appeals to this Court on the ground that the sentence is too severe, whereas there should have been a Crown appeal on the ground that the sentence was too lenient. 
     
      
    4 In these circumstances it has seemed desirable to Kirby J to accede to the application, disregarding any justified sense of grievance the shopkeeper victims might have felt. His Honour should have dismissed the appeal. 
     
      
    5 I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal.6 SULLY J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the differing judgments of Meagher JA and of Kirby J. 
     
      
    7 Like Meagher JA, I would dismiss this appeal. My reasons are as follows. 
     
      
       
      [1] In my opinion Eric Ng should have been dealt with according to law and not pursuant to the special regime established for minors by the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW). In that connection I adhere to what I said, with the general concurrence of Hunt CJ at CL and of Campbell J, in  
      WKR 
        
      (1993) 32 NSWLR 447. 
       
       
      [2] Dealing with Eric Ng pursuant to the privileged regime of the Act resulted in the imposition upon him of a penalty which was, as I respectfully think, manifestly inadequate to punish properly his high-level participation in an organised extortion racket that preyed insolently upon decent, law abiding, small shopkeepers. 
       
       
      [3] That the manifest inadequacy of Eric Ng’s punishment should furnish any kind of benchmark for the proper punishment according to law of the present applicant is, in my opinion, a proposition that should be plainly and firmly rejected. To do otherwise would not vindicate the rule of law, but would tend, rather, to subvert it.  
       
       
      [4] It follows that any justified sense of grievance now asserted by the applicant, and based upon principles of parity in sentencing, ought to be judged by reference to the sentence passed upon Hendy Tandiono. I agree with Meagher JA that Tandiono’s 
        
      sentence was itself markedly lenient; but it has not been the subject of any Crown appeal. 
       
       
      [5] I agree with Kirby J that the applicant’s head sentence, and the primary Judge’s finding of special circumstances, should not be disturbed. 
       
       
      [6] That being so, the intervention now proposed by Kirby J is, in real and practical terms,  
      de minimis 
      . I take so strongly adverse a view of the particular extortion racket in which the applicant joined, that I do not believe that such a comparatively minor adjustment as his Honour proposes can be justified by the correct application of correct principles. 
       
      
    8 I would grant leave to appeal. I would dismiss the appeal itself. 
     
      
    9 KIRBY J: Man Kam (Ambrose) Wong (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Bellear DCJ on 20 December 2002. Mr Wong pleaded guilty to five offences and asked his Honour to take into account two further matters on a Form 1. The offences were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : Malicious damage to a shop front window on 25 July 2001 (s195 Crimes Act 1900) (the Act): maximum penalty 5 years imprisonment. 
         
         
        Counts 2 and 3 
        : Demanding property with intent to steal on 4 August 2001 (s99(1) of the Act): maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment. 
         
         
        Counts 4 and 5 
        : Demanding property with intent to steal on 18 August 2001 (s99(1) of the Act). 
        
       
      
    10 The two offences on the Form 1 were further instances of demanding money with menaces on 18 August 2001. 
     
      
    11 His Honour Bellear DCJ made the sentence on count 1 partly cumulative with the sentences imposed upon the remaining counts. The effective sentence was 2 years 6 months imprisonment with a non parole period of 1 year 6 months. The sentence took account of a short period in custody after arrest. It commenced on 29 November 2002 (the date of submissions on sentence), when bail was revoked. 
     
      
    12 There were a number of co-offenders. Most entered early pleas of guilty, as did the applicant. Some were dealt with in the Children's Court. One, Hendy Tandiono, was sentenced by Bellear DCJ some months earlier. Others have yet to be dealt with. 
     
      
    13 The applicant's complaint is based upon parity. Having regard to the sentences imposed on others, he has, it is said, a justifiable sense of grievance. I will describe in general terms the joint enterprise, and then deal with the role of Mr Wong, so that his criminality might be compared with that of others. 
     
      
       
      The enterprise 
       
      
    14 Mr Ambrose Wong (the applicant) and his co-offenders were members of a gang, known as The Big Circle Gang. Gang members regarded each other as members of ""a brotherhood"". Most were youthful. Some were as young as 15 years. A number, including the applicant, were 18 years old. Many had been recruited from schools. Others joined through video parlours and internet cafes. The gang was highly organised. It had a structure which insulated the person in charge, known as the ""Grandfather"". At street level, the gang was led by Eric Ng (aged 16 years 9 months) and Nick Zaleiko (aged 18). Both were characterised as ""District Leaders"" (Parramatta being the district), or ""Red Lanterns"". Mr Ng also described himself as a ""first class street enforcer"". 
     
      
    15 Between 11 July 2001 and 18 August 2001 (when the police made a number of arrests), the gang preyed on Asian shopkeepers and restaurateurs in the Parramatta area, demanding and receiving money for protection. The amount demanded varied, although usually it was $280 per week from each establishment. That sum was moderated to accommodate protests by certain businesses. 
     
      
    16 On 11 July 2001, in a particular restaurant in Parramatta, Eric Ng asked to speak to the person in charge. He demanded money. When he made the demand, another gang member stood alongside him. Outside the restaurant others stood and waited. The restaurant owner said that he would need to consult his partner in Hong Kong. Eric Ng said he would return. And he did. When he returned, he was accompanied by twenty or thirty Asian males and females. They sat at different tables. The restaurant owner promised to pay, and asked them to leave. The same pattern was repeated with other establishments. 
     
      
    17 On any view, as his Honour recognised, these were most serious crimes. They relied upon the coercive force of numbers, and the unspoken threat of violence and reprisal. The victims were vulnerable. Because they feared violence, they met the demands made upon them. The gang relied upon the same fear to ensure that their victims then remained silent. 
     
      
    18 Happily, the victims went to the police. The police thereafter conducted surveillance. Listening devices were installed in a number of establishments. The police provided money (which was marked) which the victims gave the gang to answer their demands. After gang members had collected the money on Saturday 18 August 2001, the police arrested those involved, including the applicant. 
     
      
       
      The actions of Mr Wong 
       
      
    19 In R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, the Court emphasised that the sentencing Court must focus upon the actions, acknowledged or proven, of the person being sentenced (per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ at 277-78). His place in the hierarchy of co-offenders, if it is known or can be established, may furnish a useful index (in the context of the charges) for differentiating between one offender and another. 
     
      
    20 The matter proceeded by way of agreed facts. The facts, however, were supplemented by material from the Crown brief, which included witness statements, surveillance video tapes, and much more. 
     
      
    21 Having met resistance, or at least prevarication, from the restaurant owner, the gang took action. What they did was, as it happened, captured on a surveillance video, taken by the restaurant's security cameras. Eric Ng directed the applicant and another male to splash paint over the front window of the restaurant, which they then did. It was said by the owner of the restaurant that the window was also smashed, although that does not appear from the video. However that may be, the window required replacement. These were the facts supporting the charge of malicious damage against the applicant (Count 1). 
     
      
    22 The damage to the restaurant had the desired effect. The following Saturday, 4 August 2001, the gang returned to the restaurant. Eric Ng repeated his demands for money. Another gang member, Hendy Tandiono stood alongside him, as revealed by the video tape taken from within the restaurant. Two other gang members sat at tables nearby. The applicant and others waited outside the restaurant, forming part of the show of force designed to intimidate the restaurant owner (Count 2). The same pattern was repeated the same day at a different establishment (Count 3). 
     
      
    23 Payment was again due on Saturday, 18 August 2001. Some fifteen shops and restaurants were visited by the gang. Each visit was led by Eric Ng. It was Eric Ng who received the money, each time accompanied by an assortment of gang members. One usually stood alongside Eric Ng as he made his demands. Others stood outside. 
     
      
    24 In approximately ten minutes, according to the police surveillance, the applicant went with Eric Ng to four establishments (Counts 4 and 5 and matters numbers 1 and 2 on the Form 1). On three occasions he stood outside with others whilst Ng made his demands. On one occasion he accompanied Eric Ng into a supermarket. He did so, apparently, to assist, if required, since he spoke better Cantonese than Ng. 
     
      
    25 Following his arrest, Mr Wong was interviewed by the police. He acknowledged at once that he had known that money was being demanded and that it was an extortion racket. He was frank on all issues apart from his complicity in the damage to the restaurant on 26 July 2001 (Count 1). 
     
      
       
      Sentences of co-offenders 
       
      
    26 Complaint is made by the applicant about his sentence when compared to the sentences imposed upon Eric Ng and Hendy Tandiono, both more senior in rank, and far more involved. 
     
      
    27 Eric Ng, as mentioned, was 16 years and 9 months when these offences were committed. He was the ring leader. He was arrested on 18 August 2001 and remained in custody until he was sentenced. He pleaded guilty to 35 counts of demanding property with intent to steal (s99(1) of the Act) and one count of malicious damage (s195 of the Act). He was sentenced in the Children's Court on 26 February 2002 by Ms B A Schurr LCM. Under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, where a child or young offender is charged with an indictable offence or offences (not being a ""serious indictable offence"" as defined), the Court has a discretion to deal with the offender either ""according to law"" or under Division 4 Part 3 of the Act. Under that Division, various orders can be made by way of punishment. However, if a custodial sentence is imposed (termed a ""control order"" under s33(1)(g)), the maximum term is 2 years. 
     
      
    28 Here the Court exercised its discretion in favour of Mr Ng to deal with him under Division 4, Part 3, that is the regime appropriate to the Children's Court. When sentenced, Mr Ng was entitled to a discount, first, by reason of his early plea, and secondly, by reason of the assistance he had provided against other members of the gang. He had no criminal convictions. It was recognised that he would require protection and need to serve his sentence in an institution remote from his family. In these circumstances the learned Magistrate imposed the following sentence: 
     
      
    · First, a fixed term of 3 months (dating from 18 August 2001) for the malicious damage. 
     
      
    · Second, a sentence of 11 months (also dating from 18 August 2001) in respect of the 35 counts under s99(1) of the Act, with a non parole period of 7 months, each term to be concurrent. There was, in addition, a recommendation that Mr Ng be considered for conditional release prior to the expiration of that term to assist his reassimilation into the community. 
     
      
    29 Hendy Tandiono was also sentenced by Bellear DCJ. He was the same age as the applicant (born 13 May 1983, two days after the applicant). He was a student from Indonesia, enrolled in a course in Australia. Like the applicant, he had no criminal convictions. And, like the applicant, he received a discount of 25 percent for his early plea. 
     
      
    30 Mr Tandiono was charged with 18 offences of having demanded property with intent to steal, contrary to s99(1) of the Act, the offences having occurred on 4 August 2001 (2 counts) and 11 August 2001 (16 counts). He was not present on 18 August 2001, although he had been in Parramatta earlier that afternoon, and had made contact with gang members. 
     
      
    31 Mr Tandiono was given bail. He returned to Indonesia. As required by his bail, he again returned to Australia in order to be sentenced by Bellear DCJ on 27 June 2002. The sentencing Judge was provided with a copy of the remarks on sentence by Ms Schurr in respect of Ng. His honour made the following comments in relation to that material: (p36-37) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Whilst acknowledging that this offender is a young adult offender, I am satisfied that there can be no parity principle applied to this sentence with the juvenile co-offender Ng, who has already been sentenced. I accept the solicitor advocate Mr Ash's contention that the learned magistrate did not quantify the discounts given to the offender. However, the learned magistrate noted that these offences are 'possibly the most serious set of offences that have come from the Children's Court'. It appears that she may well have started with the maximum penalty of two years. Magistrate Schurr then noted that the offender's assistance was 'significant and useful' and that he was entitled to a 'significant discount in addition to the discount for a plea of guilty'. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept that the 'substantial' discount was somewhere in the vicinity of 40 to 50 percent, with a further discount for the plea of guilty reducing the total sentence to eleven months."" 
        
       
      
    32 In determining the appropriate sentence for Mr Tendiono, his Honour made the following finding: (p29) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This offender, I am satisfied, was not one of the street leaders but was included as a 'trusted' gang member, a few rungs down from the street leader."" 
        
       
      
    33 As with Mr Wong, his Honour was satisfied that Mr Tandiono had not yet been paid. His Honour concluded that the objective gravity of the crime demanded a sentence which would operate as a strong deterrent to others. The effect of the sentence he imposed was a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non parole period of 2 years, his Honour having found special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Comparison with the young offender 
       
      
    34 Material relating to the sentences imposed upon Eric Ng and other co-offenders (including Tandiono) was provided to Bellear DCJ so that he could address the issue of parity. His Honour reserved his decision. His remarks on sentence are lengthy and painstaking. He was keenly aware of the need for parity, which he endeavoured to provide. His Honour referred to the appropriate authorities. 
     
      
    35 The principles relating to parity, where the comparison is with a young offender, have been gathered by Wood CJ at CL in R v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432. A number of propositions can be stated: 
     
      
    · First, in fashioning a sentence for an adult involved in the same crime, it is relevant to have regard to a sentence imposed by the Children's Court upon a co-offender. 
     
      
    · Second, the worth of that comparison, however, will be limited given the different sentencing objectives and other considerations in the Children's Court. 
     
      
    · Third, in determining whether there is a justifiable sense of grievance, it must be recognised that a stage can be reached where the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon a co-offender is such that any sense of grievance engendered by it cannot be regarded as legitimate (R v Diamond (NSW, CCA, 18.2.93, per Hunt CJ at CL). 
     
      
    · Fourth, at an appellant level, where there is a justifiable sense of grievance in the adult offender, that does not oblige the court to intervene. It has a discretion to intervene. It should not intervene where to do so would produce a sentence which does not reflect the objective gravity of the crime. 
     
      
    36 Here, the applicant points to a number of matters. Eric Ng, as stated, was the ring leader. Notwithstanding his youth, he gave instruction and direction to the gang, as depicted on the video in respect of the paint throwing. It was Eric Ng who made the demands upon the victims. He it was who collected the money and badgered the victims beforehand until they succumbed to his demands. He was involved in every aspect of the enterprise from its inception until 18 August 2001, when he and other gang members were arrested. Eric Ng was charged with 36 counts, compared to 5 counts against Ambrose Wong (with two matters on a Form 1). Yet he was sentenced to a control order for 11 months with a non parole period of 7 months, with a recommendation that he be released into the community earlier if possible. 
     
      
    37 The applicant, in contrast, was a relatively late recruit into the gang. His involvement was limited in the way described. He was said by the Probation and Parole Service to be immature. Dr Jolly, psychiatrist, made the same observation. He thought he had the maturity of a 15 or 16, or perhaps 17 year old. Eric Ng, in contrast, was very mature. Their chronological ages, however, led to sentences which were markedly different. Ambrose Wong was 18 years 2 months when he foolishly joined this enterprise. Had he been six months younger, the outcome may have been very different. 
     
      
    38 I accept that to a reasonable observer, such difference in treatment may seem unfair. The unfairness derives from the decision to deal with Eric Ng under the regime provided for in the Children's Court, rather than ""according to law"" (cf R v WKR (1993) 32 NSWLR 447 at 451 (Hunt CJ at CL and Sully J at 459-460)). Can that unfairness be characterised as a justifiable sense of grievance, as that term has been explained in Lowe v The Queen 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295? I will leave that issue to one side for the moment whilst I examine the second limb of the applicant's argument, which concerned the other adult offender, Hendy Tandiono. 
     
      
       
      Comparison with Mr Tandiono 
       
      
    39 Mr Wong's counsel drew attention to two matters where, according to his argument, a contrast between Ambrose Wong's position and that of Hendy Tandiono distinctly favoured Mr Wong. First, they were differently placed in the hierarchy. Secondly, there was, according to the applicant, a marked difference in the intensity of Mr Wong's involvement in gang activities compared to that of Mr Tandiono (no doubt reflecting their rank within the hierarchy). 
     
      
    40 After his arrest, Eric Ng provided the police with statements in which he described the hierarchy and the role performed at each level. Mr Tandiono was described as a ""Blue Lantern"", which was one level down from Eric Ng. The applicant, in contrast, was described (as his Honour accepted) as a ""watchdog"", or a level 4 to 5 fighter (whatever that may mean). Eric Ng further said that if Ambrose Wong were to successfully complete the Parramatta extortion, he would be promoted to one level below a Blue Lantern. 
     
      
    41 His Honour recognised (remarks p2) the importance of ""where the offender is placed in the ladder of criminality"", considered in the context of the particular offences charged. His Honour said this: (p10 -11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This offender I accept was not one of the street leaders but was included as a 'trusted' gang member, a few rungs down from street leader Ng and just below that of the offender Tandiono. This is based on the fact that he did not attend as many shops or restaurants as did Tandiono, although I do accept that his role was significant in the menacing of the victims who refused to hand over the money demanded."" 
        
       
      
    42 It is said on behalf of the applicant that this overstates the position. At the time the offences were committed, Ambrose Wong was, on the applicant's submission, well below Hendy Tandiono. Even once promoted, he would still be one level below Mr Tandiono. And this difference, on the applicant's case, can be seen by a comparison of what each did. On 11 August 2001 (a day on which Mr Wong did not participate), Hendy Tandiono was effectively the lieutenant of Eric Ng. He went from one shop to the next with Ng and others as demands were made and money collected. Sometimes he stood alongside Ng (as revealed by surveillance) as demands were made. On other occasions he was outside, as part of the show of force designed to intimidate the victim. On that day he committed 16 offences under s99(1) of the Act. Ambrose Wong, on the other hand, was charged with two offences on 4 August and four (including the Form 1) on 18 August 2001. 
     
      
    43 In these circumstances, according to the applicant, it is timely to look again at the balance struck by his Honour between these two offenders. The difference in sentence was as follows: 
     
      
      Tandiono: 4 years with a 2 year non parole period 
       
        
        Wong: 2 1/2 years with a 1 1/2 year non parole period 
        
       
      
    44 The applicant's case can be summarised in this way. Apart from the issue of parity, no complaint could be made against Mr Wong's sentence. It was within the range of sound sentencing discretion. Indeed, no particular complaint could be made as to the balance struck between the respective terms of imprisonment imposed upon the two offenders (4 years for Tandiono against 2 years 6 months for Wong). What is unfair, according to the applicant, and gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, is that, although Mr Tandiono was much more heavily involved (18 offences compared to 7), and much more significant in the gang structure, he only received six months more in actual time in custody than Ambrose Wong.  
     
      
    45 I am persuaded that Mr Wong does, in respect of the non parole period fixed by his Honour, have a legitimate sense of grievance. I am reinforced in that view, difficult though the comparison is, by the sentence imposed upon Eric Ng. I believe the Court should intervene. 
     
      
    46 In resentencing the applicant, I would not disturb the head sentence imposed. Having regard to the seriousness of the offences, a sentence of 2 years 6 months was entirely appropriate. I would also adopt, for the reasons given by his Honour, the finding of special circumstances. I would, however, adjust the non parole period so that it was reduced from 18 months to 12 months. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    47 I therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal is granted. 
       
       
      2. The appeal is allowed. 
       
       
      3. The sentence is set aside and, in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced as follows: 
       
       
        
      On Count 1 
      , the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 9 months to commence on 29 November 2002 and expire on 28 August 2003. 
       
       
        
      On Count 2 
      , including the Form 1, the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years 6 months concurrent with the sentence on Count 1, to commence on 29 November 2002 and expire on 28 May 2005. The non parole period is 12 months to expire on 28 November 2003. 
       
       
        
      On Counts 3, 4 and 5 
      , a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment concurrent with the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 to commence on 29 November 2002 and expire on 28 August 2003.

      FACTS 
       
      The Applicant sought leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence of 8 years (with a non-parole period of 6 years) imposed on him by Ireland AJ on 2 November 2001. Charged with murder, he had pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and the Crown accepted that plea. The victim was aged a little over 2 years. At the time of the victim’s death, the Applicant had been living with the mother of the victim (who also entered a plea of guilty to the manslaughter of the victim). 
       
       
      HELD  
      per 
       Hulme J (Hidden J agreeing), allowing the appeal: 
      
    1. The fact that the victim’s mother was an accessory to the victim’s death, the fact that she had much to gain by implicating the Applicant, and the fact that she had on many occasions lied about the events, all required that her evidence implicating the Applicant be scrutinised with great care. M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487; Fox v Percy (2003) 77 ALJR 989, referred to. [69 et seq.] 
     
      
    2. The victim’s mother’s credibility was so bad that Ireland AJ was not entitled to be persuaded by her beyond reasonable doubt. [75] 
     
      
       
      Meagher JA ( 
      contra 
      ): 
       
        
        The application before the Court was directed at attacking Ireland AJ’s finding that the Applicant had exercised undue influence on the victim’s mother, preventing her from providing medical assistance for the victim. This is what the victim’s mother said, and Ireland AJ, as a tribunal fact, believed her. It is of no relevance that she was a bad mother, that she had treated the child abominably, or that she had lied about the matter again and again. Ireland AJ believed the version that she recited in the witness box.

     PAUL GEOFFREY HILL v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MEAGHER JA: The appellant, Mr Paul Hill, seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence of 8 years imposed on him by Ireland AJ in the Supreme Court at Sydney on 2 November 2001. Charged with murder he had pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and the Crown had accepted that plea. The victim was aged a little over 2 years; Mr Hill had been living with a Leanne Eriksson, who was the mother of the victim, called Tristen. Tristen met his death on 23 April 2000. 
     
      
    2 Mr Hill and Miss Eriksson had lived together for some months before the child’s death at various addresses in Ashfield, Darlington and Mount Druitt. Both of them treated the child abominably. On 14 April 2000 there was a particularly nasty episode when the child sustained a spiral fracture to the left tibia. It was later ascertained that at about the same time there were fractures to the right humerus above the elbow, to the right seventh and eighth ribs, to the left scapula and clavicle, and a number of other abrasions, lesions and bruises on his head, chest and limbs. Nobody knows exactly who was responsible for these injuries, although it was common ground that it was either Mr Hill or Miss Eriksson. 
     
      
    3 Another major episode occurred four days later, on 18 April 2000, when Miss Eriksson left the child in Mr Hill’s care for some forty-five minutes while she went to the nearby shops. On her return she inquired how Tristen was, only to receive the reply “I done something”, and then added “I couldn’t handle him crying. I threw him onto the corner of the lounge and he hit his head.” This account is Miss Eriksson’s, Mr Hill denying it. However, his Honour believed it, and to the requisite standard. 
     
      
    4 The child suffered another major trauma, on or before 23 April, but the evidence does not disclose exactly what it was or who caused it. His Honour did not, and could not find that Mr Hill was responsible for it. It was this trauma which killed the child. 
     
      
    5 No medical attention was sought for the child between 18 and 23 April, although such attention was badly needed. 
     
      
    6 It is plain beyond doubt that the child’s death was caused by the absence of medical attention to a gravely ill little boy suffering from a multiplicity of severe injuries. Both Mr Hill and Miss Eriksson should have seen to the provision of that medical attention. They did not. On Miss Eriksson’s evidence (which his Honour accepted) she did not do so because Mr Hill influenced her not to. 
     
      
    7 His Honour sentenced Mr Hill to a term of imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. Miss Eriksson, on the other hand, received a sentence of 3 years. 
     
      
    8 Mr Hill’s application before this Court was directed basically at attacking his Honour’s finding that Mr Hill exercised undue influence on Miss Eriksson preventing her from providing medical assistance for her child. However, this is what Miss Eriksson said, and his Honour, as a tribunal of fact, believed her. It is of no relevance that she was a bad mother, that she had treated the child abominably, or that she had lied about the matter again and again. His Honour believed the version that she recited in the witness box. 
     
      
    9 It was also submitted that by a proper application of the principles of parity and proportionality, considering Miss Eriksson’s sentence, Mr Hill’s sentence should be lighter. But this submission may be easily laid to rest. She made an early plea of guilty, he did not. She offered assistance to the authorities, he did not. He influenced her not to go to the doctor, she did not influence him. And, in any event, her sentence was inappropriately light. 
     
      
    10 It is also submitted that his Honour did not give sufficient weight to Mr Hill’s deprived background. This, too, admits of a simple answer: he clearly did. 
     
      
    11 Finally, it is said that the sentence is manifestly excessive. I do not think so. To put an end to a child’s life is an offence of extraordinary gravity. 
     
      
    12 The application should be dismissed. 
     
      
    13 HULME J: On 27 April 2000 Tristen Michael Allen Lane, then 2 years old, died. There were at least three events which may have caused or contributed to his death. 
     
      
    14 The first was a major head injury he sustained on or about 18 April 2000. The second was the failure of Leanne Eriksson, his mother, and the Applicant who was living with her at the time, to obtain medical treatment of Tristen between 18 and 23 April 2000. The third was further trauma to Tristen’s head which was suffered within hours prior to his admission to hospital on 23 April. 
     
      
    15 On 25 May 2000 the Applicant and Ms Eriksson were arrested and charged with Tristen’s murder. In due course they were committed for trial. The evidence before this Court does not reveal all that occurred thereafter but Ms Eriksson appeared before the Supreme Court on 2 August 2001 when she entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter.  
     
      
    16 On 21 August 2001, Ms Eriksson participated in a recorded interview. In the course of the interview she made a variety of assertions implicating the Applicant in the head injury Tristen sustained on or about 18 April and exonerating herself from all of the injuries which led to Tristen’s death. In prior interviews with police and in numerous statements to relatives and others, she seems to have maintained that Tristen had injured himself falling down some stairs or denied any knowledge of how Tristen might have been injured. 
     
      
    17 On 29 August 2001 evidence relevant to Ms Eriksson’s sentence was given and on 7 September 2001 Ireland AJ sentenced Ms Eriksson to imprisonment for 3 years including a non-parole period of 18 months. The commencing date of these periods was 20 August 2000, a date which reflects pre-sentence custody. The head sentence reflected a discount of 17% for a plea and 33% for assistance to the authorities by way of implication of, and giving evidence against, the Applicant. 
     
      
    18 On 10 September 2001 the Applicant was arraigned on a charge of Tristen’s murder. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and the Crown indicated it was prepared to accept that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. Over a number of days evidence on the question of sentence was taken and on 2 November 2001 Ireland AJ sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for 8 years including a non-parole period of 6 years, both such periods dating from 25 May 2000. 
     
      
    19 During the sentencing proceedings, it was common ground between the Crown and the Applicant that he was guilty of criminal neglect in respect of a failure to obtain medical treatment. In issue, however, was whether, in addition, the Applicant had been guilty of one or more unlawful and dangerous acts which caused injury and contributed to Tristen’s death, and specifically caused the 2 head injuries to which I have referred. On this topic Ireland AJ recorded that it was common ground that the injuries must have been occasioned by the deliberate act of either the Applicant or Ms Eriksson. Ireland AJ’s findings included the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        37. The medical evidence is consistent with Tristen sustaining a major head injury on 18 April 2000. Doctor Langlois expressed the opinion that the constellation of injuries noted during autopsy would have been inflicted ten to fourteen days before the autopsy, that is to say between 14 and 18 April 2000. The fractures had formed callus, which indicated that they were more than seven days old. Professor Harper, Professor of Neuropathology, from the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and the University of Sydney was of the same opinion. 
        
       
       
        
        38. I accept it to be common ground between the medical experts that Tristen sustained further trauma to the head shortly prior to his admission to hospital on 23 April 2000. It is not possible to say precisely when this final injury occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        39. Doctor Neil Langlois, forensic pathologist, is of the opinion that the time interval between trauma and leakage of the cerebro-spinal fluid, which was found upon admission, could range from almost instantaneous to a matter of hours. 
        
       
       
        
        40. Doctor Gregory Rowle, paediatric specialist, expressed the opinion that Tristen sustained a major injury on the day of his admission to hospital and that it was very likely that there was then a pre-existing brain injury. 
        
       
       
        
        41. Doctor Rowle expressed the opinion that the oedema or swelling of the brain, which caused the brain stem injury leading to cardiac arrest, developed in a matter of minutes and led to an arrest within the space of at most a few hours following the injury. 
        
       
       
        
        42. When asked to encapsulate the complete picture which he saw as a result of the whole of the history, that is to say the medical history relating to treatment, Professor Harper said this: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “I believe between ten and fourteen days before this child died something happened which stopped the oxygen to his brain at the same time he suffered a head injury, which resulted in him developing a subdural haematoma. The lack of oxygen has caused very, very severe brain damage to the extent that had nothing else happened to this child he would have been permanently debilitated and would have been virtually a vegetable. Certainly within four days (sic) of the death based mostly upon other evidence not my own evidence, it appears the child suffered a second injury which resulted in a fracture of the petrous temporal bone, which caused leakage of CSF, and given the leakage I saw within the older subdural haematoma it is also likely that resulted from his old head injury. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The combination of both of the brain damage or oedema, there is absolutely no space left within the skull for the brain to continue to function or for the blood to flow into the brain and that forced the rain down through the base of the skull, it is called the foramen magnum, and that is the site where our bodies meet and respiration is controlled, and if you compress that, everything stops and that is the final common pathway of this child’s death.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        43. I am satisfied that within a period, probably of the order of 4 hours, prior to admission to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on 23 April 2000, Tristen sustained a second injury which caused the oedema which, in turn, resulted in cardiac arrest. This second injury may be considered to be the direct cause of death. 
        
       
       
        
        44. The events which took place on the morning of 23 April are to be gleaned from the evidence of Ms Eriksson and the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        45. I do not propose to review that evidence in detail. Suffice it to say that it does not, in my view, permit a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender inflicted a further injury on that occasion so as to constitute manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. 
        
       
       
        
        46. The evidence makes plain, however, that over a period of some five days the offender failed to seek, for the child Tristen, medical assistance and treatment of which he was obviously in dire need, and further that he influenced Ms Eriksson to do likewise. 
        
       
       
        
        47. I am further satisfied on the criminal standard that on 18 April 2000 the offender so injured the child Tristen as to cause the multiple injuries, with the exception of the prior fracture to the tibia, as were disclosed on post-mortem examination, as well as the brain damage of such severity as to result in the degree of permanent debilitation described by Professor Harper as “virtually a vegetable”. When taken together with the influence exercised by the offender to deter Ms Eriksson from seeking medical treatment, these are circumstances of the gravest aggravation.” 
        
       
      
    20 In support of the appeal it was submitted that Ireland AJ erred in:- 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Sentencing the Applicant on the basis of an aggravating feature, being that on 18 April 2000 the Applicant so injured the child as to cause the multiple injuries and brain damage. The determination of this aggravating feature was not reasonably open on the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Sentencing the Applicant on the basis of an aggravating feature, being the influence exercised by the Applicant to deter Ms Eriksson the co-offender from seeking medical treatment for the child, Tristen. The determination of this aggravating feature was not reasonably open on the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Following upon the above errors, there was consequent error in not applying the principles of parity and proportionality so as to achieve a proper relationship with the sentence imposed upon the co-offender. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) That his Honour was in error in giving insufficient weight to the circumstance of the Applicant’s deprived background social, educational and intellectual background in determining issues of moral culpability and deterrence. 
        
       
       
        
        (v) His Honour’s determination of the appropriate sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances. 
        
       
      
    21 The evidence of the “aggravating features” was primarily that of Ms Eriksson. In substance, the first two of the submissions boil down to the proposition that his Honour should not, reasonably, have been satisfied to the requisite standard by her evidence. Appearing for the Applicant Mr Craigie acknowledged that the Applicant faced a high hurdle. For his Honour had also said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “19. What is said by (Leanne Eriksson’s half sisters, Shonna and Julia Parker, their close friend Kylie Quinn and other close friends Susie Tavares and Dominic Natalie) and by other persons, who have made statements to investigating police, satisfies me to the relevant degree that, following commencement of the relationship between Leanne Eriksson and the offender, Tristen was subjected to rough handling and physical abuse by the offender which was evident in bruising and abrasions observed by Shonna and Julie Parker and in particular Susie Tavares and Kylie Quinn. 
        
       
       
        
        23. On about Friday 14 April 2000 when residing with the offender’s sister at Golden Grove Street, an incident occurred in which Tristen suffered a spiral fracture of the left tibia. The offender has given inconsistent versions of events associated with this incident. 
        
       
       
        
        32. The credibility of Leanne Eriksson has been the subject of careful analysis in helpful written and oral submissions by Mr Zahra. It is apparent that at a time when she was in love with the offender, and desired to continue and develop her relationship with him, that she gave to hospital staff and authorities versions of events which sought to exculpate the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        33. I am satisfied that the offender was the dominant partner in their relationship and that in failing to seek medical attention for Tristen, Ms Eriksson was largely influenced by the offender and the dire consequences he encouraged her to believe would flow from any investigation by authorities of the origin of the child’s injuries. 
        
       
       
        
        34. I am nevertheless satisfied that in making her statement of 21 August 2001, and in giving her evidence before me on 12 and 13 September 2001, Ms Eriksson was endeavouring to tell the truth to the best of her ability and recollection. 
        
       
       
        
        35. I do not accept the offender as a witness of truth. His denial of any maltreatment of Tristen and his denial of a close and intimate relationship with Leanne Eriksson are both contradicted by the unchallenged statements of independent witnesses to whom I have referred with regard to his conduct and by the letters which he wrote to Ms Eriksson as to the depth of his feelings and affection for her. 
        
       
      
    22 However, just as the verdict of a jury who has seen and heard the witnesses is liable to be overturned in this Court, so may be the findings of a sentencing judge. Thus, as did the submissions on the part of the Appellant, I find it necessary to go to the evidence in some detail.  
     
      
    23 An appropriate starting point in an examination of whether his Honour was entitled to accept Ms Eriksson as a witness of truth is the medical and pathology evidence. It is at least arguable that it is impossible to reconcile Ms Eriksson’s own evidence with this.  
     
      
    24 The first event of note in this area is that Tristen was taken to hospital on 15 April 2000 where he was seen to have a broken tibia in his left leg. The tenor of the evidence of the doctor and nurses who examined him on that occasion was - and there is no reason to doubt their evidence - that at that time he had no other bone injuries. 
     
      
    25 The next time he was seen by anyone with medical or quasi-medical knowledge was when ambulance officers arrived at the unit occupied by the Appellant, Ms Eriksson and Tristen at about 10.55 am on Sunday 23 April 2000. They observed that Tristen was then without pulse. One of the doctor’s reports indicates that he remained in this state at least from 10.56 to 11.18 am. 
     
      
    26 Tristen was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and then moved to the Westmead Childrens’ Hospital where for some days he was placed on a life support system until 27 April. Shortly after that was switched off, he died. Post mortem examination showed that the injuries at that time, referred to by his Honour at paragraph 37 included, in addition to many bruises, fractures of the 7th and 8th ribs on the right side, a fracture of the right humerus, fractures of the left scapula and left clavicle, and of the left tibia. All of these bone injuries showed signs of natural repair. 
     
      
    27 One of the witnesses was Dr Rowell, a consultant paediatric physician who examined Tristen on his admission to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He observed multiple superficial bruises and abrasions on the head, neck and chest and bruises along both sides of the jaw. The bruises on the front of the chest were many and small. There was also a superficial abrasion on the right upper eyelid and superficial lacerations and bruises at the superior and inferior attachments of the right ear, caused probably a couple of days previously. The bruises were of various ages, some recent. Reddening of the left ear was consistent with pulling or a blow. 
     
      
    28 There was bruising and swelling in the left supraclavicular fossa. The symptoms were compatible with the fracture of the left clavicle having been there for some days. 
     
      
    29 There was clear fluid found in the left ear consistent with CSF leakage, this leakage suggesting a fractured base of the skull. The radiologist reported opacification of the left mastoid air cells consistent with the clinical diagnosis of a fractured base of the skull. Such a leakage normally leads to meningitis within a matter of hours to days or a week or two. 
     
      
    30 A CT brain scan showed diffuse cerebral oedema involving most of the left hemisphere of the brain. In his original report Dr Rowell’s opinion was that on the morning of 23 April Tristen suffered a severe diffuse brain injury producing massive cerebral oedema and also suffered a fractured base of the skull. The cerebral oedema provoked the final swelling of the brain. In Dr Rowell’s view, this in turn compromised brain stem function and caused cardiac arrest. 
     
      
    31 Dr Rowell said it was this injury which caused death and it occurred within at most a few hours of Tristen’s presentation at hospital. The injury could have resulted from a blow or shaking, or the oedema could have been worsened by a period of deprivation of oxygen to the brain. The latter is least likely cause: A blow to the head is the most likely. The CT scan excluded further haemorrhaging as causative of Tristen’s death. An absence of recent retinal haemorrhages argued against shaking.  
     
      
    32 Asked to assume that a later CT scan showed quite an increase in the cerebral oedema, Dr Rowell said that that would indicate that the injury occurred immediately (by which I take him to mean very shortly) before presentation at the hospital. 
     
      
    33 In evidence Dr Rowell was asked to assume also that Tristen had suffered an injury as a result of striking his head on 18 April. He said that he could not exclude the possibility of two injuries but he maintained that it was on Sunday 23 April that Tristen sustained the major injury that caused the condition Dr Rowell saw in the hospital that day. There was insufficient evidence to indicate that the subdural haemorrhage caused the oedema and compromise brain functions and subsequent cardiac arrest and indeed evidence to the contrary. However, the previous injury could have sped up the time between the traumatic event on 23 April and the oedema it caused. In general an injury sufficient to cause cerebral oedema which was sufficient to cause compromise of brain stem function and cardiac arrest would have to be substantial although the earlier injury may have meant that lesser force than usual was required. 
     
      
    34 Dr Jacobe was a part-time staff specialist in paediatric intensive care. He had been involved in Tristen’s care from the afternoon of 23 April. Apart from injuries which were described by others, Dr Jacobe said there were multiple bruises apparently of different ages on Tristen’s anterior and posterior trunk. Dr Jacobe opined that it was likely that in the hours prior to Tristen’s presentation he suffered a severe cerebral injury. 
     
      
    35 On 24 April Dr Wilkins, a senior staff specialist in paediatric intensive care took over from Dr Jacobe and examined Tristen. Dr Wilkins observed, inter alia, a bruise and abrasions on the back of Tristen’s head, a bruise on his back and one at the base of his penis, bruises on his abdomen and chest and a distended, tense abdomen. He referred to X-rays showing fractures of the left clavicle, the right eighth rib and the bottom end of the humerus. A CT scan of the head showed diffuse swelling of the brain, more marked on the left, a small left sided sub-dural haemorrhage and some small contusions within the brain. 
     
      
    36 Dr Wilkins opined that the combination of severe brain injury, injury to the pancreas and multiple fractures could not have been sustained in a single accident and none of the fractures were of the sort that could be ordinarily sustained in trivial accidents. He said, “The child died as a direct result of the traumatic injury to his brain. … a traumatic brain injury of this severity would not be followed by any lucid interval which would delay his presentation to hospital. It is therefore my opinion that the fatal injury was sustained not more than a few hours before the ambulance was called. The appearance of most of the injuries is consistent with this.” 
     
      
    37 Dr Michael Ryan is a consultant paediatrician whose CV indicates considerable study of child abuse and neglect. He examined Tristen on the morning of 24 April. He referred to bruises “over the front of the chest, on the face, and abdomen, which I confirmed to be adult fingermarks.” In his report of 28 April Dr Ryan set out the findings of a CT scan of Tristen’s head and the conclusion of a “probable left subdural haematoma, with more recent haemorrhage against the falx, and significant cerebral oedema causing effacement of the cerebral sulci, presumed base of skull fracture.” He recorded that the observation of clear fluid from Tristen’s left ear further supported the suggested basal skull fracture.  
     
      
    38 Dr Ryan said he observed multiple adult “fingermark” bruises on Tristen’s face, chest and back and a laceration to the tip of Tristen’s left ear which he believed was of recent origin. He said the CT scan taken at RPAH demonstrated “an acute interfalcine subdural haematoma (2-3 days old)” and a chest x-ray taken at RPAH showed a 2-3 day old fracture of the left clavicle. Dr Ryan suggested a repeat CT scan of the head be taken and this showed increased cerebral oedema and hypoxic brain injury. 
     
      
    39 Dr Ryan records the findings of a skeletal survey. He said that ophthalmological consultation did not reveal evidence of retinal haemorrhages. Dr Ryan quoted from a number of publications included in the quotes were that a fracture of the distal third of the clavicle is likely to be the result of shaking, that in young children rib fractures are rarely if ever the result of minor accidental trauma, have not been found after cardiopulmonary resuscitation and most are thought to result from violent shaking and that “while retinal haemorrhages are commonly associated with inflicted head trauma in 15 to 20% of cases, retinal haemorrhages will not be documented. 
     
      
    40 Dr Steinberg is a radiologist at the Westmead Children’s Hospital. He referred to many of the fractures to which I have referred. He attributed the constellation of brain injury seen to shaking and the totality of injuries to systematic beating and abuse.  
     
      
    41 Professor Harper is a surgical pathologist. He reviewed sections of Tristen’s brain. He concluded that a subdural haematoma on the left side of the brain had occurred about 10 to 14 days prior to death and there appeared also to be recent bleeding within the haematoma suggesting recurrent haemorrhage. Such an event is a frequent and well known phenomenon not necessarily associated with a second head injury. Professor Harper said that the most severe brain damage related to a lack of oxygen or glucose to the brain and changes caused by this also appeared to be 10 to 14 days old. He saw some features which “could be related to the diffuse hypoxic (lack of oxygen) damage or could be due to a head injury with a rotational component, the latter being more likely. 
     
      
    42 In evidence before Ireland AJ, Professor Harper said that the diagnosis to which I have referred was based solely on an examination of the brain and photographs together with some preliminary information that the victim could have been shaken. At the time of giving evidence Professor Harper had however seen information from other doctors and he said that this helped to give a more complete picture. He adhered to the view that Tristen had had brain damage caused by lack of oxygen and swelling to the brain and that both had occurred between 10 and 14 days before his death and said that the only issue between him and Dr Rowell was that Professor Harper saw the subdural haematoma and the hypoxic encephalitis as more significant. Professor Harper accepted what was said to be the opinions of Dr Ryan and Dr Rowell that the difference in the two CT scans indicated a significant trauma within hours of presentation at the hospital. He gave the following evidence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. The particular trauma of the morning within hours of presentation is in fact the trauma that caused death? 
         
         
        A. Yes, the child then developed brain swelling and the swelling of the brain led to the arrest, his cardiac arrest …” – T230 
         
        
       
      
    43 The transcript records Professor Harper expressing other views on the topic of when the most recent trauma occurred. Taken to what was said to be Dr Rowell’s view that it could have occurred some minutes to hours before Tristen’s fitting, Professor Harper said that from the pathological point of view, looking down a microscope, it was impossible to judge the time between the limits of zero to 24 hours. The Professor was asked what inferences could be drawn from the appearance of CSF in Tristen’s ear. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “That a second injury has occurred relatively recently because of the CSF bleed. Leaking of CSF leads to infection in the brain after one or two, maybe three days, and there was no evidence of infection in the brain so it is suspected this fracture of the skull has occurred maybe one or two days at the most but as early as minutes or hours from the time the child was seen in the hospital.” 
        
       
      
    44 Later Professor Harper agreed with what was said to be counsel’s understanding of his evidence that it could be anything from minutes to hours after the trauma that the child went into cardiac arrest. Shortly afterwards Professor Harper gave the evidence which is quoted in paragraph 42 of Ireland AJ’s remarks on sentence. Then in further cross-examination there was the following exchange:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. It was put to Dr Rowell this was probably a re-bleed. His view is it was trauma, not a re-bleed, from his clinical observations? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have indicated just a moment ago in relation to what his Honour asked you from the pathway causing death you are of the view it was a significant trauma within hours of presentation? 
         
        A. Yes. One thing I did omit in explaining that to his Honour was the impact of the actual cerebral oedema on the brain. The volume of the recent haematoma was not so great as to the precipitate the death but the haematoma and the oedema are usually linked and they are both linked to trauma. The oedema was emphasised in the two CT scans by the radiologist. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Looking all the clinical evidence, could it be put that the likely conclusion is that there was a trauma within hours? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That was - - ? 
         
        A. Hours, four hours before he died. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And this was not a spontaneous re-bleed? 
         
        A. Yes, I believe that. 
        
       
      
    45 Professor Harper also gave evidence as to the consequences of the original injury. In addition to what he said in the passage quoted by Ireland AJ, Professor Harper said :- 
     
      
       
        
        “.. the child would have probably have had, would certainly have had a very severe mental disorder. We sometimes describe it as a vegetative state, unable to speak, communicate, feed himself, because of the severity of the brain lesion I saw, which I believe occurred between 10 and 14 days before his death.” 
        
       
      
    46 There was also evidence from Dr Langlois who conducted the post-mortem examination. He said that the fractures he saw were all about the same age – certainly within a few days of one another and the evidence of healing he would not have expected to see in less than a week of the injury. He said that the absence of evidence of meningitis suggests that the fracture that led to the leak of CSF had occurred within a short time, up to a day or so, prior to the leak being detected. Dr Langlois said that during the post mortem he looked for a fracture at the base of the skull but could not find one. 
     
      
    47 Dr Langlois said that the subdural haemorrhage did not cause death. He went on to say that Tristen had a necessarily fatal head injury. 
     
      
    48 Dr Langlois said that there were indications in the form of a number of injuries to the scalp which suggested that, after the original subdural haematoma there had been at least one further incident of trauma at multiple sites. The second subdural haematoma could have been due to shaking. So could the first. The second bleeding could have occurred over a few days or within hours of presentation at hospital. It could have occurred spontaneously, been the result of a minor episode of trauma or a severe episode of trauma. However, he said he did not regard the re-bleed as of significance. In his words “what is of significance is 10-14 days before I performed the autopsy there had been a severe head trauma episode resulting in irreversible brain damage and an associated sub-dural associated haemorrhage.” 
     
      
    49 In his report under the Coroners Act, he said the correct cause of death was head injury with bleeding having occurred around 15 April and re-bleeding about 23 April. He said that microscopic examination of the brain revealed changes following a lack of oxygen supply which would have occurred when breathing failed due to the effects of the head injury before the child went to hospital on 23 April. In a supplementary report made after he had received Professor Harper’s report he said the pathological changes indicated an event between one or two weeks prior to death and consequent diffuse brain damage would be expected to have resulted in a generalised loss of function such as thought and purposeful movement. He also suggested there may have been a further head injury less than a week prior to death. 
     
      
    50 Against this background I turn to the evidence of Ms Eriksson. In the interview she had with the police on 21 August 2001, her account of events on 23 April up to the time that Tristen commenced fitting was as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “118. On Sunday morning I woke up but Tristen was awake when I woke up. Paul was still asleep. I got up and made him some Weetbix and made myself a coffee. I went in and fed him the Weetbix which he ate. I gave him a drink of cordial, I think. About half an hour later I gave him a bit of the Easter egg, which was white chocolate, which he ate. I gave him another drink. He looked tired so I propped him on the mattress of (sic) the floor but he was whinging.  
        
       
       
        
        119. I went out and made another coffee and when I came back in he was asleep. I was sitting there watching the music video show and Paul was awake. Tristen slept for about half an hour. When he woke up he was whinging, crying and I went out to the kitchen to get a drink or something. Paul screamed out, “Leanne, come here, quick. Fucken hurry up.” 
        
       
       
        
        120. I rushed into the lounge room and Tristen was on the mattress, fitting, his eyes were rolling back in his head and he was stiffening up and then relaxing. He was bringing up grey Weetbix looking stuff from his mouth.” 
        
       
      
    51 Ms Eriksson gave evidence in the course of her own sentencing proceedings and swore that in the interview of 21 August she was completely truthful to the best of her memory. 
     
      
    52 Ms Eriksson’s evidence of events on the morning of 23 April given during the sentencing proceedings involving the Applicant, was that whereas there had been difficulty in feeding Tristen previously, there was no difficulty in feeding him on that morning and there appeared to be no trouble in him drinking, or eating the chocolate. On that morning all Tristen said was “mum” or “drink”. He seemed alert, but sick and whingey. 
     
      
    53 Ms Eriksson also said that on the morning of 23 April, the Applicant was next to Tristen but she saw no interaction or attempted interaction between them prior to the commencement of the fitting. Mrs Eriksson was in the kitchen for only a brief period of time, about 30 seconds, before the Applicant called out. She agreed that during this period she heard “only Tristen whinging – the same as she had heard before she left the room”. Asked then if there was any change in that and whether she heard the child cry loudly, she said “Not that I can remember”. 
     
      
    54 Given the circumstances, it is difficult to believe Ms Eriksson would not have remembered any significant cry or noise. 
     
      
    55 In summary therefore, Ms Eriksson’s evidence of the events of the morning of 23 April is to the effect, inter alia, that nothing which could have caused the injury of that day of which the doctors spoke occurred. Although finding, in accordance with the medical evidence, that that injury had occurred and that he could not conclude the Applicant caused it, Ireland AJ did not address what I see as these inconsistencies between Ms Eriksson’s evidence and that of the doctors. 
     
      
    56 Nor did his Honour direct attention to the apparent inconsistency between Ms Eriksson’s evidence to the effect that Tristen’s condition seemed to have improved that morning such that the prior difficulties there had been in feeding him had disappeared and the evidence of Professor Harper which his Honour, in paragraph 47 of his remarks on sentence, accepted to the effect that the that the plaintiff was “virtually a vegetable”. 
     
      
    57 And, as I have indicated, these were not the only respects in which Ms Eriksson’s evidence was suspect. She had been interviewed by the police on 25 April. A transcript of that interview was not included in the Appeal papers but during the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the Applicant suggested that this Court should view the tape of that interview as Ireland AJ had had the opportunity of doing. It is in fact not clear to me that the whole tape was before Ireland AJ although the transcript of the cross-examination of Ms Eriksson makes it clear that significant passages were then played. My enquiries for the tape have so far been unsuccessful, although I have been told that substantial and time consuming editing by counsel who appeared before Ireland AJ would be required for it to be reduced to the same form in which his Honour saw it.  
     
      
    58 In the end, I have decided not to pursue enquiries for the original. In light of answers given by Ms Eriksson when shown the tape and the conclusions at which I have arrived, this will not, I believe, prejudice either the Applicant or the Crown. Included in those answers was evidence to the following effect. Before participating in the ERISP, Ms Eriksson knew that she had to say the Applicant was never there and thus to make something up. She prepared answers in advance, although made some parts up as the interview progressed and from her appearance in the ERISP, she had no difficulty in doing so. Her demeanour during the interview did not indicate confusion or that she was upset. Her lies included answers about the frequency that the Appellant stayed with her – about Tristen falling down the stairs at Golden Grove (i.e. where she living on and just before 23 April), about force feeding Tristen and then him starting to eat by himself, to the effect that at some time on the morning of 23 April, Tristen was “fine” and that she had woken the Applicant that morning after Tristen began fitting.  
     
      
    59 A number of what Ms Eriksson said were lies, e.g. about force feeding Tristen, do not seem to have had any conceivable advantage to the Applicant and Ms Eriksson was unable to explain them. 
     
      
    60 One topic which figured in what Ms Eriksson had to say concerned Tristen falling on, off, or near a coffee table. In the ERISP of 23 April Ms Eriksson had said that Tristen had lifted himself up and stood up on the coffee table. In evidence she said that he had not and that the reason she had said that he had, was to explain a little graze on his eye. In her statement of 21 August she referred to an occasion when Tristen was on the lounge. She heard a cry and found Tristen on the carpet between a lounge and the coffee table but he neither had any marks or bruises that she saw nor did he complain of hurt. 
     
      
    61 It was not only to the police that Ms Eriksson gave versions of events from which she ultimately retreated. Ms Eriksson said that she had lied to the doctor who had seen Tristen on 15 April – when he was treated for a broken leg - and to the triage nurse on that occasion, although later she said that she had not lied and her telling them the Tristen had fallen down the stairs was simply repeating what she had been told. At one stage Ms Eriksson volunteered that she lied to everyone. 
     
      
    62 When interviewed by Dr Jacobe on the occasion of Tristen’s admission to hospital on 23 April, Ms Eriksson said that Tristen had fallen down stairs about 10 days previously. She also said that a number of days prior to admission, Tristen had climbed off a couch, stood on a table and fallen off, striking his head. To Dr Wilkins who spoke to her on a number of occasions she said that she knew of no incident that could have led to Tristen’s injuries except the fall down the stairs. She repeated the falling off a table and striking his head story to Dr Ryan. 
     
      
    63 In evidence in her own sentencing proceedings Ms Eriksson gave as her principal reasons for lying to the police previously that the Applicant had told her to do so, to protect him and because she was scared. In evidence in the Applicant’s proceedings she also gave the explanation that she was concerned also for herself in the sense that she feared she might be blamed. She said also that her feelings for the Applicant cooled some time after their arrest and while both were in custody awaiting trial. 
     
      
    64 The first of these reasons certainly provides a possible explanation for untruthfulness on the part of Ms Eriksson prior to the time at which her feelings for the Applicant cooled. However, Ms Eriksson could not explain why, although she had become cold in her relationship with the Applicant by December 2000, had been charged with murder and, according to her was innocent of it, she had not told the authorities of the Applicant’s conduct till August 2001. As an explanation for not telling the police Tristen’s injuries had been caused by the Applicant, the second reason, viz. that she feared she might be blamed, is not obviously persuasive  
     
      
    65 It may be inferred from paragraph 32 and 33 of Ireland AJ’s remarks on sentence that his Honour accepted some explanation along the lines of that advanced by Ms Eriksson. And although his Honour did not advert to this, a desire for consistency with earlier statements may explain Ms Eriksson’s failure to recant for some time after that cooling. However, these explanations do not account for any untruthfulness in Ms Eriksson’s ERISP of 21 August 2001, or her evidence in the sentencing proceedings of firstly herself and then the Applicant, and it is her statements and evidence on those occasions which I find of concern. 
     
      
    66 On the topic of Ms Eriksson’s credibility, it might be mentioned also that during the evidence she gave in her sentencing proceedings, Ms Eriksson said that while she was with Mr Hill she only had one or two drinks at any particular time while she was with him.  
     
      
    67 This evidence is to be compared with evidence contained in the statements of others, including Suzy Tavares and Kylie Quinn on whose statements Ireland AJ was disposed to rely. Ms Tavares said that on occasion which from her description was the day before Tristen’s leg was set, Ms Eriksson was drunk and said that she had been drinking for about 3 days straight. Ms Quinn also reported Ms Eriksson being drunk on that day. Another person whose statement was tendered, Belinda Moffatt, said that shortly after the Applicant moved in to live with Ms Eriksson at Ashfied, she saw Ms Eriksson drunk. She saw her drunk again on a Sunday night in late March. In his statement Dale Sanders said that on an occasion when he drove the Applicant and Ms Eriksson from Mt Druitt to Golden Grove Street, Darlington, Ms Eriksson had been drinking and was slurring her words a bit. Again Ireland AJ did not deal with the inconsistency. 
     
      
    68 At the times of the accounts she gave implicating the Applicant, Ms Eriksson clearly had no substantial interest in doing so. At the very least, her blaming the Applicant for Tristen’s injuries led to her receiving a much reduced sentence for manslaughter. But the inference is also available that it may well have contributed to the murder charge against her being dropped.  
     
      
    69 The fact that Ms Eriksson was on any view an accessory to Tristen’s death, the fact that she had much to gain by implicating the Applicant, and the fact that she had on many occasions prior to 21 August lied about the events, all required that her evidence implicating the Applicant be scrutinised with great care. It is to be inferred that Ireland AJ, an experienced sentencing judge knew this. Furthermore, his Honour expressly referred to the submissions of the Applicant’s then counsel directed to Ms Eriksson’s credibility.  
     
      
    70 And had Ms Eriksson’s credibility problems stopped at the time of her interview on 21 August or, possibly even just prior to her giving evidence, his Honour’s decision to accept what she had to say would have been unassailable. But I find his Honour’s conclusion in paragraph 34 of his remarks on sentence that “in making her statement of 21 August 2001, and in giving her evidence before me on 12 and 13 September 2001, Ms Eriksson was endeavouring to tell the truth to the best of her ability and recollection” impossible to reconcile with the inconsistency between her account of events on the morning of 23 April and the wealth of uncontradicted medical evidence which his Honour accepted to the effect that Tristen suffered further injury at that time.  
     
      
    71 Although there was other evidence strongly suggestive of violence on other occasions by the Applicant towards Tristen, any conclusion that he had inflicted the injury on or about 18 April depended on Ms Eriksson. In circumstances where it seems to me clear that Ms Eriksson was not being truthful before him on a very important issue, it does not seem to me that the sentencing judge was entitled to be persuaded beyond reasonable doubt by what she had to say.  
     
      
    72 I should acknowledge the advantage Ireland AJ had in seeing Ms Eriksson – an advantage denied to this Court. However, as was said in M v R (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494 in the context of an appeal court being asked to set aside the verdict of a jury who had seen the witnesses - 
     
      
       
        
        “If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    73 See also Fox v Percy (2003) 77 ALJR 989 at [20] et seq. 
     
      
    74 To some extent I reach more easily the conclusion that his Honour erred by reason of the fact that although his Honour referred to the written submissions of counsel who then appeared for the Applicant, submissions which do raise the topic on which I rely, nowhere in his Honour’s remarks on sentence does he advert to the apparent inconsistency or its consequences to the Ms Eriksson’s credibility. 
     
      
    75 My conclusion that Ms Eriksson’s credibility was so bad that his Honour was not entitled to be persuaded by her beyond reasonable doubt means that I need not pursue the question of whether, given the central importance of her evidence, his Honour was in error in not providing reasons for accepting it despite the matters to which I have referred. As to this obligation, see Beale v GIO of NSW (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 at 441 et seq. per Meagher JA.  
     
      
    76 I should add that in arriving at the conclusion I have, I have placed no weight whatsoever on the evidence of the Applicant. His Honour was not impressed by it and it certainly contains sufficient inconsistencies to preclude this Court forming any opinion that Ireland AJ was wrong when he said that he did not accept the Applicant as a witness of truth. 
     
      
    77 The conclusion at which I have arrived also means that his Honour should not have been satisfied to the requisite standard that the Applicant influenced Ms Eriksson not to seek medical treatment for Tristen. For all practical purposes, that finding depended exclusively on her evidence.  
     
      
       
      Parity 
      
    78 The principal argument for the Applicant on the topic of parity was principally based on successfully challenging Ireland AJ’s findings of the existence of an aggravating feature in causing most of the injuries, including brain injury, seen on post mortem.  
     
      
    79 However, there is another factor of significance. Leanne Eriksson suffers from an hereditary illness, Pigmental Retinal Dystrophy, the effect of which is that she already suffers from tunnel vision and night blindness and which will cause her to lose her sight. During her own sentencing proceedings she told Ireland AJ that this was likely to occur by the time she is 30. His Honour seemed to accept an expert opinion by a professor of ophthalmology to like effect. The impact on a person so afflicted of a period of custody is calculated to be substantially greater than on a person who can expect a reasonably normal healthy lifespan. For my part it is quite sufficient to account for much of the difference between Ireland AJ’s starting points of 6 years in the case of Ms Eriksson and 9 years in the case of the Applicant. The discount which Ms Eriksson obtained for assistance to the authorities is not, of course, something the Applicant is entitled to.  
     
      
    80 There were differences in their subjective circumstances. Both had had difficulties in their upbringing and both were considered likely to serve their sentences, wholly or partly in protective custody. However, his Honour seems to have regarded Ms Eriksson as exhibiting appreciably more remorse than did the Applicant of whom Ireland AJ said “There has been no expression of contrition or remorse other than in the bare plea itself.” Ms Eriksson’s criminal history consisted of 2 counts of shoplifting which Ireland AJ regarded as of no significance. The Applicant’s antecedents were more substantial although apart from 2 charges of assault, most were for offences of dishonesty and I would not regard these of present significance. 
     
      
    81 On the other hand, there can be no doubt that in arriving at his starting point of 9 years – then reduced to 8 years on account of the Applicant’s plea – Ireland AJ regarded the Applicant’s causing of the initial injury to Tristen, and dissuading Ms Eriksson from seeking medical attention as “circumstances of the gravest aggravation”. Thus the sentence imposed reflected this finding and it is an inevitable inference that, without it, the sentence imposed would have been less. 
     
      
    82 Of course, before this Court interferes, it must be of the opinion that, within s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act “Some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. I am of that view – c.f. R v Wilkinson [1999] NSWCCA 248. Although the Applicant does not have the eye problems which Ms Eriksson has, neither was he Tristen’s parent. In these circumstances, and partly influenced by considerations of parity despite the differences between the offenders, the orders I would make are these:- 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Allow the appeal against sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Quash the sentence imposed on the Applicant by Ireland AJ on 2 November 2001. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for 6 years, including a non-parole period of 4½ years, both such periods to commence on 25 May 2002 
        
       
      
    83 HIDDEN J: Undoubtedly, in reviewing the findings of fact in the present case, due deference must be afforded to the advantage enjoyed by this experienced sentencing judge in having seen and heard the principal witnesses. Nevertheless, for the reasons identified by Hulme J, I am left with a grave sense of unease about his Honour’s findings adverse to the applicant. Given that they were findings in aggravation of sentence, as to which the Crown bore the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, I am satisfied that they cannot be sustained.  
     
      
    84 I agree with the orders proposed by Hulme J and with his Honour’s reasons.  
     
      
    85 THE COURT: On 28 November 2003 the Court corrected the order herein by substituting 25 May 2000 as the commencing date of the Applicant’s imprisonment and non-parole periods.

      11437/00 - IN THE MATTER OF THE PROPERTY OF ROBERT BRADLEY MAHONEY, APPLICANT and IN THE MATTER OF THE CRIMINAL ASSETS RECOVERY ACT, THE NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION, RESPONDENT  
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
     
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Before the Court are proceedings under the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. Otherwise unreferenced sections pertain to that Act. On 2 June 2000 Robert Bradley Mahoney (the applicant) was arrested and charged with offences including offences referrable to a quantity of 476.7 grams of methylamphetamine. On 8 June 2000 the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) obtained from this Court a restraining order pursuant to s10 in respect of the property of the applicant. On that date the Commission sought an assets forfeiture order pursuant to s22 and a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s27.  
     
      
    2 On 9 April 2001 an assets forfeiture order was made in respect of property scheduled as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        PART ONE 
        
       
       
        
        The whole of the property comprising of Lot 110 in the Deposited Plan 755260 at Browns Road, Blackhill, New South Wales, registered in the names of Sandra Dawn Maree Beldham and Robert Bradley Mahoney, as joint tenants. 
        
       
       
        
        PART TWO 
        
       
       
        
        1. The whole of the property comprising Lot 8 of Section E in the Deposited Plan 16054, also known as 27 Elizabeth Street, Cardiff South, New South Wales, registered in the names of Robert Bradley Mahoney and Sandra Dawn Maree Beldham, as joint tenants. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Funds held in bank account number 732-512-53-4210 being account in the name of Robert Bradley Mahoney at the Cardiff branch of Westpac Banking Corporation. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Funds held in bank account number 958 768 being investment account in the name of Robert Bradley Mahoney at Newcastle Permanent Building Society Limited. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Funds held in bank account number 016.65.82171/5 being investment account in the name of Mr R. Mahoney at Greater Building Society Limited. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Cash in the sum of $14,505 located by members of the New South Wales Police Service on the front passenger seat of motor vehicle registration TES-884 and handed to Police by Robert Bradley Mahoney on 18 November 1999 following a random breath test at the intersection of Pacific Highway and Redleaf Avenue, Warrawee, New South Wales. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Cash in the sum of $2,450 located by members of the New South Wales Police Service in the wallet of Robert Bradley Mahoney on 21 January 2000 following a search of his person. 
        
       
       
        
        7. 1991 Chevrolet Corvette US coupe registration number RAW-068 registered in the name of Robert Mahoney. 
        
       
       
        
        8. 1991 Harley Davidson model FXDB motorcycle registration number XDJ62 registered in the name of Robert Mahoney. 
        
       
       
        
        PART THREE 
        
       
       
        
        Cash in the sum of $4,800 located by members of the New South Wales Police in the execution of a search warrant at 27 Elizabeth Street, Cardiff South on 20 July 2000.” 
        
       
      
    3 The reasons for the divisions in the schedule are stated in the orders and need not be repeated. I will refer to the firstmentioned realty as “the Blackhill property” or “Blackhill”, the second as “the Cardiff property” and the other items in accordance with their respective descriptions.  
     
      
    4 On 25 October 2002 the Public Trustee, in whose name a new Certificate of Title had been issued in respect of Blackhill was, by further order of this Court, restrained on an interlocutory basis from selling that property. 
     
      
    5 On 7 March 2003 the applicant was convicted of supplying more than a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine.  
     
      
       
      THE LITIGATION 
       
      
    6 By motion the applicant seeks that the order restraining the sale of Blackhill be continued and/or made permanent and that the assets forfeiture order be set aside. The latter was abandoned at the hearing and the former adjourned to await the outcome of the matters next to be mentioned. By separate motion, the applicant seeks that the whole of the property scheduled be excluded from the restraining order pursuant to s25 and that a proportion of it be excluded from the forfeiture order pursuant to s26. During the hearing it appeared to me that exclusion from forfeiture as well was sought under s25 but as, at the conclusion, counsel stated that he was not instructed “to withdraw the claim for s25 relief” but that he would “say no more about it”, it suffices to record the observation. If it became relevant I would be prepared to extend the scope of the prayer to encompass s25 relief. 
     
      
    7 Sandra Dawn Maree Beldham, the applicant’s mother who was joint registered proprietor on the title of both Blackhill and the Cardiff property also seeks exclusion of her interests in those properties from the forfeiture orders.  
     
      
    8 The Commission pursues its claim for a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s27.  
     
      
    9 By consent, save the adjourned injunction issue, the hearings, that is to say the exclusion applications and proceeds assessment proceeded concurrently on the basis that I would make findings and defer the making of consequential orders until after publication of reasons and an opportunity to make further submissions, if that became appropriate. 
     
      
       
      AIM OF THE ACT 
       
      
    10 Section 3(a) specifies a principal object of the Act to provide for the confiscation without requiring a conviction of the property of a person who has, as a matter of probability, engaged in serious crime related acts as defined in s6. In parlance which counsel noted as having developed, property is forfeited unless it is shown to be “clean sourced”. Section 5 specifies that proceedings are civil as distinct from criminal and it is clear from the provisions in ss5 and 26 that the onus of proof rests upon an applicant for exclusion.  
     
      
       
      THE APPLICANT’S FINANCES 
       
      
    11 The applicant was born on 9 October 1962. From 15 December 1981 he worked at a brewery in Newcastle. He ceased that employment on 14 August 1987. Since that date he has largely been in receipt of social security benefits of one type or another. His only other assertions of earning nominated some months as a storeman in a factory at Brookvale, a few months in the Northern Territory, some rent when he was not occupying Blackhill and a sum of $5,000 from his girlfriend Denise Lewin, since deceased, for copying pornographic videos which she marketed through advertisement in magazines. He claimed that he had funds available as a result of gifts from family members and Miss Lewin and also from successful gambling. Whatever was available as nett from rental was, according to the applicant, spent on the purchase of the now missing Chevrolet Corvette. 
     
      
    12 Admitted facts include a table of taxable income returned to the Australian Tax Office between 1994 and 1998 consistent with the income of a social security recipient. Returns for 1999 and 2000 have not been lodged and there has been a waiver of requirement in respect of one year. The exception to the pattern is the year ending June 1995, but it is plain from the return that about two-thirds of the “income” is in fact the inclusion of a taxable termination payment.  
     
      
    13 The various funds and cash amounts and their claimed sources will be examined in relation to the express applications.  
     
      
       
      PROCEEDS ASSESSMENT 
       
      
    14 It is mandatory for the Court to make a proceeds assessment order where the person against whom the order is sought was engaged in serious crime related activity of a specified kind not more than six years before a determined date, relevantly in this case, 8 June 2000 (s27(2)). An order requires such a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed as proceeds derived from illegal activity during that six year span (s27(1)). The illegal activity in respect of which the proceeds are assessed does not have to be serious crime related activity as specified in s27(2).  
     
      
    15 The conviction of the appellant has already been noted. No submission was made on his behalf suggesting that the evidence did not demonstrate his probable engagement in serious crime related activity within the meaning of the provision. 
     
      
    16 Section 28 facilitates methods of assessment. Attention was directed to: 
     
      
       
        
        “28.  
        Assessment of proceeds of serious crime related activity 
         
          
          (1) For the purpose of making an assessment under section 27 in relation to an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of a person (in this section called  
          the defendant 
          ) the Supreme Court is to have regard to the following matters: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the money, or the value of any interest in property other than money, directly or indirectly acquired by: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
        
       
       (i) the defendant, or 
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              (ii) another person at the request, or by the direction, of the defendant, 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
        
       
       because of the illegal activity or activities, 
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) the value of any service, benefit or advantage provided for: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
       (i) the defendant, or 
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              (ii) another person at the request, or by the direction, of the defendant, 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
       because of the illegal activity or activities, 
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (c) the market value, at the time of the illegal activity or of each illegal activity, of a plant or drug similar, or substantially similar, to any involved in the illegal activity or each illegal activity, and the amount that was, or the range of amounts that were, ordinarily paid for an act similar, or substantially similar, to the illegal activity or each illegal activity. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
        
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (d) the value of the defendant’s property before and after the illegal activity or each illegal activity, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (e) the defendant’s income and expenditure before and after the illegal activity or activities. “ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “(3) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order of the amount of the defendant’s expenditure during the period of 6 years before the making of the application for the order, the Supreme Court is to treat any such amount as proceeds derived by the defendant from an illegal activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the expenditure was funded from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities.” 
          
         
          
        
       
      
    17 Mr Temby QC for the Commission contended that, in the present case, the subsections of 28(1) other than subsection (a) were of little or no significance. He drew attention to the “broad brush” approach recognized as inevitable having regard to the rarity of those involved in criminal activity keeping books of account or similar documentation: New South Wales Crime Commission v Crotty [1999] NSWSC 146. I adopt such an approach.  
     
      
    18 He then detailed evidenced facts from which he submitted that the cost of drugs obtained and/or used by the applicant could be calculated. Such expenditure could not be sourced from income or money unrelated to illegal activity and hence the derivative amount should be treated as proceeds from illegal activity as contemplated by s28(3). 
     
      
    19 Mr Lovas of counsel, for the applicant, submitted that the method contended by the Commission failed to “permit a reasonable and definite inference” as to the sums claimed. He pointed to the absence of direct quantification of expenditure by the applicant on drugs. This absence must be qualified by some evidence that the applicant spent about $500 for a quarter of an ounce or seven grams of drug on one occasion. Of course, the applicant admitted other acquisitions including the nearly half kilo of methylamphetamine at the time of his arrest but he gave no other evidence of expenditure and indeed claimed that he acquired drugs on credit but then defaulted on payment. The half kilo, he maintained, was a retaliatory confiscation which I will later describe. 
     
      
    20 The level submitted for proof of inference to a reasonable and definite standard was derived from a judgment of Sackville J in Australian Consumer & Competition Commission v Amcor Printing and Papers Group Limited 2000 169 ALR 344, where his Honour was dealing with recovery of civil penalty pursuant to the Trade Practices Act (Commonwealth). Mr Lovas noted that the civil standard of proof was to be applied and submitted that the specification in s5 abovementioned permitted analogy with the Trade Practices case. Sackville J had written: 
     
      
       
        
        “…… in determining in what inferences should be drawn from the primary facts, it is necessary to have regard to the seriousness of the allegations ….. and the gravity of the consequences of adverse finding …….” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour referred to Briginshaw v Briginshaw 1938 60 CLR 336 and other authorities. 
     
      
    22 It was submitted that, for the purposes of construction, the Criminal Assets Recovery Act should be classified as a revenue statute. It is not a revenue statute in the conventional sense but, as it authorizes the expropriation by the State of the property of those who have engaged in serious crime related activity, I consider that the classification is apt. The circumstance that those whose property is liable to be expropriated might be considered undeserving is not a basis for finding otherwise. The consequence of that approach to statute and Sackville J’s dictum is that inferences against the applicant should not be drawn if there exist on the evidence, other inferences which are at least as likely as those contended for by the Commission. 
     
      
    23 Mr Lovas, however, developed his argument by reference to s28(1). As mentioned, Mr Temby QC had submitted that essentially s28(1)(a) was of present relevance. Mr Lovas contended that in considering the making of a proceeds assessment, the Court was obliged to have regard to all of the matters articulated in subsections (a) to (e) inclusive. He pointed to what he claimed was a prominent deficiency in that there was no evidence of the value of the applicant’s property before and after the illegal activity in the terms contemplated by s28(1)(d) and that, in its absence, the Court could not properly draw inferences so as to assess the value of proceeds derived from illegal activity. The requirement to have regard to all of the elements in the subsections of s28(1) was submitted to be a minimum requirement which would not conflict with any authority postulating a necessarily “broad brush” approach. 
     
      
    24 I do not construe s28(1) as obliging consideration, and therefore the tender of evidence enabling such consideration, all of the matters in the respective subsections. It is of interest to note the expression that the court “is to have regard” to the matters mentioned, in contrast with other expressions in the Act, for example in s22 where the court “must make an assets forfeiture order” and “must” make such an order to apply to specified interests in property. Similarly s27(2) provides that the court “must make a proceeds assessment order” upon relevant findings. The task of the court has been legislated by s27 whereas s28 is a facultative provision. Particularly s27(2) and s27(3) provide methods of calculating what will in effect be deemed to be the proceeds derived from illegal activity even though it is obvious that the results of authorized calculations do not derive from precise investigation and calculation of actual proceeds in the sense of an accountant’s audit. 
     
      
    25 I reject the construction argued for by Mr Lovas. The elements mentioned in s28(1) are scheduled in respect of an exercise, the purpose of which is to make an assessment under s27. It cannot have been the legislative intention that every one of the elements must be the subject of regard in order to make such an assessment. That this is so is plain, for example, by observing the terms of s28(1)(c) and that not every serious crime related activity involves plants or drugs. Nor is it necessary to have evidence of the elements mentioned in subsections (d) and (e) in order to determine an amount authorized to be treated as proceeds of illegal activity pursuant to s28(3). 
     
      
       
      THE CALCULATION OF PROCEEDS 
       
      
    26 I propose to adopt an approach to calculation in accordance with s28(3) and to determine the amount of the applicant’s expenditure over the six year span, noting that I should make a deduction if part of the expenditure was funded by “clean sourced” money. Such an approach is generally in accord with the submission on behalf of the Commission. Mr Lovas, subject to the contentions previously dealt with, did not contest the availability of the method but submitted that the Commission bore an onus to exclude “all other income forms from this theory that his purchase of drugs was funded by the source of illegally acquired funds”, that the Commission’s contentions were speculation rather than reasoning and that its case was not made out. I have already indicated the standard of proof that I would apply. 
     
      
    27 For this purpose I am satisfied that the applicant spent considerable sums of money on the purchase of drugs to feed his desire for them. Such sums were not available from his social security income or from supplements from his mother and grandmother, his girlfriend or gambling. The extent of his “clean sourced” money was necessary to provide for the ordinary costs of living. That view is somewhat confirmed by the posture of the applicant which was, not that he had “clean sourced” money to buy drugs but that he had obtained drugs on credit and defaulted on payment. He agreed in cross examination that the money owed must have been many tens of thousands of dollars but benevolent drug suppliers kept supplying him on credit. The only repercussion of which he testified was that “a few people threatened me”. I do not accept the evidence that the applicant did not pay for drugs and I am satisfied that the probability is that he paid for them at a rate of something in the order of $70 to $80 per gram, a rate which he conceded he was aware of. His ability to pay was not able to be funded from sources other than illegal activity. The probability is that the applicant was, in a not untypical fashion, able to purchase drugs for himself out of the profits of trading in illicit substances with others. In any event, the money needed for drug purchase exceeded any income disclosed to revenue authority. Property acquired by the use of funds which are available by reason of a taxation offence such as understating income is itself deemed to come from illegal activity: DPP v Jeffrey 1992 58 A Crim R 310. That the applicant was a likely trader is supported by the quantity of nearly half a kilogram of methylamphetamine in his possession at the time of his arrest. It is convenient to record at this point that I reject the applicant’s story that he acquired that large quantity of drug as a serendipitous by-product of robbing a Mr Andrews in retaliation for stealing the applicant’s dog. The likely weight and consequence of the applicant’s being contradicted at trial about the date of this claimed encounter by evidence of Mr Andrew’s death previous to the acquisition of the half kilo of drug by him was explored and I do not accept the applicant’s proposition that he just “got the date wrong”. Counsel’s description of the applicant’s story as “cock and bull” was accurate.  
     
      
    28 I am conscious that the applicant has on occasions purported to admit, and on other occasions recanted, that he was the manufacturer of drug. Nor do I ignore the accoutrements in his possession at the time of arrest including an apparently downloaded hard copy of Uncle Fester’s Secrets of Methylamphetamine Manufacture, 4th Edition. At the hearing the applicant adhered to the “stolen from Mr Andrews” story and the probabilities are in my view against manufacture which, paradoxically, might on this methodology be of advantage to the applicant. The other alternative is possession of the drug in the course of trading or intended trading and I am satisfied to the appropriate degree that this was the case. 
     
      
    29 When interviewed by Dr Westmore the applicant acknowledged the consumption of five to six grams per day. At this hearing he conceded three to four grams per day. Over a period of about three years from the time of Ms Lewin’s suicide until his arrest the applicant said that he had been a heavy user for a period of “probably ten months out of the three years”. He said he was not on drugs for the whole of the three years but, obviously, in the balance of time outside of ten months, to the extent that he used drugs, it could be assessed as less than heavy use. 
     
      
    30 The mid point of the market cost recognized by the applicant is $75 per gram. Ten months of heavy usage might be formulated as three hundred daily usages of five grams (the lower figure of the range admitted to Dr Westmore) at $75 per gram. The requisite expenditure amounts to $112,500. If one were to deduct from the twenty six months remainder of the three years, two months of abstinence and then postulate a daily use at the rate of five grams for two days of each week, and further abstinence on the other five days, an expenditure requirement of 2 x 104 (weeks) x 5 x 75 = $78,000 is calculable. The applicant admitted in cross examination that he had heard that the “going rate” for half a kilogram for methylamphetamine was between $10,000 and $15,000. He did not turn his mind to variations on account of relative purity. 
     
      
    31 Thus can be formulated an expenditure well within the six year span on drugs of $112,500 during the “heavy” period, $78,000 for the “lighter” periods and, say, $10,000 to acquire the half kilogram seized at the time of arrest, a total of $200,500. 
     
      
    32 That total figure represents a bare minimum and, given that circumstance, I consider it reasonable and I draw a definite inference that it represents an amount to be treated as proceeds derived from illegal activity in accordance with an application of s28(3). It is not necessary for me to determine, as submitted on behalf of the applicant, that the onus of proving against the exception in the provision lies upon the Commission. My view is that the onus does not so lie, but determination is unnecessary because I am abundantly satisfied that the relevant expenditure as above calculated was not funded from sources unrelated to illegal activity.  
     
      
       
      EXCLUSION 
       
      
    33 Exclusion of property from the assets forfeiture order already made, in whole or in part, is facilitated by s25 and s26. As both sections make clear, and it is not in contest, the onus of proof that interest in property has not been illegally acquired or is not attributable to the proceeds of illegal activity lies on the applicant for exclusion. Mr Lovas submitted that no gloss on the civil standard of proof such as might be discernible in cases such as Briginshaw would be applicable and I approach the issues in accordance with that submission. 
     
      
       
      BLACKHILL 
       
      
    34 Blackhill was purchased in April 1995 in the names of the applicant, his mother and Denise Lewin as joint tenants. In January 1997 Ms Lewin transferred her title to the others. She died on 9 May of that year. In an affidavit sworn 27 May 2002 (Exhibit B) the applicant sourced the purchase price of $125,000 as the sale of a Harley Davidson motorcycle for approximately $20,000, a superannuation rollover at the GIO of $39,000 and $30,000 to $40,000 from Ms Lewin. 
     
      
    35 At the hearing he verified a statement (Exhibit A) in which he identified the purchase money as deriving from seven elements, namely: 
     
      
       
      (a) $10,000 State Bank cheque; 
       
      (b) $2,500 State Bank cheque; 
       
      (c) $500 cash; 
       
      (d) $39,500 GIO rollover; 
       
      (e) $47,700 from Newcastle Permanent Building Society; 
       
      (f) $11,000 State Bank cheque, and 
       
      (g) $16,074 Westpac Bank cheque. 
       
      
    36 The cheques totalling $12,500 in (a) and (b) were claimed to be derived from long term savings whilst working at the Bond Brewery. Confirmatory records are not available, however, in a claim for Jobsearch allowance lodged in May 1993 (Exhibit 10) the applicant represented that his credit in the State Bank was $116.76. No other State Bank account has been disclosed. I am not satisfied that the applicant had “long term savings” to source these amounts. 
     
      
    37 The applicant makes no assertion concerning the source of $500 cash mentioned in (c). 
     
      
    38 The Commission does not dispute that $39,500 ((d) above) contributing to the purchase of Blackhill came from the lawful source of superannuation funds following the applicant’s termination of employment at the brewery. The applicant is entitled to relief in this respect pursuant to s26. 
     
      
    39 The next sum of $47,700 taken from the Newcastle Permanent Building Society ((e) above) is itself said to have been derived from components, namely: 
     
      
       
      (i) $16,000 long term savings; 
       
      (ii) $18,000 consisting of two $9,000 deposits made on 17 March 1994, themselves part of $37,010 given to the applicant by Denise Lewin; 
       
      (iii) $10,000 given to the applicant by David Beldham his stepfather on 22 November 1994;  
       
      (iv) $2,000 deposited on 25 November 1994 also given by David Beldham, and 
       
      (v) $7,000 deposited on 20 February 1995 received out of the proceeds of sale of Harley Davidson YOO-56. 
       
      
    40 In regard to (i) above the applicant points to some records of the Building Society (Exhibit D) which show that in June 1993 there was a credit of nearly $16,000 to which interest was added. This credit is broadly consistent with a representation made by the applicant in the Jobsearch form (Exhibit 10). It is submitted that this longstanding account is corroborative of the applicant’s testimony that he had kept these savings and lived frugally in the sense that his mother fed him and she and others gave him money when he needed it. The Commission argues that this claim is dependent on the credibility of the applicant which has, in instance after instance, been undermined by material which is independent of him. Between 1991 and 1993 the applicant had made multiple purchases of motorcycles and motor vehicles and funds for these transactions had to come from somewhere. They could not be sourced from employment as the applicant had worked only for a total of about ten months between August 1987 and June 2000.  
     
      
    41 I do have significant reservations about the credibility of the applicant. I have already mentioned and will later mention instances where his assertions have been disproved by objective material. The impression I formed was that he was determined to see this matter to conclusion in the hope of favourable outcome, and, when he could not explain something, he would figuratively “shrug his shoulders”. In similar vein were his protestations of ignorance about the reporting of cash transactions exceeding $10,000. On one occasion he said it was a member of building society staff who suggested division into lesser amounts, but there are several instances of his conduct of this type. To the contrary of his evidence in these proceedings, I note that he had agreed in examination before a registrar that he knew that there was “some law that would cut in at $10,000” and that he wanted to evade it (transcript attached to Exhibit B at page 76). 
     
      
    42 The applicant bears the onus of proving that money is, in effect, “clean sourced”. The obvious inconsistency between his assertions in Exhibits A and B does not assist him and I find his explanation of the need for documentation and/or time for reflection, less than convincing. I have taken into account that the applicant may have some skills as a trader, particularly in Harley Davidson motorcycles but in my ultimate consideration the applicant fails to achieve the necessary persuasion on this item. 
     
      
    43 The next component is $18,000 described in (ii). The applicant said that the source was Ms Lewin and he points to two deposits of $9,000 both made on 17 March 1994. I have mentioned the alleged advice from the staff member of a financial institution. Even if such advice had been given, what the applicant did was to go to two different branches on the one day to make these deposits and his testimony that he did this to achieve some saving of time was quite implausible as were his assertions of large cash amounts emanating from Ms Lewin, who herself had no perceptible means of producing such amounts from legitimate sources. In the absence of any documentation at all I do not accept the arithmetical extrapolations submitted to be relevant to her pornographic video sales. In mentioning this I am not categorizing her activity in pornography and/or prostitution as illegal but I am not persuaded that such activity produced the substantial cash claimed by the applicant to have become available to him from her. I observe that the applicant asserted that Ms Lewin at one stage “dumped him” for another man but felt guilty about it, as a result of which she forewent any payment for yielding up her interest in Blackhill. Despite these circumstances she is later alleged to have given him large sums of money including an amount of about $27,000 a few days before she suicided. I find the applicant’s chronicle quite incredible. An order for exclusion of the component of $18,000 will not be made. 
     
      
    44 Items (iii) and (iv) are said to be gifts from the applicant’s stepfather. Mr Beldham was not called and no explanation for his absence was tendered. It was made clear that the Commission would, if neither witness nor explanation was forthcoming, contend that I should draw an inference that his evidence would not assist the applicant. I do draw that inference. I am not told of Mr Beldham’s occupation or anything else about any ability of his to give “clean sourced” money to his stepson. The circumstance, which I accept, that Mrs Beldham saw him write cheques tells me nothing about the sources of money against which the cheque would have been drawn. This aspect of the application must also fail. 
     
      
    45 The final component (v) is claimed to be part of the proceeds of the sale of Harley Davidson YOO-56. The Commission notes that this is one of sums of $7,000 deposited to each of three accounts on 20 February 1995. I have already commented on this style of activity. The Commission submits that the applicant’s evidence that he sold the cycle to a man in Queensland is dependent entirely upon the applicant’s word. It is an assertion which he has raised only recently. However, there are some RTA records (Exhibit D, tab 22) from which it can be discerned that the applicant was the owner of the cycle for less than a year. I am invited to infer that it probably remained under a current warranty and I accept that probability. The documentation further shows that registration in New South Wales did not simply run out but it was terminated about a week before the applicant made the relevant deposits. I am satisfied of the probability of sale. An interstate purchaser would be unlikely to, and in fact should not, re-register in this State.  
     
      
    46 I am conscious of the submissions by the Commission about tracing sources but the evidence does not enable me to make a sensible analysis of all of the applicant’s motor and motorcycle trading. This parcel of money probably came from sale of this machine and an exclusion order should be made to reflect this. 
     
      
    47 The next element of contribution to the purchase price was a State Bank cheque for $11,000 (item (f)). This is claimed to be made up of a gift from Ms Lewin and one of the $7,000 deposits from the proceeds of the sale of YOO-56. I need not repeat my reasons for rejecting the proposition that money from Ms Lewin (if that be the case) has not been shown to be “clean sourced” nor, on the other hand, my reasons for concluding that the applicant should have an exclusion order in respect of $7,000 proceeds from the sale of the motorcycle. 
     
      
    48 The final element of $16,074 Westpac Bank cheque (item (g)) is similarly claimed to be made up from gift of Ms Lewin and the sale of motorcycle YOO-56. Again I reject the claim for relief except to the extent of $7,000 derived from the sale.  
     
      
    49 In summary, including the matter not contested by the Commission, the applicant should have appropriate partial relief pursuant to s26 to the extent of the respective sums of $39,500 and $21,000 (3 x $7,000) but not otherwise.  
     
      
       
      BLACKHILL – THE CLAIM BY MRS BELDHAM 
       
      
    50 Mrs Beldham made no financial contribution towards the purchase of the property. She later assisted with minor improvements and maintenance. 
     
      
    51 It is submitted on her behalf that she had no reason to conclude that the property was in effect tainted. In order to succeed Mrs Beldham must bring her position within the terms of s9(5)(a), namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “9 (5) An interest in property ceases to be serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property: 
        
       
        
       
        
         
          
          (a) when it is acquired by a person for sufficient consideration without knowing, and in circumstances that would not arouse a reasonable suspicion, that the interest was, at the time of acquisition, serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property,……” 
          
         
        
       
      
    52 Mr Lovas argued that the phrase “sufficient consideration” should be construed in accordance with the general law of contract and he contended that, for example, a peppercorn would suffice. In my view if such, or merely nominal, consideration were contemplated by the legislature, the description “sufficient” would be surplus. As a matter of construction I am of opinion that it must be given meaning and, in context, this should be a sense of adequacy and reality, that is to say, something more than nominal.  
     
      
    53 Mrs Beldham gave no consideration for her interest, indeed it was explained that she was “put on the title” to secure inheritance should fatality overtake the applicant. Mrs Beldham’s application should be dismissed.  
     
      
       
      THE CARDIFF PROPERTY 
       
      
    54 This property was purchased for $104,000 in 1998 and title was recorded in the names of the applicant and his mother. The applicant specified the makeup of the elements of the purchase price as coming from the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) $500 in cash; 
       
      (b) $9,900 withdrawn from Newcastle Permanent Building Society on 1 April 1998; 
      
     (c) $2,530 
     
      
      (d) $75,625 withdrawn from Newcastle Permanent Building Society on 10 June 1998, and 
       
      (e) $19,384 borrowed from Newcastle Permanent Building Society. 
       
      
    55 The applicant offers no explanation for the source of the sums of $500 and $2,530 ((a) and (c)) and no relief in respect thereof should be granted.  
     
      
    56 There is an unusual aspect to the loan (item (e)) from the Building Society. The applicant conceded in cross examination that he “told lies to get the loan”. He had in filling out the necessary forms asserted that he had been unemployed for one year (as at March 1998) but immediately before that claimed to have been employed for two and half years as a plumber’s assistant. The minimal employment in fact engaged in by the applicant since 1987 has been mentioned. The Commission argues that the amount of loan ($19,384) was therefore obtained by the applicant pursuant to a false statement contrary to s178BB of the Crimes Act and it was not “lawfully obtained funds towards the purchase of the property”. Mr Lovas argues that the funds towards the purchase actually came from a “clean source” (the lender) and that the Commission could conceivably attack amounts used to repay the loan by way of a proceeds assessment order but could not contend that this elemental contribution to the purchase price was tainted.  
     
      
    57 The issue is whether the applicant has proved that a specified proportion of the value of his interest was not attributable to an illegal activity. Illegal activity in this context is not limited to defined serious crime related activity. Thus, if the applicant’s approach to the lender was not corrupted by false representation, I apprehend that he would be entitled to exclusion but, as I find that it was, the consequence must be otherwise. The applicant has not shown that his interest represented by this contribution to the purchase price was not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity. 
     
      
    58 The sums of $9,900 and $75,625 (items (b) and (d)) were claimed by the applicant to have been sourced as follows: 
     
      
      (i) $40,000 from the sale of Land Cruiser TW 232; 
       
      (ii) $9,250 from the sale of a boat; 
       
      (iii) $10,000 deposited on 26 February 1998 received from David Beldham; 
       
      (iv) $8,000 deposited on 27 February 1998; 
       
      (v) $8,000 deposited on 28 February 1998, and 
       
      (vi) $10,275 the source of which is no longer recalled. 
       
      
    59 The sale of the Land Cruiser ((i)) followed its acquisition from sale of other vehicles and the significant sum of $23,500 is sourced by the applicant to Ms Lewin. According to him, ten days before she died she gave him $27,000 in cash “to mind” and after her death he used about $1,000 to travel to New Zealand for the funeral and kept the balance for himself. I have already commented on absence of credible evidence of how Ms Lewin might come by large cash sums lawfully in the first place. I note that she had in fact served imprisonment for an offence of drug supply. I do not consider it material if “deeming” provisions of drug offence legislation happened to have been applicable. I have already mentioned obscurity surrounding the applicant’s vehicle trading. I am not satisfied that this amount has been shown to be “clean sourced”. 
     
      
    60 The applicant stated in the witness box that he would produce a picture of the boat (item (ii)). He recognized that this would not demonstrate anything about how he obtained it. In any event, no picture was produced nor was any documentation about such a craft. The applicant has not discharged his onus in regard to this claim. 
     
      
    61 A further $10,000 (item (iii)) is claimed to have come from the applicant’s stepfather. That mere circumstance does not, for the reasons given in respect of similar advances, demonstrate that it is not attributable to the proceeds of illegal activity.  
     
      
    62 Examination of the deposits of $8,000 on succeeding days items (iv) and (v)) provided telling evidence to confirm my poor opinion of the applicant’s credit. The applicant refers to deposits in February 1998 which necessarily preceded completion of the purchase in June 1998. There is evidence which I accept, of an acknowledgment of purchase by one Peter Brown specifying the sale date of the relevant motorcycle as 6 November 1998 and in addition to this, RTA documentation showing transfer to Mr Brown some days later. The applicant’s claims are rejected. 
     
      
    63 No submission was made by the applicant with reference to the unexplained fund item (vi) of $10,275. 
     
      
    64 The applicant is entitled to no order in respect of the Cardiff property. 
     
      
       
      CARDIFF PROPERTY – THE CLAIM BY MRS BELDHAM 
       
      
    65 Mrs Beldham did not make any financial contribution towards the purchase of the Cardiff property. She later purchased concrete for a driveway and painting and decorating materials which the applicant used to renovate the house. 
     
      
    66 As with the Blackhill property it is necessary for Mrs Beldham to bring her situation within the terms of s9(5)(a). The evidence does not enable her so to do and her claim should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      CREDIT BALANCES – WESTPAC, NEWCASTLE PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY, GREATER BUILDING SOCIETY 
       
      
    67 It is convenient to deal with these items in the schedule together. Credits in accounts were forfeited in the sums of $1,504.12 (Westpac); $747.93 (Newcastle Permanent Building Society) and $588 (Greater Building Society). The applicant sourced these in that order as coming from Centrelink payments, rental income (Blackhill was let for a period) and the sale of a Holden car. The Commission did not make contesting submissions about these amounts and the applicant is entitled to appropriate orders for relief. 
     
      
       
      CASH SEIZED ON 18 NOVEMBER 1999 
       
      
    68 The applicant was stopped while driving a vehicle on the Pacific Highway at Warrawee for the purpose of random breath testing. $14,505 cash was located on the front passenger’s seat. This amount was seized. The seizure preceded the applicant being arrested and charged with the drug offence in respect of which I have mentioned his conviction by some six months.  
     
      
    69 By reference to his affidavit (Exhibit B) the applicant stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “This money consisted of approximately $3,000 from a bank account withdrawal and the sum of $3,000 was the proceeds of gambling on roulette at the Western Suburbs Leagues Club. The sum of $8,500 came from the sale of my girlfriend’s Harley Davidson Sportster motorcycle on 22 January 2000. I intended to use the money to come to Sydney and purchase another motorcycle.” 
        
       
      
    70 Such a bank account was unidentified and I cannot link this amount to any record in the evidence. My estimate of the applicant’s credit does not lead to my acceptance of the probability of winnings amounting to $3,000 on the stated gambling. As deposed, the sale of the particular motorcycle took place on 22 January 2000. The seizure of cash took place on 18 November 1999. The applicant, when confronted with the impossibility of that to which he had deposed, suggested that some error had been made but offered nothing to alleviate the vagueness of that response. No exclusion should be made in respect of this. 
     
      
       
      $2,450 
       
      
    71 This sum was seized on 21 January 2000 in the course of a personal search of the applicant. His explanation is that it was a gift from his stepfather in order to enable him to go on holiday and for detoxification treatment. Mrs Beldham corroborated the payment but, as noted, Mr Beldham did not give any evidence. The applicant gave no evidence of any intended destination or any arrangements or cancellation of them or what effect the seizure had in terms of what he then did. If indeed police had taken money from the applicant which his stepfather had given him to enable him to undergo treatment for drug addiction I would have expected some protest from Mr Beldham. There was no evidence of his having made any protest nor did he come forward to make one now. The applicant’s claim should be rejected.  
     
      
       
       
      CHEVROLET CORVETTE 
       
      
    72 It is common ground that the whereabouts of this vehicle is unknown as it has apparently been stolen. 
     
      
    73 In the statement (Exhibit A) the applicant described his purchase funding as $10,020 borrowing from Greater Building Society, $23,500 essentially from rental income for Blackhill and the remainder from gambling. The applicant accepted in cross examination that the total rental was calculable as $17,160 less expenses. The discrepancy must be at least $6,340 which remains unaccounted for. The Commission submits that therefore the s25 application cannot succeed. The submission is correct. 
     
      
    74 Mr Lovas recognized that in the circumstances the matter may be somewhat academic but, given forfeiture, he submitted that there should be exclusion to the extent of $10,020 to accommodate the event of the vehicle ever being recovered. The Commission made no submission about this and I would accede to that made by Mr Lovas. Such order should be made. 
     
      
       
      HARLEY DAVIDSON XDJ-62 
       
      
    75 The applicant contends that this was a gift from Ms Lewin purchased by her in 1992 for $20,000 out of her own funds. The only available documentary records indicate that this motorcycle was acquired by the applicant after her death. I am, to put it mildly, not persuaded that the applicant has discharged the necessary onus of proof.  
     
      
       
      CASH $4,800 
       
      
    76 On search of the Cardiff property on 20 July 2000 police located and seized $4,800 in cash. 
     
      
    77 The submission on behalf of the applicant was that I should accept that this money, or the bulk of it, came from Ms Lewin. The applicant said he received $27,000 in cash from her shortly before her death. On his own figures, he spent $23,500 towards acquiring the Land Cruiser and $1,000 on fares etc to attend her funeral. The balance on that accounting is only $2,500. This is not just an arithmetical error, but, in my view, a demonstration of the applicant’s attempts at imaginative reconstruction to explain how he, a recipient of social security for the most part, had large amounts of cash pass through his hands and was able to fund many purchases of expensive items. This claim is rejected. 
     
      
       
      PROCEDURE 
       
      
    78 As was indicated and agreed at the close of the hearing, I publish these reasons and adjourn to a date now to be fixed for the purpose of making orders and entering any formalities of judgment, on which occasion I will hear submissions, if desired, in respect thereof and in respect of questions of costs. To facilitate this I direct the parties to prepare short minutes of orders congruent with these reasons for presentation on the adjourned date.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Robert Marck Ruiz-Avila, was tried in the District Court upon an indictment containing three counts: 
     
      
       
      1. Knowingly taking part in the supply of cannabis leaf on 27 March 2001; 
       
       
      2. Knowingly take part in the supply of ecstasy on the same date; 
       
       
      3. Knowingly taking part in the cultivation of cannabis between 7 July 2000 and 27 March 2001. 
       
       
      He was found guilty of all three counts and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. He appeals against his conviction of the second and third counts and, should that appeal be successful, against his sentence on the first count. 
       
      
    2 Put shortly, it was the Crown case that in late June 2000 the appellant signed a lease on a unit at Wollongong, which was to commence on 7 July, 2000. There was evidence from which it might be inferred that, although he paid the rent for the unit and had the keys to it, he did not live there. There was also evidence that several other men had access to the unit, but there was no evidence that he had sub-let it.  
     
      
    3 Towards the end of March 2001 the unit came to the attention of police as a result of a complaint of a pungent odour, which proved to be that of cannabis, emanating from it. On 27 March, 2001 police entered the unit, armed with a search warrant. It did not appear that anyone was living there, although a bank statement in the name of the appellant (directed to him at a different address) was found on the floor.  
     
      
    4 A large quantity of cannabis was found in various positions within the unit, readily within view. Some of the cannabis was hanging from metal racks, and police found equipment for drying it and securing it in heat-sealed plastic bags. A large set of electronic scales was found. There was also equipment capable of being used for the cultivation of cannabis, about which I shall have more to say later. 
     
      
    5 It was the finding of this material which gave rise to the first and third counts. The second count arose from the finding of 323 ecstasy tablets, contained in plastic bags, in a cutlery drawer in the kitchen.  
     
      
    6 The appellant declined to be interviewed by police and gave no evidence at the trial. The central issue at the trial was his knowledge of the presence in the unit of the cannabis, the ecstasy and the equipment to which I have referred. It was open to conclude on the evidence that he had been to the unit in the days prior to the search, and there was evidence of statements made by him to a real estate agent and a police officer which the Crown contended were lies and from which his knowledge of the presence of the cannabis might readily have been inferred. No doubt, it is for this reason that there is no appeal against his conviction on the first count. 
     
      
    7 The appellant was alleged to have taken part in the supply of the cannabis and ecstasy and the cultivation of the cannabis on the basis that he suffered or permitted a step in the process of the supply or cultivation, as the case may be, to be taken in premises of which he was the lessee: s6(c) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The trial judge’s oral directions to the jury about the elements of the three offences were encapsulated in a document which was provided to the jury. These directions were given with the concurrence of the Crown prosecutor and defence counsel at the trial, neither of whom appeared in the appeal. Nevertheless, in this Court Mr Odgers SC, for the appellant, submitted that the directions in respect of the second and third counts were erroneous and that, in any event, the verdicts of guilty on those counts are unreasonable.  
     
      
       
      Count 2 
       
      
    8 As to the second count, relating to the supply of the ecstasy tablets, Mr Odgers argued that his Honour misdirected the jury about the element of knowledge. The question posed for the jury was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        … knew or was aware that there was a real or significant chance that his rental premises were being used for the storage of a prohibited drug, as part of the process of supplying that drug, and either he intentionally did nothing about preventing it, or he intentionally allowed it to occur. 
        
       
      
    9 That direction appears to have been derived from the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in Bahri Kural v The Queen (1987) 162 CLR 502, a case concerned with the intent requisite to the offence of importing a prohibited drug (s 233(b)(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901). Their Honours said (at 504-5): 
     
      
       
        
        Where, as here, it is necessary to show an intention on the part of the accused to import a narcotic drug, that intent is established if the accused knew or was aware that an article which he intentionally brought into Australia comprised or contained narcotic drugs. But that is not to say that actual knowledge or awareness is an essential element in the guilty mind required for the commission of the offence. It is only to say that knowledge or awareness is relevant to the existence of the necessary intent. Belief, falling short of actual knowledge, that the article comprised or contained narcotic drugs would obviously sustain an inference of intention. So also would proof that the forbidden act was done in circumstances where it appears beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware of the likelihood, in the sense that there was a significant or real chance, that his conduct involved that act and nevertheless persisted in that conduct. As a practical matter, the inference of mens rea or a guilty mind will ordinarily be irresistible in cases involving the importation of narcotic drugs if it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused actually imported the drugs and that he was aware, at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, of the likelihood of the existence of the substance in question in what he was importing and of the likelihood that it was a narcotic drug. 
        
       
      
    10 What their Honours then said (at 505) is important for the purposes of the present case:- 
     
      
       
        
        What we have said is designed to emphasise that the existence of the requisite intention is a question of fact and that in most cases the outcome will depend on an inference to be drawn from primary facts found by the tribunal of fact. In this, as in other areas of the law, it is important not to succumb to the temptation of transforming matters of fact into propositions of law. In that regard, we would emphasise that the foregoing comments are not designed as a direction or instruction to be read by trial judges to juries. They are intended to give guidance to trial judges in order to enable them to formulate such directions as may be appropriate to the facts and circumstances of particular cases. 
        
       
      
    11 The same three justices repeated those statements of principle in Saad v The Queen (1987) 29 ACrim R 20 at 21. They were seen as applicable to cases of the deemed supply of a prohibited drug under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (1985) in R v Greatorex (1994) 74 ACrim R 496, per Hunt CJ at CL at 498 and Simpson J at 503-4. In that case their Honours referred to He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 253, Bahri Kural and Saad, but they did not refer to the later High Court decision of Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 63 ALJR 1. 
     
      
    12 In Pereira the Court considered the adequacy of a trial judge’s directions in relation to charges of being knowingly concerned in the importation into Australia of cannabis resin and having in possession a quantity of cannabis resin which had been imported into Australia (both offences under the Customs Act). In a joint judgment, the Court referred to He Kaw Teh and Bahri Kural and continued (at p 3): 
     
      
       
        
        Even where, as with the present charges, actual knowledge is either a specified element of the offence charged or a necessary element of the guilty mind required for the offence, it may be established as a matter of inference from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence. However, three matters should be noted. First, in such cases the question remains one of actual knowledge:  
        Giorgianni v The Queen 
         (1985) 156 CLR 473 at 504-507;  
        He Kaw Teh 
         at 570. It is never the case that something less than knowledge may be treated as satisfying a requirement of actual knowledge. Secondly, the question is that of the knowledge of the accused and not that which might be postulated of a hypothetical person in the position of the accused, although, of course, that may not be an irrelevant consideration. Finally, where knowledge is inferred from the circumstances surrounding the commission of the alleged offence, knowledge must be the only rational inference available. 
        
       
      
    13 These principles were applied, and the requirement of proof of actual knowledge emphasised, by this Court in Histollo Pty Ltd v Director General of National Parks and Wildlife Service (1998) 45 NSWLR 661, a case concerned with the offence created by s90 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 of knowingly causing or permitting damage to aboriginal relics: in particular, per Spigelman CJ at 665-6, Sperling J at 667, and Greg James J at 695, 700-701. 
     
      
    14 It is one thing to say that the mental element of importation might be made out when a person brings into this country a bag in which he or she is aware that there is likely to be a narcotic drug, or that the mental element of possession is made out when a person has a container in which he or she is aware that there is likely to be a prohibited drug. It is quite another thing to say that the lessee of premises might be fixed with the knowledge required to establish the charge against the appellant on the basis only of his or her awareness of the likelihood that there is a prohibited drug in the premises. In my view, nothing less than actual knowledge of the presence of the drug, in this case the tablets, could be sufficient. Of course, if the appellant’s knowledge of the presence of the tablets were proved, it would not be necessary to prove that he knew that they contained the drug ecstasy. Knowledge, or even belief, on his part that they contained a prohibited drug would be sufficient: cf Dunn (1988) 32 ACrim R 203, per Burt CJ at 205 and Pigeon J at 211. 
     
      
    15 Accordingly, his Honour’s direction that the appellant’s guilt of the second count might be founded upon proof that he was “aware that there was a real or significant chance that his rental premises were being used for the storage of a prohibited drug…” was erroneous. The jury would have understood that to mean that something less than actual knowledge, not only of the nature of the tablets but also of their presence in the unit, would be sufficient. This was a misdirection about an element of the offence charged, and one which was very much at issue in the trial. Although the direction was given with the assent of defence counsel, I would uphold this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    16 In support of the ground that the verdict of guilty of count two is unreasonable, Mr Odgers pointed to the evidence that the appellant did not live at the unit, that other men had access to it, and that the tablets were found in a place where they would not be immediately observable to anyone entering the unit. It is reasonably possible, he argued, that one of the other men had concealed the drug in the drawer in the course of some criminal activity of his own, of which the appellant had no knowledge. There is considerable force in this submission. However, I find it unnecessary to decide this ground because I have already determined that the conviction on count two must be quashed and, for reasons to which I shall turn later in this judgment, I do not consider it appropriate to order a new trial of that count.  
     
      
       
      Count Three 
       
      
    17 In relation to count three, alleging that the appellant knowingly took part in the cultivation of cannabis, the question posed for the jury was whether they were satisfied that the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        …knew or was aware that there was a real or significant chance that his rented premises were being used for the purpose of storing a prohibited plant, and that he intentionally did nothing about preventing it, or he intentionally allowed it to occur. 
        
       
      
    18 In respect of this count, Mr Odgers takes no point about the reference to awareness of a real or significant chance (no doubt, for the same reason that there is no appeal in respect of count one, that is, the sufficiency of evidence that the appellant knew about the cannabis in the unit). Where the direction is in error, Mr Odgers submits, is that it conveys that the appellant’s criminal responsibility for the cultivation of cannabis plants might be founded upon his knowledge that the unit was being used for storing the plants. It is necessary to examine how the direction came to be framed in that way. 
     
      
    19 As I have said, equipment capable of being used for cultivation of cannabis was found at the unit. A detective experienced in drug investigations gave evidence that it could be for growing cannabis hydroponically. However, he said that it was dismantled and there was no sign that it had been used in the premises. He acknowledged the possibility that the cannabis had been grown elsewhere, and had been brought to the unit just prior to drying and processing for sale. 
     
      
    20 Before the summing up, in the light of the detective’s evidence, the trial judge and the Crown prosecutor at trial discussed how the Crown case on count three should be left to the jury. In s3 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, to “cultivate” is defined to include to “plant, grow, tend, nurture or harvest” a prohibited plant. Prompted by his Honour, the Crown prosecutor acknowledged that he could not prove that the cannabis had been planted, grown, tended or nurtured at the unit, and that the only term in that definition applicable to the case was “harvest.” He agreed with his Honour that that term could not include drying a harvested crop, which should be viewed as part of the process of supplying it, but that it could embrace storing it.  
     
      
    21 Accordingly, his Honour took the jury to the statutory definition of “cultivate”, and explained to them that it was the Crown case that the cannabis was stored at the unit as “part of the harvesting process…” The written direction was in the terms which I have set out above. 
     
      
    22 His Honour’s directions would have conveyed to the jury that, as a matter of law, storage of a harvested crop is part of the process of harvesting, so as to be caught by the statutory definition of cultivation. The jury would not have understood that whether the storage of the cannabis at the unit should be viewed as part of the harvesting process was a question of fact for them. Particularly is this so of the written direction, which focussed on the use of the premises “for the purpose of storing a prohibited plant” and made no reference to the process of harvesting. 
     
      
    23 There may be circumstances in which the storage of a crop might be seen as the last stage of the harvesting process. In R v Giorgi and Romeo (1981) 7 ACrim R 305, King CJ (at 308-9) considered the meaning of the word “cultivate” in the context of South Australian legislation which did not provide a statutory definition. His Honour noted that the term could “encompass the whole process of production from the soil, including preparing the soil, sowing, tending and caring for the plant during the growth and reaping or harvesting.” His Honour went on to observe: 
     
      
       
        
        The harvesting aspect of cultivation would include, not only the actual removal of the plant or portion thereof from the soil, but also the ancillary activities of laying out, stacking, removal to nearby sheds and placing in those sheds. 
        
       
       
      Whether storage of a crop is part of the harvesting process is a question of fact, to be determined in the light of the circumstances of each case. To assert that storage is embraced by the term “harvest” as a matter of law is erroneous. Again, notwithstanding defence counsel’s assent to his Honour’s direction, I would uphold this ground.  
       
      
    24 It is difficult to see how the storage of the cannabis at the unit in the present case could be classified as part of the harvesting process, given the reasonable possibility, acknowledged by the Crown prosecutor at trial, that it had been grown elsewhere and brought to the unit for the purpose of drying and packaging. Its presence in the unit is far more consistent with its being prepared for supply (the allegation embraced by the first count). In my view, if the question whether the storage was part of the harvesting process had been left for the jury to decide, it would not reasonably have been open to them to conclude that it was. In the light of the confined manner in which the case was left to the jury, the verdict in respect of count three could not be sustained in any event. 
     
      
    25 It may be that the Crown case need not have been limited in the way it was, and that the question whether the cultivation was undertaken, in whole or in part, at the unit might have been left to the jury. However, it would not be appropriate for the Crown to have the opportunity at a new trial to make out a different case: cf R v Anderson (1991) 53 ACrim R 421, per Gleeson CJ at 453. The verdict on count three should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    26 In my view, the same orders should be made in respect of count two. The Crown case on that count is not strong. His Honour passed sentences on the three counts which resulted, effectively, in a head sentence of two years and two months and a non-parole period of seventeen months, dating from 14 November, 2002. The appellant has now served over ten months of that sentence. Moreover, without examining the manner in which his Honour structured the sentences, part of the effective sentence is referable to the third count, of which the appellant is entitled to be acquitted. In these circumstances, applying the principles enunciated by the High Court in Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler (1984) 154 CLR 627 at 630, I do not think that the interests of justice require that there be a new trial of the second count. 
     
      
    27 That leaves, then, the question of sentence on the first count. On that count his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for twelve months, commencing on 14 November 2002. Counsel in this Court were agreed that, if the convictions in respect of the other two counts were quashed, we should vary that sentence so as to enable the appellant’s immediate release. I would propose a fixed term of ten months, which would have expired by the time this judgment is delivered. 
     
      
    28 Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in relation to counts two and three. In respect of each of those counts, I would quash the conviction and enter a verdict and judgment of acquittal. In respect of the sentence on count one, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence of twelve months imprisonment, and would substitute a fixed term of imprisonment for ten months, commencing on 14 November 2002 and expiring on 13 September 2003. That sentence having expired, the appellant should be released forthwith.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 Shaw J: This is an appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against an interlocutory judgment of Judge Hosking, SC, given on 8 May 2003. In that judgment his Honour denied a permanent stay of an indictment charging the applicant with two counts of dangerous driving occasioning grevious bodily harm pursuant to s 52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). His Honour did grant a temporary stay of the indictment, allowing the applicant nine months to raise finances to afford legal expenses. It might be better described as an adjournment of the trial on the basis that the Crown would not present an indictment against the applicant for a period of nine months, but for present purposes the decision will be described as a stay. The basis of that decision is in reliance upon principles explained by the High Court of Australia in Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292. 2 The charges against the applicant arise out of an incident that occurred on Sunday 4 February 2001. It is alleged that the applicant completed a twelve hour shift, at approximately 8.00 am on that day, at the emergency department of the Shoalhaven Hospital at Nowra and commenced to drive, at around 11.00 am, to his home in Wollongong. Driving along the Princes Highway north of Berry his car impacted with another, causing really serious bodily harm to the occupants of that other vehicle. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was first arraigned on Wednesday 8 May 2002 and pleaded not guilty to two charges of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. He stood his trial before Woods DCJ and a jury for some weeks with the jury returning no verdict on those charges. He was, at that trial, represented by Mr Bonnici of counsel. 
     
      
    4 The Crown case was that the applicant was fatigued by his twelve hour shift and would have known that he was not in a fit state of mind to be driving. The defendant alleged that he was, rather, suffering under a dissociated fugue. Woods DCJ left both sane and insane automatism to the jury and the failure of the jury to agree to a unanimous verdict seems to have been based on the inability of the jury to resolve this issue of voluntariness. 
     
      
    5 After the first trial, and following an unsuccessful application to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to discontinue the proceedings, the applicant applied to Dodd DCJ for a permanent stay. This application was refused. That decision was upheld by this Court on 8 April 2003: R v Joyce [2003] NSWCCA 84 per Hidden J (Dunford and Simpson JJ concurring). 
     
      
    6 The basis of the first stay application was that it was unfair to the applicant to continue with a retrial given that it was, on the assertion of the applicant, unlikely that a different jury would be able to come to a unanimous verdict on the retrial. Secondly, it was asserted that the decision of the Director to proceed with the retrial would effect an abuse of process given: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) that a second jury would be in no better position to agree on a verdict given the level of complication involved in the trial; and 
         
        (b) the cost to the community and to the accused;  
        
       
      
    7 On that appeal, Hidden J noted (at [22]): 
     
      
       
        
        It could be, then, that the applicant would face a second trial unrepresented. It need hardly be said that this would be most undesirable, given the seriousness of the matter and the difficult issues involved. We were asked to allow the appeal on this basis, applying the principles in  
        Dietrich v The Queen 
         (1992) 177 CLR 292. However, it is not appropriate that this Court should consider that matter. It raises a basis for a stay of proceedings which was not argued in the District Court. In any event, the evidence is inadequate and the Crown has not had the opportunity to respond to such evidence as there is. 
        
       
      
    8 Accordingly, the applicant then made a further application for a permanent stay on Tuesday 6 May 2003 before Hosking DCJ. It is the refusal of that second stay application that concerns this Court.9 The applicant raised three issues in his second application for a permanent stay. To some extent they were interrelated. 10 The first was that he estimated the complexity of the trial had increased since the first trial and that the initial estimates of Hosking DCJ that the retrial would run for a similar length of time as the first trial were erroneous. The applicant asserted that the retrial would more likely run for over six weeks to explore more issues surrounding the applicant’s evidence concerning his bi-polar disorder and the relation between that disorder and the dissociated state he alleges he was suffering under and which he acknowledged, in the first trial, caused the incident the subject of the charges.11 The applicant also asserted, in his written submissions on the application, that: 
     
      
       
        
        Previous trial Mr Bonnici may well be witness given the stolen file saga – 
         
        brother as a solicitor jeopardized his job, cannot take time off work and wasn’t funded by the Wesley Mission. 
        
       
      
    12 The latter point is a reference to the fact that he was represented by his brother at the first trial on a pro bono basis instructing Mr Bonnici. The reference to the ‘stolen file saga’ is something I will address later in these reasons.13 The second ground for a permanent stay was that the applicant asserted he would need to brief a Queens Counsel or Senior Counsel given the complexity of the issues (and given that ‘[t]he issue of bipolar may be there from the outset this time’). 14 The third point was that, on his current income, he could not afford such counsel. The basis of this submission seems to be, on the applicant’s assertions, that he is working casual shifts, and further, may need to spend more time with his children if his wife returns to work. He alleges that his rostering as a casual is in breach of ‘industrial awards’ and seems to allege that he is suffering, as a result of these charges, from being unable to pursue ‘advanced training’. He also seems to allege some difficulty in his professional career given that, he submits: 
     
      
       
        
        …I am obliged to follow my conscience my attitudes towards abortion I believe would prohibit me from entering a training scheme [on obstetrics and gynaecology]. 
        
       
      
    15 The sum total of these submissions to Hosking DCJ are, without wishing to diminish the complexity of the issues raised by the applicant, that he can not, at the present time, afford sufficiently experienced counsel to run a case that will involve highly complicated medical and forensic issues.16 As to the estimates of time for the retrial, much of the submission is focussed on an assertion by the applicant that the retrial will take longer than the trial. On the application before Hosking DCJ, his Honour drew to the attention of the applicant that, generally, retrials do not take up the same amount of time. The applicant did not seem to accept that this was so. Similarly, the Crown Prosecutor before his Honour asserted that the original trial occupied four weeks because of some issues raised on the voir dire, and substantial legal argument, including argument as to whether an accused person who leads evidence of ‘normal self’ to raise an issue of voluntariness, in reliance upon the case of Falconer v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 30, thereby introduces character evidence that can be refuted by the Crown. Many of these issues may be replicated at a retrial. 17 A further issue may have contributed to the time taken up by the first trial. This issue is described by the applicant as the ‘stolen files saga’. This refers to certain subpoenas to produce evidence that were used by police, unsealed, to obtain documents relating to the applicant’s employment and employment history. Judge Woods, QC, rightly, ordered that the documents ‘produced’ under the irregular subpoenas be returned at the first trial. I have difficulty seeing how this issue will arise on the retrial, if there be one. Thus, I do not accept that his Honour erred in finding that the retrial would not be likely to take more than four weeks. Even if this assumption proves to be incorrect, the fact that a trial may be lengthy is not, in my opinion, of itself a ground for a permanent stay to be ordered. 18 However, while Hosking DCJ refused the applicant a permanent stay, he did grant the applicant a temporary stay of nine months. The applicant had applied, after the rejection of his application for a permanent stay, for a temporary stay of twelve months. To warrant intervention by this Court in that exercise of discretion by Hosking DCJ it is necessary for the applicant to show that there was some error in his Honour’s decision or error in the approach to his discretion: House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; R v Subramaniam [2002] NSWCCA 372. Further, it is correct to state, as put by the Crown, that the grant of a permanent stay is an extraordinary power, exercised in rare circumstances where the court concludes that to proceed with a matter will not allow for a fair trial of the accused: Jago v District Court of NSW (1989) 168 CLR 23. Further, it is for an applicant to put his or herself within the circumstances envisaged by the High Court in Dietrich v The Queen to be granted a permanent stay on that basis. The onus, it is correctly stated by the Crown, is a heavy one: see Williams v Spautz (1992) 174 CLR 509 at 529; Barron v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 10 NSWLR 215 at 219. 19 In Dietrich the judgments of the High Court give some elaboration of those circumstances in which a trial judge should consider a stay of proceedings on the basis that the accused person is unrepresented by counsel.20 From the judgments in Dietrich it is clearly correct to say that, in Australia, a trial judge has a power to order a permanent stay of proceedings against an indigent accused on serious criminal charges when, through no fault of his or her own, he or she is unable to obtain legal representation at the trial of those charges.21 Hosking DCJ said (at judgment page 4): 
     
      
       
        
        The applicant is a qualified and practising medical practitioner. He is not indigent in an absolute sense of being needy or poor as the figures I will soon refer to will demonstrate. 
        
       
      
    22 The applicant gave evidence on his application before Hosking DCJ. He testified that he had spent around $85,000 on barristers fees for the first trial as well as $10,000 of a $20,000 loan for other fees which had been paid. He said that he did not own any real estate exclusive of his wife but that they jointly owned property in Queensland. This property was, he thought, purchased for $264,000 about 2-3 years previously, but was subject to a mortgage to Rams of $50,000. He indicated that his wife did not wish to sell that property. Hosking DCJ found (at judgment page 8): 
     
      
       
        
        In the absence of any evidence from Mrs Joyce to support the applicant’s contention that she regards the property as wholly hers, I am not prepared to accept that assertion and I am only prepared to act on the legal basis that the applicant and his wife are registered in some way as the joint owners of the property apparently in equal shares. 
        
       
      
    23 Though, in my opinion, it should not be considered necessary that a person charge their home to pay their legal expenses when charged with criminal offences, I do not think that his Honour fell into legal error in relation to this finding.24 The applicant gave evidence that he then had about $6,500 in his bank accounts by way of savings. He testified that he made approximately $200,000 gross the previous year, subject to a tax rate, he asserted, of approximately 50 per cent. He also gave evidence that professional and insurance costs each year were in the order of $5,000.25 He testified that, as I understand his evidence, whilst he was qualified for more permanent work he was employed on a casual basis because he would not prescribe the ‘morning-after pill’. He would therefore work many hours ‘because [he] had no option’ and felt that he had very little job security. He would work late night shifts because the casual rate was higher for those shifts. He said that whilst he has been averaging about 125 hours a fortnight, he could not continue with that volume of work and, in his opinion, that volume was against occupational health and safety guidelines. Thus, while in the first trial he was able to pay his legal costs out of his wages, he doubted whether he could continue to do this during the second trial. Further, he said that he was able to pursue this volume of night work because he had a nearby flat in which to sleep through the day, but that this had been sold. 26 The applicant testified that he had three children of ages five, seven and eight. He said that his wife would care for those children but he gave evidence that she wanted to return to work and care for the children would fall to him, meaning he would have to work less. 27 Hosking DCJ noted (at judgment page 5): 
     
      
       
        
        For myself, I do not see why the applicant needs a senior counsel to obtain appropriate representation however desirable the retainer of senior counsel may be. In my view, having regard to the issues involved, a competent junior counsel would be quite adequate. 
        
       
      
    28 Indeed, the applicant told his Honour that he would be content for Mr Bonnici to continue as his counsel in the retrial. In any event, it is not for a trial judge to decide on appropriate remuneration for the defendant’s counsel because it is, rather, for the defendant to prove that he is indigent and, through no fault of his own, unable to brief counsel that renders a trial unfair: see Attorney General for NSW v Milat (1995) 37 NSWLR 370.29 Hosking DCJ concluded (at judgment page 9): 
     
      
       
        
        It is very difficult not to feel some considerable sympathy for the applicant’s position…However, on the evidence I have, I cannot see that the applicant has made out a case for a permanent stay on the grounds of inability to obtain reasonable legal representation through lack of means. 
        
       
      
    30 I can see no error in his Honour’s conclusion. In all of the circumstances there was a sufficiency of evidence for his Honour to come to the conclusions that he did, namely, that the applicant could not bring himself within the circumstances considered in Dietrich as necessary for a permanent stay to be ordered, that is, the applicant could not demonstrate that his trial would be unfair because of his inability to fund legal fees so that he could be adequately represented at his trial. Rather, the evidence indicated that the applicant required time for his circumstances to stabilise and to prepare for his trial. 31 Having come to that conclusion Hoskings DCJ noted: 
     
      
       
        
        …I would consider if the applicant makes application for it, a temporary stay to enable him to raise sufficient funds… 
        
       
      
    32 The Crown did not oppose the applicant’s subsequent application for a temporary stay. Mr McCarthy said: 
     
      
       
        
        I think it’s desirable that Dr Joyce is represented your Honour. I think that’s our position. 
        
       
      
    33 In fact, the result was that Hosking DCJ saw no need to grant a temporary stay on the undertaking of the Crown not to present an indictment within nine months from the date of the judgment.34 Thus, the finding of Hosking DCJ that a temporary stay – or simply an adjournment, by consent - was an appropriate response to the application was well within his discretion and I can see no reason to interfere with the exercise of that discretion. 35 The applicant has not demonstrated that there was any error in this approach and accordingly I propose that leave to appeal be refused.  
     
      
    36 Tobias JA: I agree. 
     
      
    37 Howie J: I also agree. 
     
      
    38 Tobias JA: The order of the Court is that leave to appeal be refused.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 WOOD, CJ. at CL. and HOWIE, J: We have read the draft judgment of Greg James J and generally agree that these were our reasons for having reached the view that the Crown appeal should be dismissed. However, we wish to emphasise that we were of the view that the appeal should be dismissed on discretionary grounds. 
     
      
    2 In our opinion the sentencing discretion exercised by Judge Coolahan was infected with the errors identified by Greg James J and as a consequence the sentence imposed was inadequate to a degree that would have justified interference by this Court. In particular, the non-parole period was manifestly inadequate. It simply did not reflect the objective seriousness of the offence nor adequately denounce the respondent’s conduct and provide for general deterrence. This was a serious instance of an offence of dangerous driving and a minimum period of punishment of imprisonment for 4 months cannot be supported on any view of the facts. 
     
      
    3 Further, the disparity between the head sentence imposed and the non-parole period specified could rarely, if ever, be justified in the regime under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that existed at the time the respondent was sentenced and by a proper application of sentencing principles. It seems that his Honour found special circumstances in order to provide for a longer period on parole: there was no other reason to reduce the non-parole period. But the ability to provide for the rehabilitation of an offender is subject to limits; it cannot be provided by lengthening the overall sentence above that which is appropriate to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence nor can the non-parole period be reduced to a point that is inadequate to punish the offender. These are basic principles of sentencing that his Honour could not have applied in the present case. It is worth repeating part of what was said by the High Court almost thirty years ago about a non-parole period in Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …………..Confinement in a prison serves the same purposes whether before or after the expiration of a non-parole period and, throughout, it is punishment, but punishment directed towards reformation. The only difference between the two periods is that during the former the prisoner cannot be released on the ground that the punishment has served its purpose sufficiently to warrant release from confinement, whereas in the latter he can. In a true sense the non-parole period is a minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing judge considers that the crime committed calls for such detention. 
        
       
      
    4 This view of the purpose of a non-parole period has been routinely cited with approval and applied by this Court ever since it was pronounced, regardless of what legislative scheme was in place for governing the parole of prisoners. Unless over-turned by a clear legislative intent, it will continue to apply to future regimes. 
     
      
    5 It should be made perfectly clear that the sentence imposed in the present case was wrong and the dismissal of the Crown appeal cannot be taken to suggest otherwise. 
     
      
    6 GREG JAMES, J: In these proceedings, the Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the asserted inadequacy of a sentence of 16 months imprisonment to date from 20 May 2003 with a non-parole period of four months imposed upon the respondent in the District Court of New South Wales by his Honour Judge Coolahan following her plea of guilty to a count of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    7 At the hearing of the appeal, after reading the careful and detailed written submissions and hearing counsel, the court determined that the appeal should be dismissed. The following are my reasons for so concluding. 
     
      
    8 The offence for which his Honour had sentenced the respondent is provided for by s.52A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 and is punishable by a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment. 
     
      
    9 The respondent had been granted conditional bail on the date of her arrest, 3 December 2001 and had, for some three months of that bail period, been subjected to conditions requiring reporting at the local police station. 
     
      
    10 The respondent’s initial plea of guilty had been entered before a magistrate. She had adhered to that plea of guilty on coming before the District Court. She came before that court with no prior criminal history. She gave evidence before the trial judge on her plea and was cross-examined. 
     
      
    11 In support of her position were tendered written submissions, a report by Dr. Wendy Louise Walker, forensic psychologist, a report of Dr. Thomas Clarke, consultant psychiatrist and a number of testimonials together with other material. 
     
      
    12 The learned trial judge, in his remarks on sentence referred to the facts of the offence as taken from a short undated statement furnished to him together with the prosecution material. He set out the following recitation from that statement:- 
     
      
       
        
        “About 6.40 am on Saturday 9 June 2001, the offender was driving a Mitsubishi Magna sedan south along the Pacific Highway towards Karuah after having left Forster at about 5.15 am to travel north. While travelling along an uphill grade leading into a moderate left-hand bend, her vehicle crossed the double unbroken centre line towards oncoming traffic. At about the same time, the victim was travelling north in his Hyundai Excel sedan. The evidence at the scene of the collision indicated that the victim moved to the left of his lane before being struck by the oncoming vehicle driven by the offender, the collision occurring near the fog line adjacent to the northbound lane. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim was trapped until about 8.00 am, before being flown to John Hunter Hospital by rescue helicopter. He had critical injuries. The offender was also transported by helicopter to hospital, having sustained moderate injuries. 
        
       
       
        
        Before the helicopter departed the scene, Senior Constable Alderson located in the offender’s vehicle a brown paper bag containing numerous syringes. Police then searched an Esprit backpack style bag belonging to the offender and located $200 in cash along with six sachets of white powder, alcohol wipes, two capped syringes filed with clear liquid, and a small quantity of cannabis. Paramedics treating the offender noticed needle marks on the inside of her elbows, commensurate with significant intravenous drug use. Analysis of the white powder indicated the presence of a total of 5.73 grams of methylamphetamine. Each of the two syringes containing the liquid was a also shown to contain methylamphetamine.” 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour noted that a blood sample taken from the offender during her treatment at hospital showed that she had in her blood 0.13 milligrams per litre of amphetamine and 1.2 milligrams pre litre of methamphetamine. 
     
      
    14 Dr. Judith Perl, a pharmacologist, referred to the concentration in the blood of methamphetamine as “in the toxic to fatal range” and that of amphetamine as being “above any therapeutic level”. She was of the view that the respondent was under the influence of those drugs to the extent that “her driving ability would have been significantly impaired”. 
     
      
    15 His Honour referred to a medical report from the Surgery Registrar of the John Hunter Hospital concerning the condition of the victim. The victim had a right pneumothorax with a right sided flail chest as a result of multiple rib fractures, a depressed sternal fracture and an interior chest wall contusion. When first seen, he was haemo-dynamically unstable with low blood pressure, his Glasgow coma score was 13 out of 15 and he was confused. In addition he suffered contusion to the right lung, a pericardial affusion, a myocardial contusion, lacerations to the face and the inside of the mouth, bleeding from the nose and left ear, a fractured left malleolus and calcaneus, a fracture of the right femur, a compound fracture of the left femur and patella, swelling to the right side of the face, a laceration to the chin, fractures of a number of bones on the left side of the face and contusions to his left arm. 
     
      
    16 His Honour noted that the doctor described these injuries as serious. Notwithstanding this, the Crown advised his Honour that the victim had returned to work by the time the matter came to be dealt with in the District Court, albeit with pain in his leg, although his ability to work, so his Honour was informed, was now unrestricted. 
     
      
    17 His Honour expressed the view that it was obviously a very serious offence, that the offender was under the influence of an extraordinarily concentration of illicit drugs, the injuries to the victim were serious and the initial injuries were of an horrific nature, including, in particular, the compound fracture which involved the bone protruding through the skin. 
     
      
    18 His Honour referred to the total irresponsibility of the offender in causing the victim such serious injuries. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is trite to say that for such an objectively serious offence, unless there could be demonstrated … exceptional circumstances, the sentence must involve fulltime custody.” 
        
       
      
    19 These are observations with which I can only agree. 
     
      
    20 His Honour turned to the respondent’s subjective circumstances. He noted she had no serious criminal history although she had one minor speeding matter for which she was fined in 2002. He referred to the reports to which I have earlier made reference. His Honour quoted the following passage in his remarks from the clinical observations of Dr. Wendy Walker:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms. Royal impressed as depressed, hating herself, vulnerable and agitated. The extent of her self-loathing was delusional and the extent of her being dominated by her physically and mentally abusive boyfriend, Matt Coburn, aged 21 years, was highly dysfunctional.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour went on to remark that notwithstanding that the respondent had attributed a very large portion of the blame for her condition and hence for the collision upon her boyfriend, Coburn, it was clear to Dr. Walker at the time when she saw the respondent that the respondent was still in contact with Coburn and continued in some sort of relationship with him. Dr. Walker had expressed the view, from information supplied by the respondent’s mother together with what she had heard of a telephone conversation between the respondent and Coburn, that Coburn would seem to be “overly psychotic, thought disordered, probably from drug abuse, sadistic, anti-social and disgustingly violent”. 
     
      
    22 His Honour, however, discounted Dr. Walker’s views to a certain extent as he had reservations as to her impartiality, he having gained the distinct impression she was acting somewhat as an advocate for the respondent. 
     
      
    23 He referred in detail to Dr. Walker’s recital of the respondent’s history. A summary of that history reveals the respondent, while obtaining a good TER, entered the banking industry upon leaving school, but developed bulimia nervosa for which she was eventually hospitalised. She apparently became subject to an obsessive compulsive disorder, although she continued to work. She began to drink heavily. Her existing relationship suffered. She adopted self-mutilating behaviour and went on to suffer major depression and has not worked since she left work in 2000. She admitted herself to the Wandine Psychiatric Clinic run by the Wesley Mission. After discharge, she still felt unstable and had herself re-admitted. During that stay in early 2001, she met another girl who was heavily involved in the drug industry. That girl introduced her to intravenous drug use and to the person Coburn. His Honour quoted Dr. Walker’s report concerning Coburn:- 
     
      
       
        
        “They began a relationship and this quite refined lady who had no criminal record became enmeshed both in intravenous drug use, speed and ice, and in a disgustingly abusive relationship in which she is bashed, bullied and subjected to constant threats of murder, along with emotional blackmail and draining of her finances.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour noted that Dr. Walker referred to the offender’s parents having provided her with a house worth nearly half a million dollars and that Coburn had lived on the money from the proceeds of that house to the extent that apparently only about $200,000 worth of the proceeds was left. His Honour noted Dr. Walker’s view that the offender was already psychiatrically very vulnerable before she became enmeshed in drug use and in the relationship with Coburn. His Honour quoted again from Dr. Walker’s reports as to aspects of her relationship with Coburn:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Between her visits to me in October 2001 and January 2002, I observed significant deterioration in Ms. Royal both in her mental state with increase in her depression and in noticeable weight loss. Her suggestibility and vulnerability had increased and when with me she would agree that Matt was a disaster and that she had to end her relationship. When he phoned repeatedly she would be sweet and placate him and would tell me after the call ended that she could not bring herself to hurt him.” 
        
       
      
    25 Dr. Walker had said she understood it was the offender’s relationship with Coburn which was said to be the cause of the charge, the offender having given her the following account of the events leading up to the collision:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I had spoken to Mum and Dad and my ex Len and agreed to end it all with Matt. I was going home and Matt would not let me go by myself. After shouting and arguing and going on, we drove and he agreed to stay in a hotel in Belmont and I said I would get the houseboat for the weekend. I said I had a family thing for the weekend. However, I was going to leave him at the hotel and not come back. I agreed with Mum and Dad that I would stay with them. I had not slept that night for over 24 hours. I drove to Belmont. I had promised Mum and I would go home and Matt was arguing, pleading and threatening suicide. Then he held me up against the door with a knife at my throat and threatened to kill me and Mum and Dad. He kept saying how he would hunt us down and kill us, how he hated being by himself. Over and over he kept threatening to kill me, Mum and Dad. I was afraid police would be called to the hotel in Belmont because we were yelling and screaming. I ran out the door, jumped into the car and ran. He had a proper diving knife. I know now he was only manipulating. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not know what time I got home, about three or 3.30, and I told Mum I had to go back, that he had threatened if I did not go back he would kill Mum and Dad and me, and at the time I believed all this crap. He threatened and Mum begged me not to go. I had a shower to try to wake myself up a bit and I mixed some speed just before I walked out the door. Dad was going on about drug use and everyone was arguing at this stage. 
        
       
       
        
        I drove off feeling horrible because I had fought with Mum and Dad and broken my word. Matt had told me I had to be back by 7.00 am so he could get a boat to go fishing, otherwise he would do as threatened. I said I would do my best. Being completely stupid I believed everything he said and tried to get back and if I did not have the accident I would have been back just after that time. 
        
       
       
        
        I had left home between 4.30 and 5.00 am and it was cold. I never use the heater but I put it on. I had not slept and I felt colder and put a blanket over my knees. At one stage on the phone to Matt I put my window down but it was too cold and I must have had a microsleep then and I woke up and the car was veering off the road. He asked what I was doing and I said, ‘I fell asleep’. He told me I still had to be back by 7.00 am. He said later he said to pull over and have a sleep. The next thing I remember is driving, talking on the phone to Matt and he fell asleep. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not remember hitting poles and the ditch. All I know I woke up as the car was about to hit Mr. Ridgeway’s car and that was it. I remember spinning many times and how it hurt. I tried to get out of the car to get to his. There was dust from the airbag and I thought it was smoke. I jumped over the passenger side, then stood up and fell with a broken ankle. I could not get to him. He suffered terrible injuries. I could not get across to help him.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour referred to Dr. Walker’s belief that the offender was remorseful and suffered from intense guilt feelings. In particular, his Honour set out at length Dr. Walker’s opinion which concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This has resulted in her self hatred and guilt feelings being manipulated ruthlessly by this very sadistic expedient and likely psychotic very young man. The offence currently before the court occurred in the context of (1) her trying to leave Matt at the urging of her parents, (2) lack of sleep for over 24 hours and, (3) use of speed to try to keep awake and, (4) terror that Matt would, as he had vividly threatened, kill her and her parents if she did not return to him by 7.00 am.” 
        
       
      
    27 Dr. Walker recommended, as she had in an earlier report, an urgent assessment by a psychiatrist as the respondent was at major risk of suicide and, in particular, recommended that she be assessed for likely admission to the new psychiatric unit at Manning Base Hospital. She noted that the respondent still suffered the mental health conditions to which she had referred in her earlier report. 
     
      
    28 The respondent had also been seen by Dr. Clarke, who gave a similar but briefer history to that of Dr. Walker. To Dr. Clarke, the respondent had admitted she had consumed amphetamines in order to keep her from sleeping and whilst admitting she had not slept for 24 hours beforehand, referred to that lack of consciousness which caused her vehicle to collide with the victim’s car as being occasioned by a “microsleep”. Dr. Clarke described her as suffering from borderline features to her personality, being of the view that it was more likely this was a chronic depression or dysthymic disorder. The latter is a condition which involves a depressed mood with symptoms of poor appetite or overeating, insomnia or hyper insomnia, low energy or fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentration or difficulty making decisions and feelings of hopelessness. 
     
      
    29 His Honour expressed the view that the testimonials of all the referees, some of whom appeared to hold responsible positions, were greatly in her favour, albeit many of those giving the testimonials did not know of her drug use prior to giving the testimonial and expressed the opinion that it was out of character. He particularly noted a letter from her tendered on behalf of the respondent expressing remorse and apologising to her victim, in which the respondent said she was driving because her life was threatened as well as the lives of her parents and her close friend, but went on to say:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am disgusted that I hurt you so badly and endangered your life.” 
        
       
      
    30 He referred to her evidence as confirmatory of the histories taken by Dr. Walker and Dr. Clarke and of the nature of the relationship with Coburn. His Honour accepted that the relationship was disastrous. The respondent’s evidence in that respect was confirmed by that of her mother. His Honour specifically adverted to those passages of the respondent’s evidence when she referred to her attempts to leave Coburn to go to Forster, he commenced yelling, screaming, held a knife to her throat and threatened her, her parents and her ex-boyfriend; together with her evidence that she believed his threats; that she did not dare go to the police to get him into trouble and that she really believed he had the capacity to carry out his threats and realised how stupid and gullible she had been. She asserted that she could terminate the relationship, no longer be manipulated by him and would not put herself in the position where this could happen again. She confirmed that her relationship with Coburn, as it then presently existed, was not a relationship of the kind that she had formerly had in that she could no longer be manipulated. 
     
      
    31 His Honour referred, however, to two important matters. Firstly, that in his view the offender’s evidence was generally unconvincing and unimpressive, that she was trying to minimise her responsibility and was still in some sort of relationship with Coburn and secondly that there was nothing in her evidence which referred to any drug rehabilitation which she may have undergone since the collision. 
     
      
    32 The fact of the continuing relationship with Coburn was attested to by the respondent’s mother, even though she also gave evidence that she had seen Coburn assault her daughter, kick her and try to choke her and that he had threatened her and her husband to the extent that they had taken out an AVO against him. She gave evidence that the house that had been provided by her husband and herself to the respondent and which had been sold had realised some $463,000 of which all the money had gone, most of it on Matt (Coburn). 
     
      
    33 His Honour did not accept there had been one unexpected microsleep, although accepting that it was during a microsleep that the car veered onto the wrong side of the road. In particular, he referred to evidence which he accepted that immediately preceding the collision, the respondent had had a similar experience some distance back down the road whilst she was also on the phone to Coburn. He noted that the offender herself had suffered a broken ankle. 
     
      
    34 He allowed a 20% deduction for the utilitarian value of the plea. He rejected an asserted duress or any prospect of successfully defending a trial as warranting “any additional discount for a plea”. This, in the context of a submission that she should receive additional discount for her plea of guilty on the basis that she might have been able, successfully, to defend the proceedings. He accepted the offender had considerable contrition, though he was not convinced that she had, in her own mind, taken full responsibility for her behaviour and its consequences. But he accepted that she suffered severely from the mental conditions and personality problems to which I have referred, albeit that she had been able to hold quite responsible positions until 1997. 
     
      
    35 His Honour, while adverting to the principle in Regina v. Engert (1995) 84 A. Crim. R. 67 was of the view that there had been a limited causal relation between the psychiatric problems and the commission of the offence and that thus the case was not one in which there was no room for an element of general deterrence, particularly because the offender made a conscious decision to drive notwithstanding she had been deprived of sleep for over 24 hours, after taking a large dose of illegal drugs and had continued to drive after being warned, by falling asleep, that it was dangerous to do so. His Honour accepted, however, that her assertion she was under pressure to visit her parents and the asserted pressure to return to Coburn. 
     
      
    36 He concluded, however, accepting the submissions made by the Crown, that there had been a total abandonment of responsibility on behalf of the offender and this was not merely a case of momentary inattention. 
     
      
    37 His Honour was of the view that, although the penalty for offence with which the applicant had been charged was one that could be determined in the Local Court, that matter, although relevant, should not be determinative of the penalty to be imposed. 
     
      
    38 So far as his Honour expressed the view that matter “takes the matter out of the guideline decision initially in Jurisic and later in White [sic]”, in my view his Honour fell into error. It is not a matter of whether or not a particular criminal offence might fall within the jurisdiction of the Local Court to which such a principle adverts but whether the facts of the individual matter charged might, if there were jurisdiction in the Local Court, be appropriately dealt with in that jurisdiction and thus be subject to a lower effective maximum sentence, that is important in a given case. As the Crown submitted to us on the hearing of this appeal, it was never the case that it would have been appropriate for a matter as serious as this to be dealt with in the Local Court. In those circumstances, there is no principle that a sentence otherwise appropriate should be reduced on the basis that a jurisdiction existed in the Local Court to deal with offences of this kind. So far as his Honour might have considered otherwise in my view, he erred. Further, so far as his Honour might have considered there was some bright line demarcation limit which, if crossed, has the effect that the guidance provided by this court to sentencing judges by guideline judgments such as Whyte (supra) becomes irrelevant, I consider he also erred. 
     
      
    39 It is to mistake the nature of guideline judgments to approach sentencing on matters to which the judgments would otherwise apply on the basis that the presence of one among the many possible considerations applicable to the proper exercise of discretion would entirely displace the application of the principles referred to in the guideline judgments. 
     
      
    40 However, his Honour adverted to all the matters to which. 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required him to advert and adverted to the threats made by Coburn as motivating factors behind the respondent getting behind the wheel of the car. He adverted to her vulnerability arising from the addiction to the drug. He rightly concluded, taking into account all the circumstances, that the matter could not be dealt with by way of a sentence other than one of full time custody, but did conclude that, adverting to all those matters and the subjective features, that he should impose a sentence somewhat less than that which would otherwise have been imposed. He entirely appropriately, concluded that there were special circumstances warranting the reduction of the non-parole period very significantly, in particular arising from the prior good record, the medical problems, and the necessity for lengthy supervision on release. He reduced the non-parole period that would otherwise have been imposed in compliance with s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to one of four months, providing for release on parole conditional upon her submitting to the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and imposed the statutory disqualification from driving. His Honour further recommended the offender be classified as soon as possible and if thought appropriate housed at a minimum security institution; that whilst in custody she be closely supervised and monitored until assessed regarding a risk of suicide. 
     
      
    41 In his written submissions, the learned Crown Prosecutor contended his Honour had erred in imposing a sentence and non-parole period which were manifestly inadequate and which did not reflect the principles referred to in the guideline judgments in Regina v. Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and Regina v. Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. It was contended that his Honour principally had erred in considering that some reduction to an otherwise appropriate sentence should be given as the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court. He referred to the matters of aggravation referred to in Regina v. Whyte (supra) and referred to the following five particular matters:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) the injuries suffered by the victim were very serious: see  
        R. v. Whyte 
         (supra), paragraph 216(i) per Spigelman, CJ.; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) at the time of the collision the respondent was under the influence of methylamphetamine and amphetamine to the extent that her driving ability would have been significantly impaired: see  
        R. v. Whyte 
         (supra), paragraph 216(iv) per Spigelman, CJ.; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) at the time of the collision the respondent had been driving without sleep and under the influence of methylamphetamine and amphetamine for a considerable period: see  
        R. v. Whyte 
         (supra), paragraph 216(iv) per Spigelman, CJ.; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the respondent had ignored the significant warning that she had received that it was totally unsafe to drive: see  
        R. v. Whyte 
         (supra) paragraph 216(viii) per Spigelman, CJ; and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) at the time of the collision the respondent had been without sleep for more than 24 hours: see  
        R. v. Whyte 
         (supra) paragraph 217(x) per Spigelman, CJ.” 
        
       
      
    42 It was submitted that, having regard to those matters, it was incumbent upon his Honour to have had what was submitted was proper regard for the abandonment of responsibility and that, having regard to Whyte (supra), it was necessary for his Honour to take into account what was said at paragraphs 229-230 by the Chief Justice in that decision, viz:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A full time custodial sentence of less than two years would not generally be appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    43 It was contended that his Honour fell into error in passing a sentence, notwithstanding the peculiar circumstances of this case, which was less than two years. 
     
      
    44 As I have said, It was submitted that his Honour had fallen into error in respect of his views concerning the availability of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court. I have already referred to this. As I have said, I agree his Honour here fell into error but the important question here is whether in the result the sentence or the non-parole period should be disturbed. 
     
      
    45 It was contended that it was incumbent upon his Honour to pass a sentence with an associated non-parole period such that both reflected the objective seriousness of the offence and the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    46 On behalf of the respondent, Mr. Hulme of Senior Counsel, whilst accepting that the trial judge generally found the respondent’s evidence unconvincing and unimpressive, pointed to his Honour’s acceptance of the general substance of her evidence as to her vulnerability to drugs and her relationship at the time of the offence with Coburn and the effect of Coburn’s threats upon her. It was contended that the special and peculiar circumstances of this respondent permitted the trial judge, even in the context of being guided by the views expressed in Whyte (supra), to have imposed the sentence that he did. 
     
      
    47 These submissions, emphasising as they do, the most unusual features of this case, focus on the role of guideline judgments which, whilst operating as indicators of the proper range of sentences, are not intended to unduly circumscribe the application of a reasoned and principled discretion by the trial judge. 
     
      
    48 In this regard, proper attention, it was submitted, had to be paid to the Chief Justice’s reference in the sentence quoted from his judgment in Whyte (supra) above to the applicability of the sentence he referred to to the general case. It was submitted that the particular features of this case sufficiently took it out of the general such that the head sentence of 16 months was not outside the range of a proper exercise of discretion or was at least not so far out of the range as to attract appellate intervention by this court in the exercise of its discretion. 
     
      
    49 It was submitted that the peculiar features of the case were such that the remarkably short non-parole period was justified or at least should not be set aside by this court in the exercise of its discretion, considering all the circumstances. 
     
      
    50 I came to the conclusion that, notwithstanding particularly the non-parole period appear to me to be very short, I was not persuaded that this court should intervene having regard to the well known principles applicable to Crown appeals, and having regard to the peculiar circumstances of the case, notwithstanding the trial judge’s errors to which I have referred, since, although the sentence and particularly the non-parole period might have, notwithstanding the peculiar circumstances of this case, been appropriately characterised as manifestly inadequate at the time sentence was imposed, the respondent has already served the bulk of that non-parole period and the case is so unusual. 
     
      
    51 In particular, I was of this view because of the exceptional circumstances in which the respondent was placed at the time of the commission of this offence and that in my view it is in the community’s interests that a person who, notwithstanding the problems with which this respondent has had to cope over the years and who has coped with them otherwise so successfully, except when under this pressure, should receive, in the interests of the community for the future, an extended period on parole during which the rehabilitation process may be reinforced.  
     
      
    52 I therefore, having regard to those matters, considered that the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
     
      
    2 GREG JAMES, J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Maguire in the District Court of New South Wales on 23 January 2003 in respect of an offence under s.25(1) of the Drug (Misuse & Trafficking) Act 1985 of supply prohibited drug, to wit, ecstasy, committed by the applicant on 16 August 2002. 
     
      
    3 The offence was punishable by a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $200,000. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had adhered before his Honour on 23 January 2003 to the plea of guilty he had entered before a magistrate on 16 August 2002 pursuant to s.51A of the Justice Act 1902. 
     
      
    5 The applicant came forward at the time of sentence aged 56 years, having been born on 8 October 1946. He had been fined on 16 July 2002 at the Downing Centre Local Court $300 for possessing a prohibited drug and on 18 February 2003 had been fined $50 at the Central Local Court for using a vehicle which did not comply with the standard. 
     
      
    6 The learned trial judge imposed upon him a sentence of imprisonment for three years to date from the imposition of that sentence on 23 January 2003 with a non-parole period of two years to commence the same date. 
     
      
    7 The applicant had been on bail from the day following his arrest, but had been subject to stringent conditions requiring reporting three times per week and to continue to reside at his home premises. 
     
      
    8 His Honour referred to the statement of facts in his remarks on sentence. I take the following statement from his Honour’s reference to those matters:- 
     
      
       
        
        “At 1.20 am on Thursday 16 August 2002, police observed the defendant leaving the premises at 110 Cathedral Street, Woolloomooloo with two other male persons. The defendant, in the company of these two males, entered into vehicle KOS-00N, a black coloured Nissan Skyline sedan, which was parked and unattended upon the southern kerb of Cathedral Street approximately 10 metres east of the intersection of Riley Street, Woolloomooloo. 
        
       
       
        
        Upon reaching the intersection of William Lane, police stopped the defendant and subjected him to a roadside breath test, which proved negative. He then produced his New South Wales driver’s licence number 3493 LX and as a consequence, a routine check was made upon the defendant’s vehicle and his licence. Certain information was received from police radio. As a result, the defendant and his two male passengers were removed from the vehicle and searched. When the defendant’s person was searched, police located an amount of Australian currency in the left hand pocket of his cargo trousers. 
        
       
       
        
        This amount of cash totalled $4,050 (81 x $50). A further amount of Australian currency was located within the defendant’s wallet. This amount of cash totalled $790 (4 x $100, 5 x $50, 6 x $20, 1 x $10, 2 x $5). The defendant was then cautioned regarding the money. He informed police the cash was winning proceeds on poker machines at the Star City Casino. The police then searched the defendant’s vehicle. Located in the front off-side driver’s floor mat was four plastic resealable bags containing a total of 92 tablets of varying colours. 
        
       
       
        
        The defendant was cautioned in relation to the tablets to which the defendant then identified the tablets as being ecstasy. The tablets were then photographed in situ. The defendant was arrested and conveyed to the Kings Cross Police Station and placed into the holding cell. He was then given a s.10A which was explained to him. At 2.20 am the defendant was removed from the holding cell and witnesses the weighing of the tablets (27.80 grams). The drugs were placed in drug bag number B199196. The defendant was given the opportunity to complete a handwritten statement or participate in an electronic interview. 
        
       
       
        
        At 4.12 am the defendant was subjected to an electronic interview to which he made certain admissions. The defendant admitted using ecstasy for the past 12 months. The defendant advised the police he’d purchased ‘two thousand something’ dollars worth of ecstasy tablets from an Indonesian male known only as Abdul in the disco section of the Star City Casino. The defendant advised police the cost of each tablet was worth ‘$25 each’ for ‘around about 80 tablets’. 
        
       
       
        
        When questioned regarding the Australian currency, the defendant stated ‘I won $10,400 the night before’ (15/8/02), on the poker machines and then ‘some more at the casino tonight’ (16/8/02). When asked the purpose of his buying the ecstasy tablets, the defendant informed police ‘You don’t usually hear the music at the disco’ and to share with his friends in the Double Bay region. At 4.35 am the electronic interview was terminated and adopted by Sergeant Purvis.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour concluded that the applicant’s early plea of guilty should attract substantial consideration for its utilitarian value, but did not quantify that consideration. His Honour noted that the offender was caught with the drugs in his possession but made immediate admissions. He referred to a probation report tendered in evidence disclosing that the prisoner was then a single man aged 54 who had, except for the matters to which I have referred, a clear criminal history. He had been maintaining good relations with his ex-wife and his two daughters, but had become a persistent gambler, frequenting Star City Casino were he had, on occasions, gambled his entire weekly income. His Honour referred to the conclusion of the Probation and Parole Officer that the applicant was addicted to gambling, but noted that the appellant had been substantially employed over many years.10 On his arrest, the applicant had been found in possession of a considerable amount of money. Records produced from the Star City Casino in answer to subpoena confirmed that his account that he had obtained the money from winnings at the Casino was consistent with the Casino’s records. As to that, however, his Honour said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, these records do not disclose how much money was invested, and accordingly it is impossible to calculate whether the prisoner was a net winner. There is a truly remarkable coincidence between the frequency of those involved with drugs who also have in their possession large sums of money, the proceeds of successful gambling activities. I do not make any finding as to this aspect, I simply note that those who are involved with drugs seem to be lucky gamblers.” 
        
       
      
    11 At this portion of his remarks on sentence, his Honour does not relate his observations to the particular case of this applicant, although his Honour goes on later to say that he was sceptical of the prisoner’s account as given in the record of interview and would not automatically accept what he told the police was a reliable account. His Honour then adverted to the fact that the applicant did not give evidence and concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, I am entirely unconvinced as to the accuracy of all that he told the police.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour then referred to the applicant’s account that he had purchased the ecstasy tablets from funds supplied by friends who were to use the drug at a party and expressed the view that the applicant had been at pains to minimise his own drug use in what he told the police. His Honour said in this regard:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am not prepared to accept that the prisoner simply purchased the ecstasy tablets for some $2,000 with a view to simply handing them over to friends at a party on a non-commercial basis.” 
        
       
      
    13 This, of course, was not a positive conclusion of any involvement in substantial commercial activity, nor does his Honour later come to such a conclusion. 
     
      
    14 His Honour then adverted to frequent statements of the Court of Criminal Appeal that custodial sentences are normally required whether or not a profit has been obtained for “trafficking alone in any substantial degree”. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentences involving substantial deterrence are to be imposed on drug traffickers, and only in exceptional circumstances would a non-custodial sentence be appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        I hold no doubt that the prisoner obtained the drugs for the purposes of supply and for the purpose of reward, albeit there is no evidence by which I could accurately gauge the financial benefit to him. 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour said of the applicant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not regard the prisoner as a Mr. Big in the drug supply scene, but nevertheless he was engaged in supplying some 92 tablets or thereabouts, involving some 27.5 grams, many times the trafficable quantity.” 
        
       
      
    16 He adverted to whether right thinking members of the community were justifiably frustrated and angered by a seeming impunity enjoyed by those who supply drugs and that when such persons were successfully prosecuted there should be a “meaningful price to pay”. He expressed the view that “some other would be Mr. Chong will be deterred when news of this sentence is published”. However, his Honour concluded that special circumstances lying in the prisoner’s age and his not having previously served a sentence existed warranting a variation of the non-parole to parole period ratio. Presumably by this, his Honour was referring to an extension to the parole period such as would arise by reason of the variation of the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. His Honour did impose a non-parole period of two years in respect of the sentence he imposed of three years expressed to be a significant, if not substantial, reduction below the normal statutory proportion. Regrettably, his Honour failed to make an order under s.50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 directing that the applicant be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    17 It will be necessary whatever otherwise might be the outcome of the appeal for such an order to be made. 
     
      
    18 One ground of appeal was articulated in support of the appeal. That ground was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge erred in respect of the proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence.” 
        
       
      
    19 For my own part, I find such a ground difficult to understand. In Regina v. Simpson (2001) 126 A. Crim. R. 525, this court constituted by five judges examined the principles underlying the fixing of non-parole periods as they had existed under various sentencing regimes in New South Wales. Subsequently to Simpson (supra), the legislation with which Simpson (supra) was concerned has been amended. A new s.44 has been provided which requires the court to first set a non-parole period for the sentence and then refer to the balance of the term of the sentence. That provision applies to all offences committed on or after 1 February 2003. 
     
      
    20 Its predecessor applicable to the circumstances of this applicant’s offence required the court:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) firstly, to set the term of the sentence, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) secondly, to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).” 
        
       
      
    21 By s.44(2) it is provided that the non-parole period must not be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence unless the court decides there are special circumstances for it being less. No provision was made by the statute to the extent to which the non-parole period may be less or for any particular proportion for the non-parole period to the entire sentence to be observed once special circumstances had been found. 
     
      
    22 The nature of the relationship between the non-parole period and the total term once special circumstances have been found, is governed by the general principles of sentencing law including those relating to the nature and purpose of parole: Regina v. GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376. It is important to note that an appropriate non-parole period in a given case whilst reflecting the considerations appropriate to the fixing of sentence generally: see Bugmy v. The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525, must be fixed having regard to the different purpose for the two parts of the sentence: Bugmy (supra) at 531 and be referrable to all the relevant considerations applicable in the particular case. 
     
      
    23 Thus, those matters which operate as factors in the synthesis may be reflected differently when weighed from the point of view of the fixing of a head sentence to when weighed from the point of view of fixing a non-parole period. But, as the review of the authorities to be found in the judgment of the Chief Justice in Simpson (supra) shows the non-parole period remains the minimum period of imprisonment which the offender must serve before being given the benefit of mitigation of punishment by the prospect of being released on conditional liberty: see Power v. The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623 having regard to all the circumstances. 
     
      
    24 As that review of the authorities makes clear, rehabilitation still remains an important factor, particularly when coming to fix an appropriate non-parole period. 
     
      
    25 In my view the concern on this appeal is not as to some legal error in expressing the proportion of the non-parole period to the overall sentence arising from the fixing of the individual non-parole period, but whether or not the sentence or the non-parole period, having regard to all relevant considerations, are inappropriate to the crime of the offender and the offender’s circumstances such that appellate intervention under s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is called for. 
     
      
    26 The particular circumstances of a case may mean a longer non-parole period and thus a shorter parole period or visa versa may need to be imposed. It may be that because of the statutory proportion, the fixing of a head sentence in the absence of special circumstances will mean that the non-parole period is defined by the statute. But once special circumstances are found, then it is for the trial judge consistent with the general principles and the exercise of a proper discretion to consider in the circumstances of the particular offender and the particular case what is, having regard to the importance of such matters as rehabilitation and objective seriousness, the minimum period of imprisonment an offender should serve for the particular crime and in compliance s.44, to do that (as that section stood at that time) in the context of having first focused on the length of the head sentence. 
     
      
    27 It can be seen that in an individual case all this may involve a delicate balance to ensure that the components of a proper sentence and non-parole period all rightly observe the relevant requirements, having regard to the important circumstances of the individual case. 
     
      
    28 It was contended in oral argument, that the trial judge had failed to consider whether other circumstances to those to which he had referred, that is, the prior clean record and age of the appellant, merited a reduction of the non-parole period. In particular, it was argued that his Honour had erred in appearing to consider the evidence concerning the applicant’s winnings as not sufficient to displace any suggestion of any substantial commercial benefit from this sale on his part. After all, the 92 tablets of ecstasy had not been sold. Apparently his Honour was seeking to consider that commercial activity of a substantial kind would be undertaken by the supply of the 92 tablets. 
     
      
    29 Reference was made to the statistics from the Judicial Commission which indicated that a non-parole period was at the top of the range for such offences as this on a plea of guilty and that this applicant was entitled to the full utilitarian discount for the plea and his prior good character.  
     
      
    30 It was submitted that the evidence showed the applicant did not appreciate the seriousness of his offence and particular regard was paid to the Probation and Parole Officer’s report which seemed to accept that the applicant was upset at being treated like a criminal and did not appear to acknowledge or understand the illegality of his actions. It was submitted that it was clear the applicant would find the experience of imprisonment more onerous than the average offender, although it appears to me that this is the matter to which his Honour was adverting when he referred to the combination of the applicant’s age and this being his first sentence. 
     
      
    31 It was put that the issues relating to drug use and gambling addiction plainly required in the community’s interest a longer than usual term to facilitate rehabilitation. 
     
      
    32 On behalf of the Crown, it was submitted his Honour adverted to those matters and that all the circumstances of the case required an appropriate minimum term of incarceration. It was submitted that the period fixed by his Honour, notwithstanding that it was at the top of the range and that this was plainly a case in which the circumstances might have mitigated towards a non-parole period somewhat less, nonetheless this non-parole period fell within the range of an appropriate exercise of discretion such that no error of the kind referred to in House v. The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 existed. 
     
      
    33 I am unable to accept that submission. Once one accepts that it is not a matter of retaining some relationship by way of externally prescribed ratio based on considerations of how long each of the components of a valid sentence should be in relation to the other, once special circumstances are found and once one accepts that the appropriate course is to impose a non-parole period which is the minimum period the offender should spend incarcerated before having an opportunity (which might come at any time or not come at all until the end of the sentence) to be released on conditional supervised liberty, the focus of the enquiry in an appeal such as this will be on whether the non-parole period, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, fell within the range of the proper exercise of a discretion which was required to focus on the length of that minium period not the proportion the non-parole period bore to the head sentence. His Honour recognised this was a case for a reduced non-parole period. He did not advert to any considerations other than the offender’s first time in custody and age as warranting the reduction of the non-parole period from the statutory proportion to the two years non-parole period he imposed. He appears to have approached the task by seeking to vary the usually pre-determined ratio rather than by seeking to find that minimum period to which I have referred. 
     
      
    34 In my view, the non-parole period failed to have regard to all relevant factors mitigating that period and which it was appropriate be taken into account to determine what was an appropriate non-parole period. Such a period would, in my view, have provided for a longer parole period which would have met the need in this case for a longer period to be available for the offender’s rehabilitation and opportunity to be released. But that is incidental except insofar as the length of that period bears upon how long the non-parole period should be. 
     
      
    35 In my view, a non-parole period of 18 months would, taking all relevant matters into account, have been appropriate as the minimum period in all the circumstances the offender should serve. I therefore consider that the matters meeting the necessary criteria in s.6(3) have been made out. 
     
      
    36 For these reasons, I would propose that leave to appeal be granted; the appeal allowed; the sentence confirmed; the non-parole period imposed be quashed; and a non-parole period of 18 months be imposed to commence on 22 January 2003 and to expire on 21 July 2004 should be imposed and a direction should be given that the applicant be released to parole on the expiration of that non-parole period, but that it be recommended that he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and a requirement that he obey all reasonable directions of that Service including, in particular, directions concerning his gambling and drug use.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with the reasons of Howie J for the orders previously made by the Court. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: On 1 October this Court made orders allowing the appeal and quashing the convictions and sentences arising from trials before Judge Twigg. The Court ordered a new trial in respect of the charges upon which the applicant had been convicted. These are my reasons for concurring in the making of those orders. 
     
      
    3 The appellant stood trial before Judge Twigg and a jury on two separate occasions for offences of child sexual assault offences allegedly committed against two of his daughters. The first trial related to the complainant K.I. and commenced on 25 February 2002. On 5 March 2002 the jury convicted the appellant of four counts involving offences under each of ss 61E(1), 66A, 61E(2A) and 61E(1)(A) of the Crimes Act. The second trial related to the complainant M.I. and commenced on 4 March 2002. On 8 March 2002 the jury convicted the appellant of two counts being an offence under s 66A and an offence under s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    4 On 20 June 2002 Judge Twigg sentenced the appellant as follows. In respect of the convictions relating to K.I. as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) imprisonment for 2 years to date from 10 May 2000; 
         
         
        (ii) imprisonment for 5 years to date from 10 May 2000; 
         
         
        (iii) imprisonment for 2 years to date from 10 May 2000; 
         
         
        (iv) imprisonment for 3 years to date from 10 May 2000. 
        
       
       
      His Honour declined to fix a non-parole period in respect of any of these sentences because of the sentence that he was to impose upon the fourth count in the second indictment. The date of 10 May 2000 was the date upon which the appellant first went into custody. 
       
      
    5 In respect of the convictions relating to M.I. and arising from the second indictment, his Honour sentenced the appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (i) 10 years imprisonment to date from 5 May 2005 with a non-parole period of 5 years to expire on 9 May 2010; 
         
         
        (ii) imprisonment for 5 years to date from 10 May 2000. 
        
       
      
    6 The effective head sentence was, therefore, 15 years imprisonment to date from 10 May 2000 with an overall non-parole period of 10 years. The appellant is eligible for release to parole on 9 May 2010. 
     
      
    7 There is only one ground of appeal against conviction being: 
     
      
       
        
         
        A miscarriage of justice occurred due to the absence at the trial of evidence which was not available at the time of the trial. 
        
       
       
      The fresh evidence, which is relied upon in support of this ground of appeal, is psychiatric and psychological evidence as to the accused’s fitness to stand trial at the time of the two trials with which the appeal is concerned. A number of reports have been placed before us which relate to the appellant’s mental state at various times both during and subsequent to the trials before Judge Twigg. 
       
      
    8 The question as to the appellant’s fitness arose following the second trial. The appellant was to stand trial on two further indictments one relating to allegations of sexual misconduct raised by his son R.I. and the other to allegations of a third complainant, R.P. of a similar nature to those the subject of the trials with which this Court is now concerned. 
     
      
    9 As a result of disquiet felt by his legal representatives about the appellant’s mental state, a psychologist, Katherine Barrier, was asked to assess him. In a report dated 14 March 2002 Ms Barrier indicated that the issue of his fitness could not be answered until he was assessed by a psychiatrist. In the course of her report Ms Barrier stated, with regard to the appellant's presentation to her at the time of her interview with him: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He was mentally oriented and alert throughout the meeting but there were signs of psychomotor slowing and lethargy. He was only able to give a very sketchy personal history. Whilst there were no critical indications of thought disorder, he reports hearing voices and it is noted he is on antipsychotic medication. 
        
       
       
      Ms Barrier concluded from IQ tests administered to the appellant that he would fall within the Mildly Intellectually Handicapped category so far as his general functioning was concerned. In respect of this finding, she stated: 
       
        
         
        Whilst [the appellant’s] IQ test results alone would not necessarily preclude him from giving consistent evidence to the Court providing the recommended allowances for those with an intellectual disability are made, it is certainly possible that other factors, namely his mental health status, likely specific organic deficits from chronic substance abuse and stress about giving evidence, are further eroding already very limited memory functions. 
        
       
      
    10 On 18 March 2002, as a result of the tender of this report, Phelan DCJ adjourned the trial that was to have commenced on that day so that the appellant’s mental condition could be further assessed. 
     
      
    11 In a report dated 10 April 2002 Dr Wong, a psychiatrist briefed by the Crown, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As mentioned above, the accused had a satisfactory knowledge of the criminal justice system which is certainly adequate for him to stand trial. I agree with Ms Barrier that his subnormal intelligence by itself probably would not render him unfit to be tried. 
         
         
        The accused was alleged to have committed the offences on [R.P.] between the years 1982 and 1987. He was not aware that such was the case and appeared unconcerned when told. As well, he did not bother to find out other details of the allegations and dismissed them as unimportant. In relation to pleading not guilty, all he would like to tell his solicitor was that he did not do it and that the victims lied. He was happy to leave it at that and say no more. I am not suggesting he was disabled because he was unable to come up with a credible defence. It might well be that there was not any. What concerned me was the observation that he did not appear to be motivated or have the incentive to defend himself. This could be put down to his undue indifference and apathy. Such emotional abnormalities are not by themselves severe. However, coupled with his subnormal intelligence and perhaps some memory impairment, they would I feel render him incapable of giving meaningful instructions. As well, these disabilities, acting in combination, would adversely affect his ability to follow the evidence given by witnesses and the court proceedings generally. 
         
         
        I am therefore of the opinion that the accused was not fit to be tried. 
        
       
      
    12 By a report dated 3 May 2002, Dr Westmore, a psychologist retained by the defence, found that the appellant was “on his current clinical presentation, unfit to be tried”. The Doctor was of the opinion that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The appellant] qualifies for the diagnosis of alcohol abuse and substance abuse. His current clinical presentation is consistent with either a chronic schizophrenic illness with a significant mood state component or a chronic depressive illness with a psychotic component. He is also of compromised intelligence. 
         
         
        [The appellant] is a fifty-four year old man who is on his current clinical presentation, unfit to be tried. While he presents clinically as being of dull intelligence, he has had I note limited education. I concur with the opinion of the psychologist, that his intellectual deficit problems would not in and of themselves result in him being unfit to be tried. 
         
         
        His [un]fitness arises from his overall cognitive impairment which is being impacted upon by his mental illness. His mental illness also is adversely impacting on his fitness to be tried. 
         
         
        While a definitive diagnosis may be unclear, the history would suggest this man has a chronic mental illness of some type. The essential features on his current presentation are his blunted affect, his flat unresponsive depressed mood state and his reported auditory hallucinations. He has in addition memory difficulties and some comprehension problems in relation to the Presser issues. 
         
         
        I note in the brief provided to me that during his previous trials [the appellant] appeared tired and ill, he was observed to sweat and drink large amounts of water. The consumption of a large amount of water may arise as result of the dry mouth occurring secondary to antipsychotic medications and/or antidepressants and/or levels of anxiety. Long term use of some antipsychotic medication can produce the side effect of polydipsia. You note in addition that his instructions did not always correlate with the evidence he had given or with earlier instructions. You note he only had vague recollections at times of being asked certain questions and that he provided different responses to the same question 
         
         
        These descriptions by you of [the appellant] are consistent with his current presentation. I think he would be a most unreliable witness both in evidence and in chief and this unreliability arises from his intellectual problems and his chronic mental illness. 
         
         
        I do not believe that [the appellant] would be able to attend and concentrate or follow a trial adequately, he would not be able to provide [his legal representatives] with instructions regarding the allegations or ongoing instructions during the course of a trial. He would miss critical aspects of the trial due to his intellectual and psychiatric problems. 
        
       
      
    13 The Crown requested that Dr Wong review his opinion having regard to material arising from the two trials before Judge Twigg and the evidence given by the appellant on sentence. By a report dated 1 August 2002 Dr Wong indicated that he was prepared to stand by his earlier opinion. During the course of his report, Dr Wong referred to specific parts of the evidence given by the appellant during the two trials and during the sentencing hearing on 20 June 2002. Dr Wong stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The answers referred to above were consistent with and in some cases, highly suggestive of him having difficulty in adequately grasping the questions asked and/or having an impaired memory and thereby being disadvantaged. In some instances, it was fairly obvious from the answers themselves that such disabilities existed. In other instances, this was not as readily evident and unwarranted adverse inferences might be drawn, thereby further disadvantaging him. 
         
         
        While giving evidence, he was asked to recall certain past events. I am unable to determine whether some of the answers he gave were factually accurate. As well, I was unable to say whether they were genuine. It was therefore difficult for me to determine, by cruising the documents, to what extent he had been disadvantaged by his memory impairment. 
         
         
        …………………………………. 
         
         
        In conclusion, the documents made available to me tended to bear out the presence in him of the disabilities identified in my last report. Having very carefully reviewed the matter, I stand by my conclusion the accused is unfit to be tried. 
         
         
        Some of the documents perused indicated that he was capable of making mitigatory or exculpatory statements……….. This was not inconsistent with the presence of the disabilities in him. As I stated in my last report, his disabilities were not profound and I did not consider they were such as would preclude him from making such statements. I reached my conclusion on his fitness on the basis that notwithstanding his capacity in this regard, he would nevertheless be significantly disadvantaged by his disabilities. In his report, Dr Westmore referred to the observations by the accused's legal representatives that ""his instructions did not always correlate with the evidence he had given or with earlier instructions"" and that ""he only had vague recollections at times of being asked certain questions and that he provided different responses to the same question during his trials"". These were the more subtle difficulties I envisaged he would have as a result of his disabilities. 
         
         
        In the records of interviews on 30 March 2000 and 11 May 2000, he provided laconic and at times monosyllabic answers. Most of them were reasonably to the point. It was when he gave extended answers that they became rather rambling and at times difficult to follow. However, answers similar to those I noted in the more recent documents were not found. They were also not found in his evidence given on 15 March 2001. It is thus possible that there has been some deterioration in him over the past year. I can only speculate on the possible causation. It might be the result of a progressive dementing process or the side effects of the increased dosage of his medication. In any case, as mentioned above, for the purpose of determining his fitness to be tried, it is his more recent level of functioning as revealed in the more recent documents that is more relevant. 
        
       
      
    14 On 19 September 2002 Judge Phelan, after a fitness hearing, found that the appellant was unfit to be tried in respect of the indictment relating to R.I. and referred the appellant to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
     
      
    15 By report dated 12 February 2003 Dr Westmore, after reviewing the evidence of the appellant at the two trials before Judge Twigg, concluded that the appellant was unfit to stand trial on both occasions. Dr Westmore was of the opinion that, given the chronic nature of the appellant’s abnormalities observed by both him and Dr Wong after the trials, the abnormalities were likely to have been present and impacting upon the appellant in February and March 2002. 
     
      
    16 On 30 May 2003, after a fitness hearing, Judge Phelan found the appellant unfit to stand trial in respect of the indictment relating to R.P. 
     
      
    17 On 13 August 2003 the Mental Health Tribunal concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, the appellant would not become fit to stand trial during a period of 12 months after he was found unfit to stand trial. 
     
      
    18 On 19 September 2003 Dr Wong made a further report to the Crown in respect of the question whether the appellant was unfit to stand trial at the time of the trials before Judge Twigg. In the course of that report Dr Wong stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Most of the disabilities present in him when seen on 2.4.02 were slowly evolving. They were unlikely to fluctuate significantly in severity within, say, five to six weeks. The two trials in question took place from 25.2.02 to 5.3.02 and from 4.3.02 to 8.3.02 respectively. When I examined him, it was just over a month after the commencement of the earlier of the two trials. I am of the opinion that more likely than not, his disabilities were in place during the two trials, thus rendering him unfit to be tried at the time. It was unlikely that there would be any significant difference in his functioning then compared with his functioning on 2.4.02. 
         
         
        In my report of 1.8.02, I observed that there was some apparent deterioration when his functioning in March 2000, May 2000 and March 2001 on the one hand, was compared with his functioning in February and March 2002 on the other hand. However, that occurred over a significantly longer period of time. 
         
         
        In coming to my conclusion that he was unfit to be tried at the two trials in February and March 2002, I did not rely on my assessment, based on my perusal of the transcripts of his evidence as to the extent to which he was disadvantaged at those trials by his disabilities. As I indicated in my report of 1.8.02, ”I did not follow the trials and did not have the opportunity to observe his demeanour and assess the answers he gave in the context of the other available evidence”. Furthermore, it was my opinion that his disabilities would render him incapable of giving meaningful instructions and adversely affect his ability to follow the evidence given by witnesses and the court proceedings generally. Such disabilities were not adequately revealed in his evidence. 
        
       
      
    19 The final two sentences, in particular, of the last paragraph Dr Wong's report quoted above reveal an apparent deficiency in the material provided to this Court in support of this ground of appeal. There is no direct evidence of any inability of the appellant during the trials before Judge Twigg to instruct his legal representatives or to follow adequately the evidence given by witnesses and the proceedings generally. No material has been placed before this Court to indicate why it was that his legal representatives determined to have the question of his fitness considered by a psychologist in April 2002. However, there is a reference in Dr Westmore’s first report to observations by his legal representatives as to some difficulties that the appellant appeared to experience in relation to questioning while giving evidence. 
     
      
    20 For completeness I should note that there was material before Judge Twigg at the sentencing hearing of the appellant that indicated that the appellant was suffering from a psychotic disorder and would be a “mentally ill person” for the purposes of the Mental Health Act. 
     
      
    21 The Crown concedes that, based upon all the material available, the appellant was unfit at the time of the trials before Judge Twigg. It is unnecessary for this Court to determine whether the appellant was unfit at that time. In order to enliven this Court’s jurisdiction, it is sufficient if there is material before the Court raising a question as to the appellant’s fitness to stand trial before Judge Twigg. If such material exists, the Court has to determine whether there was the possibility of a miscarriage of justice arising. If the appellant was unfit at the time of the two trials before Judge Twigg, each of those trials was a nullity and the convictions would have to be quashed. 
     
      
    22 In Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1 the High Court was concerned with the question of whether the Federal Court had power to raise the issue of the appellant’s fitness to stand trial in the absence of any ground of appeal relating to that issue and where it had not been raised by the parties either at the trial or on appeal. In considering that question some members of the Court considered the response of an appellate court where an issue arises as to the appellant’s fitness to stand trial for the first time on appeal. 
     
      
    23 Gaudron J stated (footnotes not reproduced): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [86] 
          
        Unless there is material to suggest otherwise, a person is presumed fit to plead. And that is so both at trial and on appeal. At trial however, that presumption is displaced if there is material which raises a question as to that person's fitness to plead. Moreover, if there is a question as to the accused person's fitness to plead, the trial must stop unless and until the appropriate body determines that he or she is fit to plead.  
         
         
        [87] 
          
        Once it is accepted that the law acknowledges that a person who is not fit to plead may also lack the capacity to raise that issue, it must follow that the role of an appellate court differs from that of a trial judge in one respect only, namely, that it looks to the past whereas the trial judge is concerned with events as they are happening. 
         More precisely, if there is material suggesting that the appellant was not fit to plead, an appellate court must inquire whether, at the time of the trial, the appropriate tribunal could not reasonably have found the appellant not fit to plead 
        . (my underlining) 
        
       
      
    24 Hayne J stated (footnotes not reproduced): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [319] 
          
        The Full Court was bound to set aside the conviction if there was a miscarriage of justice. And there is a miscarriage of justice if an accused is put to trial when that accused  
        may not 
         have been fit to plead and stand trial. That is, to adopt the terms used earlier, there is a miscarriage of justice if there is a real and substantial question to be considered about the accused's fitness. The conclusion that there is a miscarriage if the accused  
        may not 
         have been fit follows from the decisions in this Court and in intermediate appellate courts in which questions of fitness have been raised on appeal. There the question for the appellate court has been treated as being whether there was a question as to the accused's fitness, not whether the appellate court was persuaded that the accused was not fit.  
        Only if the appellate court is affirmatively persuaded that no tribunal, acting reasonably, could conclude that the accused was not fit, may that court determine that no miscarriage of justice has occurred and only then could the question of fitness be put aside 
        .  
         
         
        [320] 
          
        A conclusion by a Court of Criminal Appeal that an accused  
        may not 
         have been fit to plead or stand trial requires the court to quash the conviction. There has been a trial where the accused may not have been fit and that is a miscarriage of justice. But the further question which then arises is, what consequential order should be made?  
        If the appellate court were affirmatively persuaded that the material before it demonstrated that the accused was not fit, not only would the conviction be set aside, the appellate court would make such order as the trial judge should have made on such a finding. If, however, as would ordinarily be the case, the appellate court could not reach that affirmative conclusion, it would set aside the conviction and order a retrial, thus allowing the statutorily prescribed tribunal to determine the issue of fitness. 
         This was what was done by this Court in  
        Kesavarajah 
         and it is what has often been done by intermediate courts in cases where it was said that the trial judge should have concluded that there was a case for investigation of the accused's fitness. 
         
         
        [321] 
          
        In this respect the question of fitness does not differ from many cases which come before a Court of Criminal Appeal. In some cases of miscarriage of justice, the court will set aside the conviction and order a new trial; in others, it will set aside the conviction and order the entry of a verdict of acquittal. There is no reason to say of cases where fitness to plead first emerges as an issue on appeal that a Court of Criminal Appeal must itself try that issue to finality and decide whether unfitness is demonstrated.  
         
         
        [322] 
          
        Cases of fresh evidence offer a useful analogy in some, but not all, respects. If evidence which was not available at trial is adduced on an appeal against conviction, and if there is a significant possibility that a jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused if the evidence had been before it, the unavailability of that evidence amounts to a miscarriage of justice. Miscarriage of justice is not confined to cases of demonstrated error at trial. Further, the assessment of evidence (at least evidence going to the issue of guilt) is ordinarily a matter for the tribunal of fact -- the jury -- not for the appellate court. It follows that, ordinarily, in such a case, the appellate court sets the conviction aside and orders a new trial. But, as Barwick CJ pointed out in  
        Ratten v The Queen 
         [(1974) 131 CLR 510 at 518], there may be cases where the new evidence persuades the appellate court that the accused is innocent, or at least that a reasonable jury must entertain a doubt as to guilt. In such a case the conviction would be set aside and a verdict of acquittal entered.  
         
         
        [323] 
          
        The analogy with cases of fresh evidence breaks down, in my view, in relation to the degree of persuasion the appellate court must have that the relevant issue is a live issue. (In a fresh evidence case, the issue is of guilt or innocence; in the present case, it is the issue of fitness to plead.) Gallagher held that there must be a ""significant possibility"" of acquittal, although Gibbs CJ warned against regarding the particular form of expression adopted as ""an incantation that will resolve the difficulties of every case"". How to formulate the quality which must attach to fresh evidence to ground a successful appeal was considered further in  
        Mickelberg 
         [(1989) 167 CLR 259 at 273, 274, 301-302] but it is not necessary, for present purposes, to stay to consider details of that discussion. Fitness to plead, going as it does to whether there could be a trial, raises different issues from those that arise in relation to cases of fresh evidence. In cases of fresh evidence (where guilt has already been decided by a jury) there is the competing consideration of the desirability of treating jury verdicts as final. No such issue intrudes in relation to fitness to plead for, as I have said, the issue is not guilt or innocence of the charge or how the trial should have proceeded. 
         The issue is whether there should have been a trial. Accordingly, I consider the appropriate test in the present case to be as I have stated earlier: must the Tribunal, if the question had been put to it and it had acted reasonably, have found the accused to be fit to plead and stand trial? 
         (my underlining) 
        
       
      
    25 The High Court gave further consideration to the impact of a finding of unfitness on a criminal conviction after trial and the approach of an appellant court to the issue of fitness being raised on an appeal against that conviction in Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) (2003) 77 ALJR 1122. That case was concerned with whether an inquiry into the guilt of an accused under s 475 of the Crimes Act (ACT) could encompass an inquiry as to the accused fitness to be tried. In holding that it could, Heydon J stated (footnotes not reproduced): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [114] An essential function of the criminal trial is to minimise the risk that innocent persons will be convicted. It does this by ensuring that the prosecution case, taken as a whole, consists of potentially reliable evidence presented in an unprejudiced manner. The legal system is prepared to tolerate some lack of concordance between those who are convicted and those who are in truth guilty, in the sense that it is prepared to accept the practical possibility that some persons who are not innocent are acquitted. But it does not accept that any persons who are innocent should be convicted. Because it does not accept the latter outcome, it employs numerous means to prevent accused persons who are innocent from being convicted. Those means centre on the institutions and techniques used to ensure a fair trial - an independent judiciary and, where applicable, an independent jury; an ethical code binding the prosecution which is in part reflected in rules of law; the burden and standard of proof; the applicable rules of evidence; and the rule preventing an accused person from being tried unless that person is fit to plead. That last rule is among the key rules of criminal procedure which seek to ensure that a successful prosecution case rests on reliable evidence. If the accused is not fit to plead and stand trial, there can be no trial.  
         
         
        [115] If an appeal is allowed on the ground that an accused person was unfit to plead, it is not possible to apply the ""proviso"" that permits criminal appeals to be dismissed if the appellate court considers that, despite the ground of appeal having been made good, no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. That is because the case is one ""where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings"". There has been ""a fundamental failure in the trial process"". If the accused is not fit to plead, the key adversary in a partly adversarial proceeding falls below a minimum level of competence. In this case, if the appellant had been unfit to plead, it would mean that he was incapable of understanding what he had been charged with, or incapable of pleading to the charge, or incapable of exercising rights of jury challenge, or incapable of understanding that the trial was an inquiry into whether or not he did what he was charged with, or incapable of following the course of the proceedings, or incapable of understanding the substantive effect of the evidence given against him, or incapable of deciding what defence to rely on, or incapable of instructing legal representatives, or perhaps incapable of doing any combination of these things. If the appellant had been unfit to plead, there could have been no adequate testing of the Crown case in cross-examination; no adequate process of objection to inadmissible Crown evidence; no adequate process of preventing erroneous rulings by the trial judge; no proper attention given to the defence answer to the Crown case or to any proper case which the defence might have been well advised to advance, whether that answer or case be testimonial, documentary or otherwise; and no proper development of defence submissions. 
        
       
      
    26 The Crown has drawn the Court’s attention to the decision in R v Kent (NSWCCA, 25 September 1996, unreported). In that case a question of the appellant’s fitness arose after trial but before he was sentenced. The trial judge refused to pass sentence on the appellant, who then appealed against his conviction. This Court determined that the appropriate course for it to take was to return the matter to the District Court under s 12 of the Criminal Appeal Act so that there could be a fitness hearing. This was a course proposed by those appearing for the appellant and it was a course to which the Crown consented. The Court ordered that, if the appellant was found unfit, the finding was to be reported back to it. 
     
      
    27 The matter was returned to the District Court and the appellant was found unfit to be tried. However, the judge making that finding did not make an order pursuant to s 14 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act referring the appellant to the Mental Health Tribunal, notwithstanding the mandatory requirement to do so found in s 14(a). Instead the matter was again referred to this Court. It was not until 8 October 1998 that the matter came on for hearing. On that date the Court referred the appellant to the Mental Health Tribunal in accordance with s 14, see R v Kent (NSWCCA, 8 October 1998 unreported). 
     
      
    28 Before us the Crown has submitted that the procedure adopted in Kent should not be followed because there is no jurisdiction for a court to hold a fitness hearing after conviction and referred us to the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act in support of that submission. The provisions relevant to when a question of the accused’s fitness may be raised and the procedure to be adopted where the question is raised are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
        7. Time at which question of unfitness may be raised 
          
         
        (1)  
        The question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence is, so far as practicable, to be raised before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence but may be raised at any time during the course of the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence.  
         
        (2)  
        Nothing in this section prevents the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence from being raised on more than one occasion in respect of the same proceedings. 
         
         
        8. Procedure where question of unfitness raised before arraignment 
          
         
        (1)  
        If the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised at any time before the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Attorney General must determine whether an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offence.  
         
        (2)  
        The Attorney General may, at any time before the inquiry is commenced, determine that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted.  
         
         
        9. Procedure where question of unfitness raised after arraignment 
          
         
        If the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence, the Court must hear any submissions relating to the conducting of an inquiry in the absence of any jury which has been constituted for the purposes of the proceedings relating to the offence. 
         
        
       
       
        
        10. Procedure on raising question of unfitness  
         
        (1) If, in respect of an offence:  
         
          
          (a) the Attorney General determines that an inquiry should be conducted and does not subsequently determine, before the inquiry is commenced, that there is no longer any need for such an inquiry to be conducted, or  
           
          (b) the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for the offence is raised after the person is arraigned on a charge in respect of the offence,  
          
         
        the Court must (except as provided by this section), as soon as practicable after the Attorney General's determination is made or the question is raised, as the case may be, conduct an inquiry in order to determine whether the person is unfit to be tried for the offence.  
         
        (2) The Court must not conduct an inquiry into the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence unless it appears to the Court that the question has been raised in good faith.  
         
        (3) Before conducting an inquiry, the Court may do any one or more of the following:  
         
          
          (a) adjourn the proceedings,  
           
          (b) grant the accused person bail in accordance with the  
          Bail Act 1978 
          ,  
           
          (c) remand the accused person in custody for a period not exceeding 28 days,  
           
          (d) request the accused person to undergo a psychiatric examination or other examination,  
           
          (e) request that a psychiatric report or other report relating to the accused person be obtained,  
           
          (f) discharge any jury constituted for the purpose of those proceedings,  
           
          (g) make any other order that the Court considers appropriate.  
          
         
        (4) If, in respect of a person charged with an offence, the Court is of the opinion that it is inappropriate, having regard to the trivial nature of the charge or offence, the nature of the person's disability or any other matter which the Court thinks proper to consider, to inflict any punishment, the Court may determine not to conduct an inquiry and may dismiss the charge and order that the person be released.  
        
       
      
    29 In my view the Crown’s submission should be accepted. It is further supported by a consideration of the procedure laid down in the Act upon a finding of either fitness or unfitness. If the accused is found fit to be tried, the trial of the offence commences or continues: s 13 of the Act. If the accused is found unfit, the judge must refer the accused to the Mental Health Tribunal for a determination whether the accused will become fit within 12 months from the date of the hearing: s 14(a) of the Act. If the Tribunal determines that the accused will not become fit, there may be a special hearing directed: s 19 of the Act. This procedure is clearly not apposite to a situation where the accused has already been convicted of the offence in respect of which the question as to fitness has arisen. The provisions of the Act in relation to a special hearing and, in particular, the verdicts available at such a hearing cannot be sensibly applied where the accused has already been convicted of the offence to which the hearing relates. Similarly, s 23 of the Act, which is concerned with the fixing of a limiting term, can have no application where the accused has already been sentenced for the offence. 
     
      
    30 The Crown has pointed out that this Court has quashed a conviction in circumstances where the question of the accused fitness had been raised during the trial but the procedures of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act were not followed; R v Mailes (2001) 126 A Crim R 155 and R v Zhang [2000] NSWCCA 344. In each case it was held that there was a fundamental defect in the trial. 
     
      
    31 In light of the passages quoted above from Eastman v The Queen and Eastman v DPP (ACT) it seems to me that the procedure adopted in R v Kent is no longer appropriate. If there is material before this Court which raises a question about the propriety of the conviction because an appellant may have been unfit to stand trial, the Court should quash the conviction unless it is satisfied that, had the question been raised before or during the trial which led to the conviction, the court acting reasonably must have found that the accused was fit to stand trial. It is only if the Court can come to that finding that there will be no possibility of a miscarriage of justice. I do not believe that such a finding is open in the present case. Therefore, the convictions and sentences must be quashed and a new trial ordered. 
     
      
    32 SHAW J: I agree with Howie J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant was convicted of two charges of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s29D of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and sixteen charges of “structuring” transactions contrary to s31(1) of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) (“the FTRA”). The Applicant was successful in an appeal against conviction on the “structuring” charges (R v O’Driscoll [2003] NSWCCA 166). 
     
      
    2 In that judgment I said with respect to the newly raised sentencing appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “[113] The Appellant has not put on any submissions in this regard and should be given an opportunity to do so. It appears to me to be a matter that can be dealt with by way of writing, subject to any application to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal that an oral hearing occur. It will be desirable for the present bench to consider the sentence appeal, or at least two members of this bench should do so. It may be that when the submissions are filed, it will be appropriate for a direction to be made under s6AA of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912”. 
        
       
      
    3 Written submissions have been filed. There was no submission to the Registrar for an oral hearing. A direction was made under s6AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    4 The application for leave to appeal against sentence is based on the fact that in his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge took into account the illegality of the structuring events in the sentences he imposed for the two fraud charges. By reason of this Court’s decision, those events did not involve illegality. This Court quashed the convictions and entered a verdict of acquittal with respect to all of those charges. This is the error upon which the Applicant relies as the foundation of an appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    5 The conduct of the Applicant, on which the fraud charges were based, involved the operation by the Applicant of two companies, each of which pretended to be a labour hire company. The Applicant’s scheme involved the payment of wages to workers in the construction industry in the form of cash. The employers of workers in that industry would pay to the sham labour hire company the gross wages due to workers by way of a lump sum cheque. The operator of each company would then bank the cheque, convert the proceeds to cash and pay the workers their wages, or return the funds to the employer for payment to the workers, without deducting tax, but after deducting a commission for itself, generally of 7 percent. The amount of each employer’s cheque would usually represent the amount owed to the workers/sub-contractors. On occasions they were in excess of that amount. When that occurred the Applicant, in effect, assisted the owner of the business to claim a false deduction and evade tax by receiving cash. 
     
      
    6 The Crown case established the operation of the scheme in two distinct phases through two different companies. The two fraud charges related to each of these distinct periods. For two years commencing 1995 the scheme operated through Star Suppliers Pty Ltd (“Star”). From 1997 the scheme was operated in the name of A-Quip Hire Pty Ltd (“A-Quip”). 
     
      
    7 On the Crown case the Applicant controlled and directed each of these companies. He conducted their affairs through assumed names – O’Donovan in the case of Star and O’Neil in the case of A-Quip. He opened bank accounts and operated them in the assumed names. He filed false applications with the Australian Taxation Office for favourable treatment under the Prescribed Payments System (“PPS”) under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth), a scheme specifically directed to tax evasion by payment of wages in cash in the construction industry. 
     
      
    8 The cheques deposited over a period of twenty-four months in the case of Star amounted to $13,030,097 and in the case of A-Quip to $3,371,959. In each case the Applicant had issued false or blank invoices purporting to represent work carried out by Star or A-Quip on behalf of the business. The invoices were in the dollar amounts received by the Applicant but, because of the certificate falsely obtained from the ATO, there was no need for the businesses to remit Prescribed Payments to the ATO. 
     
      
    9 The Crown established that the specimen signature for the account holders in the name of either O’Donovan or O’Neil was in fact written by the Applicant. Similarly the signatures of hundreds of cheques used in the operation of the scheme in the name of either O’Donovan or O’Neil were also generally written by the Applicant, who did not contest that he had completed, signed and cashed the cheques. He was identified by a number of bank officers who had come to know him as a regular customer as either O’Donovan or O’Neil. 
     
      
    10 Before the sentencing judge the Commonwealth estimated the loss of remittances under the Prescribed Payments Scheme in an amount of $2,606,029 in the case of Star and $674,390 in the case of A-Quip. Furthermore, it is plain that the substantial proportion of the cash payments made to workers and their employers, indeed quite probably the overwhelming proportion of those payments, was never declared as income by the recipients of the cash. The fraudulent scheme operated by the Applicant led to a substantial but incalculable loss to the revenue. 
     
      
    11 On the calculations presented to the trial judge and not questioned on the appeal, the Applicant received in excess of $1.1 million as compensation for his criminal conduct. 
     
      
    12 Throughout the trial the Applicant maintained his innocence and claimed that he had conducted all of the transactions on behalf of a “Mr O’Donovan” a claim rejected by the jury. His Honour correctly identified this stance as manifesting a total lack of contrition with regard to the offences committed. His Honour also noted the seriousness of the offences, which appears from the maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment for an offence. 
     
      
    13 His Honour also made findings which, save for the reference to the contravention of Financial Transaction Reports Act, do not require qualification: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences reveal a premeditated scheme involving considerable planning which also involved the perpetration of very many criminal acts. The prisoner did not merely assist others to commit fraud, but provided a tax evasion service for which he was paid a commission. He provided blank and/or false invoices to conceal the fraud. He avoided the cash reporting provisions of the  
        Financial Transaction Reports Act  
        by making withdrawals under $10,000. He used false identities. The law has recognised in the past that offences of this kind are difficult to detect. The principle that generally in the case of a series of offences of defrauding the revenue, the element of general deterrence is of major importance and that usually such offences should receive full-time custodial sentences as has been referred to in a number of cases.” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour’s error, in the light of the quashing of the conviction on the FTRA offences is indicated in the following italicised extract from that part of his Honour’s reasons where he was considering the appropriate sentence for the FTRA offences. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner carried out those financial transactions as part of the scheme that he put in place to perpetrate the fraud on the revenue. Whilst it might be said that those transactions were not a necessary part of carrying out those frauds the fact that the transactions were carried out in the way they were, as transactions for amounts less than $10,000, considerably diminished the likelihood of detection.  
        The offences were therefore an integral part of the fraud and I have taken that fact into account as part of the commission of the fraud itself. 
         In the circumstances, whilst there is reason to regard these offences seriously, as previously said, in my view there is also the potential for double punishment if I were to accumulate sentence with respect to those charges, on the offences under s29D. …”. 
        
       
      
    15 The way his Honour had taken this matter into account appears from the previous extract I have quoted, i.e. as one of a number of different illegalities and improprieties involved in the process of implementing the fraudulent schemes. 
     
      
    16 His Honour’s reference to the fact that he had taken into account the FTRA offences “as part of the commission of the fraud” occurred in a context where he was explaining why he proposed to make the sentences for each set of FTRA offences concurrent with each of the fraud offences to which they related. 
     
      
    17 His Honour sentenced the Applicant to two years for each of the FTRA offences. With respect to the first of the s29D offences, relating to the company Star, his Honour imposed a fixed term of five years. In the case of the second of the s29D offences, with respect to the company A-Quip, his Honour also sentenced the Applicant to a period of five years but on this occasion fixed a non-parole period of two years and six months. 
     
      
    18 Of particular significance, however, was his Honour’s partial accumulation of the two sentences for the s29D offences. The term for the second offence commenced upon the expiration of two years and six months of the first offence, which accordingly became, in substance, a non-parole period for the first offence. Thereafter the non-parole period for the second offence came into effect. From the perspective of the Applicant the effect of the accumulation was to impose an effective head sentence of seven years and six months with a non-parole period of five years. 
     
      
    19 The subjective circumstances of the Applicant are fully set out in the remarks on sentence of the sentencing judge and it is unnecessary to repeat them. A number of additional factors have been brought to the attention of the Court by affidavit, particularly the steps taken by the Applicant to develop life skills in the prison environment and the fact that, by reason of his appeal to this Court, he has been kept in custody in the harsher environment of maximum security. 
     
      
    20 The sentencing judge referred to the decision of this Court in R v Patrick O’Connor [2002] NSWCCA 156 which involved a similar fraudulent scheme. The observations of Sully J and Smart AJ, with both of whom Handley JA agreed, are of assistance. The reasoning in that case must not be treated as if it were a precedent. Some of the submissions made in this application appear to treat the reasoning in that way. 
     
      
    21 There are important differences between the two cases. The subjective circumstances of the two offenders were completely different. Furthermore the amounts defrauded in O’Connor were lower. In that case the accused did plead guilty. More significantly, in terms of the result, was that the Crown had conceded in that case at trial that sentences for the two offences under s29D of the Crimes Act could be entirely concurrent. His Honour, in effect, imposed a rolled up sentence. In O’Connor their Honours indicated that, but for the Crown concession, an effective head sentence for the two s29D offences would have been five years with an effective non-parole period of three years (see at [36.8] and [98]). 
     
      
    22 It is entirely inappropriate to treat the sentence in O’Connor as some sort of base to which arithmetical calculations can be applied. The indications of an appropriate sentence given in O’Connor are, allowing for the different facts of the two cases, broadly comparable to that imposed by the sentencing judge in the present context. His Honour referred to O’Connor by way of guidance and took into account the prior case law, also mentioned in O’Connor, on the approach to sentencing for revenue fraud offences, particularly the significant weight to be given to general deterrence and the comparatively lower weight to be given to past integrity and character. 
     
      
    23 The objective gravity of the offences in terms of the litany of deception involved and the quantum of the loss to the revenue is high. No objection can be taken to his Honour imposing a five year term with a two and a half year non-parole period with respect to each offence. (In the case of the first count the non-parole period is an effective one rather than an actual one.) 
     
      
    24 From the perspective of the effective sentences, however, the crucial decision made by his Honour was the degree of accumulation of the two sentences. The modus operandi of the two offences were similar. However, they did represent two distinct periods of offending with a lengthy visit overseas intervening. It may well have been that the choice of a second company to take over the scheme was a further stratagem to avoid detection, although there is no finding to that effect. 
     
      
    25 It is clear that some accumulation was appropriate. In making this decision the principle of totality was and is an important consideration. 
     
      
    26 The error identified by reason of the successful appeal against the FTRA offences was and is not, in my opinion, a material element in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. His Honour referred to the fact that the modus operandi adopted by the Applicant itself constituted offences as one factor in a list of improper and illegal activity involved in the commission of the fraud offences. Although his Honour referred to the fact that he had taken this element of illegality into account, nothing suggests that this was a significant consideration in his Honour’s determination of the appropriate sentence for each of the s29D offences or in the application of the principle of totality to determine the appropriate degree of cumulation. 
     
      
    27 Applying s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, I am not satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law. Leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    28 HULME J: The circumstances leading to the conviction of the Applicant and then to these proceedings are set out at some length in the judgment of the Chief Justice. For my part it is sufficient to summarise them as follows. 
     
      
    29 Over of a period of 2 years the Applicant pursued, on a weekly if not daily basis, a calculated course of action whereunder he deprived the Commonwealth of, in the case of one company which the Applicant used, in excess of $2.6M and in the case of another such company, in excess of $670,000. A jury held his conduct in the use of each company constituted fraud. He profited by his conduct in an amount in excess of $1.1M. He pleaded not guilty and manifested a total lack of remorse. 
     
      
    30 The maximum term of imprisonment prescribed for each of the Applicant’s offences is 10 years imprisonment. On each count the Applicant was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment, the commencing dates and a non-parole period being fixed so that the effective sentence imposed was 7½ years imprisonment including a 5 years non-parole period. 
     
      
    31 The authorities make it clear that general deterrence is an important consideration when sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue and that in determining the sentence appropriate to any offence regard must be had to its gravity viewed objectively – see, e.g. R v Cappadona & Anor [2001] NSWCCA 194; R v O’Connor [2002] NSWCCA 156; 
     
      
    32 In any assessment of that objective gravity, of the magnitude of the Applicant’s criminality, it is not inappropriate to reflect on the fact that in the case of most people engaged in full time occupation, it would take them between 10 and 20 years to earn the over $1 million which the Applicant derived. During that time most of their earnings would be expended in the costs necessary or incidental to sustaining themselves and working over the period. At least to the extent to which these outgoings are time related – and they are to a very large extent – the Applicant’s criminality enabled him to make his $1 million while avoiding those costs. 
     
      
    33 Furthermore, in the circumstances here it is also appropriate to record that there is nothing apparent but the deterrent effect of punishment to provide any indication that the Applicant will not, on his release, further offend.  
     
      
    34 Although it is not unlikely, and I am prepared to assume, that in fixing the sentences that he did, the trial judge took into account against the Applicant the offences under the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 (Cth) of which he had been convicted but of which he has now successfully appealed, sub-section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On an appeal under s5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.” 
        
       
      
    35 When regard is had to the criminality of the Applicant involved in the two offences of which he remains convicted, I am not satisfied that any sentence less severe than he received is warranted. Indeed, although obviously there are limits, I would not have found manifestly excessive a sentence substantially greater than that imposed on the Applicant. 
     
      
    36 I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 FOSTER AJA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: The appellant was tried at Taree District Court before Bell DCJ and a jury upon an indictment containing eight counts. He was convicted on six of these, respectively three counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, one count of common assault, one count of sexual intercourse with a child aged between ten and sixteen years (contrary to s66C(1) of the Crimes Act) and one count of sexual assault (contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act). The two counts lastmentioned (counts six and eight in the indictment) carried maximum prescribed penalties of eight and fourteen years imprisonment. On those counts the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of three years imprisonment and to seven years imprisonment with a non parole period of five years and three months, both sentences commencing on 15 August 2001. Sentences ranging between one and six months which were imposed on the other counts upon which convictions were found were also directed to commence on that date. Those sentences are now expired.  
     
      
    3 Two grounds of appeal against conviction have been taken: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The trial miscarried due to the absence of new evidence. 
        
       
       
        
         2. The trial miscarried due to the negligence of the instructing solicitor.” 
        
       
      
    4 The grounds are inter-related, the alleged negligence claimed to have resulted in the absence of evidence which ought to have been adduced for consideration by the jury. The hearing of the trial extended from 23 July 2001 until 15 August 2001. The limited ambit of challenge to conviction expressed in the grounds makes it unnecessary to refer to much of the considerable volume of testimony and it will suffice to make reference to that which is asserted to be pertinent to those grounds. 
     
      
    5 The appellant at all material times resided on a property at Old Bar on which were located various habitations including caravans and buildings in respect of some of which there was construction activity being undertaken. Both the complainant, whom I will refer to as RL, and the appellant gave evidence at trial. RL was born on 25 August 1982 and the appellant was born on 21 June 1953. They gave differing accounts as to their first encounter as well as many other matters but it was common ground that for a period RL resided at the Old Bar property. In order to enable the development of the appellant’s argument, the Court was informed that another girl, whom I will refer to as HS, who was a friend of RL’s also complained of sexual assaults by the appellant. Her complaints were the subject of a subsequent trial at which the appellant was acquitted on all counts. Reference was also sought to be made to evidence given at the trial in which HS was the complainant and to contrast it with evidence given or not given in the preceding trial. 
     
      
    6 In support of the grounds, affidavits were filed in this Court and the deponents were cross examined by the Crown Prosecutor. A précis of some of this evidence can be given. It is noted that the appellant claimed that his solicitor left it to him to obtain various witness statements and also, to give context to the argument, that the date of the offence alleged in the eighth count had been specified as 7 February 1999. On 4 February 1999 a child was born to the appellant’s son Timothy and his partner and this circumstance was used on occasions as a pointer to establishing events on 7 February a few days later. 
     
      
    7 Harry Hepworth was in fact called and gave evidence at the trial. The “new” evidence locates a specific visit when he was told by Timothy that the appellant was not there (at the Old Bar property) and he is almost sure that this was Sunday 7 February because Timothy told him that the baby had been born on the previous Thursday. Mr Hepworth claimed that his location of the date had become certain because he was “immediately aware he (the appellant) hadn’t told me about his grandson and I had seen him the previous two days”. It is not immediately clear how the negative would provoke the claimed precision but that was the way that Mr Hepworth found his recollection fortified. 
     
      
    8 Colleen Lowe was not called at trial. She deposed that she recalled “dropping in” to see the appellant on a Sunday and being told by Timothy that the appellant was not there and also that he had become a father a few days beforehand. She stayed about an hour commencing at about 11.30 am to noon. 
     
      
    9 Susan Bunt had given evidence in the trial and she had testified to observations from which she had concluded that RL was residing in one of the caravans on the property. Her “new” evidence relates to a recollection of visiting the property at about 1 to 1.30 pm on the Sunday following the birth of Timothy’s son in order to deliver some papers for her husband. She was told by Timothy that the appellant was not there. She did not alight from her car. She saw a woman whom she knew as Freda (Gibson) sitting on the steps of “her” house on the property.  
     
      
    10 I interpolate that none of Mr Hepworth, Ms Lowe nor Mrs Bunt suggested that they encountered each other on their respective visits on 7 February.  
     
      
    11 Timothy gave evidence at the trial. He had had a conference with counsel before giving evidence. He does not recall telling counsel of the visits by Mr Hepworth, Ms Lowe and Mrs Bunt and it was only after the trial that he became aware that RL had given evidence that she and the appellant were at the property (and the offence in count eight committed) between about 10 am and 4 pm on the particular day.  
     
      
    12 At the trial he had located the Sunday after the birth of his child and said that he was at the property working on the house when the appellant and RL arrived at “after lunch I think” (T.969) and left about fifteen to twenty minutes later. I shall return to other evidence about the time. Freda Gibson was at the property and helped him for a while and they had lunch together. In cross examination at trial he was expressly asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. On that day, the Sunday, do you have a recollection of anybody else coming to the property besides your father and (RL)? 
        
       
       
        
         A. No.” 
        
       
      
    13 The thrust of this material was to attack the credibility of the assertion by the complainant that she was on this day at that location for any length of time but was sexually assaulted by the appellant in the limited time available. It was contended that, had the jury had this new material before it, it would have doubted the complainant’s testimony about the incident and, consequently, may have doubts about her credibility otherwise. 
     
      
    14 The second explicit subject of attack revolved around the failure of the solicitor to produce evidence concerning one Bourne and HS that they had left their occupation of any part of the property and moved onto the Old Bar caravan park on 26 March 1998. Part of the transcript of Bourne’s evidence at the second trial shows the production of a receipt from that caravan park and his express concession concerning that date. The circumstances of departure from the appellant’s property was such that it might not reasonably be suggested that the pair would ever have returned. The potential of evidence to this effect upon the issues at the first trial will be discussed later. 
     
      
    15 The appellant swore an affidavit and was cross examined. He recounted obtaining statements from witnesses. Although he complained of omissions by the solicitor personally he acknowledged that counsel visited the property, arranged the issue of various subpoenae during the trial and interviewed a number of witnesses just before the trial and during the course of it. The trial, as I have said, extended over several weeks. He referred to the second trial and evidence about HS and Bourne and their moving from the property to the Old Bar Caravan Park. He asserted a belief that material relevant to this contributed to his acquittal at the second trial. 
     
      
    16 It was expressly stated by counsel that reliance was placed only upon witnesses whose affidavits were read, that is to say, those whom I have identified. 
     
      
    17 The Crown called evidence from Mr Fryett, the appellant’s former solicitor. There is no need to refer to all of it. He was instructed to act for the appellant after the appellant had already been committed for trial on some charges. After his retainer he prepared and made submissions including some relevant to s48E of the Justices Act to the presiding magistrate. Counsel, who later conducted the trial, was briefed to complete the committal proceedings. All of the statements collected by the appellant were briefed to counsel. Arrangements were made for counsel to interview all of these potential witnesses and either Mr Fryett or a clerk attended those interviews. 
     
      
    18 Mr Fryett was cross examined about file notes relative to those interviews and he produced some documents including computer generated material. It was not put to him that interviews by counsel did not occur: he was challenged about his own presence and contribution. There was contradiction between Mr Fryett and the appellant about how it came to pass that the latter set about obtaining statements but the conferences with counsel provided an appropriate circumstance for decision as to which witnesses to call and what evidence they could give which might be of advantage to the appellant. 
     
      
    19 As was observed by counsel for the Crown in this Court (who did not prosecute at trial), to all intents and purposes the control of the preparation for the trial and control of the trial itself was taken by defence counsel who, it was accepted, had considerable experience and expertise in the area of criminal practice. It may be inferred that he also had relevant experience in the evaluation of potential evidence and the tactical aspects of the defence of an accused at trial. No material from that counsel was sought to be proffered.  
     
      
    20 The considerable extent of cross examination in this Court is capable of deflecting attention from what must be the ultimate issue raised by the grounds of appeal, namely, assuming the asserted new material was put before the Court, has the appellant established relevant miscarriage. 
     
      
    21 The answer to that question can be determined by looking at the issues fought at trial, and the verdicts brought in upon them, and assessing whether the proposed “new” evidence may be of such significance as to require an affirmative answer to that question. It was not in dispute that the appropriate test may be expressed as enquiring whether there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant if the new evidence had been before it: Mickelberg v The Queen 1989 167 CLR 259; R v Fuller [2002] NSWCCA 121; R v Whyte [2003] NSWCCA 64. 
     
      
    22 As can be gathered from the précis of the “new” evidence the thrust of it was to fortify Timothy’s assertion that the appellant was only at the property for such a limited period on 7 February that the complainant’s description of events which gave rise to count eight was not credible. If that be the case, it was argued, a jury should also have doubted her other allegations. 
     
      
    23 None of the “new” evidence offers direct proof from the witnesses of the absence of the appellant at the intermittent times of their visits. All rely upon what they were told by Timothy and to the extent that any of them entered any part of the premises it needs to be borne in mind that the particular offence was alleged to have occurred in “Kristy’s house” which was one of the variety of habitations on the property.  
     
      
    24 It has already been noted that Mrs Bunt said she saw Freda (Gibson) sitting on the step and it can further be noted that Ms Gibson’s presence had been the subject of challenge by the Crown at trial. However, Ms Gibson and the complainant testified that neither saw each other and the “new” support for her presence would scarcely provide a fact critical to the jury’s determination of guilt. 
     
      
    25 The reliance by the witnesses on Timothy’s assertion of the appellant’s absence requires attention to his credibility. I have already cited his contradictory testimony about visitations. There is a further undermining aspect. Mrs Bunt had also said that on the occasion of her calling there was another young man there. On the now asserted evidence this must have been one Shane Rutledge. Timothy conceded in cross examination in this Court that he had had a conversation about Shane Rutledge being present with the appellant prior to trial. The content of this conversation was such that, before trial, the appellant knew that Shane Rutledge had been at the premises on the particular day. Timothy admitted deliberately giving false evidence about Shane Rutledge’s presence (and the deponents of the now presented affidavits). He claimed that Shane Rutledge had conveyed his own father’s advice not to become involved and that since then the friendship between them had ceased. Mr Rutledge Snr is apparently a police officer. At the trial Timothy had said that he had not discussed the events of 7 February with the appellant (T998). 
     
      
    26 There is, however, a further consequence of the prevarication. In evidence in this Court Timothy claimed that the appellant RL had been at the property for about fifteen minutes in the vicinity of 10.30 to 11 am (contrast his evidence about lunch time at trial) and that Shane Rutledge followed their departure as they drove out the gates. This now stated time cannot be consistent with Mrs Bunt’s evidence that she was at the property between 1 and 1.30 pm and saw the young man, who must have been Shane Rutledge, as well as Timothy. 
     
      
    27 It is not to the point that any decision to withhold information from counsel and to give misleading evidence was that of Timothy and not of the appellant in the light of the appellant’s knowledge of the situation which had been discussed with him and his contentedness to let the trial proceed on that basis. That Timothy (if accepted) did not tell the appellant of the other short visits falls far short of fulfilling the necessary test.  
     
      
    28 The case was replete with claims and counter claims and contradictions between witnesses. There was a particular issue about whether the complainant was seeking to “blackmail” the appellant or whether he was seeking to persuade her to recant her allegations in return for payment. There was evidence from one Leighton Schmitzer who encountered the appellant in the surrounds of the Local Court. They had known each other from childhood. Conversation took place as to their reasons for presence there and the appellant told him that he was facing an allegation of rape and conceded that he “did do it”. The appellant’s version of the conversation was that he said “he didn’t do it”. There was evidence from a Ms Foster who stayed at the property in late 1998; that she came from the caravan in which she slept and entered the house on several mornings observing the appellant and RL in bed together. In a later conversation the appellant made an ambiguous reply to her enquiry about RL’s allegation of rape. Janice King was a frequent visitor who had known the appellant for twenty years or more. The appellant described RL to her as his girlfriend with whom he was having a “relationship” but he had to be careful as she was fifteen years old. Ms King saw RL in the appellant’s bedroom from time to time. After he was charged he asked her to give evidence for him and she said she would have to tell the truth. He responded that he would probably plead guilty to a charge of “having sex with a minor”.  
     
      
    29 All of these issues were ventilated before the jury. They do not touch upon issues raised by the grounds of appeal except to demonstrate the comparative insignificance of evidence of short visitations at intermittent times on 7 February. 
     
      
    30 It is true, as counsel submitted, that there is a difference between the occurrence of sexual relations with and without consent but it was the unequivocal position of the appellant that no such relationship came into being. He had testified: 
     
      
       
        
        “I never touched that girl at all.” 
        
       
      
    31 In determining whether there exists a significant possibility of acquittal if “new” evidence was before the jury, assessment should be made in the context of the trial. It is of critical significance that the learned trial judge directed the jury that conviction could not be returned on any count unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of what the complainant had said about each of the offences. Obviously corroborating evidence from witnesses concerning the sharing of a bed and the like is not germane to the issue of consent, or the issue of the knowledge of the absence of consent to intercourse on the part of the appellant, but in the light of the appellant’s denial of any sexual relationship whatsoever, a preference by the jury for the credibility of the complainant’s evidence to the necessary standard is readily understandable. 
     
      
    32 It may well be that the jury were unable to resolve contradictions concerning the comings and goings of numerous persons who passed in and out of the property yet at the same time be abundantly satisfied of the proof of guilt by other evidence including the necessary acceptance of the complainant. The asserted “new” evidence supplies further material concerning comings and goings but such evidence could only be peripheral and any impact it may have had does not rise above the quality of speculation, fails the applicable test and the absence of this evidence led to no miscarriage. 
     
      
    33 A separate argument was advanced concerning the documentation (produced at the trial in which HS was the complainant) which is convincing, as Bourne admitted in those proceedings, that neither he nor HS, to whom he had since been wed, were at the property at the time they claimed to see certain mistreatment of RL by the appellant. No doubt such evidence, if produced, could have been powerfully erosive of any credit of these witnesses however, as was pointed out by the Crown Prosecutor, their evidence was relevant only to the “relationship” between RL and the appellant in the general sense. Their evidence was left to the jury on that basis. Their credibility, even if totally destroyed, did not have a relevant nexus with the complainant’s evidence concerning the commission of the offences. 
     
      
    34 The material produced since the first trial and adduced at the second trial which is contradictory of those witnesses does not give rise to a significant possibility that that evidence would have led to an acquittal on the counts charged. In that circumstance it is pointless to investigate whether the legal representatives were at fault in not obtaining the material for the first trial.  
     
      
    35 In my view, neither ground advanced on behalf of the appellant succeeds. 
     
      
    36 Application was made for leave to appeal against sentence and counsel expressly stated that there was no appeal against sentence “per se”. That concession was appropriate as it can be noted that the appellant’s record includes sentences of minimum and fixed terms of two years and five months imposed in 1991 for offences of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse and sexual intercourse without consent. The application was made to accommodate the eventuality that the appeal was partially successful and acquittal was substituted for conviction on some counts only.  
     
      
    37 I would dismiss the appeal and refuse leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    38 DOWD J: I have seen the judgment of Grove J in draft form. I agree with the proposed orders and his reasons therefor.

     Regina v Jeremy Nathan Young 
     
     
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Jeremy Nathan Young, was arraigned in the District Court at Broken Hill upon an indictment charging him with robbery and, in the alternative, stealing from the person. His plea of guilty to that alternative charge was accepted by the Crown prosecutor in satisfaction of the indictment. He was sentenced to imprisonment for four years, to date from his arrest on 22 July 2002, with a non-parole period of eighteen months. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 In the light of one of the matters argued in the application, it is best to set out the sentencing judge’s summary of the facts in his remarks: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender comes before me for the offence of stealing a mobile phone and a sum of money from a young man called Mason Chapman who was at the time 13 years old. Mason and three of his friends, Thomas Taylor, Gareth Jones and Matthew Adams were all camping out near the Broken Hill Speedway and were sitting round a camp fire and looking forward to spending a night in the bush when the offender and a friend of his came into the camp site. The offender in particular acted from the beginning in a rather irrational fashion. He sat down without any real invitation to do so and threw a knife on the ground saying, “I thought there was a group of older people, I guess I won’t have to use this.” This caused the four boys to become quite scared. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender and his friend were drinking beer and the offender snapped a branch from a tree and started smashing it on the ground and telling them, the boys, he was going to attack them. He demanded they empty their pockets. They did this. The money and the mobile phone which was the property of Mason Chapman was taken. Ultimately after making various other threats they walked off. They had told the boys that they were going to hitchhike to Adelaide. This is consistent with evidence that the offender gave me. The four boys contacted the police. They were quite scared of what had occurred. One of the boys Thomas Taylor described the mood of the offender as, in the following words, “he was ranting and raving for ages then he’d snap and go back to normal, this went on for about two hours. He was threatening us all the time.” 
        
       
       
        
        The offender told me in evidence that he had been on amphetamines and had been drinking for eleven or twelve days and then after that period had put himself into a detox unit which he had left after his mother had visited and told him of his friend who accompanied him to this camp site was going off to Adelaide. When he left the detox a doctor prescribed Valium for him for reasons that are completely unclear to me and he with the prescription got fifteen Valium and consumed fifteen Valium. His mood was described by the boys and all of them had the same type of description. 
        
       
       
        
        Example, Gareth Jones said, “Jeremy would be talking real nice one minute but then he’d snap, he started abusing us. He threatened to smash our heads in.” His mood, his actions, were all consistent with a man who was quite irrational because of two things. The ingestion of amphetamines, the ingestion of Valium and the lack of sleep caused by the fact that the amphetamines prevent sleep. It is doubtful if he fully comprehended what it was he was doing. 
        
       
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    3 The applicant was twenty-three years old at the time of the offence and is now twenty five. He had a criminal record, which included convictions of armed robbery and other offences of violence. He had previously served terms of imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 He had a disturbed upbringing. When he was only eighteen months old his father died, and he had a number of placements in foster homes. His mother formed another relationship, but that was characterised by violence on the part of his stepfather. He left school in year 7, as he was about to turn fourteen, although he had since undertaken some practical training courses while in custody. 
     
      
    5 It is not surprising, given that background, that he has had a longstanding problem of drug abuse, using amphetamines since the age of fourteen. The abuse continued despite some experience of drug and alcohol counselling during earlier periods in custody. As his Honour noted, he had entered a detoxification unit a few days before the offence. He had been in a de-facto relationship and is the father of two children. About two months before the offence he and his wife separated, and she prevented his having access to the children. For a few months prior to the separation he had not been using drugs, but in the emotional upheaval which followed the separation he resorted to drugs again, as well as alcohol. It was in these circumstances that the offence was committed and, no doubt, it is this background which explains his irrational state at the time.  
     
      
    6 In evidence, he expressed his remorse for the offence. He had since formed a relationship with another woman and arrangements had been made for his children to visit him while in custody. He said that he had not used drugs while in custody on this occasion and he expressed his determination to deal with his drug problem. Appropriately, his Honour found special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between head sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    7 Ms Francis, for the applicant, challenged the sentencing process on a number of bases. Firstly, she submitted that his Honour appears to have dealt with the applicant on the basis that he is guilty of robbery when, in fact, the offence for which he stood for sentence was stealing from the person. There is some force in this submission. In the passage from the remarks on sentence which I have quoted, his Honour referred to the knife which was in the applicant’s possession and to the fact that the victim and his companions were frightened. Later in the remarks, his Honour observed that the applicant “has to receive a punishment which reflects the fact that he robbed a young boy and terrified his friends”.  
     
      
    8 The Crown prosecutor before us submitted that his Honour was doing no more than describing the circumstances surrounding the offence, primarily to demonstrate the irrationality of the applicant’s behaviour. He argued that his Honour’s use of the word “robbed” was colloquial, and did not arise from a misapprehension about the offence with which he was dealing. A similar problem arose in R v Kerr-Bell (CCA, unreported, 13 February 1991). In that case Gleeson CJ, with whom Priestly JA and Mathews J agreed, dealt with the matter in this way:  
     
      
       
        
        Criticism was addressed to the fact that in his remarks on sentence and in a remark made to the appellant immediately before being sentenced the learned trial judge described the offence as one of robbery rather than stealing from the person. I consider, however, that his Honour was in this respect only using a colloquial expression; both robbery and stealing from the person are offences under s94 of the Crimes Act and attract the same maximum penalty. It is true that elements of the offence of robbery are in certain respects different from the elements of stealing from the person but I do not think it likely that that was something that was overlooked.  
        
       
      
    9 The Crown prosecutor also relied on the observations of Smart AJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL agreed, in R v Hua [2002] NSWCCA 384. After examining s94 of the Crimes Act, by reference to his own judgment in R v Delk (1999) 46 NSWLR 340, his Honour observed, “Put simply, too much should not be made of the distinction between steal from the person and robbery” (par 17). After noting that putting the victim in fear is an element of robbery, his Honour said of the offence of stealing from the person, “It would not be wrong for the judge to take into account that the offence had the potential for violence or the potential for putting the victim in fear” (par 20). His Honour rejected the proposition than an offence of stealing from the person is necessarily less serious than robbery, pointing out that the gravity of an offender’s conduct must be determined by the facts of each case (par 19).  
     
      
    10 Nevertheless, nothing in Smart AJ’s judgment in Hua suggests that the distinction between robbery and stealing from the person should not be maintained. To do so, and to be seen to do so, is of particular importance in a case such as the present. No doubt, the applicant offered the plea of guilty to the alternative charge of stealing from the person, and the Crown prosecutor accepted it, in the expectation that he would be dealt with less severely than he might have been if he had faced sentence for robbery. The passages from the remarks on sentence to which I have referred do suggest that his Honour blurred the distinction between the two offences, and give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the sentencing exercise was not focussed upon the elements of the alternative charge to which the applicant had pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    11 Ms Francis also submitted that his Honour had fallen into error by making no reference to the applicant’s plea of guilty and to its influence, if any, on his sentencing decision. In my view, this submission also is sound. Although it is most unlikely that the plea was overlooked, “it was necessary for his Honour to have spelt out the way in which it was taken into account or, if discounted, to explain why that was so”: R v McCarroll [1999] NSWCCA 237 per Wood CJ at CL at par 14. Of course, quite apart from his expressed remorse, the applicant was entitled to a measure of leniency for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, even though it was to a charge which might be seen as less serious than that originally preferred: cf R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 per Hodgson JA at par 3, and my own judgment in R v Cardoso [2003] NSWCCA 15 at par 18. 
     
      
    12 Enough has been said to demonstrate that the sentencing process miscarried, and I find it unnecessary to deal with Ms Francis’ final submission that the sentence is, in any event, excessive. I would not dismiss the appeal upon the basis that, notwithstanding the errors identified, no lesser sentence is warranted in law: s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. A head sentence of four years, after an appropriate allowance for the plea of guilty, is high. In so saying, I do not overlook the serious nature of the offence and the applicant’s unfavourable criminal record. I would see four years as an appropriate starting point, but I would reduce it by twenty-five per cent in recognition of the plea of guilty and the applicant’s remorse, so as to arrive at a head sentence of three years. Ms Francis pointed out that stealing from the person can be dealt with in the Local Court, referring to R v Crombie [1999] NSWCCA 297, per Wood CJ at CL at par 12ff. However, given the facts and the applicant’s record, summary disposal would have been entirely inappropriate in this case.  
     
      
    13 More troubling, however, is the question of the appropriate non-parole period. While accepting that there are special circumstances, that period must still be long enough to reflect the applicant’s criminality: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, per Spigelman CJ at par 54 ff. Having given this question anxious consideration, it does not appear to me that the non-parole period could be any less than that specified by his Honour, eighteen months. To set that non-parole period in association with a head sentence of three years would ensure that the applicant is entitled to release on parole upon its expiration: s50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    14 A practical disadvantage of reducing the head sentence fixed by his Honour is that it leads to a reduction of the period during which the applicant might be subject to the sanction of parole. However, it needs hardly be said that the desirability of subjecting an offender to an extended period of conditional liberty is no justification for passing a head sentence greater than the case merits. In any event, I should record that I have had regard on the question of re-sentence to an affidavit of the applicant sworn on 12 September 2003. From that affidavit it appears that he has made good use of the educational and rehabilitative programs available to him in custody since being sentenced, and that he is motivated to pursue employment opportunities and meet his parental responsibilities upon his release. I believe that much could be done to foster his rehabilitation during an eighteen month period of conditional liberty, under supervision.  
     
      
    15 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the head sentence passed in the District Court and would sentence the applicant to imprisonment for three years, to date from 22 July 2002. I would confirm the non-parole period of eighteen months, expiring on 21 January 2004. I would direct the applicant’s release on that day and, pursuant to s51(1A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I would order that he be subject to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for the whole of the parole period.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: On 19 July 2002 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing two counts; the first count alleging an offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act, and the second count as an alternative to the first alleging and offence of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Act. The applicant pleaded not guilty to the first count but guilty to the second count. The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. The maximum penalty prescribed for an offence contrary to s 33 is 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 In addition the applicant had been committed to the District Court for sentence on two charges of assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty prescribed for an offence under that section is 2 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 On 18 October 2002 Judge Keleman sentenced the applicant for the offence under s 33 to imprisonment for 7 years that sentence to commence on 4 October 2002 with a non-parole period of four years to expire on 3 October 2006. In respect of each of the offences of assault the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of six months imprisonment, each sentence to commence on 4 October 2002 and expired on 3 April 2003. 
     
      
    5 The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed for the s 33 offence. There is a single ground of appeal which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the appropriate discount for the plea and the contrition. 
        
       
      
    6 In light of the limited nature of the issue arising for determination by the Court, the facts of the offence and the subjective case presented on behalf of the applicant before Judge Keleman can be stated relatively briefly. The offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced arose from an incident that occurred in the early hours of Saturday 10 March 2001 in Double Bay. The applicant, who was living in an apartment in Bellevue Road, arrived home shortly after midnight. At the time he was moderately to severely intoxicated by alcohol. Having been disturbed by street noise under the balcony of his unit, the applicant looked into the street and saw a group of people walking towards New South Head Road. These persons had left a birthday celebration nearby and were on the way to catch taxis. The applicant exchanged words with members of the group about what he perceived to be excessive noise and then left his apartment in order to confront them. At that time the applicant was aggressive but not armed with any weapon. 
     
      
    7 An altercation occurred between the applicant and three members of the group, one of whom was Angus Harris, including some pushing and shoving. The applicant then returned to his apartment, armed himself with two kitchen knives and ran back onto the street and towards the group. He slashed at one person with one of the knives but did not make contact. He chased another around a parked car while brandishing a knife at him. These two incidents gave rise to the charges of assault that were before Judge Keleman. 
     
      
    8 The applicant then pursued Mr Harris and attacked him with a knife, inflicting multiple stab wounds to his torso and upper body. It is unnecessary to detail the injuries suffered by the hapless Mr Harris but three of them could have been fatal if they had injured any vital organs that were in line with the path of the knife. As a result of the wounds inflicted on him, Mr Harris required abdominal surgery and spent a period in the intensive care ward of the hospital until he was discharged on 15 March 2001. Mr Harris was still suffering, both physically and mentally, from the attack upon him by the applicant at the date when sentence was imposed. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was himself injured as a result of the incident. After his attack upon Harris, the applicant fled back up Bellevue Road chased by members of the group. In attempting to evade these persons the applicant jumped a 10 metre wall and broke both ankles when landing on a concrete drive. He also suffered a compression fracture of the vertebrate and required surgery. The applicant remained in hospital until 6 April 2001. It is expected that as a result of the injuries he suffered there will be early degenerative joint disease in both ankles. 
     
      
    10 In respect of the offence committed against Mr Harris, Judge Keleman stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The objective seriousness of the offence of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm is very high. The offence was premeditated, determined and alarmingly vicious and callous. In offences of this type considerations of general deterrence and punishment are of particular importance. There are a number of aggravating features in the commission of this offence. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that prior to arming himself with a knife the prisoner intentionally singled out Harris for attack and then having armed himself with initially two large knives he relentlessly pursued the obviously unarmed and clearly terrified Harris for some distance. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender's subsequent concealment of the knife and false representation to Harris that he was not armed with a knife was part of a ruse by the offender to enable him to get sufficiently close to Harris so that he could stab Harris with the knife and intentionally inflict the type of grave harm that he, in fact, inflicted on Harris knowing that Harris was unarmed and virtually unable to defend himself from such an attack. The offender's disturbing callousness was also reflected in his comments to two of Harris' companions while fleeing the scene that it was all fun and games. 
        
       
      
    11 While accepting that the applicant's intoxication on the night was the primary cause for him acting in this way and was a mitigating factor, his Honour determined that the applicant's criminality, particularly in relation to the s 33 offence, fell within the upper range of seriousness for offences of its type and, therefore, his Honour felt he had no option but to impose a substantial custodial sentence notwithstanding the applicant's favourable subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    12 There was a powerful subjective case presented on behalf of the applicant. He was aged 29 at the time sentence was imposed, had no previous criminal history and had been in constant paid employment since 1995 at the same city hotel working his way up to a position of responsibility within its finance department. Judge Keleman described the applicant as a first offender, ""who is otherwise a law-abiding and relatively balanced and responsible member of the community"". His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The subjective material tendered on behalf of the offender indicates that the offender is a genuine, caring, warm and responsible person who is also a loving and caring family member well regarded by those who know him as a friend, family member and employee. That material, which I accept, also indicates that the violent conduct in which the offender engaged in respect of the present offences was out of character. 
        
       
      
    13 After referring to evidence from a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore, concerning the applicant's mental state at the time of the offence and the psychiatric counselling that he had undertaken since, his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        There is no doubt that as a consequence of the present offences the prisoner's life has undergone constructive changes. These include addressing his alcohol consumption and learning and utilising strategies to assist him to deal more effectively with problems that he may face in the future…………….. 
         
         
        There is no doubt that the offender is highly motivated to rehabilitate himself and has been doing everything possible to ensure there is never a repeat of the conduct which gives rise to the present charges. This is reflected in the subjective material that has been tendered. The changes he has made to his life are observable even in his workplace……………. 
         
         
        I am satisfied that if the offender maintains his present motivation and receives appropriate support and assistance his prospects of rehabilitation are excellent. 
        
       
      
    14 In respect of the relevance of the applicant’s plea of guilty and his remorse, his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender's pleas of guilty have also been taken into account. The pleas of guilty to the two charges of assault were entered at the first available opportunity in the Local Court. The plea of guilty to the charge of wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm was entered, as the Crown concedes, at the first reasonable opportunity. That plea of guilty was entered when the Crown first indicated on arraignment in the District Court that it would accept a plea to that charge in full satisfaction of the indictment. The offender had previously entered a plea of guilty to that charge in the Local Court on 27 September 2001, however, the Crown at that time would not accept the plea. 
         
         
        I am satisfied that the offender's pleas of guilty represent genuine remorse and contrition and that his expressions of remorse and contrition are also genuine. Having regard to the principles enunciated in the guideline judgment of  
        R v Thomson  
        [ 
        and Houlton 
        ] (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 where a discount range of 10 per cent to 25 per cent is indicated solely for the utilitarian value of the plea, I am satisfied that the appropriate discount to take into account all elements of the pleas of guilty warrants a discount of 25 per cent on the sentences that would otherwise have been appropriate. 
        
       
      
    15 The applicant submits that Judge Keleman erred in giving a discount of only twenty-five percent in respect of both the plea of guilty and the expressions of remorse that his Honour had found to be genuine. The argument is that the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty justified a discount at the very top of the range specified by this Court in Thomson and Houlton, disregarding any expressions of remorse and contrition by the applicant. 
     
      
    16 The written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant contained the following two paragraphs (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        14 His Honour referred to the applicant's plea(s) of guilty as representing genuine remorse and contrition and accepted that this was amplified by the applicant’s genuine expression of these emotions (reasons for sentence pgs 14 and 18). His Honour also said that in fixing the discount at 25% he was ""taking into account all elements of the pleas of guilty"" (Ibid.). However, by discounting the term of imprisonment for the offence of malicious wounding by 25%, and fixing that term at 7 years,  
        it is submitted he failed to adequately reflect the overwhelming evidence of contrition, the applicant's acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, and the currency of these subjective responses over many months between the commission of the offences and sentence. 
         
         
        15. In the circumstances of this case, where the utilitarian value of the plea(s) is high,  
        and a strong subjective case on the evidence is established to the sentencing judge's satisfaction 
        , a greater discount than 25% was warranted and his Honour erred in not so finding. 
        
       
      
    17 In my opinion those parts of the written submissions that I have underlined reveal the erroneous nature of the ground of appeal and the submissions made in support of it. 
     
      
    18 In Thomson and Houlton at [3] Spigelman CJ recognised that a plea of guilty should attract a lower sentence for three reasons: it manifested remorse and contrition; it had a utilitarian value to the efficiency of the criminal justice administration; and it saved vulnerable witnesses from having to give evidence. However, it was only the second of those reasons that became the subject of a guideline. It was considered, at [154], that the value of the plea on that basis could be objectively assessed by reference, firstly, to the stage in the criminal justice process when the plea was forthcoming and, secondly, the length and complexity of the trial that would have occurred had there not been a plea. The evaluation of the discount on a utilitarian basis, therefore, has no regard to the strength of the Crown case, does not reflect remorse or contrition and is not concerned with any other factor relevant to sentence such as the rehabilitation of the offender. 
     
      
    19 The utilitarian value of the plea was seen as a suitable subject for a guideline judgment because its contribution to the synthesis which attends the exercise of a sentencing discretion could be isolated and dealt with separately without upsetting the interplay of other matters taken into account by a sentencing judge: Thomson and Houlton at [122]. 
     
      
    20 However, the other two reasons why a plea of guilty might result in a lower sentence, that is, as a manifestation of remorse and in sparing witnesses from giving evidence, depend upon the circumstances of the particular offence or offender and overlap with other aspects of the sentencing task in a particular case: Thomson and Houlton at [121]. In particular, the element of remorse has significant relevance in determining what aspects of punishment are to be reflected in the sentence: for example whether personal deterrence is a relevant factor and how much weight can be given to the prospects of rehabilitation, at [116]. It is when considering the plea as a manifestation of remorse that the strength of the Crown case may be a relevant factor, at [117]. 
     
      
    21 In respect of the relationship between the plea and remorse, the Chief Justice stated at [118]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The bare fact of a plea is, of itself, a very simple expression of remorse. Much greater weight may be accorded to the conduct and statements of an accused over a period of time, which confirm a position of genuine and deeply felt contrition. When such contrition is taken into account by a sentencing judge, then the diminution of sentence is given for contrition, not for the plea of guilty. The plea in such a case is, at most, evidence of remorse or contrition and, often, not the best such evidence. It is not desirable to separate out the factor of a plea as an indication of remorse from other manifestations of remorse. 
        
       
      
    22 The guideline laid down in Thomson and Houlton did not require that a sentencing judge always specify the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea as a separate and distinct entity. The Chief Justice stated at [113]:  
     
      
       
        
         
        As Gleeson CJ and Hunt J said in  
        Gallagher 
         it will not always be possible or appropriate to specify a discount for a plea. Whether or not it is possible or appropriate is a matter for the exercise of the discretion of the sentencing judge. This Court should go no further than encouraging judges to do so. 
         For the reasons discussed below, this encouragement particularly relates to the utilitarian benefit of a plea, where it is appropriate to separately deal with that element. 
         This should not inhibit a trial judge, where she or he thinks it appropriate to do so, to take another course, including quantifying a discount for all aspects of a plea. (my underlining) 
        
       
      
    23 It should be noted that sentencing judges were being encouraged to specify the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea “where it was appropriate to separately deal with that matter.” There are situations where it may not be appropriate to specify a discrete discount for the plea. The guideline in Thomson and Houlton itself recognised at [160(ii)] (that, in cases involving assistance to authorities, a “single combined quantification will often be appropriate”, and see R v Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300 at [72]. In such a case an early plea will simply be one component of the assistance being given by the offender and generally follows a full and frank disclosure of the offender’s guilt to the authorities. 
     
      
    24 Another case where it may not always be appropriate to give a separate discount for the plea is one such as the present where the plea is simply one event in a course of conduct by the offender following the commission of the offence which not only indicates remorse but reveals an attempt by the offender to redress the harm occasioned by the offence and to ensure that it does not occur again. Where, as in the present, there is a subjective case presented on behalf of the offender to show that the offence was out of character, that the commission of the offence had a salutary effect upon the offender and that his rehabilitation was well under way by the date of sentencing, I have some difficulty in appreciating how the plea can be viewed as anything but part of that process of rehabilitation and reform. Thomson and Houlton recognised that the then existing practice of giving a discount of up to thirty-five per cent for the plea by encompassing all relevant matters remained appropriate. This is the type of case where such a course might have been adopted. 
     
      
    25 The foundation for this ground of appeal is that his Honour said that he was taking into account “all elements of the pleas of guilty” in determining that the appropriate discount was twenty-five per cent. The phrase is reminiscent of that used by Spigelman CJ in Thomson and Houlton at [113] and quoted above. The Chief Justice referred to a judge being entitled to take another course than the one being encouraged in the guideline, “including a discount for all aspects of the plea”. 
     
      
    26 The argument put on behalf of the applicant is as follows. The twenty-five per cent discount was justified by the utilitarian benefit of the pleas, putting aside any evidence of contrition. As his Honour had found the applicant to be contrite and remorseful, that he had accepted responsibility for his actions and that he had had continued to display “these emotions” by his conduct since the offence, the discount was inadequate. His Honour had erred, so the argument runs, in not taking into account in discounting the sentence for the plea the applicant’s contrition and remorse. This argument seems to assume that ‘these emotions” are only relevant to the discount that should be given for the pleas and, like the utilitarian effect of the pleas, have no other role to play in determining the sentences to be imposed. It also assumes that, other than in calculating the discount for the pleas, his Honour had no other regard to the material to which he refers at length in his remarks. 
     
      
    27 I am completely unpersuaded that there was any error in the approach adopted by Judge Keleman. In my opinion, in referring to “the appropriate discount to take into account all elements of the pleas of guilty”, his Honour was indicating no more than that, having regard only to the pleas of guilty, a twenty-five per cent discount was appropriate to reflect all the matters that were manifested by the pleas alone: these were the utilitarian effect, the sparing of witnesses, and such remorse as was reflected in the bare fact of the pleas. At the start of the paragraph in which Judge Keleman quantified the discount for the pleas, he drew a distinction between the genuine remorse and contrition represented by the pleas, on the one hand, and the applicant’s genuine expressions of remorse and contrition (that is, those expressions not reflected in the pleas) on the other. 
     
      
    28 There is nothing in Thomson and Houlton that required his Honour to give a discount of twenty-five per cent simply for the utilitarian aspect of the pleas standing alone, particularly where there would have been nothing complex about the issues in the trial had it proceeded. The only matter that appears to have been in dispute on the first count in the indictment was the intention to murder. It has to be emphasised once again that the range of discounts referred to in the guideline judgment is a guideline. It creates no presumption of, or entitlement to, a particular discount in a given situation. Further, in R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 it was held that, where a plea to a lesser charge is accepted a long time after the offence, a discount of less than twenty-five per cent can be appropriate notwithstanding that the plea was made at the earliest opportunity. Here the plea was first offered on 17 September 2001, nine months after the offence.  
     
      
    29 In any event there is simply no basis to assume that His Honour intended that the twenty-five per cent discount was to include all the actions of the applicant that reflected his contrition and remorse regardless of when it occurred or what it entailed. The greater part of the applicant’s conduct that manifested his genuine contrition and remorse took place before the plea to the lesser offence was offered in the Local Court. 
     
      
    30 Any suggestion that his Honour may have failed to take into account all aspect’s of the applicant’s remorse and contrition, which was evidenced by his conduct between the commission of the offence and the date of sentence, is dispelled by a consideration of the sentence imposed. Having regard to the very grave seriousness of the offence, which his Honour rightly described as being in the upper range for an offence of this nature, a sentence of 7 years as against a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment is eloquent of the fact that his Honour must have given full weight to the subjective material before him. A discount of only twenty-five per cent of the otherwise appropriate sentence would mean that his Honour must have chosen a starting sentence below 10 years. That is so obviously not an appropriate starting point that his Honour could not have chosen it. The non-parole period of 4 years is the very least that could have been imposed to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and the aspects of punishment that the sentence imposed had to manifest. 
     
      
    31 In my view the sentence imposed was such that, even had there been error shown, the Court would not have intervened as no lesser sentence is warranted. By reason of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, the appeal must fail. 
     
      
    32 I propose that the application for leave be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

      70110/02 - REGINA v ANTHONY ROBERT WILLIAMS 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT - (Reading of Victim Impact Statement) 
       
      
    1 A victim impact statement has been tendered pursuant to the provisions of Div 2 of Pt 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). The statement, dated 17 September 2003, has been prepared and signed by the mother, father and sister of the deceased, Ms Pearce. Each of them is a “family victim” within the definition of that term contained in s 26 of the Act. Each is a ‘victim’, within the meaning of the section, as a victim is defined so as to comprehend the deceased or a member of the immediate family of the deceased.  
     
      
    2 Section 30A provides that: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a victim impact statement has been received by a court, a victim to whom it relates or a member of the immediate family or other representative of the victim is entitled to read out the whole or any part of the statement to any court.” 
        
       
      
    3 Although no objection has been taken on behalf of the accused to the statement being read out, the question has been raised as to whether or not the person who it is proposed should so read it, namely, Mr Dix, a first cousin of the deceased, falls within the ambit of s 30A. 
     
      
    4 The section itself contemplates that in the case of a person who has been injured that person, as a primary victim, may make a statement and, because the person is living, he or she would be able to read the statement personally or appoint a representative to read the statement on his or her behalf. 
     
      
    5 The problem in the present case arises because the primary victim, as defined in s 26, is dead. Where such person has died leaving a will, then the executor would undoubtedly be “a representative” of the deceased. What is the situation where no will has been left and there is no instrument of, or statement by, the primary victim as to the appointment of a person to represent him or her?  
     
      
    6 Section 30A is a remedial section designed to fulfil what, in the view of the Legislature, is a legitimate social purpose. No doubt part of its intendment is to let it be seen publicly that, in the case of the victim who is living, that person has a voice that is heard at the time of the sentencing proceedings. In the case of a person who is deceased, such an intendment would be fulfilled by enabling the deceased person to have a voice speaking on his or her behalf at the sentencing proceedings, as opposed to there merely being a piece of paper tendered in respect of the matters raised in a victim impact statement. 
     
      
    7 In view of the nature of the section and its purpose I think it should be given a beneficial or expansive construction. In any event since each of the persons who made the victim impact statement that has been tendered and admitted without objection is a victim within the meaning of Div 2 of Pt 3 of the Act, it is, in my opinion, competent for such persons, or any of them, to appoint a representative to read out his or her victim impact statement in the course of the sentencing proceedings. Section 30A is broad enough in its import to permit the persons who signed the victim impact statement which is before the court to appoint a representative i.e. their representative, as victims, to read out the statement in whole or in part. 
     
      
    8 For these reasons, provided there is adequate evidence that Mr Dix is a person who has been appointed as the representative of the persons who made the victim impact statement, I will permit him to read the statement.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Judge Gibson QC in the District Court on a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of not less than a commercial quantity of a drug shortly referred to as MDMA or ecstasy. This is an offence contrary to s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act and carries a maximum penalty of a fine of $750,000 or life imprisonment or both. A commercial quantity of ecstasy is 0.5 kilograms. 
     
      
    3 On 8 November 2002 his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 14 years to date from 5 December 2001 and specified a non-parole period of 9 years to commence on the same date and to expire 4 December 2010. The matter was listed before his Honour again on 14 November 2002 on an application of the Crown for clarification of his Honour’s sentencing remarks. I will return to that matter shortly but what occurred on that date did not affect the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had pleaded guilty to the charge in the Local Court on 7 August 2002 and was committed for sentence to the District Court under s 51A of the Justices Act (now repealed). He adhered to his plea before Judge Gibson on 24 October 2002. 
     
      
    5 In evidence before his Honour was a statement of facts tendered by the Crown without objection save one matter to which it will be unnecessary to refer. In brief the facts can be stated as follows. The drug to be imported was 34.401 kilograms of ecstasy contained in 480,000 tablets weighing 123.75 kilograms. The applicant, who ran an importing and exporting business, agreed with a friend and business associate, the co-offender Prasad, to assist him in the importation. The applicant knew that Prasad owed a considerable sum of money to a person named Choi and that he intended to carry out the importation in order to repay him. Prasad also owed money to the applicant and was going to pay him $25,000 for his assistance. 
     
      
    6 The drug was hidden in freezer panels packed into crates and placed in a shipping container. The container vessel left Antwerp on 15 October 2001 and arrived in Brisbane on 17 November 2001. The applicant provided Prasad with documents relating to the importation of the container and fabricated invoices and a declaration for the purpose of obtaining custom’s clearance of it. The applicant made arrangements with the shipping company for delivery of the container to factory premises that he had leased earlier. On 20 November customs officers searched the container and located the drugs. They removed all but 13,000 tablets that were to remain in the container for the purpose of a controlled delivery. 
     
      
    7 On 23 November 2001 the container was delivered to the factory unit and the applicant was there to open the premises and to aid a co-offender, Bourke, in unpacking the container. He also assisted in loading some of the panels onto a truck that Bourke brought to the premises. The balance of the contents of the container was to be stored in the unit until the crates could be removed some time later. 
     
      
    8 Shortly after taking delivery of the panels, the co-offenders discovered that the drugs were missing. On 29 November the applicant sold the remaining panels that were in the unit. In early December the applicant was inquiring about payment from Prasad but was told there was a delay. The applicant supplied copies of the documentation relating to the importation of the container to Prasad so that the persons who were to receive the drugs could attempt to find out what happened to them. 
     
      
    9 Police intervened to search the factory premises on 5 December 2001. The applicant was present during part of the search and told police that the contents of the container had been a pre-fabricated freezer kit and had been sold. He said that he had paid for custom’s clearance himself and that he expected to make between $10,000 and $12,000. In a recorded interview with police on 5 January, the applicant said that he was unaware that the shipment was to contain drugs, although he knew that it would involve contraband. He admitted that he had fabricated documents to have the container cleared from customs. 
     
      
    10 The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge during which he said that Prasad had told him that he and his family had been threatened and that he owed a large amount of money to various persons. He said Prasad was depressed and that the only way he could buy time was to co-operate with the persons importing the drugs. The applicant’s evidence was that he was to be paid money only to reduce the debt owed to him by Prasad. He said that he did not know what drug was to be imported or the amount. He stated that his motivation for being involved was the repayment of the debt and to assist Prasad. 
     
      
    11 In the course of his remarks on sentence, Judge Gibson described the role of the applicant in the importation and his criminality as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Counsel has submitted that though it was a very serious offence, it was towards the lower end of the scale and it was only a mid-level drug, and he should be dealt with on the same basis as a courier. I do not agree. The prisoner made a cold-blooded decision to become involved in the importation of drugs. He knew not what they were or the quantity involved, and he cared not, as long as he got his money. He made his own price. He said it was partly because of his friendship for Prasad. I do not believe him. True it is that if he had not known Prasad, he would probably not have been approached, but it was his own greed that was the real reason for his involvement. 
         
         
        His part was a part that was vital to the importation and without his expertise in the forging of the various documents and his familiarity with the appropriate procedures, there would have been much more difficulty occasioned in landing the materials and he, in my view, is an importer of goods. The fact that he was not to be involved in any subsequent disposal of the goods does not diminish his involvement. He was a key figure in the importation. 
        
       
      
    12 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that during the course of his remarks on sentence Judge Gibson made a number of factual errors that resulted in him overestimating the applicant’s role in the importation and hence the criminality of his conduct. It was argued that his Honour erred in describing the applicant’s role as “vital to the importation” and in concluding that the applicant was “a key figure in the importation”. It was submitted that his Honour ought not to have rejected the applicant’s evidence that he was assisting in the importation through friendship with Prasad nor found that the applicant acted out of greed. 
     
      
    13 I do not believe that, if there were errors of fact, they were of such significance as to have affected a proper assessment of the sentence to be imposed on the applicant in light of the degree and seriousness of his conduct in assisting in the importation. The applicant’s criminality arises from the fact that he was prepared, for whatever gain or other motive, to play a significant role in the importation of what he must have known to be a very substantial quantity of drugs. He had agreed to become involved in the importation in March 2001. He was an active participant from August until December 2001 by taking steps to facilitate the clearance of the container through the shipping company and customs. He had permitted premises that he had leased to be used to receive the container and to store some of its contents. The applicant was there when the container was delivered. He assisted in the removal of some of the contents, clearly believing that they contained drugs, and the loading of them onto a truck to commence their distribution. 
     
      
    14 In my view it was well open to his Honour to determine that the role played by the applicant in this particular importation was vital whether or not others persons involved had successfully imported drugs on other occasions by a similar method. The importers needed someone to fulfil this role if the importation was to be successful and the applicant was prepared to undertake the task. Nor was it unfair for the sentencing judge to describe the applicant as a key figure in the importation: the importation depended upon the container being cleared through customs and released without the drugs being found, and the applicant had the expertise to achieve that result. In light of the applicant’s conduct and the size of the importation in which he was involved, I do not see any significance in the fact that he may have been motivated by assisting Prasad, if that were the case, rather than greed as found by his Honour. The fact that, on his version, he was prepared to do what he did for a $25,000 reduction in a debt owed to him is hardly mitigating. The applicant’s criminality lies largely in what he did rather than why he did it.  
     
      
    15 The applicant’s submission is that, by reason of his limited participation in the importation, his role should be identified as being “above a mere courier but below mid-level executive or organiser”. This was the description given to the role of the offender by Wood CJ at CL in R v Meggett (1999) 107 A Crim R 157. Further, it is submitted that the applicant’s role was less significant than the offender in that case. For my part, I see little value in this sort of exercise. The conduct of the offender being sentenced in Meggett was to captain a Boston whaler being sailed from Panama to Australia with a large quantity of cocaine. I do not believe that there is any purpose to be served in seeking to compare the criminality of that offender with that of the applicant for the purposes of assessing what sentence should have been imposed upon the applicant. 
     
      
    16 Nor is it always useful to compare different importations on the basis of the amount or type of drug being imported with a view to establishing what sentence should have been imposed upon a particular offender. However, the applicant relies upon the fact that the drug being imported in Meggett was over 171 kilograms of cocaine, more than 85 times the commercial quantity for that drug. But when the offence concerns a very large quantity of drug, here almost 70 times the commercial quantity, variations in the amount of drug imported cease to have significant impact on the issue of parity of sentence. 
     
      
    17 In any event this exercise of comparing sentences imposed upon other offenders for different importations to support a submission that the applicant’s sentence was excessive has frequently been the subject of criticism in this Court; see for example R v Bushell (NSWCCA, 7 August 1998, unreported). There is a range of sentences available to a sentencing judge who has a wide discretion to choose a sentence that is appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The comparison of sentences can be important to determine whether there is an established range of sentences for the offence for which sentence is being imposed or, in this Court, to determine whether the sentence imposed is unjustifiably outside that range. But ultimately the question for the sentencing judge and this Court is determined by the particular facts and circumstances of the matter before the court when viewed against the legislative regime for sentencing an offence of that type. 
     
      
    18 The applicant was aged 44 years at the time of being sentenced and has no relevant criminal history. A report by a psychologist was in evidence before his Honour, as was a detailed personal history of the applicant. There is little in that material of relevance to the sentencing task in the present case except that the applicant is revealed to be an intelligent, industrious person with the wherewithal to live a law-abiding life if he chooses to do so. 
     
      
    19 The most significant mitigating factors of a subjective nature were the plea of guilty before a magistrate and that he was prepared to give evidence against others involved in the importation, including Prasad. Towards the end of his sentencing remarks, Judge Gibson stated: 
     
      
       
        
       
       
        
         
        I take into consideration all matters under 16A of the  
        Commonwealth Crimes Act 
         relevant to the charges against him. I make a deduction from the sentence I would otherwise have imposed of approximately thirty percent in accordance with s 16G of the  
        Crimes Act 
        , and the non-parole period I will set will be in the range of sixty to sixty-six percent as mentioned in  
        Bernier’s 
         case. I allow a period of three years off the head sentence for the assistance referred to in exhibit C5 and the promise to give evidence, and I deduct twenty percent for the plea. 
        
       
       
      His Honour then imposed the sentence, to which I referred at the commencement of this judgment. The non-parole period was sixty-four per cent of the head sentence. 
       
      
    20 On 14 November his Honour was asked to elucidate the steps he took to arrive at the sentence and stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I allow twenty percent for the plea and the assistance rendered as described in and quantified in C5 and I deduct three years from the head sentence that I imposed for his promise to give evidence in the future. 
        
       
       
      His Honour then clarified with the Crown that the sentence that would have been imposed, but for the future assistance, was 17 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years and 11 months. 
       
      
    21 The applicant submits that the sentence was manifestly excessive because the starting point must have been too high and insufficient discount was given for the assistance, both past and future. It was argued that the starting sentence must have been approximately 34 years before the discounts were applied and that this was too great, especially having regard to the starting point in Meggitt of 30 years. 
     
      
    22 The respondent on the other hand argues that the starting point was approximately 32 years with a reduction to 21.3 years for the discount under s 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth). There was then, according to the Crown, a reduction of twenty percent for the plea and assistance and then a further reduction of 3 years for the future assistance. 
     
      
    23 It has been held that there is no particular order in which the discounts are to be applied nor do they need to be applied as distinct and separate entities rather than as a single reduction: Chan (2002) 128 A Crim R 119. Nor is there any need for the sentencing judge to state the particular starting point before the discounts are applied: Budiman (1998) 102 A Crim R 411. The only requirement is that found in s 21E of the Crimes Act: the sentencing judge is to specify what the sentence and non-parole period would have been but for the promise of future assistance. 
     
      
    24 The applicant argues that the discount for assistance was too low and not in keeping with general practice. Reliance is placed upon the decision in Pang (1999) 105 A Crim R 474. In that case it was held that there was no fixed tariff in relation to a discount for assistance but that it is usually between twenty and fifty per cent. There the sentencing judge had allowed a discount of twenty-five per cent but on appeal a discount of fifty per cent was given. However, two matters should be noted; firstly, in accordance with what was then the practice, there was no separate discount given for the plea of guilty and, secondly, the discount for future assistance was twenty per cent. The applicant also points to the course taken by the Chief Judge in Meggett. His Honour allowed a discount of 50 per cent to encompass both the early plea and past and future assistance. The assistance in that case went beyond that relating to the offence for which the offender was to be sentenced and was in the nature of general intelligence. The discount for future assistance was 37 per cent. 
     
      
    25 During the course of oral argument Mr Crowley, who appeared for the applicant, refined his written submissions. He contended that, if it were determined that the starting point of the sentence, about 32 years, was at the top of the available range and the total discount, thirty-three per cent, was at the bottom of the range, the result is an excessive sentence unjustified by any of the objective or subjective factors present. The Crown fairly conceded that the discount that the applicant might have expected in light of the totality of his plea and assistance would normally be about fifty per cent. The Crown also accepted that the starting sentence was at the very top of the range. 
     
      
    26 The material, relating to the applicant’s assistance to the authorities that was before the sentencing judge, reveals that his assistance went beyond that concerned with the offence for which he was to be sentenced. It is unnecessary to refer to it in detail. It also indicated that the authorities considered that the applicant had given full and frank disclosure in relation to his role and that of others in the importation of the drugs. At the hearing of the appeal fresh evidence was tendered by the Crown to the effect that the applicant had been continuing to comply with his undertaking to assist the prosecution. We were invited to consider this material if we found error on the part of the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    27 There was further material received by the Court, with leave, after judgment was reserved. It was a letter from an investigative agency of the Commonwealth that was, for reasons unrelated to the applicant, unavailable at the hearing of the appeal and that sets out the applicant’s continuing assistance of a general nature. The overall assistance provided by the applicant is described as “moderate”. It confirms my view that the discount allowed by his Honour was inadequate in all of the circumstances of the present case and resulted in an excessive sentence. The appropriate discount to reflect the plea and past and future assistance is forty-five per cent. Therefore, this Court must resentence the applicant. Taking into account the matters in s 16A and 16G of the Crimes Act (Cth), I believe that the applicant should be sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years 4 months. For the purposes of s 21E, the sentence, which would have been imposed but for the undertaking to give future assistance, is imprisonment for 16 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 10 years 9 months. 
     
      
    28 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted and the appeal be allowed. The sentence should be quashed and in lieu the applicant should be sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years 4 months to date from 5 December 2001. The non-parole period is to expire on 4 April 2009, the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    29 SHAW J: I agree with Howie J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: I agree with Newman AJ. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: I agree with Newman AJ. 
     
      
    3 NEWMAN AJ: This matter involves both an application for extension of time in which to lodge an application for leave to appeal and in turn the consequential application for leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon the applicant by Hulme J on 18 April 2001.  
     
      
    4 On that day Hulme J imposed a head sentence of twenty-four years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen years, and six months, both periods to commence on 7 July 1988.  
     
      
    5 The sentence imposed by Hulme J was in fact a re-determination of a life sentence originally imposed upon the applicant by Campbell J on 15 December 1989 following the applicant’s conviction by a jury for the murder of one Robert Caelli. The application before Hulme J was one made pursuant to s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989 for the substitution of the minimum and additional terms of imprisonment in lieu of the original life sentence.  
     
      
    6 The applicant does not allege that his Honour, Hulme J fell into error in imposing the sentence which he did. What was urged on his behalf is that the sentence imposed should be reduced because of assistance he afforded the authorities in relation to a charge of solicit to murder brought against one S. For reasons which I find difficult to understand no material relating to the applicant’s assistance in relation to the matter of S was placed before his Honour. Accordingly his Honour was totally unaware of that assistance and properly sentenced the applicant on the material he had before him. As I have said there is no suggestion that in determining the matter as he did his Honour fell into error in any way. I shall turn to the factual background relating to the assistance provided by the applicant to authorities later in these reasons. 
     
      
    7 As I have said the applicant was originally sentenced to life imprisonment by Campbell J on 15 December 1989. The application for redetermination was heard on 7 April 2000 and Hulme J gave judgment on 18 April 2001.  
     
      
    8 Because no challenge was made to the factual findings made by his Honour in relation to the commission of the crime of which the applicant stood convicted, I incorporate Hulme J’s findings of fact. They were:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Facts as found by Campbell J were that the applicant worked from time to time as a driver and guard for Mr Caelli, who on the evidence before his Honour was a drug dealer. The applicant and perhaps one other decided that Mr Caelli should be killed. Discussion on the topic occurred over at least a few days. On 8 July 1986, Mr Caelli was tricked into accompanying the Applicant and 2 others on a car trip to carry out a fake drug deal. On the way the car diverted to a relatively lonely spot and there Mr Caelli was shot at least 3 times with a shot gun. It was not established that the Applicant fired the shots but, as Campbell J remarked, the jury must have been satisfied that the applicant was criminally responsible for the firing of the shots. Campbell J also recorded in his remarks on sentence that the Applicant procured the theft of the car used and for this offence imposed a concurrent sentence of a fixed term of 2 years. 
        
       
       
        
        The circumstances were described in the Court of Criminal Appeal which, on 28 February 1992, dismissed the applicant’s appeal against conviction as a “gangland execution”. I mention, though given the applicant’s conviction for murder it has no relevance, that other persons who appear to have been co-offenders in the murder were either acquitted or convicted of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
        
        In his remarks on sentence Campbell J made no finding as to the motive for the killing although the Court of Criminal Appeal said that “it seems that a conclusion had been reached that (Mr Caelli) was an informer although to, by, for or upon whom was not altogether clear”. Having regard to the terms in which this statement is expressed I do not believe I would be justified in regarding that as a finding beyond reasonable doubt. Nor is there any other information which would enable me to make any finding to the criminal standard as to the motive for the killing. 
        
       
       
        
        Campbell J did however make the following findings:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “The Prisoner is 36 years old, an associate of criminals and addicted to drugs. He is divorced and has two children. From material put to me by Mr Kelly and not disputed, it appears that the Prisoner had a very difficult childhood and home life in a home where there was alcoholism and violence. He is not able to read or write although he was able to overcome that handicap to the extent that he at one time operated, how successfully does not appear, a model agency through a proprietary company. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Prisoner was released on a twelve month good behaviour bond in 1967 on a charge of break enter and steal, and after that apart from driving offences his record remained clear until 22 September 1989 when he was convicted of being an accessory after the fact to murder and sentenced to eight years penal servitude with a non parole period to date from 7 July 1988. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Prisoner was arrested on the present charges on 7 July 1988 and the Crown has indicated that it accepts that the present sentences should date from or be regarded as having commenced from that date.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The offence of being an accessory had been committed between 21 March and 30 April 1988. Studdert J who sentenced the applicant for this offence found it more probable than not that the Applicant was “influenced, such influence falling short of duress, to do what he did, by fear of the (murderer).” A letter from the Department of Corrective Services said that, taking remissions into account, the 8 and 4½ year terms of the sentence imposed by Studdert J expired on 3 August 1993 and 25 May 1991 respectively.” 
        
       
      
    9 Having carefully considered any mitigating factors advanced on behalf of the applicant and the effect of the sentence imposed by Studdert J for the offence of being an accessory after the fact of murder into account his Honour imposed the sentence which he did. 
     
      
    10 I turn then to the facts relating to the matter of the assistance afforded to authorities by the applicant. Late in the year 2000 the applicant was approached by one S who was an inmate of the same correctional institution in which the applicant was incarcerated. S asked the applicant if he knew anybody outside the prison who would be prepared to kill S’s wife’s lover. S was prepared to pay $15,000 if an assassination could be achieved. Apparently the question of the assassination was discussed on a number of occasions by S with the applicant. S showed the applicant maps and plans which could be used in order that the assassination could take place.  
     
      
    11 Not only did S approach the applicant but it was also alleged that he approached another inmate of the prison one Q to like effect.  
     
      
    12 In the event the applicant reported S’s overtures to him to the authorities. As a consequence S was charged with two counts of solicit to murder one involving Q. Following the applicant’s reports of S’s overtures to him the authorities arranged for an undercover police operative to be placed in the same cell as S. That operative had sound recording equipment attached to his body. Eventually S made a similar proposal to the police operative. It was this approach which founded the second count of solicit to murder against S. 
     
      
    13 In November 2001 S was tried on two counts of solicit to murder at the Albury District Court. Following the conclusion of defence counsel’s closing address S pleaded guilty to the count involving the police undercover operative. In relation to the count involving the alleged overtures to Q the jury found S not guilty. S was duly sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the second count to which he had pleaded guilty. The applicant gave evidence on behalf of the Crown. During the applicant’s cross-examination the following exchanges occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q See the year 2000 that was an important year for you wasn’t it because you were seeking a re-determination of your life sentence? 
        
       
       
        
        A. That’s correct 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that is during that year you expected a hearing to occur in which a Court would hear evidence and ultimately determine whether or not you were entitled to have a determined sentence in the sense of a non-parole period and a head sentence, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Rather than what you had at the time, a life sentence? 
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
        A. That’s right. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were also aware were you not that assistance to the authorities is something that is viewed favourable, you were aware of that weren’t you? 
         
         
        A. No, that’s not true.” 
        
       
       
        
        “Q. And you knew in 1997 didn’t you a prisoner by the name of Michael Holt? 
         
         
        A. Michael Holt, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And shortly before your attempt in 1997 to have your life sentence determined you and Holt provided information to the authorities regarding another matter didn’t you? 
         
         
        A. To the Royal Commission. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You provided authorities -- 
         
         
        A.. Yeah, that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that resulted, to your knowledge, in a massive investigation didn’t it? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And yielded nothing? 
         
         
        A. Yes it did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Absolutely nothing? 
         
         
        A. It yielded nothing, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You see what I suggest to you Mr P. is that you determined that Mr S was an easy mark? 
         
         
        A. No I don’t think so,. That’s a lie. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That you and Q.-- 
         
        
       
       A. No. 
       
        
         
        Q. --set about setting him up for the purpose of gaining benefit, what do you say about that? 
         
         
        A. No, that’s a lie, big lie. There was nothing to benefit out of this.” 
         
        
       
      
    14 At no time in the year 2001 did the applicant reveal his assistance to authorities to his solicitors. It was not until August 2002 when the applicant was seeking a re-determination of the Legal Aid Commission’s refusal to grant him legal aid for his application for leave to appeal against sentence that he revealed his assistance to authorities to his solicitors. In an affidavit provided to this Court the applicant gave no explanation as to why it was that he did not bring the matter of the assistance he had provided to the attention of his solicitors earlier than he did. 
     
      
    15 The extracts I have quoted from the applicant’s cross-examination in S’s trial indicate that it was then his claim that he was not seeking any benefit from his assistance to authorities. What I do find baffling is that at the time when he reported S’s overtures to the authorities Hulme J had reserved his judgment in the matter for some seven or eight months. It was a further five months before Hulme J delivered his reasons – ample time for an application to re-open the hearing to be made to Hulme J had the applicant informed his solicitors of what he had done. Even more extraordinary is the fact that it was over a year from the time when Hulme J made his re-determination before the applicant informed his solicitors of his assistance. I find this to be quite extraordinary in a case where the applicant had been an inmate of the prison system for many years. 
     
      
    16 Had the applicant told his solicitors of the assistance he was providing prior to his Honour re-determining the sentence on 18 April 2001, I have no doubt that his Honour would have allowed a re-opening of the matter so that that evidence could be adduced before him. Had this happened then, I am equally of the view that his Honour would have given the applicant a discount from the sentence he was about to pass, following cases such as R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, R v Gallagher  (1991) 23 NSWLR 220. However, this did not of course happen. 
     
      
    17 The Crown opposed the applicant’s tender of evidence relating to his assistance to the authority. Essentially the Crown submitted and that the applicant had failed to satisfy the onus upon him to satisfy the Court that it should intervene in the matter. It was further submitted that the onus upon the applicant is “real, substantial and not merely formal” See Regina v W (2001) NSWCCA 172 at par 23 per Sully J. 
     
      
    18 In R v W Sully J summarised the law in relation to the reception of fresh evidence of this type as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “…When it is alleged in connection with an application for leave to appeal against sentence that fresh evidence justified the reopening of the current sentence, the applicant must satisfy this Court, on the probabilities, of all of the following matters: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (1) That the proposed fresh material is of such significance that the sentencing Judge, had he had the material before him at the time of primarily sentencing, may have regarded it as having a real bearing upon his decision 
           
          . 
           
          (2) That although its existence may have been known to the applicant, its significance was not realised by him at the time. 
           
           
          (3) That its existence was not made known to the applicant’s legal advisers at the time of those sentencing proceedings. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        These propositions are well settled law; and authority for them is provided by the decision of a differently constituted Bench of this Court in  
        Goodwin 
         (1990) 512 A Crim R 328…”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    19 Let me say that I find that the Crown’s submission in this regard was one with some force. The baffling inertia on the applicant’s part in bringing his role in the prosecution of S to his Solicitor’s notice and failure to provide any explanation of why he acted as he did is not a matter which assists him in discharging the onus upon him which was identified by Sully J clear terms in W’s case. However, this court has an undoubted discretion to accept fresh evidence to prevent a miscarriage of justice even when the applicant may be thought to have fallen short of satisfying the postulates set out by Sully J in W’s case. In R v Smith  (1987) 44 SASR 487 at 488 King CJ observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The proper purpose of fresh evidence on an appeal against sentence is to bring before the Court facts which were in existence at the time of the imposition of the sentence but were not known by the sentencing judge or to explain facts which were before the sentencing judge so as to put them in a new light. 
        
       
       
      To like effect see  
      R v Edwin Davies  
      CCA unreported 10 March 1995 at 8;  
      R v McKenna 
       CCA unreported 26 October 1992. In this instance I am of the view the Court should exercise its discretion to admit the material relating to the applicant’s assistance in the case of S.  
       
      
    20 The question then arises as to the discount which should be given to the applicant. The enormity of the crime for which the applicant was sentenced cannot be understated. He took part in brutal assassination of a fellow human being. The effect of that assassination on the deceased’s relatives has been disastrous. Any discount made by this Court must not in my view lower the sentence imposed to a level which does not reflect the serious nature of the crime which the applicant committed. In my view a reduction of the head sentence by three years and a reduction of the non-parole period by two years would satisfy both the principles on sentencing involving assistance to the authority and also an appropriate sentence for the crime which the applicant committed. Accordingly I would grant the applicant an extension of time, grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence imposed by Hulme J on 18 April 2001 and in lieu thereof substitute a sentence of twenty-one years and six months with a non-parole period of sixteen years and six months commencing on 7 July 1988. The applicant would be eligible for release on parole on 6 January 2005.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: The appellant was tried in the Supreme Court on an indictment charging him with the murder of Samuel Ekavati (Count 1) and with maliciously discharging a firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm (Count 2). Both offences were alleged to have been committed within a short time of each other at Kings Cross in the early morning of 6 January 2000. The event giving rise to the second count was said to have occurred first. 
     
      
    2 Following a trial before Studdert J and a jury the appellant was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on Count 1; and guilty on Count 2. Manslaughter had been left to the jury on the bases of excessive self-defence (Crimes Act 1900, s421); unlawful and dangerous act; and provocation. 
     
      
    3 A sentence of imprisonment for 18 months, dating from when the appellant was first taken into custody on 17 June 2002, was imposed in relation to the firearm offence. A term of eight years imprisonment to date from 17 June 2003 was imposed in relation to the manslaughter offence. In respect of that sentence there was a non-parole period of five years to date from 17 June 2003. 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals against conviction on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      1. The trial judge erred in failing properly to warn the jury regarding the hearsay evidence of Dick Andrews. 
       
       
      2. The verdict in respect of Count 2 is unreasonable. 
       
      
    5 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Circumstances of the offences 
      
    6 What follows is an abbreviated summary of the circumstances of the two offences as recorded in Studdert J’s remarks on sentence (R v Cioban [2002] NSWSC 972). 
     
      
    7 The deceased died in consequence of a single gunshot wound which penetrated his body in front of the rib cage and passed through the centre of his chest and through the heart wall. The shooting took place shortly before 6.00am on 6 January 2000 in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross. 
     
      
    8 Earlier that morning the appellant and a male companion had been drinking at the Hampton Court Hotel. So too had the deceased, who was one of a group of four or five Fijians. There was an altercation and the appellant and his companion were asked to leave the hotel. They did so and were followed by the deceased and his companions. 
     
      
    9 A fight started in the street near the corner of Bayswater Road and Darlinghurst Road.  
     
      
    10 Differing versions of that fight and its ultimately fatal aftermath were given by various witnesses, including three of the deceased’s Fijian companions and several independent witnesses. No witnesses were called for the defence at trial. 
     
      
    11 The Crown case, in brief, was that some of the Fijians were punching and kicking either the appellant or his associate in the middle of the road near the intersection of Bayswater Road and Darlinghurst Road. The appellant produced a gun which he pointed at the deceased who was threatening to assault him. He shot at the deceased intending to cause him grievous bodily harm, but missed (Count 2). Then he retreated up Darlinghurst Road with the deceased chasing him. Eventually, the deceased caught up with him and they fell in the entrance area of a backpacker’s hostel. They struggled and in the course of that struggle the appellant fired the fatal shot (Count 1). 
     
      
    12 There was an identity issue at trial as to whether the appellant was the “white man” who fired the two shots. There was plenty of evidence to indicate that he was, and this matter is not in dispute in the appeal.  
     
      
    13 Studdert J recognised that the manslaughter verdict could have rested on any one of the three bases upon which the jury were directed they could reach such a verdict. His Honour indicated that he was attracted to the submission that manslaughter stemmed from the Crown’s failure to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not personally believe that it was necessary for him to do what he did to defend himself (cf Crimes Act, s421(2)). Studdert J said:  
     
      
       
        
        32. I find the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) that the prisoner fired the fatal shot;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) that he did so deliberately. This is implicit in the jury's finding of course, but in any event the evidence persuades me beyond reasonable doubt as to the deliberate nature of the shooting. I accept that before he moved into the doorway where the fatal shot was fired the prisoner had threatened to shoot, and I accept the evidence that the witness Mr Palasovski gave about this;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) that in doing so he used force that involved the reckless infliction of death. I described earlier the path of the bullet through the body of the deceased and the shot must have been fired with the weapon very close to the body of the deceased; 
           
           
          (iv) that the Crown has not proved that the prisoner did not believe it was necessary to fire the shot in self defence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        33. As to (iv), the evidence established that the prisoner was in the process of retreating before he fired the fatal shot, and the evidence of Dean Palasovski and of Christopher Allen, which I have earlier reviewed, establishes this. I accept that the prisoner had already been punched and kicked closer to the Bayswater Road intersection with Darlinghurst Road and that the deceased had been acting very aggressively towards the prisoner prior to the time that the first shot was fired, and, indeed, thereafter until the second and fatal shot was fired. I find that the deceased was the only member of the group described in evidence as the Fijians who continued to pursue the prisoner after that first shot. The evidence established that the deceased was affected by drink, and he was a taller and younger man than the prisoner. On my analysis of the evidence, the prisoner may well have perceived that he was cornered in the doorway and that he was faring badly in resisting the deceased.  
         
         
        34. The prisoner gave no evidence at all but, addressing the issue of self defence on the Crown case, that evidence does not satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner did not have the belief that what he did was necessary to defend himself. 
        
       
       
        
        35. It is implicit in the jury's verdict that the jury considered that the prisoner conducted himself in a manner that was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in any event, on my analysis of the evidence, that this was the case. The evidence did not suggest that the deceased was armed with any kind of weapon and the manner of the shooting of the deceased at such close range was not a reasonable response in all the circumstances, even as perceived by the prisoner.  
        
       
       
        
        36. Because I consider that the requisite intent for the crime of murder was established, a verdict of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act would not be appropriate.  
         
         
        37. In my opinion the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not shoot the deceased under provocation. I so conclude for two reasons:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) the shot was not fired whilst the prisoner had lost his self control. Rather, it was fired after he had threatened to shoot and the deceased did not retreat; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the behaviour of the deceased was not such in my opinion as could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the accused to so lose his self control as to form the requisite intent for murder.  
        
       
       
        
        38. For the reasons and on the findings I have expressed, the prisoner is to be sentenced for the crime of manslaughter in accordance with the first of the approaches that was available to the jury for such a verdict, as identified in para 28(i) above. The Crown failed to prove that the prisoner did not believe that what he did was unnecessary in his self defence. 
        
       
      
    14 As to the second count his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        43. The verdict of the jury on the second count establishes that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt:  
         
         
        (i) that the prisoner fired the first shot;  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) that he did so maliciously;  
        
       
       
        
        (iii) that he did so with intent to do grievous bodily harm;  
        
       
       
        
        (iv) that he was not acting at the time in self defence or in defence of anyone else.  
        
       
       
        
        44. The most incriminating account of the circumstances of the firing of the first shot (particularly as to element (iii) above) seems to me to be found in the evidence of Mr Andrews who, of course, the jury did not have the advantage of seeing or being tested in cross examination. Be that as it may, I must give effect to the finding of the jury and the legislature has made it plain that this offence is in a category to be regarded very seriously. Section 33A(1) provides for a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment for this category of offence. As with the crime of manslaughter, I approach this count on the basis that there was no pre planning, whether the prisoner had the weapon in his possession from the outset or not. I also take into account that the shot was fired after the prisoner had been kicked and punched and when he was being pursued. Fortunately, no person was injured when this shot was fired. 
        
       
       
        
       
      Ground 1: Failure to give proper warning regarding the hearsay evidence of Mr Andrews 
       
       
      Ground 2: The verdict in respect of count 2 is unreasonable 
       
      
    15 The grounds overlap and were considered together in submissions. Ground 1 is relied upon in respect of both convictions. 
     
      
    16 Leaving aside identification, the critical issue on Count 2 was whether the appellant fired the gun as a “warning shot” or with intent to hit his assailant. To find him guilty the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he fired the gun “with intent to do grievous bodily harm”.  
     
      
    17 It is convenient at this stage to look closely at the evidence on this particular issue.  
     
      
    18 The appellant or his associate (the evidence was conflicting on this issue) had been assaulted in the street by a number of the Fijian men. In using “assault”, I am not determining the highly contested issue as to who was the aggressor and whether self-defence would have been available. What is clear is that one of the two “white men” had been punched in the street by one or more of a bigger group of larger men. 
     
      
    19 The deceased posed a serious threat of physical harm to the appellant. He was 18 years old, 1.8m tall and weighed 86kgs. He had a blood alcohol level of 0.237. He had earlier been abusive to strangers and had kicked a box belonging to a delivery man. One of his companions testified that he was “very vicious and very angry” (Pita Ekevati at Tr p434). He was “really aggressive” and “really pumped up” (Pita Ekevati at Tr p449). 
     
      
    20 The other Fijians were also a threat to the appellant, whether or not he had initiated the brawling between the two groups. At one stage after the Fijians had left the hotel they were observed by one of the Crown witnesses as “very aggressive, all of them yelling and swearing”, challenging a security guard to a fight, some of them kicking cars in the street (Tr pp72, 78-9). 
     
      
    21 With this background, I turn to the evidence touching the appellant’s intent when he fired the first shot. That evidence came from: 
     
      
       
      •  
      Dean Palasovski 
      , who saw the man identified as the appellant walking backwards holding a gun while  
      “the black man” 
       walked forwards, punching. The following evidence was given: 
       
       
        
        Q. What was the white man doing? 
         
        A. He was kind of moving away, pointed the gun up as well, just basically, just pointing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say he was pointing the gun up, where was he pointing it to? 
         
        A. Towards the black male, I suppose, in that direction. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to say at what height he was pointing the gun, in terms of the black man’s body. 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you hear something said between them? 
         
        A. Yeah, I heard the white man say ‘I’m going to shoot this’, like … 
        
       
       
        
         
        Mr Palasovski turned away at this point, but he heard the gun go off. He then turned back to see what had occurred and saw the two men who had been scuffling moving further away up the street. 
        
       
       
        
        Later (Tr p424) Mr Palasvoski said that the dark-skinned man continued to fight, throwing punches even though the gun was being waved and even after the man with the gun had said  
        “I will shoot this” 
        . He agreed with the cross-examiner’s question:  
        “Everything you saw that night led you to the conclusion that the shot you first heard was a warning shot, is that right?”. 
        
       
       
      •  
      Moses Ekevati 
      , a cousin of the deceased and one of his companions, saw the  
      “white guy” 
       pull a gun from his pants and point it (Tr p349). He was standing beside the deceased. One gets the general impression that the gun was pointed towards both men, but the precise direction was not clarified in the evidence in chief. Moses Ekevati stopped after the gun had been pointed, but the deceased  
      “continued to chase him” 
      . In context, this was a reference to the chasing that occurred after the first shot.  
       
       
        
        Moses Ekevati made no reference in his evidence in chief to the gun being fired except on the occasion of the fatal shot. In cross-examination, he agreed that a shot had been fired into the footpath as the white man was backing away from the deceased, but before the deceased went after the man with the gun. Mr Ekevati was standing about two metres away at the time when the shot was fired in the street. He agreed with the cross-examiner that he thought this was a warning shot (Tr p371). 
        
       
       
      •  
      Pita Ekevati 
       saw the man on the footpath pointing the gun, with his arm extended just below shoulder height. The man was screaming out that he had a gun and was pointing  
      “towards my cousins” 
       (Tr p441). Asked what happened next, Mr Ekevati said: 
       
       
        
         
          
          Well, the other person, he sort of started running down the road and then the person with the gun, he shot, pulled the trigger to the gun and then I heard the noise, but I didn’t see where the bullet went. It didn’t hit nobody. 
          
         
        
       
       
       
       Mr Ekevati was asked where the gun was and he answered: 
       
       
        
         
          
          It was still, he was still pointing at my cousins. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In cross-examination Mr Ekevati said that when the gun was produced the man was walking backwards, but the four companions were continuing to chase him. The gun had no effect on their chase. The next thing that happened was that Mr Ekevati heard the gun shot (Tr p443). The man was still backing away after the shot (Tr p451). 
        
       
       
       Later Mr Ekevati agreed that  
      “everything  
      [he] 
       saw on that night told  
      [him] 
       that the first shot  
      [he] 
       heard was a warning shot”. 
       
       
      •  
      Rachel Hampshire 
       was walking with friends along Darlinghurst Road. She was passed by a group of five Islanders. She heard raised voices. She turned and saw that they were surrounding someone on the footpath of Darlinghurst Road. Ms Hampshire looked up and saw a man standing in front of the shops with a gun in both hands. She was about 3-4 metres away. She demonstrated what she saw, indicating that both arms were extended with both hands touching the weapon (Tr p277). 
       
       
       Ms Hampshire was asked what happened so far as the movement of the gun was concerned after she first saw it in the extended arm position. She said: 
       
       
        
         
          
          Well, when I saw the man pointing the gun at the group I turned to look at the group and that is when I heard the gun go off, the pop sound, and then I looked back towards the man with the gun and I can’t really recall what he did with the gun at that point. I think he may have lowered it. I’m not sure. 
          
         
        
       
       
       
       Ms Hampshire said that she saw the gun pointing at the Islanders and heard a pop sound. She did not recall seeing the man holding the gun in that position move before she heard the pop sound (Tr p278). It was Ms Hampshire’s impression that the gun appeared to be pointed at one person in particular (Tr p279). 
       
       
       The cross-examiner elicited from Ms Hampshire that she was tipsy at the time, but he did not challenge her on what she had observed as regards the pointing of the gun and its shooting. 
       
      
    22 Dick Andrews was a taxi driver who was parked on the rank in Darlinghurst Road. Mr Andrews moved to South Africa before the trial. Arrangements were made for him to be a witness at the trial, including the provision of an air ticket and a visa. He missed the Qantas flight from Johannesburg to Sydney because (through some confusion about ticketing) he was unable to board a connecting flight to Johannesburg. It had not been practical to rearrange flights for him to attend the trial.  
     
      
    23 The Crown Prosecutor asked that Mr Andrews’ statement be read to the jury and that an associated diagram be admitted into evidence. Defence counsel indicated that he had no objection to the course proposed. He said that he did not want to ask the police officers any questions concerning the absence of the witness. The statement was then read. It had been signed on the day after the shooting. 
     
      
    24 The statement reads in part: 
     
      
       
        
        6. I was sitting in my cab (marked 1) when I noticed a fight coming around the corner from Bayswater road. Then around into Darlinghurst road. There was a white male running with a Fijian male chasing after him, about six feet apart. The white male was heading along the footpath then turned and went across the road. The white male has tripped and fallen down onto the road (marked 2).  
        
       
       
        
        7. The Fijian male has run up to him and started to punch him on the ground, with both hands, in the face. I also saw the Fijian male kick the white man who was on the ground. The white man was trying to get up off the ground.  
        
       
       
        
        8. There was another group that had come around the corner following the two fighting. There were two more Fijians and another white male. They were not fighting but I could tell they were with the two who were fighting. 
        
       
       
        
        9. I was watching the fight and I saw a gun thrown from the group to the white male on the ground. The gun landed on the roadway and skidded and stopped just near the feet of the white male. The white male on the ground grabbed hold of the gun, got to his feet and ran off.  
        
       
       
        
        10. The white male ran back in front of my cab, onto the footpath and run north on the eastern foot path. The Fijian male has continued to chase him along the footpath. The rest of the group have continued to follow the two fighting but not getting involved or fighting...  
        
       
       
        
        11. The Fijian guy caught the white male...and started to punch him again. This was still on the footpath and both males were standing. I saw both persons throwing punches at each other. The white male was only punching with his left hand. He was still holding the gun in his right hand. 
        
       
       
        
        12. The white male has then pointed the gun at the Fijian, straight into his face. The gun was very close to the Fijian's face. It was maybe twenty centimetres from his face. The gun was pointed right into the centre of his face. The white male is still trying to punch him with his left hand while he had the gun pointed at the Fijian.  
        
       
       
        
        13. The Fijian was still trying to punch the white man. He was also hitting the gun. It looked like he was trying to knock it away. The Fijian was also yelling at the white male: 'Shoot, shoot, if you want to shoot, shoot.'  
        
       
       
        
        14. The white male has then fired a shot at the Fijian. I saw the finger of the white man pull the trigger on the gun. The Fijian was still trying to knock the gun aside but he wasn't near the trigger. I heard a loud bang. I saw a flare from the barrel of the gun and some smoke. The shot missed the Fijian. I think it went past him on the Fijian's right side about head level. I did not hear the shot hit anything. 
        
       
       
        
        15. After he fired the gun, the white male ran off north along the footpath again. The Fijian has continued to chase the white man and caught him again just north of the hotel...""  
        
       
      
    25 The learned trial judge immediately gave the following direction: 
     
      
       
        
        Members of the jury you have had that statement read. It forms part of the evidence that you have got to consider. What weight you give to it ultimately is a matter for you. The person who made this statement isn’t here. You have heard about what happened to efforts to get him here. You haven’t heard him being cross-examined and you do not have the benefit of making assessments of him. But, there it is. That is the statement he made and it is part of the evidence that you have to weigh up. 
        
       
      
    26 The addresses of counsel are part of the appeal record. 
     
      
    27 Much of the Crown address related to the issue of identification. 
     
      
    28 Towards the end of that part of the submissions, the prosecutor referred to the evidence establishing that the two shots came from the one gun. In that context, she made reference to Mr Andrews’ statement. She reminded the jury that they had the difficulty of not knowing anything about Mr Andrews except what had been read out to them. She relied upon the portion of the statement referring to the fighting in the centre of the road during which a gun was slid across to the appellant from the place where “the other group then is”. She submitted that the jury should infer that the gun came from the appellant’s associate who was himself engaged in a struggle with the other Islanders. (Nowhere in the trial had it been suggested that the deceased or his Fijian companions had been carrying a gun.) 
     
      
    29 The Crown Prosecutor made no reference to Mr Andrews’ statement in the context of the second count. Her submissions were very brief in that regard (Tr pp609-10). In essence, she invited the jury to infer from the fact that a shot was fired, that the shooting was intentional. 
     
      
    30 Mr Lucas of counsel represented the appellant at trial. He too concentrated at the outset on the issue of identification. He submitted that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the man who fired the gun. 
     
      
    31 Counsel then turned to the alternative case which proceeded from the contrary assumption. Early in his submissions he drew attention to the evidence suggesting that the first shot had been a “warning shot”. Counsel put to the jury that a warning shot could not be a shot discharged with intention to do grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    32 Defence counsel then addressed the first count in the indictment. He started with the evidence of Mr Andrews. He reminded the jury of what the judge had told them, namely that they may have regard to Mr Andrews’ evidence, but that it had not been the subject of cross-examination. He added: 
     
      
       
        
        You might have seen witnesses called who were forced to concede various matters when giving evidence so you may see the value of cross-examination in a criminal trial. 
         
        
       
      
    33 The Crown submission inviting the jury to conclude that the pistol had been thrown to the accused by one of his associates was described as “absolute rubbish”. Ambiguities and possible ambiguities of the Andrews’ statement were then raised, interspersed with reminders that they might have been clarified if there had been cross-examination. Counsel made much of the fact that Mr Andrews’ absence left many questions unresolved. 
     
      
    34 Defence counsel also embraced part of Mr Andrews’ statement (contingently upon the jury accepting that the accused was the person identified). It was submitted that, if the accused had picked up the gun (as Mr Andrews alone said) it was strange that he had not shot the deceased there and then if his purpose that night was to shoot someone. Instead, the appellant ran off (Tr pp623-4). This submission was then linked with the defence case regarding Count 1, in particular the denial of intention to kill and the raising of self-defence. 
     
      
    35 When the learned trial judge came to sum up on the particular facts he too focussed his early attention on the issue of identification. Studdert J then gave general directions about the matters to be proved on the first count, including those referable to the alternative verdict of manslaughter. 
     
      
    36 The judge then turned to the evidence of the particular witnesses in so far as they bore upon the first count. The conflicting evidence as to who was the aggressor and as to the firing of the first shot was recounted in detail. It included the evidence elicited in cross-examination to the effect that some of the Fijian witnesses thought that the first shot was a warning shot. 
     
      
    37 Studdert J made no reference to Mr Andrews’ statement in his summing up as to the facts on the first count. His Honour concluded in the following terms (SU 53): 
     
      
       
        
        Well, the Crown says, you will have regard to that evidence I have reviewed with you in considering the Crown’s submission that what happened in this continuing skirmish was initiated by the accused so that self-defence does not arise and you will bear in mind the contrary submission by Mr Lucas to the effect that that submission of the Crown is not to be accepted because the evidence establishes the accused was anything but a willing participant in the stage affairs had reached prior to this shooting, all he was trying to do was to get away. 
        
       
      
    38 Addressing the second count, Studdert J reminded the jury that defence counsel had submitted that the Crown failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the first firing was done with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. There was evidence that it was a warning shot, with the weapon not having been being pointed at anybody (SU 71). That evidence was then recounted to the jury, as were the evidence and submissions in the Crown case referable to the second count. Once again no reliance was placed upon the Andrews’ statement as supporting either the Crown or defence case on the second count. 
     
      
    39 It was clear that the summing up was coming to an end. In the absence of the jury, the Crown Prosecutor reminded Studdert J about the evidence of Mr Andrews “who I think we have all forgotten, and I failed to remember during the course of address, he says in para 13 he was saying ‘if you want to shoot, shoot’. Then your Honour it is he who gives for the Crown the highest account in paragraph 14 of the first shooting” (SU 83). 
     
      
    40 When the jury returned his Honour referred them to portions of Mr Andrews’ statement (SU 85).  
     
      
    41 The transcription of the first passage in the summing up is not an accurate rendition of the text of par 13 of the Andrews’ statement, which had previously been read to the jury. The opening sentence of the portion apparently quoted by his Honour reads “Whilst the white male was pointing a gun at the Fijian, the man who was shot…”. This, I infer, was his Honour’s introduction, fairly based upon para 12 of the statement and the facts of the case. It appears that the summing up has been incorrectly transcribed in this regard. 
     
      
    42 What followed was an almost verbatim reading of par 13 of the statement, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        … the Fijian was … trying to punch him and was hitting the gun and the Fijian was yelling out at the man with the gun “Shoot, shoot if you want to. Shoot”. 
        
       
      
    43 Studdert J then read par 14 of the statement, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The white male has then fired a shot at the Fijian. I saw the finger of the white man pull the trigger on the gun. The Fijian was still trying to knock the gun aside but he wasn’t near the trigger. I heard a loud bang. I saw a flash from the barrel of the gun and saw some smoke. The shot missed the Fijian. I think it went past him on the Fijian’s right side about head level. I did not hear the shot hit anything. 
        
       
      
    44 The judge continued: 
     
      
       
        
        That is relevant to the second count, that is the first shooting incident. So it is another piece of evidence, albeit unsworn and untested in cross-examination, but it is another piece of evidence which the Crown would call in aid as proving the intent and the malicious element of the offence charged in the second count. 
        
       
      
    45 No redirection was sought. 
     
      
    46 There was a later reminder in the summing up about the unsworn and untested nature of Mr Andrews’ statement (SU 143). 
     
      
    47 The appellant relies upon ground 1 in respect of the challenge to both convictions. 
     
      
    48 He recognises that s165 of the Evidence Act was not engaged, because there was no request for the warnings and information contemplated by sub-s (2) thereof. He submits that there was nevertheless a miscarriage because of the trial judge’s failure in the particular circumstances to give an appropriate warning about the difficulties with hearsay evidence. It was common ground in the appeal that the common law may enliven a duty to give directions and/or warnings such as may be “necessary to avoid the perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case” (Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 86); and that in a proper case this could include a warning about hearsay. 
     
      
    49 Mr Andrews’ statement was the highpoint of the Crown case on the second count. But it was not unequivocal on the critical issue of the shooter’s intent. For one thing, Mr Andrews’ evidence was that the gun was pointed into the centre of the man’s face at a distance of about 20 centimetres. The Fijian was trying to punch the man with the gun and was hitting the gun. One might think that it was unlikely that the shooter would accidentally miss at this close range. 
     
      
    50 There were also conflicts between Mr Andrews’ account and the accounts of other witnesses. 
     
      
       
      • Andrews described the initial assault on a white man as involving only one Fijian male, when virtually every other witness described an attack by three or four Fijians 
       
       
      • Andrews described a gun being thrown to the white male who was initially assaulted – no other witness saw this happen (although there was some circumstantial evidence to support it) 
       
       
      • no witness other than Andrews saw the man with the gun punching his attacker just before the gun was discharged 
       
       
      • Andrews’ statement that he saw  
      “the finger of the white man pull the trigger of the gun” 
       is said to be implausible in the circumstances. 
       
      
    51 The appellant raises those matters as reasons for doubting Mr Andrews’ account. So much may be conceded, but these were factual discrepancies which were before the jury. No special expertise was involved in addressing these issues. No miscarriage is established by the appellant pointing to the relative lack of attention given to the detailed differences at the trial as compared with the closer examination on appeal. 
     
      
    52 Section 165 provides a non-exhaustive list of “evidence of a kind that may be unreliable”. As regards matters falling outside the list in subsection (1), the cases support the view that “unreliability” is concerned with matters within the special knowledge and experience of the court of which the jury may be unaware (R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298, R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301). 
     
      
    53 Hearsay evidence is such a matter. It is specially mentioned in s165(1). The Australian Law Reform Commission Report on Evidence (ALRC 26 vol 1, para 662) suggested that features of hearsay evidence that should be considered include: 
     
      
       
        
        • that the evidence relies on compounding the perception, memory, narration skills and the sincerity of both the maker of the representation and the witness who narrates it in court, particularly where the hearsay is not first-hand or the maker has no personal knowledge; 
        
       
       
        
        • the potential for an out-of-court statement to be susceptible to falsification, to be the product of suggestibility or to be influenced by stress; 
        
       
       
        
        • the inability to test an out-of-court statement by cross-examination; 
        
       
       
        
        • the lack of oath or affirmation. 
        
       
      
    54 In Mendham and Foster (1993) 71 A Crim R 382 this Court considered the warning appropriate to be given when a committal deposition of a witness unable to attend the trial is tendered under s409 of the Crimes Act 1900. Gleeson CJ (with whom Handley JA and Grove J agreed) said (at 388): 
     
      
       
        
        The authorities make it clear that, even if Sergeant Hain’s deposition had been admissible under s409, the trial judge should have given the jury an appropriate warning of the approach to be taken of that evidence. His Honour was asked to give such a warning but declined to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Henriques 
         (1991) 93 Cr App R 237 at 242 the Privy Council said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “When a judge allows deposition evidence to be admitted he should as a matter of course warn the jury that they have neither had the benefit of seeing the deponent nor of hearing his evidence tested in cross-examination and that they must take this into consideration when evaluating the reliability of his evidence. Furthermore as Lord Griffiths said in  
          Scott and Barns

            ‘in many cases it will be appropriate for a judge to develop this warning by pointing out particular features of the evidence in the deposition which conflict with other evidence and which could have been explored in cross-examination.’” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The present case involved a good example of the sort of thing to which Lord Griffiths was referring. There was a clear and important conflict between the evidence of Hain and the evidence of Eastwood, relating to the matter of Hain’s notebook. This is just the sort of matter that should have been dealt with in the course of an appropriate warning. 
        
       
      
    55 Two observations are immediately pertinent in relation to Mendham and Foster. A warning was requested. And secondly, the “evidence of Eastwood, relating to the matter of Hain’s notebook” to which the Chief Justice referred was of a particularly compelling kind. Hain was a police officer who had said at committal that he had made no note of an incriminating admission. Eastwood was a fellow officer who said that Hain had made such a record in Hain’s notebook which he (Eastwood) had seen about a week before the trial (see at 384). 
     
      
    56 See also Williams v R (2000) 119 A Crim R 490 at 506. 
     
      
    57 In my view there was no miscarriage in the present case. No warning was sought. The jury were told by the judge three times that the statement was unsworn and untested. The statement was first-hand hearsay. Unlike Mendham and Foster, there was no pall of suspicion about the circumstances giving rise to the witness’ non-attendance at trial. Mr Andrews’ statement was read without objection, and I infer that this was because it assisted the defence case on the more serious charge of murder. No special expertise was involved in perceiving the points of difference between Mr Andrews’ evidence and the evidence relied upon by the defence about the “warning shot”. That evidence had been recounted earlier in the summing up. It was not incumbent on the judge to repeat it when, reminded by counsel of his omission to refer to the Andrews statement, he read portions of that statement to the jury. He reminded them that: 
     
      
       
        
        … it is another piece of evidence, albeit unsworn and untested in cross-examination…. 
        
       
      
    58 I would therefore refuse leave under r4 and reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    59 I would however uphold ground 2 and set aside the conviction on the second count, given the untested but critical material in the Andrews’ statement; the body of evidence (some of it from the deceased’s companions) about the shot being perceived as a warning shot; the relative unlikelihood that the appellant would have missed the deceased had he shot from the close quarters described by Mr Andrews; and the defensive behaviour of the appellant after the first shooting as he retreated from the advancing deceased. I conclude that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant shot with intent to hit the deceased. The very fact that Mr Andrews was not cross-examined means that the jury were not in a superior position to this Court, since they did not see the key witness. 
     
      
    60 The appellant does not submit that the verdict on the manslaughter count was unreasonable having regard to the evidence. I have already indicated that the trial judge concluded that it rested upon excessive self-defence. The conclusion that the conviction on the second count cannot be sustained does not undermine the conviction on the first count or enliven the argument that the manslaughter conviction miscarried because of the failure to give a stronger direction about Mr Andrews’ evidence. I am also of the opinion that the unsupportable verdict of the jury on the second count does not undermine the conviction on the first count. The body of evidence in support of the Crown case on the first count was compelling and did not depend on the evidence supporting the second count. There was abundant evidence of the brawl taking place before the appellant ran away chased by the deceased. The jury did not, in my view, need a greater level of judicial assistance in assessing the factual controversies touching the first shooting incident. 
     
      
    61 Sentence 
     
      
      As earlier mentioned, the judge found that the appellant fired the fatal shot deliberately and that he should be sentenced on the basis that the Crown failed to prove that the appellant did not believe what he did was unnecessary in his self defence. Put briefly this was a case of excessive self defence. As the judge said the appellant's response was not reasonable in the circumstances as he perceived them. The judge was influenced by the deceased not being armed and the appellant shooting the deceased at very close range. These were major factors. 
       
      
    62 The judge accepted that the appellant was punched and kicked by the deceased in Darlinghurst Road relatively close to the intersection with Bayswater Road, that the deceased had acted very aggressively towards the appellant prior to the first shot being fired and thereafter until the second and fatal shot was fired. The deceased alone continued to pursue the appellant as he ran away along Darlinghurst Road after the first shot. The deceased caught the appellant in front of the doorway of a backpacker hostel and engaged him. They ended up on the ground where they wrestled and fought and struggled. The deceased, who was younger and taller than the appellant, was on top of him. It was about this time that the appellant shot the deceased. Up to that point the appellant seemed to be getting the worst of the fight. 
     
      
    63 Until the appellant fired the gun it had been a fist and body fight. A tall young man can do a lot of damage by kicking, punching and seizing hold of an older man. He could have either killed the appellant or inflicted serious wounds upon him. The use of a gun transformed the struggle and fatally so. Even in the heat of the moment it was obvious that the use of a gun at such close quarters was very dangerous and could well result in a fatality. The appellant reasonably believed he had to act in self defence but he went much too far and well beyond the limits of legitimate self defence. 
     
      
    64 The judge gave detailed and careful consideration to the question of sentence. He remarked: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          In assessing the objective gravity of this crime of manslaughter, I accept that the prisoner is to be regarded as having believed that the shooting was necessary to defend himself, and I take into account all the events that preceded the shooting, including that the prisoner had been punched and kicked, that his threat to use the gun did not discourage the deceased and that the deceased was apparently having the better of the encounter in the doorway until the firing of the fatal shot. However, to use this weapon in the manner in which it was used was not a reasonable response even in the circumstances as the prisoner perceived them. The community cannot condone the use of guns, and there is a need to deter not only the prisoner but others from their use. 
          
         
        
       
      
    65 The judge accepted that the crime involved no pre-planning. He observed that he was ""concerned to impose punishment for the use of the weapon with its consequences."" The judge reminded himself that a human life had been taken and that a weapon was used to take it. 
     
      
    66 The appellant was born on 14 July 1962. His criminal history revealed some minor offences in the early eighties and a mid PCA in early 1991. That history was of no consequence and he should be regarded as a person of good character for sentencing purposes. There was a formidable body of evidence by way of testimonials as to his good character. 
     
      
    67 The judge made these important remarks as to the appellant's subjective features: 
     
      
       
        
        The prisoner has been in a relationship with his current de facto wife for some nineteen years His de facto wife, Ms Jennifer Dunn, gave evidence of her relationship with the prisoner. There is one child of the union, Andre, who suffers from cerebral palsy. Andre was born on 17 June 1991. In addition to that disability the son has recently been diagnosed with dystonia, a rare form of muscular disorder. Ms Dunn said that the prisoner had pursued employment as a scaffolder and rigger but once it was appreciated that the son would need very extensive care, it was decided that the prisoner, whose employment was less remunerative than that of Ms Dunn, would become the full time carer and Ms Dunn would pursue remunerative employment. According to Ms Dunn, those roles were pursued until the time the prisoner went into custody following the verdict of the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Dunn said that she will be standing by the prisoner, and I accept that this is so. I also accept the evidence of the witness to the effect that their son and the prisoner have a very close relationship and that the son is very dependent upon his father. I accept that Andre misses his father deeply. As a consequence of the prisoner's imprisonment, Ms Dunn had to give up her employment and to assume a full time role caring for her son. I have no doubt that the prisoner's imprisonment will cause financial hardship to his wife and child, as well as acute emotional distress which will, doubtless, be shared by the prisoner himself. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Ben Patynowski is an engineering surveyor with the Roads and Traffic Authority who has known the prisoner for twenty years, and he gave evidence concerning that association and his favourable assessment of the prisoner as a loving husband and a very effective caregiver of his son. 
         
         
        One puzzling feature that arises from he evidence of Mr Patynowski is that according to him the prisoner has been pursuing employment at night as a bouncer, working in a club. That does not accord with the evidence of Ms Dunn. Nor does it accord with the history taken by the probation and parole officer for the report tendered to the Court s Exhibit B. The Court has not had the benefit of evidence from the prisoner. 
         
         
        The prisoner was assessed by Ms Robilliard, psychologist, and Ms Robilliard has concluded her report with this expression of opinion: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'The client has no significant criminal history nor are there any indicators in his personal life and habits that suggest unstable, antisocial or aggressive behaviour. He appears to have a happy marriage and a very responsible attitude to his roles as partner and parent. His work history has been similarly without incident. His involvement in the offence appears therefore, to be out of character. Georghe maintains that he acted to defend himself against an aggressive attack and that he feared for his life.' 
           
          
         
        Having regard to the psychological assessment, the evidence of Ms Dunn and the other evidence of good character before me, I do accept that the commission of these offences for which the prisoner is to be sentenced was out of character, although the prisoner has expressed no contrition for what happened, and has not sought to explain to the Court why he acted as he did. 
        
       
       
        
        On my assessment of the evidence in this case, the prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation appear to be good, but the prisoner faces his first term of imprisonment and it will be for a significant period. In my opinion, he will require and benefit from the opportunity of an extended period of supervision when he is released, and I am satisfied therefore that there are special circumstances for the purposes of s.44(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999. 
        
       
      
    68 The judge correctly found special circumstances and for the reasons which he gave. 
     
      
    69 The sentencing exercise was one of considerable difficulty bearing in mind that the appellant had to act in self defence. The appellant would have been aware that he was being attacked by a man who had had a lot to drink and exhibited much aggression. The appellant had to get away from the deceased to avoid further injury. That would have struck him as a very difficult task physically without some assistance. Hence the use of the gun. 
     
      
    70 The appellant had been cornered by the deceased and was being overcome. His own health and safety were endangered. He would have been very fearful of loss of life or grave injury. This was the reason he gave the Probation and Parole Officer. 
     
      
    71 As has been said so often, the sentences for manslaughter vary greatly because of the markedly different circumstances in which the offence is committed. Little useful guidance can be obtained from analysing sentences where the circumstances differ. The cases emphasise that the sanctity of human life is of paramount importance. Nevertheless given the circumstances of this offence, including the need for the appellant to act in self defence to extricate himself from the fearful position he was in, and his powerful subjective features, a head sentence of 8 years is manifestly excessive. The correct head sentence was one of 6 years 6 months. As earlier indicated, there were the special circumstances found by the judge. The correct non-parole period is one of 4 years. That reflects that this is the appellant's first time in custody, the good prospects of rehabilitation and his need for an extended period of supervision. Amongst other things, he will have to cope with again assisting to care for a child with significant disabilities. 
     
      
    72 Proceeding under the present sentencing legislation it is first determined that the non-parole period is one of 4 years being the least period which the applicant should serve in prison and that the total sentence should be one of 6 years 6 months. The same end result follows whatever approach is taken. 
     
      
       
      Disposition 
      
    73 The following orders are proposed: 
     
      
      1. Appeal upheld in part 
       
      2. Set aside the conviction under s33A of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
       and in lieu thereof enter a verdict of acquittal. 
       
      3. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      4. Appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      5. In lieu of the sentence imposed the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years 6 months starting on 17 June 2002 and ending on 16 December 2008 with a non-parole period of 4 years starting on 17 June 2002 and ending on 16 June 2006. The first date on which the appellant is eligible for release on parole is 17 June 2006.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: The applicant, Stephen Charles Bell, pleaded guilty to three counts of assaulting a police officer acting in the execution of his duty but without occasioning actual bodily harm; s60(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. On 16 December 2002 his Honour Judge Gibson sentenced the applicant on the third count to imprisonment for two years commencing on 10 October 2002 with a non-parole period of eighteen months to commence on the same date. On each of the first two counts his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of twelve months to commence on 10 October 2002. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against severity. 
     
      
    2 The offences charged occurred on 2 March 2002. At about 11.40 pm on that date police observed the applicant’s motor vehicle being driven at high speed. Pursuit resulted in the vehicle colliding with the kerb at which point a passenger fled and the applicant who had been observed in the driver’s seat tried to get out of the front passenger’s seat. Police ran to the vehicle and told the applicant, who was familiar to them as a disqualified driver, that he was under arrest. The applicant refused to get out of the vehicle and became aggressive. During a struggle one of the police officers drew his extendable baton and the applicant punched him on the left arm and chest (count 1). The officer struck the applicant on his left arm with the baton and attempted to restrain him again. Police attempted to handcuff him but the applicant continued to struggle and was pushed to the ground. The applicant kicked out at the same police officer striking him in the left leg several times (count 2). The applicant, who was then lying on his back, yelled out to the officer “I have hepatitis and I’m going to spit in your face so that you get it too and have a life of misery” (count 3). 
     
      
    3 In his remarks on sentence, Judge Gibson said that the applicant, who was drunk, behaved in an appalling manner both as to his language and physical actions towards the police officers who were there and later at the hospital to which he was taken. Had it not been for the intervention of two people who had been in the car with the applicant and who put their hands over his face the preparations he had made to spit at the police officer might have been carried into effect. The applicant’s actions were appalling and frightening.  
     
      
    4 At the time of sentencing the applicant was 35 years of age. According to the probation report, he had a very dysfunctional background as a young person and his problems had continued into adult life. He was a drug user and had only worked occasionally. The applicant was a passenger in a car which was involved in an accident. As a result he was incapacitated for work. The sentencing Judge noted that despite this incapacity with a bad back the applicant was still prepared to engage in physical contact with others.  
     
      
    5 The applicant had two children from a long-standing de facto relationship. The elder of these children, a teenage boy, was doing school exams. He had never been in trouble and the applicant was very proud of him.  
     
      
    6 At about the time of the incident in March 2002 the applicant had trouble with criminal associates which resulted in his possessions being stolen, his vehicle destroyed and his home firebombed. He apparently had difficulty in eliciting an appropriate response from the police when he sought help. Certain people were charged and the applicant gave evidence. However, those persons were acquitted. As a result, at the time of sentencing the applicant, who was in custody, was held in special segregation. The sentencing Judge took that factor into account.  
     
      
    7 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has a long record and gains very little assistance from that by way of mitigation. He does not receive more because of his record, but he does not receive the mitigation that others with a lesser record would. I take into consideration the early plea as some evidence of his remorse, but I also note the circumstances and strength of the Crown case. I take into consideration his physical condition and note that the Commission has facilities for the physic [sic] well being of inmates. 
        
       
       
        
        I make allowance for the utilitarian value of the plea and the early plea and I take both those matters into consideration, in allowing an overall figure of 20 per cent. I take into consideration all matters relevant under s21A of the Sentencing Procedures Act. 
        
       
       
        
        It has been suggested that I should find special circumstances in his prospects of rehabilitation, but on the evidence before me, including the facts that he was on two bonds at the time of this offence, I make no such finding. It was submitted that these matters should all carry concurrent sentences as they were all part of the one sentence [sic offence] and with that I agree. However, the fact that no one was injured does not carry any weight as the section makes specific provision for when bodily harm is occasioned by increasing the penalty. 
        
       
       
        
        Objectively, the assaults were very serious, they were committed whilst the prisoner was on two separate bonds and while it can be expected that police officers will, while carrying out their duties, be in situations that means that they will encounter violence, that is not to say that the law or these Courts regard what happens to police officers as of little moment, they do not. 
        
       
       
        
        The mental anguish occasioned by the threat in the first [sic third] count is worse in my view, than what occurred in the first two. Whilst it is true the threat was not carried out, the uttering of it, and the inability of the victim to do anything made it very real for that period of time. It is the third count upon which I will sentence the prisoner for the overall criminality of the offences, and it was submitted that there should be some adjustment due to the fact that the matters were not dealt with at the same time as the matter in July, through no fault of the prisoner and also I should also take into consideration the fact that the matters could have been dealt with in the Local Court. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst that is true, and I will take it into consideration, there is no doubt that these matters were deliberately and in my view, properly laid in this Court. The matter for which he was sentenced on 25 July, was a separate and distinct breach of the law, and if the matters had all been dealt with at the same time, there is no doubt there would have been some overlapping of the sentences, and for that reason I propose to commence these sentences as from 10 October. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to count three, which is the sentence for the overall criminality, I would have imposed a sentence of two and a half years, but I allow a 20 per cent discount which reduced it to two years. It will commence on 10 October 2002, and will expire on 9 October 2004. There will be a non-parole period of 18 months, which will commence on 10 October 2002 and expire on 9 April 2004, upon which date he will be released subject to supervision and such other orders as the Parole Board deems meet. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to counts one and two, there will be a 12 months fixed term on each count, commencing on 10/10/02 and expiring on 9/10/03 upon which date he will be discharged on those matters.” 
        
       
      
    8 The applicant was not charged for the three offences until 11 April 2002 when he was arrested. On 25 July 2002 he was sentenced at Dubbo Local Court to twelve months imprisonment with a six months non-parole period. This sentence was for a series of other matters and the applicant’s breach of the terms of a suspended sentence imposed on 1 September 2001. It was backdated to begin on 11 April 2002 so that the applicant was eligible for parole on 10 October 2002. On 10 October the applicant was released on parole. On 30 October he was arrested on other charges and refused bail. Hence, he was in custody at the time of sentence by Judge Gibson. Even though the applicant had been released on 10 October for a period of twenty days the sentencing Judge commenced the sentences from that date. 
     
      
    9 The ground of the applicant’s application for leave to appeal against severity was expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in considering special circumstances by failing to have regard to the effect of accumulation upon existing sentences.” 
        
       
      
    10 Ms Francis appeared for the applicant. The nub of her written submissions was that the applicant had been in continuous custody since 11 April 2002 and would remain in custody until 9 April 2004. This was translated into a submission that the applicant would serve a sentence of two years and six months with an effective non-parole period of two years. This was claimed to be disproportionate. It was submitted that the accumulation was a special circumstance to be considered in fixing the non-parole period which the sentencing Judge did not take into account and which should have resulted in a reduction of the non-parole period for the third count, so as to make the applicant eligible for parole before 9 April 2004. In support of this argument particular reference was made to R v Lyndon [2003] NSWCCA 152, particularly para 16. In that case Smart AJ, with the concurrence of James J, found that an accumulation of sentences which, when added to the sentence imposed, resulted in continuous custody for four and a half years, was a special circumstance to be taken into account when fixing the non-parole period. 
     
      
    11 Ms Francis conceded, as the Crown had pointed out in its written submissions, that on 2 April 2003 the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of twelve months to commence on 2 March 2003 and to expire on 1 March 2004 for the offence of supply prohibited drug. Thus, even if this Court were minded to intervene, no more could be achieved on the present appeal than to order the applicant to be released on parole on 1 March 2004. Factually this case is distinguishable from Lyndon. The applicant has not been in continuous custody since 11 April 2002 but was released on 10 October 2002 and was at liberty until 30 October 2002 when he was returned to custody on other matters. 
     
      
    12 In the course of her oral submissions Ms Francis enlarged upon the matters relied upon in the notice of appeal to suggest error. She emphasised the need for the applicant to be held in some form of protective custody and his prospects of rehabilitation to which, she submitted, the sentencing Judge did not give sufficient weight. 
     
      
    13 I entirely agree with what the sentencing Judge said about the seriousness of these assaults on a police officer and particularly what his Honour said about the third count and the threat made to the police officer in the course of performing his duty, which his Honour rightly regarded as likely to occasion great mental anguish to that officer. In the probation report available to the sentencing Judge and dated 21 June 2002 it was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In recent months he [the applicant] has shown some definite progress towards resolving some long standing criminogenic factors of his lifestyle. However, since March 2002 his lifestyle has deteriorated and he has reverted to the former well entrenched pattern of drug abuse and offending behaviours.” 
        
       
      
    14 With due respect to the submissions put, no basis whatever is shown to support a suggestion that the sentencing Judge did not take into account and give weight to all appropriate considerations both objective and subjective. In my opinion, the sentences were well within the range and no error is shown which would entitle this Court to intervene. I would grant the applicant’s application for leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    15 SULLY J: I agree with Sheller JA. 
     
      
    16 HOWIE J: I agree with Sheller JA.

    CRIMINAL LAW – sentencing – murder – finding that prisoner would present significant risk of re-offending – whether finding must be made on criminal onus 
     
     FACTS 
    At the age of 13½ the applicant broke into a home at night, abducted a three year old girl who remained asleep, and some 300 metres away stabbed her to death with a knife. He pleaded guilty to murder. There was no evidence of mental illness and no defence of diminished responsibility. The sentencing Judge (Wood CJ at CL) sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 20 years, and fixed a non-parole period of ten years. The applicant sought leave to appeal on the ground that the sentencing Judge had not found, and could not find, on the criminal onus, that he posed a significant risk to society on his release but had nevertheless taken that into account in fixing the head sentence. HELD: A sentencing Judge is entitled to take into account the risks to society that the prisoner will present in the future without having to find that the prisoner will re-offend or that the risk of his doing so has been established beyond all reasonable doubt.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: S L D, a boy aged thirteen years and ten months at the time of the offence, pleaded guilty to the murder during the night of 29 January 2001 of a three year old girl who lived nearby. On 30 August 2002, after an extended hearing, he was sentenced by Wood CJ at CL to imprisonment for twenty years to commence from 29 January 2001 with a non-parole period of ten years. He has applied for leave to appeal from his sentence on the ground that the sentencing Judge erred in assessing the risk that he would pose to the community in future and on the ground that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    2 The 29th January 2001 was a hot night and the victim’s parents left the main doors of their house open with the screen doors locked. The applicant obtained entry to the victim’s home by cutting the gauze and went into her bedroom. He removed her nappy without waking her and then carried her outside for a distance of some 300 metres. He then placed her on a concrete driveway and stabbed her in the chest with a knife with fatal results. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing Judge was satisfied that the applicant intended to kill the girl but he was unable to determine, on the criminal onus, whether the offence was premeditated or impulsive. He said that “in many ways a motiveless and inexplicable murder of the kind here seen is as serious as one which was preplanned and motivated” (para 17).  
     
      
    4 The Judge held that the applicant had to be sentenced in accordance with s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 and that he must apply decisions of this Court which placed significant weight on rehabilitation. He said that nevertheless, where the offence was one of gross criminality, as in the present case, punishment and personal deterrence also had to be taken into account. He also had to take into account what the future held for the applicant and the community when he was released. 
     
      
    5 His Honour carefully reviewed the relevant evidence and made findings as to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. Until his adoption in 1993 these were horrific. His mother who had a history of substance abuse physically and emotionally abused her children. Intelligence testing placed him in the borderline disabled range (para 37) or at the low average range of intellectual functioning at the 18th percentile (para 47). 
     
      
    6 His Honour reviewed the medical and other expert evidence. It was not suggested that the applicant suffered from any form of mental illness. Mr Champion, a clinical psychologist, thought that the applicant’s prognosis in terms of his future mental state and involvement in criminal offending was very poor (para 46). Dr Waters, a psychiatrist, thought that the likelihood of the applicant now changing into a reasonably socialised adult was “reasonably low” (para 61). He said that there were difficulties in coming to any definite diagnosis as to the presence of a personality disorder before the applicant was eighteen although his history meant that the chances of him developing an anti-social or substance abuse disorder or a borderline personality disorder were in excess of 50% and could be of the order of 70%. The fact that he had killed once made it even more likely that such a disorder would develop (para 63).  
     
      
    7 Dr Westmore, the other psychiatrist who gave evidence, accepted that while the prognosis was poor at the present time a positive outcome could not be excluded. He agreed with Dr Waters that it was possible that the applicant could comply with the ordered structures of the correctional system but resume dangerous behaviour once released and those most likely to be at risk would be the more vulnerable persons in society. 
     
      
    8 The Judge made the following ultimate findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “126. In my view, his history is such that, consistently with the expert opinions placed before the Court, he must be judged as posing a significant level of future dangerousness and to be at a substantial risk of reoffending in both violent and sexual ways. There are also very strong indications … that he will develop a significant antisocial or borderline personality disorder, of some magnitude. 
        
       
       
        
        127. Whether that can be addressed in the course of the Robinson Program [at the Reiby Detention Centre], and precisely how S L D would behave once free of the structured and controlled environment of the custodial system, are problematic in the extreme …” 
        
       
      
    9 The Judge noted that under the legislative framework his only option was to fix a head sentence and if that was other than imprisonment for life, to specify a non-parole period. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “138. As the law presently stands, I must impose a sentence in the light of what is presently known, notwithstanding the circumstance that the none of the psychiatrists or psychologists who have examined S L D and who have given evidence, can be certain what the future holds, or what truly motivated him …  
        
       
       
        
        139. The only alternative, as I see it, is to impose a significant head sentence which would reflect my assessment that the present offence fell into the upper range of objective seriousness, and that S L D poses a significant risk of recidivism and of being a serious risk to the community in terms of potentially killing again or committing sexual offences.” 
        
       
      
    10 In the light of those findings he passed the sentence which the applicant seeks to challenge. 
     
      
    11 The applicant’s submissions, prepared in written form by Mr Zahra SC and presented orally by Mr Craigie SC were in summary that: 
     
      
    · The finding by the sentencing Judge that the applicant “posed a significant level of future dangerousness and to be a substantial risk of re-offending in both violent and sexual ways” (para 126) could not be supported to the criminal standard. 
     
      
    · The sentencing judge erred in concluding that the absence of motive was in the circumstances of the present case proof of and an indicator of future dangerousness. It is submitted that this conclusion could not be reached to the criminal standard. 
     
      
    · The length and structure of the sentence is indicative of a significant component of preventive detention. 
     
      
    · Because of the difficulties in the assessment of future dangerousness to the requisite standard, the resolution of the tension between the need to protect the community and rehabilitation should be weighted towards the rehabilitation of the prisoner. In this regard the applicant’s youth and subjective features are significant factors. 
     
      
    · In all of the circumstances the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    12 The written and oral submissions for the applicant reviewed the expert evidence and noted that the expressions used by the experts in their assessments of the applicant could not support findings as to his future behaviour and the risk he posed to society to the criminal standard. The concluding submission based on this analysis was: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is submitted that the caveats expressed by the expert witnesses upon the making of a firm diagnosis are such that a conclusion that the applicant ‘posed a substantial risk of re-offending in both violent and sexual ways’ could not be supported to the requisite standard.” 
        
       
      
    13 It was submitted, for this reason, that when setting the head sentence the sentencing Judge’s reliance on his finding that the applicant posed a significant risk of violent behaviour in the future had resulted in a sentence which was manifestly excessive. It was also said to be manifestly excessive in any event.  
     
      
    14 Senior counsel for the applicant focussed his challenge on the head sentence and did not suggest that the non-parole period of ten years was itself excessive (T 15). 
     
      
    15 There is no need for me to further rehearse the Judge’s careful findings of primary fact or his summary of the expert evidence which included extensive passages from the more significant witnesses. 
     
      
    16 Senior counsel for the applicant did not suggest that His Honour’s findings as to past and existing facts, where they were adverse to the applicant, were not made to the criminal standard, and could not be supported. His challenges were confined to the Judge’s findings as to the future, especially for the period during and after the second half of the head sentence. 
     
      
    17 The submission that findings by a sentencing judge as to the future that are adverse to the prisoner can only properly be made to the criminal standard took as its starting point the decision in The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, 280-1, based as it was on the general onus in our criminal law. However that decision was, in terms, limited to “facts”, and future probabilities or possibilities are not “facts” in any meaningful sense. See also Weininger v The Queen (2003) 77 ALJR 872.  
     
      
    18 The principles which apply in such circumstances in civil cases were settled by Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd (1990) 169 CLR 638. Brennan and Dawson JJ in their joint judgment said at 639-40: 
     
      
       
        
        “Hypothetical situations of the past are analogous to future possibilities: in one case the court must form an estimate of the likelihood that the hypothetical situation would have occurred, in the other the court must form an estimate of the likelihood that the possibility will occur. Both are to be distinguished from events which are alleged to have actually occurred in the past … To make a finding on the balance of probabilities as though the [future] prospect were something that had occurred in the past was to misconceive the process of evaluation.” 
        
       
      
    19 The joint judgment of Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ at 643 was to the same effect. They said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The future may be predicted and the hypothetical may be conjectured. But questions as to the future … are not commonly susceptible of scientific demonstration or proof. If the law is to take account of future … events … it can only do so in terms of the degree of probability of those events occurring. The probability may be very high … or very low … But unless the chance is so low as to be regarded as speculative … or so high as to be practically certain … the court will take that chance into account … Where proof is necessarily unattainable, it would be unfair to treat as certain a prediction which has a 51 per cent probability of occurring, but to ignore altogether a prediction which has a 49 per cent probability of occurring. Thus, the court assesses the degree of probability that an event … might occur, and adjusts its award of damages to reflect the degree of probability.“ 
        
       
      
    20 Similar principles have been applied in criminal cases. It has been recognised that it will seldom be possible to make predictions as to the future beyond reasonable doubt. However the sentencing process cannot ignore possible criminal behaviour by the prisoner in the future and the consequent risk to society. 
     
      
    21 The relevant decisions of the High Court commence with Veen v The Queen [No 1] (1979) 143 CLR 458 where the appellant had been sentenced to life imprisonment for manslaughter following a verdict based on diminished responsibility. This case, like the others that followed, turned on the risk the appellant posed to society on his release from prison. Stephen J, who was part of the majority who allowed the appeal and substituted a sentence of twelve years, said at 464: 
     
      
       
        
        “No doubt the whole question of prediction of behaviour in the future is a most difficult one. Its very difficulty is in itself a potent reason against undue weight in sentencing being given to the protection of the community from what is predicted as the likely future violence of the convicted person.”  
        
       
      
    22 Jacobs J, who was also part of the majority, said at 489: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the court itself must be satisfied that the prisoner has a mental disorder which  
        will 
         lead him to kill or seriously injure in the future before proceeding to sentence on that basis. It should be added that in the great majority of cases where mental disorder has been treated … as a reinforcement of the need for the longest permissible sentence, the psychiatric evidence … was overwhelming and most frequently unanimous that there was a present abnormal mental condition of a severe kind.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    23 Mason J, who wrote the principal judgment for the minority, said at 468: 
     
      
       
        
        “The court must, in sentencing a person who has been convicted of a very serious offence involving violence, if his record and the expert evidence plainly demonstrate that there is  
        a real likelihood  
        of his committing that kind of offence again if he is restored to liberty, ensure by the order which it makes that he will not be released whilst that likelihood continues.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    24 Following his release Veen killed again in similar circumstances, was again convicted of manslaughter, and was again sentenced to penal servitude for life. He again appealed to the High Court which this time dismissed his appeal: Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465. The majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ) referred to the need in sentencing to have regard to the protection of society although an increased sentence “merely” by way of preventive detention was not permissible (473, 474). They said (477) that the sentencing judge “was entitled to attach great weight to the protection of society as a factor” and added (478) that “the appellant’s mental abnormality makes him a grave danger to society if he goes at large”. 
     
      
    25 In Chester v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 611, which arose under special legislation in Western Australia, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in their joint judgment at 619 referred to cases where the sentencing judge was satisfied by acceptable evidence that the convicted person is “so likely to commit further crimes of violence (including sexual offences) that he constitutes a constant danger to the community” (emphasis supplied). The legislation did not contain the word “likely”. 
     
      
    26 The next significant case was Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525. The appellant had been convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment but under later legislation he applied for the fixing of a minimum term. This was fixed at eighteen and a half years and he appealed. The majority, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, who allowed the appeal, said in their joint judgment at 537: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The risk  
        that the applicant might re-offend was of course a relevant factor in fixing a minimum term. But a minimum term of eighteen years and six months is of such length as to take the prospects of re-offending in this case beyond even speculation … the applicant’s behaviour in prison is a relevant consideration, but the longer the minimum term the less importance it must assume, simply because of  
        the impossibility of making a forecast of future behaviour so far ahead 
        . Again, while the desire on the part of his Honour to protect the community is material to the fixing of a minimum term as well as a head sentence, its significance must be the less the longer the minimum term, simply because  
        relevant forecasts cannot be made at such a distance 
        .” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    27 Mason CJ and McHugh JJ, who dissented, said at 532: 
     
      
       
        
        “In fixing a minimum term, a sentencing judge is bound to give close attention to  
        the danger  
        which the offender presents to the community. Naturally, as the length of the minimum term under consideration increases, so does  
        the difficulty of making satisfactory predictions 
         about the future progress of the offender  
        and the danger  
        he or she would present to the community. But that difficulty does not relieve the judge of his or her responsibility to take account of the need to protect the community. Necessarily the judge will be influenced by an assessment of the material before the court as to the prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation.” (emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    28 It is significant that both judgments avoided the requirement of certainty (“will lead him to kill”) used by Jacobs J in Veen [No 1] [para 22] and referred to forecasts and predictions and the majority referred to the risk of re-offending and the minority to the danger to the community. It is also significant that three of the Justices who sat in Bugmy also sat in Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd. Judgment was delivered in the former on 24 May 1990, and in the latter on 26 June and argument in the two cases overlapped. 
     
      
    29 In Mitchell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 333, which arose under later legislation in Western Australia which enabled a sentencing judge to order that the prisoner not be eligible for parole, the appellant who had been convicted on four counts of wilful murder and of associated sexual offences had been sentenced to strict security life imprisonment but the sentencing judge declined to order that he not be eligible for parole. The Full Court made that order following a Crown appeal but the prisoner’s appeal to the High Court was successful. In their joint judgment Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 432 approved the remarks of Owen J, the sentencing judge, who said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I am not able to say that you will always be a danger to the public. That depends on whether you will stay [away] from drugs. Who knows what the future holds? I cannot prognosticate twenty years or more into the future on the basis of the material before me … if I were to make that decision now it would be that you not be released because I have little confidence in your commitment to free yourself from drugs. In the light of the expert evidence I am not able to say that this would be the case in twenty years or more from now.” 
        
       
      
    30 In Boughey v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 10 the Court considered the meaning of “likely” in s 156(2) of the Tasmanian Criminal Code which defined culpable homicide as including homicide caused by an act “which is commonly known to be likely to cause death or bodily harm”, and in s 157(1) which defined murder as culpable homicide which the offender knew to be likely to cause death. Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ in their joint judgment said at 21-2: 
     
      
       
        
        “In our view, the word ‘likely’ is used in both [sections] with what we apprehend to be its ordinary meaning, namely, to convey the notion of a substantial - a ‘real and not remote’ - chance regardless of whether it is less or more than 50 per cent … To bury the word ‘likely’ in s 157(1) … beneath the gloss of ‘more likely than not’ and the explanation of ‘a more than 50 per cent’ or an ‘odds on’ chance would be … to attribute to the word ‘likely’ a requirement of a specific degree of mathematical probability which the word does not convey either as a matter of ordinary language or in its context in s 157(1) of the Code.” 
        
       
      
    31 Gibbs CJ agreed with this conclusion (15). 
     
      
    32 Thus a finding that a prisoner is likely to re-offend does not even require a finding that it is more probable than not that he will do so, let alone a finding that this has been established beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    33 The decisions in this Court are to the same effect. In R v Harrison (1997) 93 A Crim R 314, 319 Hunt CJ at CL, Newman and Ireland JJ in their joint judgment said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it should be emphasized that a sentencing judge is not required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a prisoner will in fact re-offend in the future. It is sufficient if a risk of re-offending be established by the Crown.”  
        
       
      
    34 Recently in R v Robinson [2002] NSWCCA 359 Giles JA, Dunford and Greg James JJ in their joint judgment said (paras 48-9) 
     
      
       
        
        “48. … What was said about likelihood of reoffending is relevant in the present case, where the imprisonment is for a very long time and the offence is murder. But certainty is not required, as indeed it could not be. 
        
       
       
        
        49. Giving weight in sentencing to protection of society against future reoffending must involve an assessment of both degree of likelihood and gravity of consequences. The likelihood must be a real likelihood, but certainty of reoffending can never be found. In looking to society's protection in determining the sentence the probability of the offender remaining a source of danger to the community and the gravity of the danger as a probability interact. [their Honours then referred to  
        Harrison 
        ] 
        
       
       
        
        50. In the present case the nature of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed of themselves called for serious concern as to future reoffending.”  
        
       
      
    35 The onus of proof in sentencing proceedings in respect of future possibilities has twice been considered by the Supreme Court of Canada. In Lyons v The Queen [1987] 2 SCR 309, 363-5 La Forest J delivering the judgment of Dickson CJ, Estey, McIntyre, Le Dain, and himself said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant submits … that s 688, in requiring proof that the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons, or that there is a likelihood of the offender causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons … is fundamentally unfair in that the standard of proof required of the Crown is lower than that traditionally required in the criminal law … 
        
       
       
        
        I do not believe that [this submission] is valid. First, it is important to recognise exactly what is and what is not required to be proved on such an application. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of s 688 both require proof that the offender represents a threat of some sort to society. It is nowhere required that it be proved that the offender will act in a certain way. Indeed, inherent in the notion of dangerousness is the risk, not the certainty of harm. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant asserts that a ‘likelihood’ is ipso facto not susceptible of proof beyond a reasonable doubt … The criminal law must operate in a world governed by practical considerations rather than abstract logic and, as a matter of practicality, the most that can be established in a future context is a likelihood of certain events occurring …  
        
       
       
        
        Moreover I am not convinced, even as a matter of logic, that the appellant’s submission is sound. It seems to me that a ‘likelihood’ of specified future conduct occurring is the finding of fact required to be established … Logically it seems clear to me that an individual can be found to constitute a threat to society without insisting that this require the Court to assert an ability to predict the future. I do not find it illogical for a Court to assert that it is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the test of dangerousness has been met, that there exists a certain potential for harm. That this is really only an apparent paradox is aptly captured by Morden J in  
        R v Knight  
        (1975) 27 CCC (2d) 343, 356:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I wish to make it clear that when I refer to the requisite standard of proof respecting likelihood I am not imposing on myself an obligation to find it proven beyond a reasonable doubt that certain events will happen in the future – this, in the nature of things would be impossible in practically every case – but I do refer to the quality and strength of the evidence of past and present facts together with the expert opinion thereon, as an existing basis for finding present likelihood of future conduct’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    36 See also The Queen v Currie [1997] 2 SCR 260 at para 42 per Lamer CJ delivering the judgment of the Court.  
     
      
    37 The sentencing judge found that the applicant posed “a significant level of future dangerousness” and there was “a substantial risk” of him “reoffending in both violent and sexual ways” [para 8] and that he was “a serious risk to the community in terms of potentially killing again or committing sexual offences” [para 9]. At the same time he directed himself that he had to sentence “in the light of what is presently known” and that the experts were not “certain of what the future holds” [para 9]. 
     
      
    38 His Honour made findings on the criminal onus, which were open to him on the evidence, about what was “presently known” about the prisoner and on that basis made his findings about the risk to the community. He accepted that the prisoner’s future was problematic and that he could not be certain what the future held.  
     
      
    39 The Judge’s findings of present fact cannot be disturbed and on the basis of those findings he was entitled and bound to evaluate the risk that the applicant would pose to society on his release from prison. His Honour did not presume to assess the risk of future serious criminality on the basis that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant would re-offend in this way. 
     
      
    40 A sentencing judge is not bound to disregard the risk that a prisoner would pose for society in the future if he was at liberty merely because he or she cannot find on the criminal onus that the prisoner would re-offend. The view that the risk of future criminality can only be determined on the criminal standard is contrary to all the High Court decisions since Veen [No 1]. 
     
      
    41 In any event his Honour structured his sentence so that he did not have to undertake the task of making definitive findings as to the degree of risk that the applicant would pose to society many years in the future. He crafted a head sentence, after carefully weighing the relevant factors, and fixed a non-parole period which accommodated the interest of rehabilitation and permitted an extended period of release on parole (para 140). 
     
      
    42 The present case is the converse of Chester [para 25], Bugmy [para 26] and Mitchell [para 29] where the sentencing judges imposed sentences which pre-judged the prisoner and the risk he would pose to society, eighteen and a half years, twenty years, or even longer into the future. 
     
      
    43 In this case the sentencing judge has fixed a non-parole period which is not, and could not be challenged, and has refused to make a binding forecast of future behaviour beyond that period. Effectively this was only eight years and six months into the future after allowing for the applicant’s pre-sentence custody. Thereafter the assessment of the prisoner and the risks he will then pose to society have been left to be determined by the parole authorities who should have much better information as to the prisoner’s rehabilitation and prospects at the end of the non-parole period and thereafter than the Judge had, or could possibly have had. 
     
      
    44 In my judgment therefore the sentencing Judge imposed a sentence which reflected “the impossibility of making forecasts of future behaviour so far ahead” [para 26 Bugmy] and avoided the problems which arise when sentencing judges attempt to do this.45 Leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BARR J: This is an application by Peter Jeffrey Turner for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 7 November 2002. On that day he came before Judge Freeman and pleaded guilty to a charge under section 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act of threatening to use an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely murder. He also acknowledged the commission of five offences which were summarised pursuant to section 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and asked his Honour to take them into account. His Honour did so, and sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for six years and three months. A non-parole period of four years was fixed.2 In 1993, when he was about twenty-six years old, the applicant formed an attachment to a young woman whom he later married. She was thirteen years his junior. As the sentencing judge found, the relationship was a volatile one, in which there was a deal of violence and controlling behaviour on the part of the applicant. The applicant is an immature man with entrenched personality difficulties. They make him susceptible to over-reaction to perceived or acute deprivation or abandonment. 
     
      
    3 The applicant and his wife have a son, who at the time of the events was eighteen months old. 4 The marriage broke down in 2002 and his Honour thought that that might have been because the applicant’s wife had matured and he had not. He began to suspect that she was seeing another man. He attempted suicide by taking an overdose of prescribed tablets and was admitted briefly to a mental hospital, then allowed home. He barricaded himself in the house and threatened suicide but was ultimately talked out of it. Again he was taken to hospital, kept briefly and sent home.5 The applicant interpreted the signs as showing that his wife was lost to him. That is the opinion of a consultant psychologist, Ms Robilliard, whose report was tendered in the sentencing proceedings. He could not bear the circumstances he found himself in and had no mature understanding and no acceptance of those circumstances. Even before the sentencing judge he was expressing the desire to be reunited with his wife, an entirely unrealistic attitude in view of the matters I shall relate.6 On 24 April 2002 the applicant’s wife, who had been talking about separating, moved out of the home. He was unable to contact her for the next couple of days. On 27 April he drove to the shop where she worked and had an argument with her about the man he thought she was seeing. He struck her. He left the shop, went to the place where the man worked and had an argument with him. Then he returned to the shop and struck his wife again, this time knocking her to the floor. He only left when others intervened.7 The shopkeeper was trying to call the police and the applicant told him that if he rang them their son would die. He tore the telephone out of the wall. He drove his car into the car that his wife was using.8 Having done these things he drove to the house where their son was being minded. His mother and sister were there. They tried to take the child away to safety, but the applicant seized him and held him by the foot, swinging him upside down with his head barely clearing the floor. He realised that his sister also was trying to telephone the police. He smashed the window and removed a shard of glass about 15 centimetres long. He carried the child into a nearby park, sat him on the ground and held the jagged glass close to its neck. That act constituted the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty. The assaults and the occasion of damage which preceded it were the matters that the sentencing judge took into account.9 In passing sentence his Honour expressed concern about the applicant’s personality. His Honour observed that some ten or eleven years earlier the applicant had attempted to abduct his female companion. He had been given the benefit of a good behaviour bond on that occasion. 10 His Honour had the benefit of reports from Dr Hugh Jolly and Dr Allnut, psychiatrists. They were not substantially in disagreement and remarked on the applicant’s immature personality and need to change so as to accept responsibility.11 His Honour concluded in view of that unanimity between the experts that the applicant represented a risk to his wife and child. He remarked on Dr Allnut’s warning that the applicant’s wife should be warned when the prisoner was going to be released and to Ms Robilliard’s endorsement of that warning. His Honour observed that the need to protect society was a matter that weighed heavily in sentencing. He observed that the deep-seated personality flaws of the applicant were notoriously difficult to treat and would require prolonged treatment.12 The applicant was originally committed for trial on a more serious charge. There was a change in the formulation of the charge when the case reached the District Court. As soon as that was done the applicant pleaded guilty. His Honour acknowledged that in the circumstances the applicant was entitled to recognition for a plea of guilty at the earliest possible time.13 His Honour observed that but for the plea of guilty he would have imposed a head sentence of seven years but was reducing it by about 10 per cent in recognition of the plea.14 The first submission made in this application was that that allowance was insufficient. This Court has said in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 that a person pleading guilty is entitled to a discount of somewhere in the range of 10 to 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea. Generally, the earlier the plea of guilty is entered the higher in the range the discount may be taken to be.15 A discount of about 10 per cent for an early plea is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge. On the face of it, however, there may be substance in the criticism which has been levelled at the discount allowed. Whatever view this Court may take about the discount it might have allowed in the circumstances, however, this Court does not simply substitute its own view for the view of the sentencing judge. The wide range of discretion of the sentencing judge has to be recognised. Also relevant to this question is the ultimate sentence that was arrived at. I shall make further reference to that matter.16 On appeal, the applicant criticised the conduct of his barrister on the day of his plea and at earlier times. He submitted that his barrister told him that by the time he came up for sentence he would have served about six months in custody and that he would arrange for the matter to be put before a lenient judge. The time served would be taken into account and he would be given a bond. That is to say, he would be released immediately.17 The applicant also said that on the day of his plea he was in a state of shock. He had been told that the charge had been changed and did not really understand what he was pleading guilty to. He also submitted that his barrister, his estranged wife, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the sentencing judge were in a conspiracy together to keep him in gaol. They perverted the course of justice.18 The inconsistency between these several submissions is obvious. The facts put before the sentencing judge, which I have summarised and which were not challenged below, show that the applicant committed the offence for which he was sentenced and those offences which were taken into account. It seems to me that there is no substance in these submissions.19 Then the applicant said that he had completed some programs while in gaol, and it is heartening to see that he is already making progress. However, these are matters that this Court cannot take into account. The duty of this Court is to consider whether the sentencing judge erred.20 The final criticism the applicant made of his barrister was that he asked him during his evidence whether he had ever threatened his wife with a firearm. He answered that he had never done such a thing. The relevance of that question is not clear. None of the charges, either the one to which the applicant pleaded guilty, or those offences taken into account, involved the use of a firearm. It may have been a slip of the tongue or some misapprehension on the part of the barrister that gave rise to the question. At any rate, what is clear is that the sentencing judge expressly took no such matter into account. The question of the raising of the denial of any activity with a firearm is, it seems to me, irrelevant.21 The maximum sentence attracted by the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty is twelve years’ imprisonment. Bearing in mind the matters taken into account by his Honour at the applicant’s request, it seems to me that the resulting sentence fell within the proper range of his Honour’s discretion. It is true that another judge might have allowed a greater discount for the plea of guilty, but this Court is bound to look at the resulting sentence. To my mind a sentence which produced a non-parole period of four years was entirely proper in this case. The offence was a very serious one of its kind.22 I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.23 GREG JAMES J: Subsection (3) of section 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that it is only in a case where some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed that this Court might intervene on an appeal against the severity of a sentence below. I am persuaded that the Court should not intervene, having regard to the statutory requirements. It is to the sentence that has been passed the section draws the Court’s attention, not merely the convenience of it.24 It may well have been that in affording so little discount for a plea, he held to have been entered at the earliest possible opportunity, the trial judge may have erred, but such an error did not, in my view, affect the eventual product of the sentencing synthesis such as to show error in the upshot. I agree that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal dismissed.26 HOWIE J: For the reasons given by the presiding judge and Justice Greg James, I also agree the application for leave should be granted and the appeal dismissed.27 BARR J: The orders of the Court are as I have proposed.

      13053/00 - NSW CRIME COMMISSION v JOSEPH ATTALLAH 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: By amended summons filed on 15 November 2000 the plaintiff, the New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) sought, inter alia, a proceeds assessment order against Joseph Attallah (the defendant) pursuant to s27 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (the Act). On 16 December 2002 such an order was made for an amount to be later assessed and the matter is before the Court for the purpose of that assessment. 
     
      
    2 The defendant has appeared from custody and is unrepresented. The circumstances surrounding his asserted expectation of legal representation are recorded in the transcript as are my reasons for refusing adjournment. I note in passing that the particular solicitor mentioned appears to be the same as the one about whom, in address, the defendant complained concerning alleged failure to call witnesses at his recent trial. 
     
      
    3 On 9 November 2000 the defendant was arrested in possession of a quantity of illicit drugs. He was again arrested on 11 April 2001. In due course he was presented for trial at Sydney District Court upon indictment that between 31 May 1999 and 11 April 2001 he supplied not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin and between the same dates he supplied a large commercial quantity of cocaine. He was convicted on both counts. Relevantly included in his record of prior offences are convictions for possession of heroin at Campsie Petty Sessions on 20 October 1983 (fined $500); conviction for supply of prohibited drug at Penrith District Court on 12 August 1986 (eight years imprisonment with a non parole period of five years) and convictions on two counts of supplying prohibited drug at Newcastle District Court on 19 March 1992 (minimum term of four years imprisonment with additional term of one year and four months and two years fixed term to be served concurrently).  
     
      
    4 A restraining order pursuant to the Act in respect of the defendant’s assets was obtained on 15 November 2000 and the relevant period specified in s27(1) of the Act commences on 16 November 1994.  
     
      
    5 The evidence shows, and I accept, that during the relevant period the defendant conducted brothels, first at Mons Street, Condell Park and later at Clements Avenue, Bankstown. Drugs were sold by him or on his behalf to prostitutes working at the premises and to others who were referred to at times as “outside girls” and as customers. There is direct evidence of the defendant’s activity in connection with drugs from two former prostitutes, [name removed] and Jenny Sampson (recorded in documents to which I will later make reference as Vanessa and Rebecca respectively) which includes observation of his physical handling of drugs and the delivery of nightly “supplies” to the brothel. When supplies ran out, an employee would make a telephone call after which the defendant would arrive with more drugs.  
     
      
    6 The assessment required to be made is facilitated by s28. Of significance is s28(4) which precludes subtraction of expenses or outgoings incurred by the defendant in relation to his illegal activity, in effect, as was put by senior counsel for the Commission, what must be looked at are gross receipts in distinction from some calculation of profit. It is convenient to look first to evidence relating to the brothel at Bankstown. The evidence includes timesheets referrable to individual prostitutes. These are voluminous and have been analysed by Detective Sergeant Gallina.  
     
      
    7 A typical sheet has four squared columns under the “working name” of the prostitute. In the first column is recorded a time and in the fourth column a room number. The centre columns record the “split” of fees between the prostitute and “the house”. However, in the upper block where the name was written there was endorsed in red ink “minus” figures which were referred to as “subs” or subtractions. These were “contras” against the prostitute’s share of the fee which had been paid to the house, often by credit card, by the customer. On occasions these “subs” represented cash advances against the fees earned but I accept the evidence that the larger amounts are the cash equivalents of drugs used by the prostitute, of which the defendant was the supplier. An interview with Miss Sampson contained this telling exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q58. And you said that Joe Attalla supplied you with drugs? 
        
       
       
        
         A. Yeah, yeah. He’d, he’d either give it to me or he’d give it to Jackie to give to me. Always, always make sure that we had our stuff to start work ‘cause he knew that we couldn’t work without it otherwise we were sick and what’s good a, well what use is a sick prostitute, not very good. Anyway someone who’s not sick and not hanging out is a lot handier to have y’know they’re gunna work obviously a lot better.” 
        
       
      
    8 It was routine for a prostitute to use heroin in the evening before “work” and in the morning afterwards. 
     
      
    9 A consequence of the costing of quantities of drugs consumed by the prostitutes, which frequently exceeded their earnings from the provision of sexual services, was that they became permanently indebted to the defendant and thus were providing services to customers in order to meet that debt, or more likely to inhibit the extent of its growth, rather than being in receipt of earnings. 
     
      
    10 Miss Sampson described a method of acquiring cash on occasions. There was a scale of fees relative to the particular acts of sexual congress engaged in with the customer. She would persuade him to contract with the “house” for a cheaper service but pay her an additional amount “in the room” for a more expensive one. The customer was not always aware which was in fact delivered. 
     
      
    11 However, this cash, which she described as “extra money” was used to purchase cocaine which she herself consumed. She said she had “a fairly wild coke habit” and estimated that she earned and spent between at least $300 and up to $900 a night on these purchases. All of the extra money was used to purchase drugs “without any doubt”.  
     
      
    12 An accounting analysis by Det Sgt Gallina (Exhibit B to his affidavit of 22 January 2002) computes $313,282 as representing “subs” referrable to drug purchases by prostitutes between June 1999 and October 2000. A deduction from total “subs” has been made for “shift fees” and amounts which are smaller than the charged rate for drugs, although it should be recognized that it remains possible that some of the smaller amounts might have been for drug purchase. I am satisfied that the computation is accurate and provides an appropriate guide for the purposes of assessment. 
     
      
    13 After 3 November 2000 “subs” for drugs ceased to be recorded in the stated manner. On that date one Victor Razzak was murdered on the premises. No doubt there was a significant police presence following this event. The defendant directed the change in recording which was made other than on the timesheets. The change itself offers some confirmation that the recordings were not of advances for innocent purposes. The figure of $313,283 is derived from “subs” for drugs over seventeen months and an extrapolation at the same rate for a further five months (until April 2001) produces a figure of $405,425. I accept the Commission’s submission that this can appropriately be rounded down to $400,000 for present purposes. As abovementioned, Miss Sampson was spending between $300 and $900 per day from her extra money to satisfy her craving for cocaine. She said this was done throughout from between 1997 and December 2000. An extremely conservative approach to this evidence would lead to an assessment of $300,000. This would be achieved by taking the lower figure of the range of expenditure for one thousand days which itself is a period of less than three years as against the stated period of three to four years. 
     
      
    14 Next, it should be taken into account that Miss Sampson’s evidence is that her second daily heroin consumption (the morning administration) was not recorded in the timesheets. On the same approach to selection of one thousand days and at the evidenced charge of $150, there can be computed a sum of $150,000. 
     
      
    15 Miss Sampson first became associated with the defendant when she was working as a street prostitute on Canterbury Road and heard that there was “like a protection house” nearby in Mons Road, Condell Park. Initially she obtained heroin from a manageress (Jackie) but when the defendant “knew I wasn’t a spy or whatever” he supplied it to her directly himself. She was working at Mons Street for about eight months. A daily expenditure of $250 can be represented by a total of $60,000. Having regard to the system which inevitably would seem to put a drug using prostitute into debt to the defendant supplier, Miss Sampson recalled a debt of $7,000 on “her account” at the time she ceased at Mons Road. The defendant “wiped” the debt although later, at Bankstown, he made occasional jocular reference to it. Allowing for this, the previously mentioned sum can be reduced to $53,000. 
     
      
    16 The foregoing relates to what was referred to as “in-house” dealing. The evidence of Vanessa was that, after a night’s activity, the defendant would call to collect the takings from the sale of drugs. The amount was usually between $4,000 and $10,000 but was, on some days, as low as $2,000. That daily figure is consistent with her evidence as to drug delivery and dealing. The evening delivery by the defendant consisted of a standard stash of ten half gram deals of heroin, ten quarter gram deals of heroin and thirty deals of cocaine. The evidence is that the charge for a half gram of heroin was $150. There is no direct evidence of the charge for a quarter gram but for the purpose of assessment the Commission submits that a charge of $80 (slightly above a pro rata charge for the larger quantity) would provide a reasonable basis for estimate. I agree and adopt it for this purpose. Cocaine was charged at $50 a deal. 
     
      
    17 Sale of all the delivered drug at those rates would return $3,800. As already noted, if supply was exhausted, the defendant, after a telephone call was made, would appear with further drug supplies. 
     
      
    18 Focussing upon the evidence of the morning collection of the usual sum of $4,000 to $10,000 (sometimes as low as $2,000) and the return on an unsupplemented sale of the “standard” delivery for $3,800, it would again be an extremely conservative approach to postulate a daily gross return of $3,500. Over a period of one thousand days (less than three years) a total of $3,500,000 can be calculated. From 31 May 1999 to 10 April 2001 (the period of the indictment upon which the defendant was ultimately tried, less one day, that is 680 days) a similar daily rate computes at $2,380,000. 
     
      
    19 The defendant did not comply with directions to put any evidence upon which he wished to rely upon affidavit. He addressed after the close of evidence and an indication by senior counsel for the Commission of the basis upon which orders were sought. To a large extent, the defendant spent his address proclaiming the invalidity of his conviction, his innocence of any drug dealing, the fact that the prostitutes who gave evidence against him had had their police statements “induced”, an insistence that the brothels conducted by him were drug free, that he had in fact remonstrated with prostitutes whom he had incidentally found using drugs, that if they had drugs they must have purchased them from “outside”, that he had a caring attitude to the “girls” who worked in his “business” and that he had a desire to lead a normal life with his wife and four children. 
     
      
    20 I do not accept these protestations but, as was attempted at the hearing, focus should be had upon the statutory task. More towards the relevant issue, the defendant stated that “subs” recorded on the timesheets were misinterpreted as representing in any part a contra against a prostitute’s earning for drugs supplied by him, or by anybody else as I understood him. He asserted that the amounts in red ink were records of cash paid to the individual prostitute by the house in response to a demand for payment for services which she had already rendered to customers. I reject this contention. I am satisfied that the “subs” were, to the extent and with the qualification already mentioned, records reflecting drug purchases from the defendant by the prostitute identified in the time sheets. 
     
      
    21 The calculations abovementioned can be summarized as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         (a) 
         In-house sales from timesheets 
          
           
           $400,000

           $300,000 
           
         
         
          
         (ii) morning heroin

         (iii) Mons Road 
          
           
           $53,000 
           
         
         
         (c) 
         Drug sales for 1000 days 
          
           
           $3,500,000 
           
         
         
          
         TOTAL 
          
           
           $4,403,000 
           
         
         
          
          
          
         
        
       
      
    22 Alternatively if one assumed drug sales for the lesser period of 680 days the total reduces to $3,283,000. 
     
      
    23 The Commission seeks an assessment in the sum of $2,000,000. It is submitted that it can be confidently concluded that the gross proceeds from drug sales by the defendant over the relevant period was well in excess of that sum. I find that this is so. 
     
      
    24 I order the defendant to pay to the Treasurer the sum $2,000,000 as the value of the proceeds derived by him from illegal activities that took place after 16 November 1994. 
     
      
    25 I order the defendant to pay the Commission’s costs of the hearing of this assessment application.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: On 27 November 2002 the appellant stood trial before Acting Judge Shillington on an indictment containing a single count, being that on 8 June 2001 at Glebe in the State of New South Wales she did supply a prohibited drug, namely cocaine. This was an offence contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The trial proceeded without a jury and on the same date Judge Shillington convicted the appellant of the offence charged. The appellant was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment suspended for a period of two years under the provisions of s 12 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    2 There is no application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. There is a single ground of appeal against the conviction being: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “That the trial miscarried through the application of an extended definition of what constitutes an offer or agreement to supply a prohibited drug which is not created under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 New South Wales.” 
        
       
       
      By this ground of appeal the appellant seeks to call into question a line of authority in this State holding that an offence of supplying a prohibited drug may be made out where a person offers or agrees to supply a prohibited drug but never intends that any prohibited drug will actually be supplied to the person to whom the offer, or with whom the agreement, is made.  
       
      
    3 The only issue raised before Acting Judge Shillington was whether the offence had been made out by the evidence led in the Crown case by way of the tender of statements from the prosecution’s brief of evidence. The appellant did not give evidence. It was submitted to his Honour that the offence had not been made out on the evidence in the statements of the prosecution witnesses. 
     
      
    4 The allegation was that the appellant had offered or agreed to supply an undercover police operative with cocaine on the date specified in the charge. The incident giving rise to the allegation occurred during a controlled police operation in Glebe involving an operative using the name Johnno. The appellant, having been told that Johnno wanted to buy some cocaine, said to him, “I’m about to do a coke run, I’ll be back soon, just wait here in the park. You can give me the money now and I’ll come back with it.” Eventually the operative gave the appellant $50 for the drug and an additional $5 towards a taxi fare. Shortly thereafter the operation concluded without the appellant returning to the park. The appellant was arrested some months later. 
     
      
    5 After referring to the decision of this court in R v Dendic and Mazzeo (1987) 34 A Crim R 40 and R v Addison (1993) 70 A Crim R 213, Acting Judge Shillington stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts as I find them indicate quite clearly that there was first of all an offer and secondly an agreement between the parties. The law is that what followed thereafter is not relevant. It is not relevant therefore to consider whether there was in fact a ‘rip off’ or not to use the vernacular. As a matter of fact I find it difficult to conclude that there was a ‘rip off’. The matter is left in an equivocal situation in my view.” 
        
       
      
    6 Counsel for the applicant, Mr Zahra SC, concedes that his Honour was required to find as he did by reason of authority of this Court in the two cases to which Judge Shillington referred in his judgment. But it is argued that this interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act is erroneous and has in effect converted a minor act of dishonesty, akin to false pretences, into a serious offence involving a prohibited drug even though the drugs may never have existed. 
     
      
    7 Section 25 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act makes it an offence to supply a prohibited drug. Section 3(1) of that Act contains a number of definitions of words or meanings to be attributed to words for the purposes of the provisions of the Act. It includes the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.”  
        
       
      
    8 In Dendic and Mazzeo, above at 45, Street CJ considered a similar argument in relation to a provision of the Poisons Act that was identical to that part of s 3(1) which is quoted above. The appellants had been charged with an offence based upon an offer to supply heroin. In that case, unlike the present, the evidence revealed clearly that the appellants were intending to “rip off” the purchaser of the drugs, an undercover police officer, by supplying a harmless substance rather than heroin. The trial Judge initially directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not important, it is not relevant, it doesn’t matter, what the accused or either of them intended to supply, if they offered to supply heroin. It doesn’t matter if they intended all along to supply glucodin or if they originally intended to supply heroin and then changed their mind. The only important thing is, the only matter for you to consider is, did the accused offer to supply heroin and not what their intention was, except in relation to - you must be satisfied that it was a genuine offer, not just a mere jest. By genuine offer I mean an offer intended to be acted upon.” 
        
       
      
    9 The next day his Honour re-directed the jury in terms that the accused could only be convicted if the jury were satisfied that they intended to supply some substance, whether a prohibited drug or something they represented to be a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    10 Street CJ, with whom Slattery CJ at CL and Wood J agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        The relevant intention or mens rea that must be proved where there is a charge of supply involving an offer to supply is the intention inherent in the making of the offer. It must be a genuine, intended making of an offer with the intention that it is to be regarded as genuine by the offeree. The relevant intention in order to bring conduct within this particular portion of the Poisons Act does not involve any intention of ultimate supply. The intention, I reiterate, is bound up with the making of the offer itself.” 
        
       
      
    11 In Street CJ’s view of the relevant provisions of the Poisons Act it did not matter that the appellants may never have intended to supply any substance, whether a prohibited drug or otherwise, at the time of making the offer. A submission made by counsel for the appellants that the criminality in their conduct fell within the offence of false pretences under s 179 of the Crimes Act, rather than under the provisions of the Poisons Act, did not find favour with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    12 This Court in Addison considered the mental element of an offence of supply under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act based upon an agreement to supply a prohibited drug. The appellant was alleged to have agreed to supply an undercover police officer with ten ounces of heroin. The appellant’s case was that he had never intended to be part of an agreement to supply heroin but pretended to do so in the hope of endearing himself to the person who turned out to be an undercover operative. The trial Judge gave a direction to the jury in accordance with the decision in Dendic. Although counsel for the appellant formally argued before the Court that Dendic was wrongly decided, the principal argument was that the decision did not apply to an agreement to supply. 
     
      
    13 Gleeson CJ, with whom Grove and Finlay JJ agreed, stated at 216: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was argued that for there to be an agreement to supply there must have been an intention on the part of the appellant to supply, that is to say, to perform the agreement. The first observation to be made concerning that argument is that, if it be correct, there is an extraordinary lack of congruence between the concepts of offering to supply and agreeing to supply. 
         
         
        Why Parliament should have intended such a result is not apparent. However, upon examination, the argument is based upon a false analogy. 
         
         
        “In the view that I hold the way in which his Honour put the matter to the jury [initially] was correct. I would make this one extension of the directions that his Honour gave in relation to the genuineness of the offer. An offer, in order to fall within the statutory definition in the Poisons Act, must be an offer which was intended to be regarded as genuine by the offeree. The distinction matters little - indeed not at all in the present case. Apart from that minor change I would assent to his Honour’s directions as being correct in law for the purposes of the evidence that the jury were required to consider in this case. 
         
         
        The basis of the argument was the decision in  
        Regina v Freeman 
         (1985) 3 NSWLR 303, which dealt with the offence of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The court held that, for a charge of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, the Crown must prove an intention to pervert, or wrongfully interfere with, the course of justice. 
         
         
        It is one thing to say that, for the purpose of the crime of conspiracy, the essence of which is a combination to achieve an unlawful purpose, it must be shown that the parties to the conspiracy intended to achieve the purpose. It is a different thing to say that, if Parliament makes it an offence to agree to supply goods of a certain kind, the offence is only committed if the accused person has the intention of honouring the agreement. In such a case, the relevant intention is the intention to agree, not the intention to perform the agreement. This is underlined by the consideration that the concept of agreeing to supply appears in a legislative context in close proximity to the cognate concept of offering to supply, which has the meaning explained in Dendic.” 
        
       
      
    14 Although there has been some question raised about whether an offence of supply is an appropriate way for the legislature to deal with behaviour involving an offer to supply drugs where there was no intention to do so, see R v Kalpaxis (2001) 122 A Crim R 320 at 323, the correctness of Dendic has not been doubted by this court. It was most recently considered in R v Salem (NSWCCA, 3 October 1997, unreported). Dendic was applied to the provisions of s 70 of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Victoria in R v Pierce [1996] 2 VR 215. A similar view has been taken in Western Australia; see Tsargis v Regina (WACCA, 14 December 1998, unreported). 
     
      
    15 The submissions on behalf of the appellant argue that Addison was wrongly decided in that the reasoning in the last paragraph of Gleeson CJ’s judgment, in the passage quoted above, erroneously proceeds on the basis that the offence created by Parliament was an offence of agreeing to supply a prohibited drug rather than the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, which is the offence contained in s 25(1) of the Act. The argument is that, because the offence of supply must contain as an element an intention to supply, so must any other offence under the section regardless of whether the allegation is based upon the extension to the meaning of “supply” contained in s 3 of the Act. 
     
      
    16 I do not believe that this argument should be accepted. The legislature has clearly intended that any conduct involving a prohibited drug should be covered by the Act. This intention is apparent, not only from the extension of the meaning of the word “supply” but also in the concept of “admixture” in s 4 and in the extended meaning of the phrase “take part in” provided in s 6. I see no reason why, therefore, the plain meaning should not be given to the words used in the extension of the meaning of the word “supply” in s 3. An offer, or an agreement, to supply does not necessarily carry with it an intention on the part of the moving party to fulfil the offer made or the agreement entered into. The present interpretation of “offer to supply” and “agreement to supply” is consistent with s 40 of the Act which provides that a substance which is represented as being a prohibited drug for the purpose of supplying the substance is deemed to be a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    17 As was noted by Wood CJ at CL in R v Yaghi (2002) 133 A Crim R 490: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It is a regrettable fact of life, within the organised drug trade, that rip offs occur and those who choose to cloak such an endeavour with the appearance of a genuine drug deal must accept the consequence if their conduct happens to fall within the specific provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act.” 
        
       
      
    18 I can see no reason why it should be doubted that Parliament intended such conduct to fall within the ambit of the provisions of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. If the legislature had been of the view that Dendic and the cases following it had been based upon an erroneous interpretation of the provisions, it could have easily addressed the situation. To the contrary, the provisions considered in Dendic were re-enacted in the present Act when the provisions dealing with prohibited drugs were removed from the Poisons Act. 
     
      
    19 To uphold the submission made on behalf of the appellant would lead to an almost impossible situation for the Crown. How could it ever prove that the person making the offer or instigation the agreement actually intended to supply a drug unless the offer or agreement was carried through to conclusion or the accused confessed to such an intention? If a doubt arose about the intention of the accused, he or she could not be convicted of any offence, either under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act or an offence of dishonesty under the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    20 This was a matter considered by the Court in Regina v Pierce and was one of the considerations that led that Court to dismissing an argument similar to that raised before this Court. 
     
      
    21 There are, in my view, strong public policy reasons for not declining to follow Dendic. Contrary to the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, the fact that the offence may be committed in connection with the activities of an undercover police officer or that it may work an injustice to a particular appellant, by reason of the consequences of a conviction for the offence where no drug was to be supplied, does not seem to me to compel a different approach from that which has been followed in this State for well over a decade. 
     
      
    22 One curious aspect of the appeal is that a re-trial is sought if the conviction were set aside. But the appeal could only succeed if the evidence disclosed in the Crown case could not prove the offence because it was equivocal as to whether the appellant intended to supply the drug offered to the operative. That was Judge Shillington’s view, although I doubt that it would be mine. Although the written submissions indicate what the appellant would have said had she given evidence, that material is quite irrelevant to the argument before the Court or the success or otherwise of the appeal. 
     
      
    23 I would dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 GREG JAMES, J: Mr. Kelly seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Ducker in the District Court of New South Wales following his plea of guilty to one count of assault with intend to rob whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, an offence under s.97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 punishable by a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for four years to commence on 27 September 2002. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of two years. 
     
      
    2 The applicant had been arrested on the date of the offence, 7 April 2001, but had been granted bail the following day on reporting conditions. His Honour had finally passed sentence on 27 September 2002, having heard evidence and oral submissions on 12 and 24 September 2002. 
     
      
    3 His Honour had commenced his remarks on sentence on 24 September 2002 but proceedings were interrupted during his Honour’s delivery of those remarks by counsel for the applicant indicating that the applicant wished there to be an enquiry to substantiate his claim that he had been stood over to commit the crime. Notwithstanding that his Honour had already proceeded to make relevant findings, his Honour adjourned at that point to permit counsel for the applicant and the Crown to consider relevant authorities on the issue of whether the proceedings, having gone so far, should be interrupted for the purpose sought. 
     
      
    4 Upon the matter being resumed on the Friday, his Honour was informed that the applicant did not wish the matter of his being stood over to be investigated any further. He still adhered to his plea. Other than referring his Honour to the material on which special circumstances might be found, the applicant’s counsel was content for the matter to go forward for sentence as it had stood before his Honour on 24 September 2002. Thus, his Honour’s remarks on sentence extended over the two days, the Tuesday and the Friday. 
     
      
    5 His Honour found that the objective facts relating to the offence were within a relatively simple compass. The offender, armed with an extendable baton, attempted to rob Mr. Prior, an employee of the Byron Bay Services Club of the monies contained in a money drawer on the staff side of a counter at the front desk of the Club. His Honour referred to those circumstances as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On the evening of Saturday 7 April 2001, the victim Garry Prior, an employee of the Byron Bay Services Club, was on duty when at about 6.45 pm, he took note of a male person (the present offender) who was dressed in a white shirt, dark trousers and wearing a pair of prescription glasses in the foyer area of the Club. This man was walking around and appeared as though he was waiting for somebody. At one stage, Mr. Prior had the impression that the offender was leaving and in fact said to him words to the effect of ‘see you later’. The offender looked at him but did not say anything, just continued to walk around the same area. 
        
       
       
        
        Between 7 and 8 pm, Mr. Prior was on his meal break. After that he returned to working behind the front desk, which has two counters, one where people, particularly visitors, can sign and be signed into the Club, the other counter dispensed change. The victim, Mr. Prior, was again aware of the presence of the offender, who was leaning against a wall in the foyer. At about 8.30 pm, Mr. Prior was providing change to a female at the change counter. After he had finished serving the woman, he turned around with his back to the sign in counter. As he did so, the offender came behind the staff side of the counter, about a metre and a half away. He turned to face the offender, and was struck on the left side of his head, with an implement that was later identified as an extendable baton. He managed to push the offender away, causing the offender’s spectacles to fall off. The offender leant over and put his hand on the money drawer, but Mr. Prior was able to push him away from that drawer. These drawers sit on a shelf under the change counter, and were turned sideways during the scuffle. The offender then ran from the Club. 
        
       
       
        
        As the offender left the Club, Mr. Prior called for assistance on the PA system. Mr. Snow, a supervisor, and a Club patron, a Mr. Bayard Martin, who had witnessed part of the assault upon him, left the Club through the front door. Mr. Martin mounted a bicycle and gave chase after the offender. Mr. Snow followed. The offender hid behind a fence in the front yard of premises in Ruskin Street. When Mr. Snow ran towards where he was hiding, the offender jumped the fence and attempted to run further up Ruskin Street. Mr. Snow called on him to stop and, probably to Mr. Snow’s surprise, he did. He then accompanied Mr. Snow and some other persons back to the Club, where the police were by that time present. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender was arrested, cautioned, taken to Byron Bay Police Station and later interviewed electronically on audio tape by the police.” 
        
       
      
    6 In the interview with the police, the offender put forward a reason for his behaviour. He said that he had, in response to a request from a friend of his father, agreed, for the sum of $200, to assault the person who had assaulted that friend’s son. He told the police that his friend had met him outside the Club and indicated that it was Mr. Prior who had assaulted his son. He said that he had intended to confront Mr. Prior and was holding the baton at the time; that Mr. Prior came at him but he had struck Mr. Prior on the head with a baton. He denied making any attempt to take money from the cash drawer and denied any intent to commit a robbery. He declined to provide the police with information which would have enabled the identification of that friend. Later, by his plea of guilty to robbery and his evidence on the plea, the applicant accepted this account was not true. His accounts to his wife and to a psychiatrist were radically different to that given to the police. 
     
      
    7 To the forensic psychiatrist whose report was tendered in evidence, he gave an account which was set out in his Honour’s remarks on sentence. In essence, that was an account in which the offender said he was in debt to a physically giant man who had reportedly spent 20 years in prison. Since he could not repay the money within the agreed time, he agreed instead to steal money from the Byron Bay Services Club at the creditor’s instigation. He had, he told the forensic psychiatrist, used amphetamines and antidepressants prior to going to the Club. He asserted the same giant told him to go and get the money, notwithstanding that the woman who it was expected would be in the Club was not there and a man was instead. 
     
      
    8 He was asked about this by the psychiatrist who, noting the applicant had substantial martial arts skills, asked why with those skills he needed to use a baton on the man. He said he did not mean to hit the man with the baton but had taken it because he thought he might have to use it against the man directing him to obtain money illegally from the Club, that is, the giant. He asserted to the psychiatrist he had merely defended himself when the man at the Club came at him when he attempted to obtain money from the Club. His account to the psychiatrist referred to his being frightened of the man who was “super well connected” and knew where Mr. Kelly’s wife and children lived. He told the psychiatrist that he was concerned that the man might find out that Mr. Kelly had talked about him and had sought to conceal for that reason the true reason for his going to the Club but had reverted to the truth on the advice of his lawyer that honesty was best. 
     
      
    9 In the account given to the psychiatrist, there are many bizarre features, in particular, referring to Mr. Kelly’s involvement with the police, fears of criminals and, in particular, his fears of being involved with police as a police informant and referring to his conduct when at another club in August 2001. 
     
      
    10 The report contained a long history of the offender of a confused and bizarre nature which included reference to a friend of the offender having been charged with murder, a matter which became complicated because of an asserted involvement of the National Crime Authority, the charged man having made a deal to give information about bikies and an assertion that Mr. Kelly had colluded with the police or being an informer, as a result of which he had bikies and well known criminals engaging in threatening behaviour towards his family and himself. Mr. Kelly told the psychiatrist he did not wish to go into witness protection because of his wife’s then pregnancy and that the offer for protection was not extended to her. 
     
      
    11 The offender had told the psychiatrist there were threats to kill the person charged with a murder who had become an informant for the National Crime Authority; that one of his family was tortured and shot. It was asserted by the offender that he had been set up to appear responsible for the death. He referred to Queensland police having told him to get out of the State and that he had, when confronted by bikies, had to pay them $500 to avoid them assaulting him and was told not to attend court in a case involving a stolen vehicle in which a dead body had been found. 
     
      
    12 The report referred to, by January 2001, the offender as having completely lost control, having depressive symptoms, uncontrollable crying, depressed mood, loss of interest and pleasure, insomnia, reduced energy, difficulty concentrating and suicidal ideation. In June 2001, he said he had taken an overdose of sleeping tablets intending to kill himself. He had sought psychiatric assistance. The trial judge described material in this report as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The whole of the history given to Dr. Delaforce contains a whole series of most strange, even bizarre happenings. The descriptions given by the offender have a strangely florid quality and have him at centre stage most of the time.” 
        
       
      
    13 Both he and his wife gave evidence before the trial judge on the plea. When Mrs. Kelly gave evidence, by consent her statement, Exhibit 2, was admitted into evidence. She gave evidence that she was scared for herself and her children, that the man that her husband had named had threatened herself and her kids if she said who he was, although her husband had told her that man’s name. She had had contact with the man through her husband’s mobile phone number when somebody else had answered the telephone when she had rung it; that the man had come to her place at Kingscliff and she had seen that man at the courthouse. In her statement she had referred to her husband’s initial account of having been asked to assault the man working at the RSL by way of reprisal for the assault on the friend’s 16 year old son. She referred to the man as having come to the premises at Kingscliff with a pistol sticking out of his pants. She referred also to the bizarre occasion in which her husband attended the Cudgen Leagues Club apparently with a knife seeking to be arrested. She specifically referred to the threat made to her by that man. 
     
      
    14 In cross-examination she confirmed the history as given by her husband to Dr. Delaforce and pointed out that she had known her husband for over 25 years, having been married to him for 15 years. She believed that he was a good man, a great father who had a breakdown due to stress. She confirmed his medication and his bizarre behaviour. She confirmed that she was very scared by the activities of this man who had threatened her for her own safety and that of her children. 
     
      
    15 The applicant’s statement was admitted and marked Exhibit 4. In that statement, the applicant asserted the account in which he was threatened by the violent creditor who required him to steal from the Byron Bay Services Club and that he had taken the extendable baton with him to protect himself against the creditor. He referred to what took place between himself and the man at the Club as “there was a scuffle”. He asserted that the man had threatened him if he said anything about that man to the police and that he knew that if he’d told the true story to the police his family would have been in danger. He referred to that man as having turned up at his wife’s place at Kingscliff and to his bizarre conduct taking the knife down to the Cudgen Leagues Club which he said he had done in order to be arrested. He asserted that he had received five to 10 other death threats over the phone made in a voice other than that of the man who lent him money; that his wife had received death threats also. 
     
      
    16 In his oral evidence, he referred to the man as being a giant of a man but declined to give details of the man when asked in cross-examination. During cross-examination, his counsel sought an adjournment once again to counsel him in favour of revealing the identification of the man. Reference was made to his psychiatric problems and particularly his depression as militating against his willingness to provide such an identification where he was, as he asserted he was, in terror of the man. 
     
      
    17 Some material was eventually forthcoming after the matter had been stood down but it was not possible to assess at that time the value of the material. On resumption, it was not possible to identify any person who might come within the description given. His Honour, thereafter, entertained extensive factual submissions by counsel appearing for the applicant, particularly concerning the applicant’s mental state and his bizarre behaviour. 
     
      
    18 When considering the alleged events preceding the commission of the crime, his Honour was unable to conclude on a balance of probabilities that the offender’s claim to have been stood over was true. His Honour expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the evidence of both the offender and his wife. He concluded that he was unable to accept with any confidence the offender’s version of events. In particular, he noted that the offender was, at the time this offence was committed, very short of money, his tree cutting business had been discontinued and he had a number of debts. 
     
      
    19 Concerning the claim that the offender had been stood over, which his Honour had concluded he was not able, on the balance of probabilities, to find true, he said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is just possible it could be true, but unfortunately there is such an atmosphere of untruths surrounding his evidence that I am unable to believe what he says or, given the situation of his wife, what she says. She is more credible than he, but that is not saying much.” 
        
       
      
    20 It was at this point that his Honour’s reasons were interrupted as I have referred to for the purpose of considering whether some further enquiry should be undertaken. 
     
      
    21 When the matter resumed on the Friday, his Honour continued with his remarks on sentence, expressing the view that whatever may have been the source of the pressure upon the offender, his Honour did accept that the offender was under some form of pressure at the time the offence was committed. He said;- 
     
      
       
        
        “Unfortunately, he has surrounded himself in a web of fabrication that has made it impossible for this court to determine with any confidence what that pressure was. I cannot totally discard the version of events which he now relies upon, nor do I have very much confidence as to the likelihood of that version being correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Perhaps this confusion in some ways, mirrors the confusion that seems to have taken hold of the offender around the time of the commission of this crime.” 
        
       
      
    22 When his Honour turned again to the psychiatrist, Dr. Delaforce’s report, he concluded that he accepted Dr. Delaforce as a competent and objective source of information, although he did not accept that the facts and events related by the offender to Dr. Delaforce had necessarily occurred. His Honour analysed the various bizarre matters the offender had related to Dr. Delaforce and said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There seems to me to be something of an aura of paranoid thinking pervading the versions of events to which I have just referred, which I find rather troubling. It is difficult to know what to make of them.” 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour then referred to various of the events as consistent with possible scenarios that could be true and Dr. Delaforce’s history of substance abuse by the offender. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is some information provided by his wife, indicating some rather strange behaviour witnessed by her, which, in my view, is very suggestive of the abuse of amphetamines.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour noted that Dr. Delaforce apparently found the same difficulties as the court in some respects and, in particular, concerning the information provided by the offender’s association with various criminal elements. 
     
      
    25 Dr. Delaforce had diagnosed the offender as having suffered from a major depressive disorder, a single episode, in partial remission and amphetamine dependence with physiological dependence; that the major depressive disorder had continued since the onset for the first time in January 2001 but that the amphetamine dependence has been present for some time since the initial use in 1996. His Honour quoted a passage from Dr. Delaforce’s report which included the following passage:- 
     
      
       
        
        “What currently appears to be well substantiated is a history of significant stress from 1999 at the latest, with marked deterioration in his mental health and onset in about January 2001 of a major depressive disorder that continued to after the April 2001 offence.” 
        
       
      
    26 He referred to Dr. Delaforce’s complaint that he had a lack of sufficient information about police matters. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have a strong intuition that some of the more florid allegations and claims made by this offender, could be more due to an imagination excited by the overuse of amphetamines than actual fact. There is an almost nightmarish tone to much of what he claims happened to him.” 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour also referred to much of what the offender had said as suggesting his having had a lot of contact with the criminal element, but concluded there were really no relevant convictions, although the offender had reached the age of 34 and thus the offender was to be treated as having a clean record. His Honour determined that that lack of prior record and the plea of guilty made at the earliest stage of arraignment were matters which must be taken into account in the offender’s favour. He referred to the various matters set out in the guideline judgment in Regina v. Henry & Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and the range of sentences referred to in that decision. He referred to the use of the extendable police baton, some degree of vulnerability of the victim, the absence of prior threat to use the baton, that although the victim had sustained a lump on his head, bruising, soreness and bleeding to the left side of his head so that his injuries were nasty and painful, they were not permanent. 
     
      
    28 His Honour concluded that the offender did have a genuine mental illness which might not be intractable, in that, the offender might respond to proper treatment. His Honour referred to the offender probably having to be kept in protection throughout the term of his imprisonment, that his mental illness would make his period in custody more onerous and that a perception that the offender was an informer might also add to his discomfort whilst in custody. His Honour concluded that he could only give limited weight to the degree to which the mental illness contributed to the offence because of the undoubted premeditation, notwithstanding that the offender’s thinking appeared to be not very clear and this could have been due to mental illness. His Honour was quite satisfied that the offender knew well that he was intending to commit a serious crime and took with him the baton in order to commit that crime. 
     
      
    29 It was for those reasons that his Honour imposed the sentence that he did. His Honour was of the view that the mental illness, the fact that it was the first time in custody and that upon release an extended period of supervision might be required were such as to amount to special circumstances and set therefore the two year non-parole period. He also recommended that the applicant be permitted to serve his term in an institution as near as possible to the State of Queensland. 
     
      
    30 On the hearing of the appeal, it was sought that there be admitted into evidence on the merits of the appeal certain material said to show that the matters to which his Honour had adverted as possibly requiring the appellant to undergo a period of imprisonment more onerous than that of others would possibly occur had in fact occurred. For the reasons given in the judgment delivered that day, the court concluded that the evidence was not admissible for that purpose. It was rejected. 
     
      
    31 Certain other material was also provided to the court in various affidavits to which the court’s attention was invited in the event that the court had determined that it was appropriate to re-sentence. 
     
      
    32 Three grounds were asserted on the application for leave to appeal against sentence. They were:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. It is submitted that his Honour erred by having insufficient regard to the applicant’s mental illness leading up to and at the time of the commission of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        2. It is submitted that in the absence of any reference, in the reasons for sentence, to the well known decisions concerning the proper approach to questions of deterrence, in the case of offenders with a mental disability, that his Honour had overlooked the principles for which they stand, and in that respect fell into error. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In the circumstances of this case, the sentence is manifestly excessive and a lesser sentence is warranted in law s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act (1912).” 
        
       
      
    33 In her written submissions, the applicant’s counsel submitted that his Honour’s conclusion that there was premeditation was one that did not militate against the importance of the evidence of the applicant’s mental illness. It was submitted that the mental illness, emotional and psychological deterioration distinguishes the applicant’s case from those referred to in Henry (supra), even given that the maximum penalty for the crime to which he had pleaded guilty exceeds that applicable to the crime which was considered by the court in the guideline judgment. 
     
      
    34 The submissions referred to Regina v. Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 in which a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of a two year suspended sentence for offences of armed robbery imposed upon an offender suffering from mental illness was dismissed. In particular, our attention was drawn to the remarks of the Chief Justice at paragraph 21:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercised (sic) has long been accepted. The relevant authorities have been reviewed in this court, the Victorian Court of Appeal and the Western Australian full Court. See  
        R. v. Fahda 
         [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48] per Simpson, J.;  
        R. v. Harb 
         [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45] per Smart, AJ; see also  
        R. v. Lauritsen 
        (2000) 114 A. Crim. R. 333, esp. [43]-[51] per Malcolm, CJ.;  
        R. v. Tsiaras 
         [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; see also Potas, Sentencing Manual: Law Principles and Practice in New South Wales 2001 at 285-286; Fox and Freiberg, Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed.), 1999 at 293-294.” 
        
       
      
    35 In that case, the Chief Justice went on to point out that mitigation on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence can be given where the offender suffers from mental illness. He continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
        
       
       
        
        To the extent that mental illness explains the offence – as her Honour found to be the position in the present case – then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood, CJ. at CL. put it in  
        Henry 
         (supra) at [254]:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I agree with the observations of Malcolm, CJ. in  
        Lauritsen 
         at [48]:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such.” ( 
          Tsiaras 
          , supra, at 400).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    36 It was submitted of this applicant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The fact of his psychiatric disorder remains a matter of significance in the sentencing process, notwithstanding that it is not shown that the mental disorder itself caused the commission of the offence:  
        Regina v. Engert 
         (1995) 84 A. Crim. R. 67. It may not, in those circumstances, reduce the moral culpability of the offence, but it does warrant consideration of the extent to which general deterrence and specific deterrence should be taken into account.” 
        
       
      
    37 Reference was made to Regina v. Letteri (NSWCCA, unreported 18 March 1992), a judgment of Badgery-Parker, J., with which Gleeson, CJ. and Sheller, JA. agreed, where his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The principle then is clear enough. It is correctly stated as follows - that whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a  
        mental 
         disorder or severe intellectual handicap. In an extreme case, the proper application of this principle may produce the result that considerations of general deterrence are totally outweighed by other factors. In every case it is a matter of balancing the relevant factors in a manner no different from that which is involved in every sentencing exercise.” 
        
       
      
    38 It was contended that since the sentencing judge here had not referred expressly to the well known decisions concerning the proper approach to considering mental illness as bearing on questions of deterrence nor expressly to the principles referred to in such cases as Israil (supra), it could be taken that his Honour had overlooked or wrongly applied them. Our attention was drawn to Regina v. Nelson [2002] NSWCCA 463 and in particular to the reference at paragraph 31 in the judgment of his Honour the Chief Judge at Common Law:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The approach which his Honour took in relation to general deterrence, in the special circumstances of this case, involving as it does somewhat bizarre behaviour by an offender of an otherwise unblemished record, but with an underlying mental state, does raise a concern as to whether that aspect was given undue weight. That concern, in my view, is sufficient for leave to be given to the applicant to appeal.” 
        
       
      
    39 It was submitted that general deterrence should have been given very little weight nor should personal deterrence have been given the usual weight. It was submitted in support of the third ground that assuming a discount in the order of 15 to 20% for the utilitarian value of the plea (see Regina v. Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383) his Honour’s sentence translated to a sentence which reflected a starting point near or above the top of an appropriate range and for all those reasons a lesser sentence was both warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    40 Further, in her oral submissions, counsel drew attention to the fact that it was the offender who provided the information to the police that the weapon he used was a dangerous weapon, thus escalating his offence from that under s.95(1) which involved corporal violence, but a maximum of only 20 years to the offence under s.97(2) by reason of the extendable baton being a dangerous weapon, an offence punishable by the maximum of 25 years and submitted that circumstance mitigated against such regard being had to the statutory maximum as to take the matter out of the range to which a judge is guided by Henry (supra). 
     
      
    41 In her oral submissions, counsel referred to the affidavit material on the issue of re-sentencing in a way that evoked a possible basis on which it might have been used to consider whether some other sentence warranted in law should have been passed. In particular, whether matters that were before his Honour had not in fact been fully revealed in their potential for imposing a proper sentence at the time at which the matter was before his Honour, that is to say that his Honour did not have a full appreciation of the material that would have been in existence at the time. It was, however, submitted by the Crown that the material really concerned events which had later occurred. For my own part, I would agree. I would conclude that this is not material that was fairly available to the court to consider absent the finding of other error which might warrant the court proceeding to re-sentence. 
     
      
    42 Even given the breadth of the discretion available to this court to take into account material which might not strictly accord with the rule of fresh evidence but which in justice should be received, I am unable to conclude that the material contained in these affidavits was such that I would be able to fairly accept it was material which should have been before the trial judge or which gave proper complexion to that which was before the trial judge. That notwithstanding that the doctrines concerning the limits on the evidence being taken into account on appeal may have been framed at a time in which licences might have been granted in respect of matters arising subsequent to sentence under the then in force provisions of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    43 I am not persuaded that some other lesser sentence or non-parole period was warranted in law and should have been passed. 
     
      
    44 In my view, the sentence passed by his Honour was such as not only to have taken into account fully the mental illness to which he referred but also the applicant’s plea of guilty and prior lack of record. His Honour expressly referred to these matters. The course taken at the hearing and the summary I have set out here of his Honour’s consideration of the applicant’s mental condition shows how deeply and correctly he considered the effect on the sentence of that matter. 
     
      
    45 The sentence, on its face appears to be, having regard to the objective culpability of the offence, remarkably lenient. That leniency is only explicable in the light of his Honour having given to the applicant not only the benefit of the early plea but of findings dramatically in his favour on the issue of mental illness as well as according to him the full value of the early plea. Suffice it to say that in my view, there appears to be no error in his Honour not expressing precisely the principles which he applied or referring expressly to the case law. It is apparent to me from the very sentence itself that his Honour properly had regard to the matter of mental illness as well as to the other matters he expressly identified. The submission that his Honour failed to give them sufficient weight, particularly having regard to the sentence that was imposed, in my view, fails. 
     
      
    46 In this regard, I particularly note that questions of credibility were for his Honour to evaluate and in doing so he afforded every opportunity, including by way of adjournment, to enable material to be put before him which might further assist the applicant’s case. 
     
      
    47 As I have said, I am unable to conclude that some other sentence warranted in law should have been passed. I see no error in his Honour’s exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    48 Since the matter has been argued fully, in my view, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal dismissed.

    1 STUDDERT J: I agree with Barr J.  
     
      
    2 BARR J: This is an appeal brought by the Crown under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act. On 4 March 2003 the respondent was found guilty by a jury of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon the complainant, Mr Shane Noel. On 29 May 2003 Ducker DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment for four years and fixed a non-parole period of two years and six months. His Honour ordered under s.19 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act that the sentence be served in a Juvenile Justice Centre. The Crown says that the sentence is inadequate. 
     
      
    3 The respondent, an aboriginal youth, was born on 3 September 1985. On 7 March 2002, when he was aged sixteen years and six months, he was in the company of friends and relations at an hotel in Grafton. The premises closed at about 11:00pm and the party left. The respondent had had so much to drink that he vomited. As the party moved away from the hotel there was a scuffle among its members, but he broke away from it. He came upon Mr Noel, a young man who was walking along the street minding his own business. He attacked Mr Noel. Nobody who gave evidence was able to say how the violence began, but the sentencing judge was satisfied that the respondent had started it. The respondent later gave two explanations why he had dealt with Mr Noel in the manner complained of. One was that he had a few days earlier called him a poofter and the other was that he had made a racist remark. The sentencing judge believed neither of those explanations. The evidence does not explain how it came about, but Mr Noel came to be lying in the street, apparently unconscious and quite unable to defend himself. The sentencing judge found that the respondent forcefully and deliberately jumped on his head, certainly more than twice. The attack ended when an adult member of the respondent’s group pulled him away. That adult tried to help Mr Noel but was unable to do so. He saw blood and other fluid running from Mr Noel’s ears and nose.  
     
      
    4 Before the attack Mr Noel was a healthy young man of normal intelligence. He suffered intermittent psychosis, probably schizophrenia, which was responding well to antipsychotic medication, and had a drug-induced problem for which he was receiving counselling and support. He was well and able to manage his own affairs. After the attack he was admitted to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. Scans revealed bilateral extracranial haematomas but no fracture of the skull or intracranial abnormality. He was badly affected and remained within the brain injury unit of the hospital for a number of months. He was doubly incontinent and dependent for all care. His cognition was seriously impaired.  
     
      
    5 In statements which were put before the sentencing judge, members of Mr Noel’s family described the condition of Mr Noel in May 2003. He was unable to walk unassisted and used a walking frame with wheels. He was unable to walk long distances without becoming tired. He could not complete normal daily activities, such as showering and attending to his personal hygiene, without assistance. He had difficulty preparing meals and drinks. He suffered body tremors. He was incontinent on occasions at night. His vision was reduced. He had difficulty in focusing, reading and writing. He was undergoing physiotherapy and needed care and supervision 24 hours per day. He was unable to hold a driver’s licence or drive a motor vehicle. He suffered from short-term memory loss. He tended to become agitated, frustrated and verbally abusive at times. He had a low attention span and had lost the ability to draw. Sometimes he was withdrawn. Sometimes he had difficulty understanding simple routines. He was confused when handling money and tended to lose track of time. It was necessary for the members of Mr Noel’s family responsible for caring for him to be constantly on the alert. Their time was very much taken up with his care, with his personal hygiene, seeing to his medication and transporting him to physiotherapy, medical and hospital appointments. The stress and strain on the family was great. All the indications were that that state of affairs would continue indefinitely. 
     
      
    6 It is implicit in the findings of the sentencing judge that the respondent did nothing to try to help his victim. Moreover, as his Honour said, he gloried in what he had done, offering to demonstrate to those present what he had done and jumping close to Mr Noel’s head. His Honour took the view that there had been no convincing statement of remorse on behalf of the respondent. A witness was called at the sentencing hearing who reported that the respondent had said to members of his family that he was sorry, but his Honour did not find the evidence impressive. His Honour noted that the maker of a Juvenile Justice report had observed that during her interview with the respondent remorse was neither stated or implied.  
     
      
    7 The respondent is the eldest of three children born to his mother and father. There are half-brothers and sisters as well. His parents separated when he was four or five years old and he was brought up by his grandparents. His mother and grandparents are part of the aboriginal community at Yamba. His father lives at Casino. All are concerned for him.  
     
      
    8 The respondent attended Maclean high school and left at the end of year nine. His attitude there was satisfactory and he is not recorded as having misbehaved. However, he began to use alcohol and other drugs at an early age. He first appeared in court in 1997, when he was placed on probation for two years for some unspecified offence. He was supervised by the Department of Juvenile Justice and responded satisfactorily. He was before the courts twice again in 1999, four times in 2000 and seven times in 2001. His offences were of misbehaviour, stealing and kindred offences and the possession of drugs. In March 2001 he was dealt with, among other things, for two instances of assaulting and intimidating police officers. He was put on a six month control order. That brought him into the Jacaranda Unit at the Juvenile Detention Centre at Grafton. On 15 July 2001 he was behaving in a noisy and agitated manner in his room. When one of the youth workers went to investigate the respondent punched him, breaking his nose. He was reported to have taken pleasure in the commission of that offence and to have said that if given the chance he would hit the worker again twice as hard.  
     
      
    9 That offence produced a twelve month period of probation and it was during the currency of that term that the respondent attacked Mr Noel.  
     
      
    10 A Juvenile Justice report was put before the sentencing judge. It indicated that during 2001 he had been binge drinking spirits weekly and using cannabis daily. Reports had indicated that he was not mentally ill and, unsurprisingly, that his offensive behaviour was connected with his abuse of alcohol and other drugs. He was said to have a propensity to react quickly and violently to behaviour by other males that he perceived as sexual.  
     
      
    11 His Honour had to decide in view of the age of the respondent whether to deal with him according to law or under the provisions provided by young people in the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. His Honour decided that the only appropriate way to deal with the respondent was according to law.  
     
      
    12 There were several features his Honour was bound to take into account in deciding how to sentence the respondent. The first was the objective seriousness of the attack on Mr Noel and its grave consequences. The second was the respondent’s youth. The third was his troublesome history of violence and his abuse of alcohol and other drugs. The fourth was his lack of remorse and its effect upon his prospects of rehabilitation. The fifth was an offer he had made to plead guilty to this offence.  
     
      
    13 This last matter needs explaining. The respondent had been tried for the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. The jury had acquitted him of that charge but had found him guilty of the statutory alternative. During the sentencing proceedings counsel for the respondent informed his Honour that at the committal an offer had been made on his behalf to plead guilty to the offence of which he was ultimately convicted. The Crown had refused to accept the offer but had required the respondent to come forward to trial on the more serious charge. A conviction on that charge would have attracted a maximum penalty of twenty-five years’ imprisonment. The offence of which the respondent was found guilty attracted a maximum sentence of only seven years’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    14 Having expressed surprise at the verdict, his Honour commented critically on the difference between the two maximum penalties and called for an increase in the maximum penalty for the lesser offence.  
     
      
    15 The position of the respondent before his Honour was clear. He was entitled to full consideration for his offer. Although the Crown could not be criticised for pressing on to a trial on the more serious charge, the result of which was that the community was saved no time, trouble or expense, the respondent was entitled to equal value for his willingness to facilitate the course of justice: see Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6. The appropriate range of discount in such an event is between 10% and 25%: R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309. Generally, the earlier the plea is offered the higher is the allowance that is made. 16 His Honour observed that the respondent’s record did not entitle him to leniency and identified as an aggravating factor the assault on the police officer which had resulted in the control order and the assault during the period of that order on the youth worker.  
     
      
    17 This was a difficult sentencing matter and his Honour summarised the matter in this way- 
     
      
       
        
        Despite his age, the offender must be sentenced according to law. However, his youth must be taken into account. Rehabilitation retains significant importance. The present offender’s apparent lack of remorse and expressions of his satisfaction from his violent behaviour are a source of concern as to his prospects of rehabilitation.  
        
       
       
      
    18 His Honour went on to observe that if the case had concerned an adult he would have allowed some leniency for the plea of guilty and imposed a sentence of something like six years’ imprisonment. His Honour continued- 
     
      
       
        
        Bearing in mind the age of the offender and the importance of rehabilitation of young offenders, there must be some weight given to the possibility of reform despite his present negative attitude which appears deeply entrenched. I am however firmly of the view that any sentence less than four years, given the seriousness of the offence and its appalling results would be insufficient, particularly in the light of his prior history of violent behaviour.  
         
        
       
      
    19 In shortening the non-parole period from three to two and one half years his Honour spoke about the age of the respondent and the length of the sentence. He wished to make it clear, especially to the Parole Board, that the principal reason for fixing such a non-parole period was so that the respondent’s suitability for release could be reviewed after the service of two and a half years’ imprisonment. His Honour observed that it should not be seen as an indication that the respondent should necessarily be released at that time. His Honour expected that the Parole Board would reach its decision after carefully evaluating whether the respondent’s attitudes had undergone any or any sufficient change so that he no longer presented a risk of committing further violent offences.  
     
      
    20 The Crown submitted on appeal that his Honour’s remarks revealed one frank indicator of error. It was submitted that the fact that the offence was committed during the period of a bond required a finding that the prospects of rehabilitation were consequentially poorer and a statement that a correspondingly smaller allowance had been made on that account. I do not think that so experienced a judge lost sight of the fact of the bond or that his Honour failed properly to assess the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation accordingly. No rule required his Honour to mention that matter in particular. I do not accept that error so appears.  
     
      
    21 The Crown otherwise asserted that his honour made these errors, which it called “identifiable errors”- 
     
      
       
        
        a. His Honour failed to impose a sentence which reflected the objective seriousness of the offence and the aggravating features in respect of it;  
         
         
        b. His Honour gave too much weight to the youth of the offender and insufficient weight to issues of general deterrence, personal deterrence, punishment and the protection of the community; and 
        
       
       
        
        c. His Honour failed to fix a non-parole period that adequately reflected the seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
      
    22 Without derogating in any way from the important principles that these submissions raised, it is necessary to observe that in total they did no more than assert that the length of the head sentence and the length of the non-parole period themselves indicate error. 
     
      
    23 It was submitted that the brutality and mercilessness of the attack, the seriousness of the injuries and the long term consequences for the complainant were so grave that this fell into the worst category of cases of its kind. Despite his intoxication, it was submitted, the respondent knew what he was doing and was without remorse. His previous convictions for violence and the fact that he was on probation at the time demonstrated his persistent disregard for the law and the safety of others, giving rise to a particular need for personal deterrence.  
     
      
    24 The Crown acknowledged that general deterrence is generally not as important in fashioning sentences to be imposed upon young offenders and that consideration of rehabilitation is correspondingly more important. Reference was been made to R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112. The Crown also correctly submitted, by reference to cases like R v Pham (1991) 55 A Crim R 128, R v Hawkins (1993) 67 A Crim R 64 and R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459, that the need to protect the community requires that deterrence and retribution remain significant elements even in sentencing youthful offenders. 
     
      
    25 The Crown referred to an observation of his Honour that a sentence of about six years would have been appropriate for an adult which, it was said, implied a conclusion that this offence fell into the most serious category of such offences, warranting the maximum sentence, and a discount of about fifteen percent for the offer of the plea of guilty. It was submitted that the subsequent reduction of the head sentence by one third to four years amounted to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    26 The Crown produced such statistical sentencing records as were available, but they showed that there were only four instances of offenders under twenty-one years of age pleading guilty to the commission of similar offences while at conditional liberty. Three of the cases resulted in imprisonment. The head sentences varied from three to four years and the non-parole periods or minimum terms from one to two and a half years. The Crown conceded that the record was of no statistical significance. 
     
      
    27 The Crown put before the court the remarks of sentencing judges in certain cases, for the most part the ones represented in the statistical figures I have mentioned. The salient details are as follows. 
     
      
    28 Vaea Taliai was sentenced by Urquhart QC, DCJ on 19 January 1996. Taliai pleaded not guilty and was found guilty by the jury. When he was twenty-one years old he and another man chased, knocked down and viciously kicked their victim. He sustained fractures to the base of the skull. He was unconscious for five and a half weeks. He sustained permanent brain damage. Whereas he had been a promising university student he could not maintain attendance at even a fairly basic TAFE course. He had poor memory and poor impulse control. His propensity to spend his money frivolously made him virtually incapable of handling his own affairs. His condition was permanent. The head sentence was three and a half years’ imprisonment and the minimum term two years’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    29 Ahu Stanley Taylor was sentenced by Blanch CJDC on 17 April 1997. He responded to an attack commenced by the complainant, overcame him and kicked him several times in the head and body. He picked the complainant up by his hair and smashed his head onto the ground several times. There was brain damage but it was not clear whether it was permanent. Taylor pleaded guilty. He was twenty years old at the time of the offence. The head sentence was three and a half years’ imprisonment and the minimum term two years’. However, Taylor was sentenced at the same time for two unrelated matters, each of which resulted in a concurrent one year fixed term. A further unrelated matter was taken into account. 
     
      
    30 Ben Sakisi and John Taotara were sentenced by Blanch CJDC on 30 January 1996. Both pleaded guilty. Sakisi was nineteen years old at the time of the offence and Taotara twenty years old. They were members of a group of at least six people who attacked others and punched and kicked the complainant in the face and the head. A broken beer bottle was thrust into his face. He was thrown into a wall. Each was given a head sentence of four years and a minimum term of two and a half years.  
     
      
    31 Leon James Sutherland was sentenced by Nield DCJ on 23 November 2001. He pleaded guilty. He was nineteen years old at the time of the offence. He attacked the complainant and kicked him in the head while he was lying on the ground. Permanent brain damage resulted which the sentencing judge found would have a significant effect upon the complainant for the rest of his life. The head sentence was two years eight months and the non-parole period one year eight months.  
     
      
    32 The Crown did not put these cases before the court for the purpose of demonstrating what might be a correct or an incorrect sentence according to a given set of facts, for that would not have been a principled approach, but rather to give some indication of sentences imposed for not dissimilar offences. They do not make a tariff. 
     
      
    33 Some features of these cases are less serious than the one under consideration in this appeal. For the most part the injuries sustained were less serious, though Taliai’s victim probably suffered as badly. Some features, on the other hand, were more serious. For example, the offences of Taliai, Sakisi and Taotara were committed in company. Most importantly, all offenders were significantly older than the respondent, the age differences varying between two and a half and four and a half years. To my mind, the young age of the respondent was of such significance that this age difference makes the cited cases of little assistance. They do not support the Crown contentions.  
     
      
    34 This is not a sentencing court in which the arguments for or against a particular sentence are rehearsed a second time and a second discretionary decision made. It is a court of error. The court interferes with a sentence only if it can be shown that the sentencing judge erred in acting on a wrong principle or in misunderstanding or in wrongly assessing some salient feature of the evidence.  
     
      
    35 His Honour is one of the most experienced sentencing judges in New South Wales. His careful remarks show that he took a very serious view of the grave features of the offence pointed to by the Crown. It could never be said that his Honour did not have a full appreciation of them. His Honour was well aware of the need for the sentence to reflect the need for personal and general deterrence and retribution. His Honour was also well aware that while they also remained relevant, those matters are of less importance in the sentencing of children. 
     
      
    36 In view of the age of the respondent, his troubled personal history, his questionable chances of rehabilitation and the need to foster it wherever possible and the consideration to which he had entitled himself by his offer to plead guilty to the charge, the resulting sentence was bound to be fixed significantly lower than the maximum sentence available for the offence. There was a limited range within which his Honour could exercise his discretion. The maximum penalty was seven years’ imprisonment. In the circumstances a head sentence of four years’ imprisonment for an offence committed by a boy of sixteen and a half years of age was substantial. The Crown has not made good its submission that it fell outside the proper range of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. Neither, to my mind, has the fixing of a non-parole period of two years and six months been shown to be outside the proper range of his Honour’s sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    37 I would dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 STUDDERT J: Richard Edward Colley stood trial in the District Court charged with supplying a prohibited drug. The jury found him guilty of that offence and he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years eight months with a non parole period of four years three months.  
     
      
    2 The appellant now appeals against his conviction. 
     
      
    3 At his trial there was no issue about the element of possession. I shall examine the evidence more closely shortly, but the evidence established that the appellant had in his possession some 57.9 grams of methylamphetamine. This, of course, was more than the traffickable quantity of methylamphetamine (set in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act at 3 grams), so that the appellant was deemed under s 29 of the statute to have the prohibited drug in his possession for supply unless the appellant proved that he had it in his possession otherwise than for supply.  
     
      
    4 In his written submissions, counsel for the appellant acknowledged that the sole issue for the jury was whether the appellant had proved on the balance of probabilities that he had the drug in his possession otherwise than for supply. It was the appellant’s case that he had the drug solely for his personal use. 
     
      
    5 The appellant was arrested early on the morning of 20 February 2001. Police officers had premises at Bathurst under observation and observed a car leaving those premises. The police officers followed the vehicle and signalled the driver to stop. The appellant was the driver. His girlfriend was with him in the car. The appellant was observed to pull something in a clear plastic bag out of the left pocket of his jeans and to place it in the centre console of the car. A police officer searched the vehicle and in the centre console found twelve plastic resealable bags containing white powder. In addition a tin marked “Latex” was located and inside that there were a further six resealable bags containing a white powder. A box containing twelve black syringe disposable packs with used and unused needles was found on the floor of the car. 
     
      
    6 When the appellant was told he would be searched, the appellant was seen to adjust his right ankle area with his left foot. When searched $3500 was found in the appellant’s right sock. The appellant also handed to the police officer a needle and syringe from that right sock. A further $320 in cash was located in a wallet in the appellant’s jeans. 
     
      
    7 Later on the same day the premises occupied by the appellant and his girlfriend were searched and the results of that search were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) a set of plastic scales was found in a box in a small room at the rear of the premises; 
       
       
      (ii) a plastic bottle used as a bong was found in the laundry; 
       
       
      (iii) a small brass pipe and two syringes were found in a kitchen drawer; 
       
       
      (iv) a small amount of cannabis was found in the kitchen; 
       
       
      (v) a box of Glucodin was found in the kitchen; 
       
       
      (vi) a second set of scales was found in the kitchen; 
       
       
      (vii) pieces of foil were found on top of a cupboard in the dining area; 
       
       
      (viii) Glucodin tablets were found on a table in the lounge area; 
       
       
      (ix) a number of needle swabs were found in the bathroom; 
       
       
      (x) in the bedroom were found a number of syringes, a plastic bag containing white tablets, a spoon with some dried residue later identified as methadone, and a black pile of rolled up tape which contained a plastic bag with what was identified as morphine in it. 
       
      
    8 The content of the eighteen resealable bags was subjected to chemical analysis. All of the packs contained methylamphetamine. Four of the bags with a content weighing 15.5 grams were of such purity as to be known on the street as “ice”. Twelve of the bags, with a content weighing 36.4 grams, contained powder of a purity of 22.5 percent, which was also high purity according to the chemist conducting the analysis. The content of the remaining two bags weighed 6 grams and the purity of it was not tested. 
     
      
    9 A detective superintendent, whose evidence prompted the first ground of appeal argued, said that the twelve bags containing the drug with a 22.5 percent purity had, on a conservative estimate, a total value of $4200. He said that a single gram of drugs at 22.5 percent purity would sell for between $90 and $120. The two resealable bags with a content of 6 grams had a total value of between $540 and $700. The superintendent described the content of the bags as “typical eight ball deals”. Then, in relation to the four resealable bags with a purity of eighty-one percent, the superintendent said the 15.5 grams could be cut at least eight times, so as to create 146 grams of amphetamine. He said this gave the content of these four bags a value of “around $12,400”. 
     
      
    10 The appellant gave evidence. He denied being a drug supplier. The appellant said that in September 2000 he accidentally had a drink that contained methylamphetamine and thereafter he became progressively addicted to this drug until by the time of his arrest he was using two grams and sometimes as much as three grams per day, injecting it into his person. 
     
      
    11 The appellant gave evidence of recent purchases of methylamphetamine for his own use and of acquiring the drug in stronger form than he had been used to using, so he took it home to cut it with glucose. His evidence in short was that all the drug that had been found in the car was his and that it was all purchased for his own use. He said that he had the drugs in the car, after taking them from a hiding spot in the garden, with a view to taking them with him whilst he visited Queensland. 
     
      
    12 The appellant offered an explanation for having money on his person. He said he had recently won a considerable amount of money on the poker machines. He had also received a lump sum of $50,000 on a workers’ compensation claim in September 2000 and he withdrew money from his bank account to defeat a threatened claim by a neighbour for victim’s compensation. The appellant said that claim was made after the appellant had assaulted that neighbour. 
     
      
    13 In summary then, the appellant’s case was that the methylamphetamine found in his car was for his own use and the money in his possession was not money received from the sale of drugs. 
     
      
    14 I turn now to consider the various grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
       
       
      Ground 1: That the trial miscarried in that damaging and inadmissible evidence was admitted both without objection and without any direction from the trial judge limiting its use 
       
      
    15 There were three categories of evidence to which this ground related: 
     
      
       
      (a) certain of the evidence of the detective superintendent; 
       
       
      (b) certain evidence concerning the appellant’s mobile phone menu; 
       
       
      (c) the evidence of the detection of the drugs inside the appellant’s premises. 
       
      
    16 It is to be observed that no objection was taken by counsel appearing for the appellant at his trial to the introduction of any of the evidence to which ground 1 relates. Nor was the trial judge asked to give any direction limiting the use of the evidence to which exception is now taken. Leave is accordingly required to rely upon ground 1.  
     
      
    17 The operation of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was recently considered in R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174. In that case Ipp JA, with whose judgment Buddin J and Shaw J concurred carried out a review of earlier decisions on r 4, citing inter alia the dicta of McHugh J in Papakosmas v R (1999) 196 CLR 297 where his Honour said (at 319): 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error or law or is satisfied that the appellant’s conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant”. 
        
       
      
    18 What was said in the above passage in Papakosmas has particular relevance here. It is for the appellant to satisfy this Court that there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of the introduction of the evidence to which ground 1 relates. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(a) The evidence of Detective Superintendent McKay 
       
      
    19 The evidence of this witness was led from his statement as to his involvement in the investigation of illicit drug manufacture and supply from the year 1985 onwards, including his involvement in a large number of undercover operations. His evidence disclosed expertise in investigation of illicit drug operations, and no challenge to his expertise in the field was taken at the appellant’s trial, nor, indeed, in this Court. 
     
      
    20 Detective Superintendent McKay addressed the chemical analysis of the content of the resealable plastic bags that had been discovered in the appellant’s car, and on this matter the witness said this (T 59): 
     
      
       
        
        “item one describes 12 resealable plastic bags containing a total of 36.4 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 22.5 percent. The normal street usage purity that we discover is between one percent and six percent. Single grams of a drug of this purity sell for between $90 and $120. I would describe 22.5 purity as of good quality. It is the case that the 12 bags contained similar amounts, they are typical eight ball deals. This is typical behaviour in the illicit drug world, used to purchase eight balls of purity, cut the drug, use some of it and on sell the rest. I would conservatively value the eight balls in this case at $350 each, giving them a total value of $4,200. Item two on the same certificate relates to two resealable plastic bags containing a total of six grams of methylamphetamine. These again are typical eight balls. It is the case that the two bags contained similar amounts. Dependent upon purity they would be valued between $270 and $350 each, giving them a total value of between $540 and $700. 
        
       
       
        
        Item three relates to four plastic resealable bags containing a total of 15.5 grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 81 percent. Methylamphetamine with a purity of this level is usually referred to as crystal methylamphetamine or ice. This drug sells for approximately $500 per gram. If it is the case that the four bags contained a similar amount they are typical eight ball deals. As they would be worth approximately $1,900 each the total value of $7,600. 15.5 grams if cut at least eight times creating 146 grams of amphetamine which could sell for $100 a gram, giving it a value of around $12,400.” 
        
       
      
    21 Whilst in his written submissions, Mr Cook recorded some complaint about the introduction of the above evidence, in oral submissions Mr Cook conceded that the above evidence was admissible. In my opinion, that was an appropriate concession having regard to the ambit of the expertise of this witness. 
     
      
    22 In the course of cross examination of Detective Superintendent McKay questions were asked that sought to make the following points: 
     
      
       
      (i) that it was cheaper to purchase drugs in larger quantities than in smaller quantities; 
       
       
      (ii) that each time a user sought to buy drugs he exposed himself to dangers; 
       
       
      (iii) one of those dangers was the danger of being “ripped off” by the person from whom he was buying; 
       
       
      (iv) another danger was being apprehended by the police. 
       
      
    23 The witness agreed in cross examination as a matter of commonsense that the less a user exposed himself to those dangers the better it was for him. 
     
      
    24 Plainly the purpose of that cross examination was to elicit evidence explaining a course of conduct on the part of a mere user in buying in bulk, so as to buy more cheaply and so as to minimise the risks associated with drug transactions. 
     
      
    25 Following the completion of his cross examination, the witness was asked in re-examination the following questions and gave the following answers (T 65): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Superintendent based on your experience and looking at the if I could say the drugs seized in this arrest, are you able to say whether you have opinion, whether it is a user situation or a supplying situation? 
         
        A. I have no doubt it’s a typical drug supply there’s no doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you have no doubt it’s a typical drug supply? 
         
        A. There’s no doubt at all.” 
        
       
      
    26 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the evidence introduced in re-examination was inadmissible. Mr Cook submitted that the questions sought an opinion on the ultimate jury issue, and that notwithstanding s 80 of the Evidence Act, evidence of the opinion of the expert on that issue was inadmissible. It was argued that at the very least the evidence should have been excluded in the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. Reference was made to R v David & Gugea (unreported, NSWCCA, 10 October 1995 in particular at p 9) and to R v Lam [2002] NSWCCA 377 (at paras 78-79). The Crown responded that David & Gugea did not prescribe an inflexible principle to be applied in every case; rather the approach to ss 135, 136 and 137 of the Evidence Act called for a ruling depending on the circumstances of the particular case, citing Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297, and in particular the judgment of McHugh J at para 97. 
     
      
    27 Had objection been taken to the first of the questions asked in re-examination, then, in my opinion, the question should have been disallowed because it seems to me there was a fundamental difficulty with it. What did it mean? Perhaps it had the meaning for which the appellant here contends, but another way in which the question could have been understood was that it called for an expression of opinion as to whether the quality and the quantity of the drugs seized were typical of possession for supply on the one hand or possession for personal use on the other. Uncertainty as to the meaning of the question warranted its rejection. 
     
      
    28 If what the witness was being asked to do was to express an opinion as to whether the appellant had the drugs in his possession for the purposes of supply or for the purpose of use, then it seems to me the question should not have been asked. The expertise of the witness did not qualify him to give evidence as to the purpose for which the appellant possessed the drug. 
     
      
    29 However, what the witness had said in his evidence in chief was admissible in my opinion, and indeed it is not now submitted to the contrary. It was within the expertise of the witness to express an opinion as to whether it was typical behaviour of a supplier to have drugs in the quantity and of the purity of the drugs discovered in the appellant’s car. The evidence that such possession was typical of drug suppliers was admissible as being within the expertise of the witness. 
     
      
    30 Acknowledging that the questioning which elicited the responses in re-examination was not altogether clear, I do not read the answers given as amounting to any more than a repetition of what was said in the evidence in chief. What the witness was saying, as I read the answers, amounted to no more than a summary repetition of the evidence in chief set out earlier. 
     
      
    31 It was pointed out that the Crown treated the responses in re examination as amounting to an expression of opinion by the witness that the appellant had the drugs in his possession for supply purposes, because this was the interpretation of the evidence advanced in the final address of the Crown. However, the position remains that not only was no objection taken to the introduction of the evidence but at no stage was the trial judge asked to give the jury any direction limiting the use which the jury might make of that evidence. In these circumstances, the remarks of McHugh J in Papakosmas cited in ITA assume particular relevance. 
     
      
    32 An affidavit was affirmed by counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial in which counsel explained that he did not object to the evidence to which this ground refers because 
     
      
       
        
        “he did not direct his mind to the fact that the witness was answering an ultimate jury question and the prospect that the jury may substitute his opinion for their own.” 
        
       
      
    33 The likely explanation for that is that counsel did not regard the answers in re-examination as anything more than an repetition, in summary form, of the evidence given in chief. In the atmosphere of the trial, counsel did not perceive there was a need to make any application to the trial judge, either about the evidence given or the content of the Crown’s address to the jury, and I am not satisfied that any miscarriage of justice has occurred by reason of the evidence given by this witness. I conclude that I would not grant leave to the appellant to rely upon this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(b) The evidence of Senior Constable Cuzner 
       
      
    34 Senior Constable Cuzner gave evidence at the trial (which the transcript records as being given by consent), of having inspected the appellant’s property including a small Nokia mobile phone. He said (T 66-67): 
     
      
       
        
        “After obtaining the telephone numbers from the accused’s mobile menu, I then completed a lessee name and address check for each telephone number in the accused’s telephone menu and forwarded them to the police information and intelligence centre. I later received a number of faxes relating to each of the name and address checks for those telephone number checks.  
        Some of the checks revealed names and addresses well known to police for their involvement in drug culture and activity 
        …” 
        
       
      
    35 It has been submitted that this evidence should have been excluded because its effect was to demonstrate that the appellant was an associate of criminals engaged in the drug trade generally. It was submitted that this was not permissible and what it did was to raise the spectre of his being a person of bad character in a generalised sense. The evidence was plainly inadmissible as hearsay evidence, the appellant submits. 
     
      
    36 Had objection been taken to the evidence in the sentence underlined above, that evidence should have been rejected, but no objection was taken to its introduction. It could not be suggested that counsel appearing at the trial was taken by surprise when Senior Constable Cuzner said what he did. There had been an earlier trial which had proceeded so far as the end of the defence case. Something thereafter occurred which necessitated the discharge the jury. A reading of the transcript of the evidence of Constable Cuzner given at the second trial discloses that Constable Cuzner gave the evidence above in response to a question expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “With the consent of my learned friend, I would ask you to read from paragraph 3 on page 1 of that statement, please.” 
        
       
      
    37 Not only did counsel take no objection to the introduction of the evidence knowing in advance what was to be said, but it is to be noted that there was no application made to the presiding judge concerning that evidence at any stage of the trial. 
     
      
    38 The Crown has submitted that there was no prejudice occasioned to the appellant by the admission of this material because his own case was that he had numerous dealings with local drug dealers and that he bought drugs for five months prior to his arrest. He was cross examined about the names found in his telephone menu (T 117): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. But by February you were familiar with the suppliers of drugs in the Bathurst area, weren’t you? 
         
        A. Some. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Because you heard Detective Constable Cuzner say that your phone had in its memory a number of entries that he was familiar with in the drug trade in Bathurst? 
         
        A. I’d have to – I knew people in the drug scene because I’d buy drugs.” 
        
       
      
    39 So it was that the appellant had an explanation for having the phone numbers and that explanation was entirely consistent with his case. 
     
      
    40 An affidavit was affirmed by Constable Cuzner who deposed to his personal knowledge of many of the names in the telephone menu “as belonging to people involved in the drug trade as either users or dealers”. Constable Cuzner further deposed: 
     
      
       
        
        “My knowledge in relation to these people was a result of my direct dealings with them as part of my duties in the New South Wales Police Anti Theft Squad.” 
        
       
      
    41 Had counsel raised objection to that part of the evidence of Constable Cuzner which was inadmissible, doubtless the rejection of that evidence would have led to further questioning by the Crown enabling Constable Cuzner to give evidence in point as to his own personal knowledge. It is unlikely that this would have helped the appellant’s case. 
     
      
    42 In my opinion, the appellant should be regarded as bound by the way his counsel conducted the trial concerning this matter: see the discussion of relevant principles in Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 and in particular in the judgment of the Chief Justice at 685. 
     
      
    43 In the circumstances therefore I do not consider that a case has been made out for the grant of leave under r 4 to pursue this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1(c) The introduction of evidence concerning drugs and items found in the appellant’s premises 
       
      
    44 This ground, expressed in the notice of grounds of appeal and addressed in written submissions, was not pursued on the hearing of the appeal. However, I propose to refer briefly to it because the explanation for the way in which the evidence complained of under this ground was introduced at the trial is an explanation of a kind that accounts for the reluctance which a judge presiding at a trial may have in intervening where seemingly inadmissible evidence has been introduced without objection. Unless counsel appears to be incompetent (and there is no suggestion of that here), it is not unreasonable for the presiding judge to conclude that the accused’s counsel wants the evidence admitted in a particular way, or for a particular purpose. 
     
      
    45 The evidence which was introduced and to which this ground relates is the evidence referred to in para 7 of this judgment. Whilst in written submissions it was argued that the evidence was inadmissible and highly prejudicial because it showed a propensity in the appellant to use drugs and to be involved with drugs other than methylamphetamine, an affidavit sworn by the Crown Prosecutor appearing at the first trial makes it clear that it was the Crown’s understanding that the defence wanted the material placed before the jury as additional evidence of the appellant’s status as a heavy drug user and one who lived with another drug user. Indeed, the evidence at trial was that these other drugs were not his. The appellant’s evidence was that the various drugs found were those of his girlfriend and he was not challenged about this. The Crown Prosecutor affirmed in his affidavit: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence of the search of Colley’s home given by Senior Constable Cuzner was as agreed between the defence and the prosecution. It included the evidence of the finding of the bong, small brass smoking pipe, the small amount of cannabis, some methadone and some morphine. This evidence was led by me at the first and second trials because it was my understanding that the defence wanted this material placed before the jury as additional evidence of Colley’s status as a heavy drug user, who lived with another drug user and whose previous partner had left him because of his drug use in the home.” 
        
       
      
    46 In response counsel for the appellant at the trial affirmed in his affidavit: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have read the affidavit of Crown Prosecutor Alex Clout. The contents of that affidavit are consistent with my own memory.” 
        
       
      
    47 This ground has not been argued, but in any event r 4 would have stood in its way. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The trial miscarried as a result of the manner in which an alleged lie was dealt with by the trial judge 
       
      
    48 When the police officers were searching the appellant’s car prior to his arrest and powder was discovered, the appellant was asked whether he knew what it was, and he responded: “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” The appellant was not cross examined about that statement, and he did not refer to it in his evidence in chief. Neither the Crown nor counsel for the accused addressed the jury about the significance of that statement. However, before the addresses began the judge raised the matter (T 169) in the context of considering how he should sum up: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Now, what about the question of lies? (incorrectly recorded as “liars”) 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Your Honour can I take that one on an advisement and we can make application to you on it tomorrow morning if I think it’s appropriate?…” 
        
       
      
    49 Then, on the following morning counsel for the accused said this in the absence of the jury (T 171): 
     
      
       
        
        “DOYLE: Your Honour yesterday afternoon your Honour mentioned about the direction regarding lies. I had discussions with the learned Crown, neither of us would like any direction at all on lies. Our position is that a direction as to lies would really be confusing to the jury in any case, so that’s both our positions on that direction.” 
        
       
      
    50 It is to be taken then that neither the Crown nor counsel for the accused wanted a direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 to be given to the jury, and plainly no such direction was given in the course of the summing up. His Honour did refer to the appellant having been asked about the white powder (SU 23): 
     
      
       
        
        “When spoken to by the police when they first apprehended him he told them that he did not know what they were talking about when the policeman asked him what the white powder was. There was no claim made then ‘look officer this is my stash of drugs purchased for my own use’. In short the Crown says he was caught red handed with a substantial quantity of valuable drugs. His claim that he had them in his possession solely for his own use is a concoction to avoid responsibility.” 
        
       
      
    51 The above passage in the summing up did not prompt change in the position of counsel on lies, nor did it prompt any request for any further directions about what the trial judge had said as set out above. Once again r 4 is enlivened when considering this ground; and it is relevant to bear in mind what Ipp JA said in ITA (supra) at para 98: 
     
      
       
        
        “The existence of r 4 and s 99 [of the Criminal Procedure Act] imposes a duty on counsel to inform the trial judge of all points that arise from the summing up that reasonably could give rise to an appeal. It will not lightly be assumed that this duty has been breached. Rather, unless there is good reason to hold the contrary, it will be inferred that decisions not to raise such matters with the trial judge are taken for sound forensic reasons. No more need be said than to repeat and emphasise the remarks of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Sanderson  
        (unreported, NSWCCA 18 July 1994) that:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances, to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred’.“ 
          
         
        
       
      
    52 I do not consider that the appellant should be given leave to rely upon this ground when no point about it was taken at the trial. In context, what the trial judge was pointing out to the jury was simply the absence of an assertion by the appellant when he first had the opportunity to make it that the powder was a drug bought for his own use. Read in context, what the judge said in the passage above quoted should be read in the sense that in what was said from the words “In short the Crown says” onwards, his Honour was summarising the Crown case which he had earlier been reviewing for the jury.  
     
      
    53 There was no suggestion in the evidence, or in the addresses of counsel, or in the summing up that the lie was told because of a consciousness of guilt in respect of the supply charge, and the lie appears to have been given little prominence at the trial. Counsel for the appellant did not want an Edwards direction, doubtless because it was perceived that such direction would have given an emphasis to the notion of consciousness of guilt in a manner that the evidence and the conduct of the trial had not. 
     
      
    54 In Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40 Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said this (para 34): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not necessary for a trial judge to give a direction, either of the kind referred to in  
        Edwards 
        , or of the kind referred to in  
        Zoneff 
        , every time it is suggested, in cross-examination or argument, that something that an accused person has said, either in court or out of court, is untrue or otherwise reflects adversely on his or her reliability. Where the prosecution does not contend that a lie is evidence of guilt, then, unless the judge apprehends that there is a real danger that the jury may apply such a process of reasoning, as a general rule it is unnecessary and inappropriate to give an  
        Edwards 
         direction.  
        Zoneff 
         was said to be an unusual case, and the direction there proposed was said to be appropriate where there is a risk of misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies. The present was not such a case.” 
        
       
      
    55 These dicta are, in my view, directly in point here. I do not perceive that there exists the possibility that the absence of an Edwards direction might have caused this trial to miscarry. 
     
      
    56 In my opinion, leave to rely upon ground 2 should be refused. 
     
      
    57 For the above reasons, I consider that this appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

     REGINA v Darren Douglas ELLIS 
     
     
      
       
       
      FACTS 
       
       
      Following a trial before Holt ADCJ and a jury, the Appellant was convicted on 24 October 2001 of eleven counts of break enter and steal or attempted break enter and steal with intent or aggravated break enter and steal. The offences were all committed on commercial premises in rural New South Wales, with access to the premises obtained or attempted by removing an entire pane of glass from its seals. Originally there were thirteen such counts on the indictment. Before the trial commenced, an issue arose as to admissibility of evidence of each offence as tendency or coincidence evidence in relation to all other offences on the indictment. His Honour concluded that such evidence was admissible in respect of eleven of the thirteen counts, and, accordingly, permitted a joint trial to proceed on those counts. His Honour’s reasoning failed to refer to the test in  
      Pfennig v The Queen 
       (1995) 182 CLR 461. The Appellant appealed against his convictions, submitting that Holt ADCJ applied the wrong test for admission of the tendency and coincidence evidence and wrongly admitted that evidence. 
       
       
       
       
       
      HELD  
       
       
      A. (per Spigelman CJ, Sully, O’Keefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ agreeing) 
       
      The statutory regime for the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence found in the  
      Evidence Act  
      1995 was intended to cover the relevant field to the exclusion of common law principles previously applicable. The use of the word “substantially” to indicate the extent to which the probative value of tendency or coincidence evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect in s101(2) is a legislative formulation, not derived from prior case law. [70], [74], [83], [84] 
       
       
      Papakosmas v The Queen 
       (1999) 196 CLR 297 applied. 
       
       
      B. (per Spigelman CJ, Sully, O’Keefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ agreeing) 
       
      The continued application of the common law test for admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence explicated in  
      Pfennig v The Queen 
       (1995) 182 CLR 461 is inconsistent with the statutory requirement in s101(2) for a balancing process between probative force and prejudicial effect, during which the court must make a judgment that probative value substantially outweighs prejudicial effect. [88], [89], [94], [95] 
       
       
      Pfennig v The Queen 
       (1995) 182 CLR 461 considered. 
       
       
      C. (per Spigelman CJ, Sully, O’Keefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ agreeing) 
       
      His Honour was correct to adopt and apply the terminology of the legislation, rather than the pre-existing common law test. Application of the common law test may result in a trial judge failing to give adequate consideration, pursuant to the statutory formula, to the actual prejudice in the specific case that the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh. [90], [94] 
       
       
      D. (per Spigelman CJ, Sully, O’Keefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ agreeing) 
       
      The line of authority applying the common law  
      Pfennig  
      test to the statutory requirements for admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence is incorrect. However, there may be cases where, on the facts, it would not be open to conclude that the statutory test for admissibility is satisfied unless the common law test is also satisfied.

      E. (per Hidden and Buddin JJ; Spigelman CJ, Sully and O’Keefe JJ contra) 
       
       
      Tendency and coincidence evidence is likely to be highly prejudicial, therefore the statutory test for admissibility remains one of very considerable stringency. [99], [104], [105]

     REGINA v Darren Douglas ELLIS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant appeals to this Court against 11 convictions for break enter and steal or attempted break enter and steal with intent or aggravated break enter and steal contrary to ss112(1), 112(2) and 113(1) together with s344A of the Crimes Act 1900. There is a single ground of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “There has been a miscarriage of justice in that the learned trial judge applied a wrong test in determining whether to admit certain tendency and coincidence evidence and wrongly admitted that evidence.” 
        
       
      
    2 Originally there were 13 such counts on the indictment. Acting Judge Holt permitted 11 of the counts to be heard together. His Honour did so on the basis that he would admit the evidence on each of those counts on each other count and, accordingly, that a joint trial could proceed. 
     
      
    3 The offences were committed in a number of rural towns in New South Wales including Bathurst, Cowra, Yass, Mudgee and Wagga Wagga. 
     
      
    4 Before the trial commenced an issue arose as to admissibility of the evidence. The Crown relied on the evidence to which I will hereinafter refer on both a tendency and coincidence basis. It gave notices under both s97 and s98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (see transcript 8/10/01 at p6). The issue in the appeal is whether on either basis, i.e. tendency or coincidence, his Honour applied a wrong test by referring only to the terminology found in s101(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (“the Act”), which I will hereinafter set out and which applies to both tendency and coincidence evidence. 
     
      
       
      Evidence in Respect of Each Count 
       
      
    5 To understand how and on what basis the tendency and coincidence evidence was admitted on the trial of the Appellant, it is necessary to refer in some detail to the events of November 1996, and January-April 1999, during which the various break and enters were committed or attempted. 
     
      
    6 The first and second of the thirteen counts on the indictment related to events that took place on 24 and 25 November 1996 at Bathurst and Orange respectively. On the evening of 24 November 1996, after the owner had locked it up for the night, a glass panel was removed from the front sliding door to Heath’s Café at Bathurst. It had been placed, intact, against the front counter. Property including toys, video games, cigarettes and wine was missing. No identifiable fingerprints were able to be taken from the glass. The same evening, the East Orange Newsagency was also broken into. A glass pane from the lower section of the door was removed and later found inside the premises. Some cigarettes were removed from a display. The internal burglar alarm was activated. The Senior Constable who attended the scene at about 1:30am on 25 November gave a statement indicating that although he had seen a similar modus operandi in break and enters when working in Sydney some six years previously, he had not observed it since. 
     
      
    7 Apart from the unusual modus operandi and the tendency evidence sought to be introduced by the Crown, there was no other evidence connecting the Appellant to these two offences and his Honour disallowed that evidence in relation to the first two counts and refused to include counts one and two in the trial. His Honour also refused to admit as tendency evidence the evidence of four break, enter and steal matters that had taken place in 1994 in which the Appellant had admitted his guilt on an earlier occasion, or of a break, enter and steal at Wodonga in Victoria on 21 April 1999, in which the Crown alleged a similar, unusual, modus operandi was used. 
     
      
    8 There was a gap of more than two years before the next series of offences with which the Appellant was charged. These offences, which were the subject of counts three and four on the initial indictment and became counts one and two in the trial, took place on 12 January 1999 in Bathurst and Mudgee. The first incident occurred at Heath’s Café in Bathurst on the night of 12 January 1999, after the owner had locked up and departed for the evening. The glass from the bottom section of one of the front doors was removed and when the café’s owner returned to the shop the following morning, he discovered that about $7000 worth of cigarettes, as well as an electric drill, a CD player and a cassette player were missing. No finger marks were found on the glass. That same night, a glass window pane near the front entrance of the Fiesta Chicken Shop in Mudgee was removed, along with its rubber seal and steel edging, and the alarm system activated. Nothing was stolen, and a piece of glass matching that from the window pane was later found in the laneway behind the shop. 
     
      
    9 Unlike the first two counts on the initial indictment, there was other evidence linking the Appellant to these offences. On 12 January 1999, Kevin John McKenzie rented a car with registration number 432-DWZ from All-Country Car Rentals in St Marys in Sydney. Kevin McKenzie is the Appellant’s stepfather. The car was rented for one day, and upon its return on the 13th of January it had travelled 830 kilometres over the course of the rental period. Detective Senior Constable Nicholson, the officer in charge of the matters being tried before Holt ADCJ, gave evidence of the distances between Sydney, Bathurst and Mudgee, and calculated the round trip between those three places as being 697 kilometres. Attina Georgopoulos, who was employed at the time as a customer service officer for All Country Car Rentals, gave evidence that she had attended to the lease of the vehicle at 3:50pm on 12 January, and that the car had been returned at 4pm on 13 January. The return was supervised by Alan Rogerson, who was the proprietor of the business at St Marys. 
     
      
    10 Counts three and four in the trial were a break, enter and steal and an attempted break and enter with intent to steal that took place in Cowra on the evening of 15 January 1999. Some time after the premises of the Downtown Milk Bar in Cowra had been locked and secured at approximately 9pm, a glass window panel from the front of the shop was removed. It was found intact the following morning on the right hand side of the shop’s interior, with its rubber beading removed. Approximately $5600 in cash, two cash registers, a large quantity of cigarettes and some soft drinks and chocolates were missing. The police recovered the two cash registers on 16 January in a culvert on the side of the road towards the township of Koorawatha, which is situated south of Cowra en route to Young. Senior Constable Terry of the Cowra Police gave evidence that the cash registers and glass were fingerprinted but no prints were found. These events became the subject of count three. 
     
      
    11 At about 10:30pm on 15 January 1999, Angela Parris, co-owner of Parris’ Milk Bar, situated about 100m away from the Downtown Milk Bar in Cowra, secured the shop for the evening. The following morning, Con Parris, the other co-owner, noticed a piece of black rubber lying on the concrete outside the front of the shop. Further investigation revealed that the strip of rubber had apparently been removed from the large window beside the front door of the shop. That window was loose in its frame. Murray Alchin, a glazier in Cowra who inspected the premises with Senior Constable Terry on the morning of 16 January, gave evidence that the outside glazing rubbers and the aluminium piping bead had been removed from the window of Parris’ Milk Bar, which was sufficiently large that, according to Mr Alchin, two people would be needed to remove it. Mr Alchin also gave evidence that a fair knowledge of the glass industry would have been required to remove the glass at the Downtown Milk Bar, because, unusually, the aluminium beading was located on the inside of the window in that case. A particular type of glass-lifting sucker would have been required. Mr Alchin said that “whoever did this was very knowledgeable in this industry” (T270) and that in his opinion, the same person was involved in both counts three and four because of the way both “jobs” were done (T272 and 279). 
     
      
    12 The events the subject of count five in the trial took place in Young on the evening of 15 January 1999. Andrew Xenophos, the co-owner of the Young Charcoal Chicken shop, left the premises securely locked at approximately 9:15pm. Upon arriving at work the following morning, he discovered that a glass pane from the front of the shop was missing from its frame and had been placed on the ground near the front door. One corner of the glass was damaged. About $2000 worth of cigarettes had been taken. The co-owner later found the rubber strips from the window in a garbage bin outside the shop, and aluminium stripping apparently from the window in bushes several doors up the street. Senior Constable Kelly Slater’s statement was read to the court below. She attended the premises on 16 January 1999 and observed the glass pane being fingerprinted. No fingerprints were found. She noted that in over seven years that she had been stationed at Young, she had never witnessed this glass removal method being used in a break and enter. 
     
      
    13 Evidence linking the Appellant to counts three, four and five at the trial was supplied by mobile telephone records obtained from Telstra and annexed to the statements of Megan Foster and John MacKay. Mr Ian Seaford, a principal telecommunications technical officer, gave evidence in relation to the telephone calls made from the mobile phone leased by the Appellant. He prepared a map showing the outer limits of where each call from the mobile phone could have been made, which became Exhibit H at the trial. On the morning of 16 January 1999, the telephone leased by the Appellant made calls from areas within 35 kilometres of the base station at Yass at 8:05 and 8:06am, from Gunning at 8:32am and from Fairfield at 10:29am. 
     
      
    14 Counts six and seven at the trial were the result of events taking place on the same night, 19-20 February 1999, in Wagga Wagga. The owner of the Silver Tree Café locked and departed the premises at approximately 9:30pm on 19 February. Upon returning at 8:30am the next morning, he noticed that the glass was missing from the bottom of the window on the left side of the shop. The refrigerator had been pushed away from the window and cash and cigarettes were missing, to a value of $1120. 
     
      
    15 Mr Kevin Boys was the co-owner and operator of The Place Newsagency in Wagga. He arrived with his wife to start work shortly after 4:50am on 20 February and noticed that the lights at the rear of the shop that normally remain switched on 24 hours a day were not lit. Mr Boys unlocked the door and was in the process of pulling it open when a male person started running towards Mr and Mrs Boys, saying, “Get out of the fucking way, I’m going to stab you”. Both Mr and Mrs Boys gave evidence that the man was wearing clear plastic or latex gloves and carrying a red, white and blue bag. He ran into Mr Boys and knocked him over, before running around the corner of the shop and down the laneway at the side of the shop towards the ambulance station. Another bag similar to the one the assailant had been carrying was lying under the counter filled with loose packets of cigarettes from the display in the shop. The glass pane in the bottom half of the front sliding door had been removed and its plastic beading was on the floor of the shop. The glass pane itself was later found intact, outside the rear of the shop. No fingerprints were found on it. Cartons of cigarettes to a value of approximately $1357 were missing. 
     
      
    16 Mr and Mrs Boys both gave evidence at trial that the assailant was approximately 5’7” in height, with fair hair cut above his collar and of average build. Mr Boys gave evidence that the man was Australian or European looking and had no distinctive accent. Mrs Boys later participated with the police in the construction of a com-fit image, which became exhibit J in the trial. Neither she nor Mr Boys were able to identify the assailant from a video collage of photographs shown to them at Wagga police station. 
     
      
    17 At 4:30pm on 19 February 1999, the Appellant’s stepfather again hired a vehicle, registration number 431-DWZ from All Country Car Rentals. The rental details were noted by Attina Georgopoulos. The car was returned at approximately 5pm on Saturday 20 February 1999, having travelled 1158 kilometres. Although the refund of the deposit was signed by Mr McKenzie, (the original hirer of the vehicle) and dated 22 February 1999, Ms Georgopoulos recorded “Darren Ellis picked up $498 only” at the bottom of the page, and this notation was signed “D Ellis”. Ms Georgopoulos gave evidence that the Appellant was present with Mr McKenzie when he came to pick up the vehicle two out of the four times that the latter rented a vehicle from All Country Car Rentals. She correctly identified the Appellant from a video collage on 19 August. Mr Rogerson and Ms Georgopoulos both gave evidence that the rental documents were sometimes pre-signed when a vehicle was to be returned on a Saturday, since All Country Car Rentals was at that time not open after midday on a Saturday. Detective Nicholson gave evidence that the distance from Sydney to Wagga is 460 kilometres, thus a return journey would be 920 kilometres. 
     
      
    18 On 8 March 1999, Mr and Mrs Boys secured The Place Newsagency in Wagga at about 6pm. The newsagency had recently been restocked with cigarettes following the previous break-in. At about 4:30am the following morning they returned to find that the bottom half of the fixed window on the left hand side of the door had been removed. The glass pane that had been removed was slightly chipped or cracked and was leaning against the shop fittings on the right hand side of the shop. The aluminium beading was beside the glass pane on the floor of the shop. Approximately $2200 worth of cigarettes had been taken. These events were the subject of count eight at the trial. 
     
      
    19 At 5pm on 8 March 1999, the Appellant’s stepfather hired vehicle 432-DWZ from All Country Car Rentals. It was returned at 2:30pm the following day, having travelled 1194 kilometres. Detective Nicholson gave evidence that the distance from Sydney to Wagga is 460 kilometres, thus a return journey would be 920 kilometres. 
     
      
    20 A car with a matching registration plate was seen by Phillip Hoey, an Ambulance Station Operator on duty overnight at the Riverina Operations Centre, which was located about 150 metres to the rear of The Place Newsagency in Wagga. At about midnight, Mr Hoey heard a car door close and went out onto the roof of the ambulance station. He saw a person getting out of the car and looking around and thought that this behaviour was abnormal, so wrote the car registration number down on his hand. Mr Hoey gave evidence that the person was Caucasian, of medium build, had “blondie” coloured hair (T193) and was wearing shorts, joggers and no shirt. The person disappeared for 20 to 30 seconds behind an electricity substation and reappeared with a large red and blue striped bag. The person looked up and down a few times, and approached the vehicle, seeming to be in a hurry. He threw the bag in the back of the vehicle, got into the vehicle and drove away quite rapidly without the vehicle lights on. After the incident, Mr Hoey made a call to Wagga police on the police radio. He was subsequently unable to identify the Appellant in a video collage of photographs. 
     
      
    21 Ian Seaford gave evidence that there were two telephone calls made from the Appellant’s mobile telephone in the early hours of 9 March 1999, at 12:55am and 1:21am. Both were made in the Albury billing sector, which was just to the south of Wagga Wagga. At 5:56pm on 8 March, a call had been made from the Liverpool area on this mobile phone. Detective Nicholson gave evidence that there is 126 kilometres between Wagga and Albury. 
     
      
    22 The events that became the subject of count nine at the trial took place on 15 March 1999 in Yass. James Patrick McGrath secured the Yass Newsagency at approximately 7pm on 15 March, leaving approximately $1300 in cash in the open drawers of its three cash registers. At about 11:30pm, Mr McGrath received a telephone call from the police, and upon arrival at the newsagency noticed that a pane of glass from a window next to the door of the shop had been removed. The empty cash register drawers were stacked on the floor and the cigarette and battery displays above the counter were also empty. A box containing phone cards had been emptied and was sitting on the counter. The total value of property stolen was estimated by Mr McGrath as between $10,000 and $12,000. 
     
      
    23 The following day, the missing glass pane was located in a park about 100 metres away from the newsagency. Mr McGrath telephoned Mr Graham Jewell, who attended the premises and repaired the window that morning. Mr Jewell gave evidence that he had replaced hundreds of panes of broken glass over the course of his career, but on only one previous occasion had he seen glass panes removed in the same fashion, at a break and enter at the Yass Soldiers’ Club about twelve months previously. 
     
      
    24 The Appellant’s stepfather hired vehicle registration number 431-DWZ from All Country Car Rentals at about 4:30pm on 15 March 1999. The vehicle was returned the following day, after a journey of 783 kilometres. There does not appear to have been any evidence from Detective Nicholson as to the distance between Sydney and Yass. Mr Rogerson (proprietor of All Country Car Rentals) recalled that when the vehicle was returned on this occasion, Mr McKenzie was accompanied by a man of slim to average build, with sandy coloured hair and heavily tattooed legs. The man later drove off in a VK or VL series Commodore. Deborah Lee, the Appellant’s de facto partner at the time, gave evidence that he had a lot of tattooing on the bottom part of his legs. 
     
      
    25 At about 10:45pm on 15 March, Senior Constable John Monkley and Sergeant Sternbeck were on patrol in Yass when they saw a white Commodore sedan parked in Meehan St, Yass, close to the newsagency. Sergeant Sternbeck noted the number plate, 431-DWZ. A man, described in evidence by Senior Constable Monkley as of medium build, about 5’10” and wearing a sloppy joe-style jumper and jeans was packing items into the boot of the vehicle. Sergeant Sternbeck described the man as being in his mid-20s, of medium build and similarly dressed. The police saw the vehicle again about seven or eight minutes later and ascertained that the driver was the only person in the vehicle. Senior Constable Monkley noted as the vehicle turned that its number plate was 431-DWZ. The officers commenced following, but were only able to follow for about 50 metres before the vehicle got too far ahead. The officers contacted police radio before returning to the newsagency. 
     
      
    26 On 17 March 1999, police executed search warrants at 6 Somov Place, Tregear, the residence of Kevin and Jennifer McKenzie, the accused’s stepfather and mother, and at 18 Mawson Road Tregear, the residence of the accused and his de facto partner, Deborah Lee. At 6 Somov Place, a carton of Winfield Blue cigarettes, a striped plastic bag containing a number of assorted batteries with Yass Newsagency price stickers on them, eleven packets of Holiday brand cigarettes and a large quantity of unopened packets of batteries were seized. At 18 Mawson Road, a box of Tally Ho cigarette papers, four packets of tobacco, one packet of Winfield Blue cigarettes and one box of Longbeach cigarettes containing five individual packets were seized. On 6 July 1999, a box of batteries and cigarette packets was shown to Mr McGrath at Yass Police Station. Mr McGrath recognised the majority of the batteries as the property of Yass Newsagency. He was also shown some packets of cigarettes, which were consistent with the brands carried by the newsagency, but was unable to positively identify them as being from his business. 
     
      
    27 Counts 10 and 11 at the trial both related to break-ins at the Yass Caltex Service Station at 228 Comur Street, Yass. Count 10 was the result of events of the night of 14 April 1999. At the end of his afternoon shift on that day, Raymond Hill secured the Yass Caltex Service Station site as per company instructions. The next morning, Simon Bumbar arrived for work at around 6am, and noticed some rubber stripping lying to the left of the front door. When the manager of the service station arrived for work, he discovered that the stripping came from the bottom of the front door. He telephoned the police. Senior Constables Tait and Baxter attended the premises at about 8:35am and observed that the aluminium angle from the bottom of the door was loose where the rubber stripping had been pulled out, and that the glass was wobbling. 
     
      
    28 Michael Timmer owned a bakery over the road from the Yass service station. On or about 14 April 1999, he saw a man standing at the service station looking in the window at about 3.30am. He described the man as between 18 and 28 years of age, of medium solid build, wearing dark clothes. Mr Timmer gave evidence that the man disappeared around a corner and a few minutes later a VH or VK Holden Commodore drove out of Polding Street near the service station. The car was described by Mr Timmer as having mag wheels and carrying a P plate, similar in appearance to the car he positively identified two weeks later in relation to count 11 at the trial. There was only one person in the car at the time. Deborah Lee, the accused’s partner at the time, gave evidence that she was the registered owner of Holden Commodore TOW-976, a car which had mag wheels and which was used by the accused, who had a provisional licence and drove the car with P plates. On 28 April 1999, police executed a search warrant and took photographs of the accused and of a Commodore TOW-976 at 18 Mawson Road, Tregear. 
     
      
    29 On 27 April 1999, Anne Pasparene secured the premises of the Yass Caltex Service Station at about 9.30pm. She left the office door open, which was normal practice when the floors of the office were due to be polished by the cleaner. When the cleaner arrived at 5.15am on 28 April, he noticed that the lower section of the glass sliding front door was completely missing. He contacted the manager, and spoke to police at the premises at around 6am. The service station manager, Michael Waters, arrived at about the same time. The glass pane from the front door had been completely removed and was sitting inside the premises. Cigarettes to the value of $2264, and $1100 in cash had been taken from the office. These events were the subject of count 11 at the trial. 
     
      
    30 At 3.30am on 28 April 1999, Michael Timmer, who had commenced his baking for the day, heard a noise from the back of the Yass Caltex Service Station and got into his delivery vehicle to investigate. About 800 metres up the road, he saw a car coming towards him. When it passed him, he recognised the car as being the same Holden Commodore he had seen a fortnight previously, with mag wheels. Mr Timmer turned around to follow the car, which headed towards Canberra. He put his lights on high beam and noted the registration plate, which was TOW-976. The car had a P plate on. Mr Timmer returned to his shop and rang the police, at which point he observed the same car driving past, heading out of town in the other direction. 
     
      
       
      The Trial Judge’s Ruling 
       
      
    31 Holt ADCJ set out the facts and the relevant evidence in a manner which was not contested on this appeal. He identified the relevant tendency/coincidence evidence on which the Crown relied in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The type of premises which was the subject of the break enter (or attempt as the case may be) were small retail outlets in country New South Wales which stocked similar types of merchandise. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The goods stolen or available inside of the shop where the attempts to enter was unsuccessful were of a similar type, mainly cigarettes and or cash. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The entry had been effected by adopting an unusual modus of operation, namely, the removal from the outside of the rubber or aluminium seals securing the glass panel in the entry door or windows and removing the panel without breaking it, and leaving the panel in the vicinity of the premises broken into.” 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour referred to the evidence before him from a number of police officers which indicated that the offence of break enter and steal rarely occurred in the manner identified in point 3 above and his Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “In view of this evidence it is clear this is an unusual mode of breaking and entering into premises.” 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour then determined the question of admissibility by applying the test emphasised in the following passage to the evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The next question is whether the tendency evidence the Crown seeks to call together with other evidence to be adduced has significant probative value.  
        And whether it passes the test under s 101 of The Evidence Act 
        . Section 101 (2) of the Evidence Act says: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Tendency evidence about a defendant or coincidence evidence about a defendant that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial affect it may have on the defendant.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In relation to counts 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 in the indictment, there is evidence of sightings of a car with which the Crown says the accused was associated in the town where the offences are alleged to have occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        As to counts, 3, 4, 8 and 9 there is evidence of a car with which the Crown says the accused was associated with which was hired shortly before the time of the alleged offences and returned shortly thereafter together with evidence available of the mileages done. 
        
       
       
        
        As to counts 5, 6, and 7, there is no evidence relating to the use of a car but a phone call was made from a phone leased to the accused from Yass at 8.05 and 8.06 on the morning after the offences referred to in counts 7, 8 and 9. Later a cash register was found at Koorawatha relating to count 6. Koorawatha being a village between Cowra and Young. 
        
       
       
        
        Yass is south west of Young, but on the Hume Highway, which leads to Sydney, where at 10:29 another phone call was made on this phone from Fairfield, and again earlier a call was made from Gunning, which is near the Hume Highway and between Yass and Sydney at 8.32am. 
        
       
       
        
        As to counts one and two, there is no car, phone, or other evidence which the Crown will tender to link the accused with the crimes, apart from the suggested tendency evidence. In my view, the tendency evidence in relation to count one and two by itself is not of significant probative value and should be disallowed. 
        
       
       
        
        As to the other counts, namely, counts three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, and thirteen, in my view, the proposed tendency evidence, together with the other evidence to be called, has, in my view, significant probative value; and  
        as to the test in s 101 of the Evidence Act, in my view, the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused 
        .” (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
      
    34 His Honour determined that the evidence was admissible on each count, other than the first two counts. His Honour concluded that it was appropriate for the remaining eleven counts to be heard together, but counts one and two were not included in the trial. His Honour refused another tendency evidence application but no issue arises on this appeal with respect to that decision. 
     
      
    35 Having considered the matter on a tendency basis, his Honour then proceeded to determine the admissibility of the evidence on a coincidence basis. He found that the separate test in s98(2) was also made out as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown also seeks to use the evidence I have allowed in counts three to thirteen inclusive as tendency evidence, to be used as evidence of coincidence under s 98 of the Evidence Act. In my view, the evidence fulfils the requirements of that section, but I also find the requirements of s 98 (2) in the affirmative, and in my view,  
        under s 101 of the same Act, the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused 
        .” (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
       
      The Statutory Scheme 
       
      
    36 The relevant sections of the Evidence Act 1995 are: 
     
      
       
        
        “97(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if:

          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        “98(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Subsection (1)(a) does not apply if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        “101(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant.

    37 The Dictionary of the Act contains the following relevant definitions: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        coincidence evidence 
         means evidence of a kind referred to in section 98(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.” 
        
       
       
        
        “ 
        coincidence rule  
        means section 98(1).” 
        
       
       
        
        “ 
        tendency evidence  
        means evidence of a kind referred to in section 97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.” 
        
       
       
        
        “

        “

    38 It is also material to note s141(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “141(1) In a criminal proceeding, the court is not to find the case of the prosecution proved unless it is satisfied that it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
       
      The Issue on the Appeal 
       
      
    39 This Court has convened a bench of five because of a conflict of authority that has arisen with respect to the proper application of s101 of the Evidence Act 1995 in the light of the prior common law position determined by the High Court. 
     
      
    40 In Sutton v The Queen (1984) 152 CLR 528 at 564, Dawson J said with respect to the admissibility of similar fact evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the various expressions which are used to lay down the test of admissibility, it seems to me that a trial judge may find assistance in arriving at the correct test in any particular case by applying the same standard as the jury must ultimately apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence. If in considering the admissibility of similar fact evidence the trial judge concludes that there is a rational view of that evidence which is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused, then he ought not admit it because in those circumstances the evidence cannot be said to have a sufficiently strong probative force. Prejudice may operate when neither logic nor experience necessarily require the answer that the evidence points to the guilt of the accused and that being so the probative force of the evidence will not outweigh or transcend its prejudicial effect.” 
        
       
      
    41 The test of “strong probative force”, which Dawson J invoked, had frequently been applied. (See e.g. R v Boardman [1975] AC 421 at 444 quoted in Markby v The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 108 at 117; Perry v The Queen (1982) 150 CLR 580 at 586, 589, 604 and Sutton at 533). That test is reflected in each of ss97(1)(b) and 98(1(b) in terms of the court determining whether the evidence “would … have significant probative value”. 
     
      
    42 The final sentence of the extract from Dawson J in Sutton invoked a process of balancing probative force and prejudicial effect, which had emerged in R v Boardman as the appropriate test for the admissibility of similar fact evidence. 
     
      
    43 In Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 296, the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Sutton 
         Dawson J. expressed the view, with which we agree, that to determine the admissibility of similar fact evidence the trial judge must apply the same test as a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence, and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    44 The reasoning in Hoch was expressly adopted and extended by the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in Pfennig v The Queen (1995) 182 CLR 461 where their Honours said at 482-483: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because propensity evidence is a special class of circumstantial evidence, its probative force is to be gauged in the light of its character as such. But because it has a prejudicial capacity of a high order, the trial judge must apply the same test as a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is consistent with the innocence of the accused. Here ‘rational’ must be taken to mean ‘reasonable’ and the trial judge must ask himself or herself the question in the context of the prosecution case; that is to say, he or she must regard the evidence as a step in the proof of that case. Only if there is no such view can one safely conclude that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. And, unless the tension between probative force and prejudicial effect is governed by such a principle, striking the balance will continue to resemble the exercise of a discretion rather than the application of a principle.” 
        
       
      
    45 Section 101 of the Evidence Act poses the test in different terms as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    46 The issue that arises in these proceedings is whether the proper construction of s101, in its context, requires the Pfennig test to be applied. 
     
      
    47 This matter has been the subject of differences of opinion in the authorities. 
     
      
    48 In this State, commencing with the first relevant authority in a single judge decision of the then Chief Judge at Common Law, Mr Justice Hunt, in 1997, the preponderance of authority has been in favour of the continued application of the Pfennig test. (See R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356; Foley (unreported, NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, Stein JA and Bruce J, 5 June 1997); R v AH (1997) 98 A Crim R 71; R v Veitch [1999] NSWCCA 185; R v Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359; R v Colby [1999] NSWCCA 261). 
     
      
    49 Doubts were expressed in this regard in R v Fordham at 369 per Howie AJ and in R v Holt [2001] NSWSC 232 at [13] per Sully J. Sustained criticism has appeared in three judgments of Hulme J (R v Leask [1999] NSWCCA 33 at [53]; R v Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 at [112]-[116] and R v Andrews [2003] NSWCCA 7). In each of Andrews and Le, Hidden J agreed with Hulme J. Heydon JA noted the difficulty of the issue in Andrews. Simpson J, with whom Mason P and Dowd J agreed, expressed her agreement with Hulme J’s comments in Le in R v OGD (No 2) (2000) 50 NSWLR 433 at [52]. See also her Honour’s observations in R v Daley [2001] NSWSC 1211. 
     
      
    50 Nevertheless, the line of authority commencing with R v Lock has been affirmed, albeit in particular terms, in judgments of Hodgson JA in the three most recent cases R v WRC (2002) 130 A Crim R 89 at [25]-[29]; R v Joiner [2002] NSWCCA 354 at [37] (Simpson J and Smart AJ agreeing) and R v Folbigg [2003] NSWCCA 17 at [27] (Sully and Buddin JJ agreeing). 
     
      
    51 In the ACT, where the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) applies, the same issue has arisen. The position taken in this State has not been adopted. (See W v R (2001) 189 ALR 633 especially per Miles J at [53] and Madgwick J at [101]). To similar effect is the approach of the Full Court of the Family Court in WK v SR (1997) 22 Fam LR 592 at 604-605 and the Full Court of the Federal Court in Conway v The Queen (2000) 98 FCR 204 at [97] and [102]. The preponderance of authority outside of this State supports the direct application of the terms of the statutory test and not the application of the Pfennig test. Tasmania has recently adopted the Evidence Act, but the issue has not arisen in that State. 
     
      
    52 Pfennig continues to be applied in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia, which have not adopted the Evidence Act. In Queensland and Victoria, the test was reversed by legislative intervention. (The Evidence Act 1997 (Qld) s132A and R v S [2001] QCA 501 at [32]; Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) s398A and R v Camilleri (2001) 119 A Crim R 106 at 123 and 125.) 
     
      
    53 The issue has been recognised on a number of occasions in special leave applications before the High Court. However, at this stage, no suitable vehicle for determining the issue in that Court has arisen. 
     
      
    54 The Appellant’s contention on this appeal was that the Pfennig formulation was required to be applied in any case in which the exclusionary rule found in s101(2) falls to be applied. It was not contended that this turned on the facts of the present case. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Did the Trial Judge Apply the  
      Pfennig 
       Test? 
       
      
    55 I have set out his Honour’s reasoning above. There is no reference in that reasoning to the Pfennig test, nor any terminology identifying the evidence to be circumstantial evidence, to which the approach determined in Pfennig is to be applied. His Honour referred, in terms, to the test under s101(2) of the Evidence Act and applied that test in terms. (See the parts of the judgment emphasised in paras [33] and [35] above.) 
     
      
    56 When the Crown handed up its written submissions, outlining the use it intended to make of the evidence in one count on each other count, it was his Honour who said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… out of our bench book here we’ve got a few notes on tendency and coincidence evidence. I have a couple of copies made of that and whilst I’d like you both to regard it as being confidential, I’ll give you a copy each and you might care to read that, it may save us a bit of time …” 
        
       
      
    57 The Bench Book to which his Honour referred was the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book prepared by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales for the use of judicial officers. It was at that time confidential, but has subsequently become publicly available. 
     
      
    58 In the course of the discussion of tendency and coincidence evidence, that Bench Book quoted the relevant passage from Pfennig and stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The above principles … may be taken authoritatively to state the common law with respect to the admissibility of tendency and similar fact evidence in Australia. These principles may conveniently be compared to the standard of proof of evidence sought to be tendered under the tendency and coincidence rules of the  
        Evidence Act 
         1995 (NSW)”. 
        
       
      
    59 There then followed some discussion of the statutory provisions and the Bench Book concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Prudence would dictate, however, that despite the lower statutory threshold, the higher  
        Pfennig 
         test should be applied when determining whether the relevant evidence has significant probative value, viz – is there a reasonable view of the evidence that is consistent with the innocence of the accused?” 
        
       
      
    60 After this material was made available to counsel, the trial judge was addressed on the applicability of Pfennig and subsequently asked for a copy of the judgment. He received further submissions from counsel then appearing for the Appellant, which urged on him the application of the Pfennig test. It does not appear that the Crown made any submission to the contrary. 
     
      
    61 In the light of these submissions, it is, perhaps, surprising that his Honour did not refer to the Pfennig test in any way in the judgment he subsequently delivered. 
     
      
    62 Although his Honour made available the Bench Book extract, there is nothing which indicates that he did so because of the references therein to Pfennig. The extract first distinguishes the position under the Evidence Act. It goes on to state that the Pfennig test “should be applied”, but does so in language of “prudence”, rather than of requirement. 
     
      
    63 It appears that his Honour concluded that it was not appropriate to express his judgment in any terms other than the specific statutory formulation. His Honour gave clear reasons for the decision, as quoted above, in which he applied, in terms, the statutory formulation in s101(2). I am not prepared in these circumstances, to conclude that his Honour did apply the Pfennig test, in some unstated manner, by way of explication of the statutory test. 
     
      
    64 It is, accordingly, necessary to decide whether the Pfennig test must still be applied. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Does the  
      Pfennig  
      Test Continue to Apply? 
       
      
    65 The Evidence Act as originally enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament, and subsequently adopted in New South Wales, was based in large measure on the reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission. However, that Commission’s reports are less useful on this subject than usual, because the formulation in the legislation eventually adopted was substantially different from that recommended. 
     
      
    66 In 1991, New South Wales and the Commonwealth each introduced Evidence Bills which were based on the Law Reform Commission’s draft bill, but differed in several respects from that draft bill and from each other. Officers of the Commonwealth and New South Wales worked together to develop a uniform law. 
     
      
    67 What is now s101 first emerged as a result of this process in an Exposure Draft of an Evidence Bill which was issued in August 1993 by the Attorney General of New South Wales. The explanation accompanying the proposed clause 101 was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clause 101 provides a further safeguard in relation to tendency and coincidence evidence adduced in a criminal proceeding by the prosecution to those set out in clauses 97-99 for all proceedings. In such a proceeding, tendency or coincidence evidence is not admissible against the defendant unless the probative value of such evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that it may have on the defendant. This safeguard reflects the rule applied at common law in relation to what is conventionally termed “similar fact” evidence: See  
        Hoch v R 
         (1988) 165 CLR 292;  
        Harriman v R 
         (1989) 167 CLR 590.” 
        
       
      
    68 When the Commonwealth Evidence Bill was introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament later in 1993, the Explanatory Memorandum stated, with respect to clause 101: 
     
      
       
        
        “174. This clause sets out a second exclusionary rule relating to tendency evidence and coincidence evidence in criminal proceedings. It applies in addition to the preceding requirements of this Part. The prosecution in a criminal proceeding is not to adduce tendency evidence about a defendant (except to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant) unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        175. Similarly the prosecution in a criminal proceeding is not to adduce coincidence evidence about a defendant (except to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant) unless its probative value substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    69 The reference to Hoch and Harriman in the New South Wales Exposure Draft was not of such a character as to suggest that the document was adverting to the particular passages in Hoch, which were subsequently adopted in the joint judgment in Pfennig. Nothing in the extrinsic material suggests that those responsible for the drafting and promotion of the legislation had any alternative formulation in mind than that which found its way into s101 in terms of probative value substantially outweighing prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    70 The line of authority in this State which asserts the continued applicability of the Pfennig test commenced at a time when there was an occasional tendency to construe the Evidence Act in the light of the pre-existing common law. This approach was decisively overruled by the High Court in Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297. In that particular case, what was in issue were the common law rules with respect to evidence of recent complaint in sexual assault cases. In that context, the Court made numerous references to the way in which the statute may be found to override the pre-existing rules. 
     
      
    71 Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said at [10]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the sections of the Act relevant to this case undoubtedly make express provision different from the common law. It is the language of the statute which now determines the manner in which evidence of the kind presently in question has to be treated. The appellant argues that the meaning and effect of that language, properly understood, is to be determined in the light of, and in the manner that conforms to, the pre-existing common law. For reasons that will appear, that argument must be rejected. …” 
        
       
      
    72 Furthermore, Gaudron and Kirby JJ said at [46]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Act specifies new rules of evidence in place of those developed by the common law.” 
        
       
      
    73 McHugh J said at [88]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, the plain words of Pt 3 of the Act indicate that the legislature intended to change the law with regard to complaint evidence … . The Act has made substantial changes to the law of evidence. Notwithstanding s 9, reference to pre-existing common law concepts will often be unhelpful.” 
        
       
      
    74 As finally enacted in the Evidence Acts of both the Commonwealth and New South Wales, there are a number of indications in the regime for tendency and coincidence evidence, found in Pt 3.6, that the Parliaments intended to lay down a set of principles to cover the relevant field to the exclusion of the common law principles previously applicable. 
     
      
    75 First, the change of terminology is itself significant. What is referred to as “coincidence evidence” was previously referred to as “similar fact evidence”. “Tendency evidence” was previously referred to as “propensity reasoning”. The use of different terminology with precise and comprehensive definitions, manifests an intention to state the principles comprehensively and afresh. 
     
      
    76 Specifically, the common law concept of “similar fact evidence” as variously applied in the case law, is not necessarily the same as the definition in s98(2) of “related events” in terms of events that “are substantially and relevantly similar” and occurring in circumstances which are “substantially similar”. 
     
      
    77 Furthermore, the express provisions for tendency evidence clarified the common law at the time of their introduction. The balance of authority was against extending the similar fact evidence principle to evidence which could be used only by way of propensity reasoning. (See e.g. Markby v The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 108 at 116; Perry v The Queen (1982) 150 CLR 580; Sutton v The Queen (1984) 152 CLR 528 at 533, 545-6, 556-7, 562-3; Pfennig at 480-1). Indeed, it was not until Pfennig itself that the admissibility of such evidence was established. In the Australian Law Reform Commission reports, the question of whether or not propensity reasoning should be permitted at all was very much in issue. (See e.g. Australian Law Reform Commission Report No. 26 Evidence: Interim Report, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra (1985), Vol. 1, pars 810 and 813; Australian Law Reform Commission Report No. 38 Evidence, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra (1987), par 176.) 
     
      
    78 It is also noteworthy that the Act provides a definition of “probative value”, as quoted above. Although the definition could well have been the same as at common law, the fact that such a term was defined at all suggests an intention to ensure consistency for purposes of the Evidence Act for the words, which appear in a number of different sections (see s135 and s137 quoted above). This suggests that the Act, even if substantially based on the common law, was intended to operate in accordance with its own terms. 
     
      
    79 By s94, the Act sets out the circumstances in which the tendency rule and coincidence rule do not apply, in a form not derived from any common law authority. 
     
      
    80 A novel system requiring notice was created by ss97(1)(a), 98(1)(a), 99 and 100. 
     
      
    81 Section 101 itself makes express provision for the situation in which tendency or coincidence evidence has first been adduced by the defendant in criminal proceedings. When that has occurred, the prosecution is permitted to adduce evidence to explain or contradict any such evidence. 
     
      
    82 Finally, s110 and s111 exclude the tendency rule in particular cases where evidence about character of an accused is adduced.  
     
      
    83 These various provisions indicate an overall intention to cover the relevant field in a comprehensive manner. 
     
      
    84 Of particular importance, however, is the formulation adopted in s101(2) requiring the probative value of tendency or coincidence evidence to “substantially outweigh” its prejudicial effect. The use of the word “substantially” is a legislative formulation, not derived from prior case law. Most significantly, it introduces a legislative formulation into the very territory which the majority judgment in Pfennig said was the function of the formulation adopted in that case. In the overall context of the significant changes made to the pre-existing common law to which I have referred above, I find this last consideration determinative. 
     
      
    85 It is in my view critical to note that the joint judgment in Pfennig identified the “no rational view” test as the means of determining how it is that probative force and prejudicial effect should be balanced against each other. The joint judgment in Pfennig said at 483: 
     
      
       
        
        “Only if there is no such view can one safely conclude that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.” 
        
       
      
    86 The joint judgment reiterated the same proposition at 483-484: 
     
      
       
        
        “That evidence, as has been said, will be admissible only if its probative value exceeds its prejudicial effect. But that statement, it seems to us, is of little assistance unless it is understood that the evidence sought to be admitted is circumstantial and as such raises the objective improbability of some event having occurred other than that asserted by the prosecution; in other words, that there is no reasonable view of the evidence consistent with the innocence of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    87 See also at 485 where their Honours refer to “the criterion of probative force as against prejudicial effect and thus of admissibility”. 
     
      
    88 The continued application of a “no rational view” test is not, in my opinion, consistent with a statutory test which expressly requires a balancing process and tilts that process in the same direction as that which the joint judgment in Pfennig suggested, but by the use of different terminology, i.e. “substantially”. 
     
      
    89 The reasoning in Pfennig applied the “no rational explanation” test to a common law principle that probative value outweighs prejudicial effect. That reasoning is, in my opinion, inapplicable to a statutory test that probative value substantially outweighs prejudicial effect. 
     
      
    90 The Parliament has sought to achieve the same general objective as that which Australian common law had developed by the time of Pfennig, but it did so by the use of precise and different terminology. His Honour was, in my opinion, correct to adopt and apply the terminology of the legislation, rather than the pre-existing common law test. 
     
      
    91 I find the following reasoning of McHugh J in Pfennig at 516 compelling: 
     
      
       
        
        “If evidence revealing criminal propensity is not admissible unless the evidence is consistent only with the guilt of the accused, the requirement that the probative value ‘outweigh’ or ‘transcend’ the prejudicial effect is superfluous. The evidence either meets the no rational explanation test or it does not. There is nothing to be weighed – at all events by the trial judge. The law has already done the weighing. This means that, even in cases where the risk of prejudice is very small, the prosecution cannot use the evidence unless it satisfies the stringent no rational explanation test. It cannot use the evidence even though in a practical sense its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect.” 
        
       
      
    92 His Honour’s judgment was a dissent. Nevertheless, this reasoning is directly apposite to the issue now before the Court, which is an issue of statutory construction. 
     
      
    93 It is one thing to determine that a common law test requiring balancing between different, indeed incommensurable, considerations, should be conducted in a particular way. It is quite another thing to say that statutory words should be given a construction which they are not capable of bearing.  
     
      
    94 The words “substantially outweigh” in a statute cannot, in my opinion, be construed to have the meaning which the majority in Pfennig determined was the way in which the common law balancing exercise should be conducted. The “no rational explanation” test may result in a trial judge failing to give adequate consideration to the actual prejudice in the specific case which the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh. 
     
      
    95 Section 101(2) calls for a balancing exercise which can only be conducted on the facts of each case. It requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion. (See R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at [20] per Sheller JA; F Bennion “Distinguishing Judgment and Discretion” [2000] Public Law 368.) The “no rational explanation” test focuses on one only of the two matters to be balanced – by requiring a high test of probative value – thereby averting any balancing process. I am unable to construe s101(2) to that effect. 
     
      
    96 My conclusion in relation to the construction of s101(2) should not be understood to suggest that the stringency of the approach, culminating in the Pfennig test, is never appropriate when the judgment for which the section calls has to be made. There may well be cases where, on the facts, it would not be open to conclude that the probative value of particular evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, unless the “no rational explanation” test were satisfied.  
     
      
    97 There are conflicting authorities in this Court. Nevertheless, the preponderance of authority is in favour of applying the Pfennig test by way of explication of the statutory formulation. That line of authority was, however, established before the High Court in Papakosmas clarified the correct approach to determining the relationship between the Evidence Act 1995 and the pre-existing common law. 
     
      
    98 In any event, I am satisfied, to the high degree necessary to refuse to follow earlier reasoning of this Court, albeit not unanimous and in benches constituted by three judges, that this line of authority is incorrect. 
     
      
    99 Since writing the above I have read the additional observations of Hidden and Buddin JJ. I do not agree with their Honours. In my opinion, the statutory formulation should operate in accordance with its terms. There is no need for an assumption that all such evidence is “likely to be highly prejudicial”, nor for guidance that the test for admissibility is “one of very considerable stringency”. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    100 The appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    101 SULLY J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    102 O’KEEFE J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    103 HIDDEN and BUDDIN JJ: We agree with the order proposed by the Chief Justice and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    104 We would add only this. Underlying the various formulations of the test for admission of similar fact or propensity evidence in the common law authorities is the recognition that evidence of that kind is likely to be highly prejudicial, and of the need to ensure that it is admitted only when the interests of justice require it. Its admission at common law is exceptional for reasons of policy, not of logic. These considerations should guide the balancing exercise required by the statutory provision, so that the test for admissibility under that provision remains one of very considerable stringency. 
     
      
    105 In practical terms, that will have the consequence that in many, if not most, cases the application of the common law and the statutory tests will produce the same result. The present case aptly demonstrates that point.

     REGINA v LAJOS SZABO 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal in relation to a sentence imposed upon the respondent following his trial at the Sydney District Court before Knight DCJ and a jury. He was convicted on a single count of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. Following his conviction he was sentenced to imprisonment for four years commencing on 14 March 2003 expiring on 13 March 2007, and a non-parole period of eight months was specified commencing on 14 March 2003 and expiring on 13 November 2003. It therefore follows that the first date of eligibility for release to parole of the respondent falls due in two days’ time. 
     
      
    2 The facts of the offence were serious indeed. The offence occurred on 25 April 2002. The victim was the respondent’s wife. They had been married for about thirty years and they had four adult children. The relationship between them was described as toxic and it appears that for some time prior to the offence they had lived relatively separate lives although under the same roof. 
     
      
    3 On 25 April which was of course Anzac Day, the respondent’s wife had been to the nearby shops and had visited some friends at a hotel. She came home at about 3.30pm. The respondent was at that time in the house and watching television in the main bedroom. It appears that he was watching a pornographic video display. The respondent’s wife put some clothes away and later decided to have a shower. She returned to the bedroom with a towel around her. As she went to get some underwear from her drawer she was attacked by the respondent. She screamed and there was a punching, kicking and scratching melee between the two of them. 
     
      
    4 The respondent had a cucumber in his hand. The evidence is not clear as to how this cucumber came to be in the bedroom. Nevertheless, he said something along the lines about his erection being gone, that his wife was going to “have this”. On two occasions he inserted this cucumber into his wife’s vagina. In his remarks on sentence the learned judge felt that it was unnecessary to recite matters of detail and, like him, I do not believe it is necessary to articulate all of the circumstances beyond repeating my conclusion that the circumstances of the offence were serious indeed. The respondent’s wife had to flee in a dressing gown without other clothing. She went to a neighbour and a telephone call was made for police assistance. 
     
      
    5 Those were the circumstances that gave rise to the offence charged by the indictment. The respondent pleaded not guilty but, as I have observed, he was convicted by the jury. The mere statement of the head sentence imposed and the non-parole period attached to it is capable of giving rise to surprise, to say the least. It therefore merits some investigation as to how the matter came to be dealt with in that fashion. 
     
      
    6 In his remarks on sentence the learned judge indicated that he had had reference to the statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales and he observed that after looking at those statistics he came to the conclusion that, in general terms, sentences for the particular offence tended to be imposed in the range of four to five years’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    7 As I have observed, he imposed a sentence of four years’ imprisonment. The somewhat surprising attached non-parole period was a matter that was canvassed during the sentencing proceedings. I will later turn to describe some matters relating to the respondent’s medical and physical condition, but in relation thereto in an exchange with counsel, his Honour made this observation,  
     
      
       
        
        “The real question is having regard to the nature of the offence, whether it is a case that could be dealt with by way of a suspended sentence. It seems to me really that that is the question that is posed for me in it. The other realistic alternative is to impose a sentence of imprisonment of a significant length but to have a comparatively short non-parole period, far shorter than would otherwise be the case to take into account the subjective factors, in particular his state of health.” 
        
       
      
    8 In due course his Honour came to the conclusion that a suspended sentence was inappropriate. In submissions on behalf of the Crown, counsel who appeared for the Crown in those proceedings but did not appear on the appeal, drew his Honour’s attention to the absence of contrition. This was evidenced not only by the absence of a plea of guilty, but in a Parole and Probation report tendered to his Honour where it appeared that the respondent continued to dispute his guilt of the offence. 
     
      
    9 The Crown Prosecutor pointed out that, so far as the respondent’s medical condition was concerned, his state of health at the time of the offence was the same as it was at the time that he appeared for sentence. The submission was made that the option of suspended sentence was inappropriate and the Crown Prosecutor then put that the only alternative would be full time custody. She said, 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown does not cavil with the special circumstances due to his health but not to the degree that the sentence would be lenient, in my respectful submission.” 
        
       
      
    10 Thus, as the matter was dealt with below, there was in effect a focus upon the specification of the non-parole period (perhaps to the exclusion of focus upon the length of sentence) in having regard to the respondent’s condition. His Honour made a specific finding concerning the respondent’s condition. He said,  
     
      
       
        
        “In my view in this case, imprisonment will be a greater burden on the offender by reason of his state of health and also I consider there to be a serious risk of imprisonment having a gravely adverse effect on the offender’s health. In that regard I rely on the last sentence of Dr Lacji’s report.”  
        
       
       
        
        “That sentence simply stated ‘in my opinion sentencing him to prison will have an adverse effect on his general health’ ”. 
        
       
      
    11 Despite the paucity of detail in that report there has been put before this court considerable material concerning the respondent’s state of health. It could be said that we are, particularly as to detail, far better informed than his Honour was at the time of the sentencing proceedings. From the exhibited medical reports attached to the affidavits of Susan Amy Barnes sworn 30 October 2003, 6 November 2003 and 7 November 2003, it can be observed that the respondent is awaiting bypass heart surgery. He has a tabulated set of conditions described as insulin-dependent diabetes, a condition which has affected him for some eighteen years, peripheral vascular disease, severe diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent foot ulcers and severe diabetic retinopathy. 
     
      
    12 An observation is made concerning his eyesight that a Professor Mitchell who is treating him in that regard, is not too optimistic that his eyes would be able to be “controlled”, even with treatment. In other reports his chronic renal failure is referred to. The treatment of his foot ulcer is noted. It can be observed that whilst in prison between 14 May and 10 October he seems to have been taken to clinics from the gaol on at least twelve occasions. It is probably an indication of the scope of the conditions affecting him that his present medication regime consists of the following: Panadeine Forte twice daily, Norflex 100 mg daily, Iscover 75 mg morning, Pravachol 40 mg morning, Coversyl 2mg morning, Polytears eye drops both eyes daily as required, Mixtard 30/70, 50 units morning and 36 units night, Omperazole 40 mg night, Lasix 80 mg daily, Imdur 60 mg daily, Cardizem 60 mg morning and night.  
     
      
    13 It is no understatement to say that the state of health of the respondent was correctly described at the proceedings below as appalling. Nevertheless, the crime is, as I have indicated, one that was extremely serious. It was noted by the trial judge that the applicant had no prior convictions and he was a man in his fifties. Nevertheless it was a violent, unprovoked assault in the domestic circumstances that I have described. 
     
      
    14 At the hearing the court raised the possibility of there being an error of principle discernible in a failure by the sentencing judge to take into account the medical condition of the respondent in setting the whole length of sentence rather than in simply focusing upon the non-parole period. That the respondent’s medical condition is relevant to the length of sentence is well-established law. See R v Vachalec [1981] 1 NSWLR at 351. That is not to say of course that it has not often been said that such a condition is relevant to the setting of a non-parole period. We were referred to R v Sellen (1991) 57 A Crim R 313. The relevant passage is at 318 which indicates that it was the view of the court,  
     
      
       
        
        “If it is shown that imprisonment will cause particular hardship (either because of a pre-existing physical or mental disability of the prisoner or because of the circumstances in which the prisoner must be kept for protection) this is a circumstance to be taken into account in determining the duration of imprisonment.” 
        
       
       
      Their Honours then referred to a number of authorities. 
      
    15 Duration of imprisonment would be taken to be a reference to length of sentence. Their Honours later said at (page 320) when proceeding to re-sentence in the particular case that it was their view that the prisoner then before them had established poor health and that this constituted special circumstances within s5(2) of the Sentencing Act as it then applied. 
     
      
    16 As I have said, there is ample authority that the condition of health of a prisoner can be relevant to the setting of a non-parole period. The remarks of Brennan and Dawson JJ in R v Griffith (1989) 167 CLR 372 where their Honours gave an offender’s health as an example of something that can be taken into account in setting a non-parole period was recited with approval by Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson [2001] 53 NSWLR 704 @ page 713. 
     
      
    17 Having made those observations, however, it seems to me that this court in this case should take account of the way that the matter was dealt with by both parties below. I have already indicated how his Honour’s observation was adopted to the extent that the Crown submitted that his Honour should not reduce the sentence or the non-parole period to one which was in effect overly lenient. 
     
      
    18 Thus, I turn to consider whether or not the specification of a non-parole period of eight months in this case was manifestly inadequate. In my view it clearly was, and was to an extreme extent. In the course of exchange with counsel it was pointed out that whilst the statute talks in terms of setting a non-parole period of seventy-five per cent of head sentence, in this case the specification was something less than twenty-five per cent thereof. This case in that respect bears a similar quality to that observed in the joint judgment of Justice Wood, the CJ at CL and Howie J in R v Royale [2003] NSWCCA 275. 
     
      
    19 In dealing then with a Crown appeal their Honours said in respect of the sentence, 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentence imposed was inadequate to a degree that would have justified interference by this court. In particular, the non-parole period was manifestly inadequate. It simply did not reflect the objective seriousness of the offence nor adequately denounce the respondent’s conduct and provide for general deterrence.” 
        
       
       
      That is entirely applicable to the present case. Further, their Honours said that the disparity between the head sentence imposed and the non-parole period specified could rarely, if ever, be justified in the regime under the Act which existed at the time by a proper application of sentencing principles. 
       
      
    20 Their Honours reminded us that the High Court had said as long ago as in Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 263 @ page 628,  
     
      
       
        
        “In a true sense the non-parole period is a minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing judge considers that the crime committed calls for such detention.” 
        
       
      
    21 In this particular case the specification of a non-parole period of eight months falls so far below what would be adequate to fulfil those requirements that it is in my view, as I have said, manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    22 This leads me to consider however what needs to be done in this case. I have already pointed out that the respondent’s first date of eligibility for parole falls due in two days’ time. I have touched upon the extent of his medical condition which is serious indeed. For my part I would be reluctant merely to increase the non-parole period and leave the head sentence where it is, because it seems to me that if my observation about the possible error of principle in setting the head sentence is correct, that would merely compound what might be an error. On the other hand, to deal with the matter by reducing the head sentence involves a number of factors including looking at whether or not such a reduction itself might need to involve a computation to avoid the possibility of what has been described as “double-dipping”. That is to say, the reduction of the head sentence would necessarily reduce the “statutory” proportion to be specified as a non-parole period and it would be “double-dipping” to reduce that again. 
     
      
    23 Having regard to all of those circumstances and in particular to the constant medical attention required by the applicant, I have come to the conclusion that although this sentence is manifestly inadequate, indeed grossly inadequate, that this is a case in which the residual discretion of this court to dismiss an appeal should be invoked. Before proposing such an order I would like to add and endorse what was said by Wood CJ at CL and Howie J in the judgment in Royale, which is in my view also applicable to this case.  
     
      
       
        
        “It should be made perfectly clear that the sentence imposed in the present case was wrong and the dismissal of the Crown appeal cannot be taken to suggest otherwise.” 
        
       
       
      I propose therefore that the Crown appeal be dismissed. 
       
      
    24 HODGSON JA: In my opinion the sentencing judge made an error of principle in that he did not take the state of health of the offender into account in setting the head sentence, although he did take it into account in fixing a non-parole period of one-sixth of the head sentence. The sentencing judge should have taken it into account in setting the head sentence; and if it was to be taken further into account as part of special circumstances in relation to the non-parole period, then to avoid double counting it could only justify a relatively modest adjustment of the non-parole period from the prima facie ratio. However, having regard to the way the case was conducted below and the submissions made on appeal, it would not be appropriate for this court to intervene on the basis of such an error of principle.  
     
      
    25 I agree with Mr Justice Grove that the non-parole period was inadequate to an extent that would justify the intervention of this court. I am also of the view that, if the court did intervene and re-sentence, the result would be a lower head sentence and a higher non-parole period. However, I also agree that the court in this case should exercise its discretion not to intervene. 
     
      
    26 HOWIE J: I agree with some reluctance and considerable hesitation to join with the other members of the Court in dismissing the appeal in the exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    27 In my respectful opinion, the sentencing exercise completely miscarried principally because of the submissions made by those appearing for the parties before his Honour who sought a course which in my opinion was simply not in accordance with proper sentencing principles. 
     
      
    28 It is unnecessary in the present case to determine the proper weight to be given to onerous prison conditions in determining special circumstances when that factor has already been taken into account, as it should be, in determining the appropriate length of the sentence as a whole. But a sentencing court should not lose sight of the purpose of finding special circumstances, that is in reducing the non-parole period or lengthening the parole period for some purpose other than simply to mitigate the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    29 Although as R v Simpson [2001] 53 NSWLR 704 makes clear, there is no limit to the factors that might be taken into account in finding special circumstances, and the illness of the offender as it impacts on the conditions of imprisonment is one of them, it does not necessary follow that such a factor will amount to special circumstances to further reduce the period to be served before the offender is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    30 The exercise of discretion in the present case is at the very margins of a proper exercise of the Court’s duty to do justice to the Crown as well as to the respondent. I generally agree with the remarks of both Justice Grove and the presiding judge. 
     
      
    31 HODGSON JA: The appeal is dismissed.

    CRIMINAL LAW – appeal – no question of principle  
     
     FACTS 
    The appellant was convicted of the deemed supply of not less than the commercial quantity of heroin and was sentenced to imprisonment.He appealed from his conviction on 10 grounds which included an allegation that his counsel at the trial had been so flagrantly incompetent that there had been a miscarriage of justice. He also challenged his sentence. HELD: Defence counsel had not been guilty of flagrant incompetence, the other grounds of appeal also failed, and the sentence was not out of the range and excessive.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY JA: In May 2000 the appellant stood trial before Sides DCJ and a jury on a charge of deemed supply on 7 December 1998 of not less than the commercial quantity of heroin based on his alleged possession of four quantities of that drug with a total weight of 260.4 grams. He was represented by Mr C J Watson of counsel instructed by Mr Steven Sukkar solicitor. He was convicted and after a further hearing was sentenced to seven years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years to date from 8 June 2000. 
     
      
    2 He has appealed against his conviction and sentence on 11 grounds set out in his amended notice of appeal of 4 August 2002. The grounds allege the wrongful admission of evidence (grounds 1, 2, 3, 4), misdirections of the jury (grounds 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), flagrant incompetence on the part of his counsel at the trial (ground 9) and that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory (ground 10). Ground 11 challenges his sentence. 
     
      
    3 The appellant, who remains in full-time custody, represented himself at the hearing. He gave affidavit evidence but was not cross-examined. His former solicitor, Mr Sukkar, also gave affidavit evidence in support of the appeal, and was cross-examined. The Crown filed an affidavit by his former counsel who was cross-examined. 
     
      
    4 The appellant alleges that inadmissible evidence was led by the Crown from the arresting police officers that his vehicle was stopped on Concord Road “as a result of information received”, that his vehicle was then searched “for weapons”, and that when two small packets of heroin were found during a body search he was asked whether they were for his “own personal use” (ground 1).  
     
      
    5 The evidence that the police acted on information received is commonly given in criminal trials and is not prejudicial. An unexplained stoppage of the appellant’s vehicle by police might well lead the jury to speculate, to his disadvantage, and evidence of a reasonable suspicion on their part which could justify stopping the vehicle would not have helped him either. 
     
      
    6 The search for weapons was presented as a routine precaution (Newton T 59). The appellant agreed to the search and no weapons were found. The transcript of the committal proceedings tendered by the appellant at the hearing of the appeal (T 135-7) included evidence that the police did not suspect that weapons would be found (Newton T 19). Evidence of the personal search and the discovery of the heroin, which was disputed by the appellant in his evidence, was relevant and admissible. The question asked of the appellant and his refusal to answer were also relevant and admissible. On the Crown case they were part of the police action following the arrest, and possession for personal use of these small quantities would not be a deemed supply.  
     
      
    7 The next matter relates to a question during the cross-examination of Federal Agent Sykes at the trial (ground 1). He was asked whether Detective Newton was the man in charge “in this investigation concerning Mr Shalala” (T 69-70). The appellant submitted that this would suggest to the jury that he had been the subject of a police investigation prior to his arrest. However the witness did not understand the question in this way because he said that Detective Newton had the carriage of the brief of evidence after the arrest. There were no further questions about any “investigation” of the appellant and the matter was never raised by the Crown. The use of this expression on an isolated occasion during a four day trial cannot cause or contribute to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    8 The consequential ground (ground 2) that the judge failed to direct the jury to disregard the evidence referred to in ground 1 necessarily fails.  
     
      
    9 On the day of his arrest the appellant had met a Mr Arthur Wan twice some hours apart first at Belmore Park at Central Railway and then at Burwood. As a result he came under electronic surveillance directed at Mr Wan. Following a voir dire hearing the judge ruled that the surveillance evidence, and evidence that the appellant had $1705 in currency notes in his possession at the time of his arrest was inadmissible. The Crown then led evidence from Detective Newton that the appellant had “a sum of money” in his possession when he was searched after his arrest. This evidence was not objected to at the trial (T 40) but the appellant now submits (ground 3) that it contravened the judge’s ruling. There is no substance in this point. Most adults leave home with money in their possession. 
     
      
    10 The appellant gave evidence at the trial and was cross-examined about his movements that day prior to his arrest. These questions were also said to contravene the judge’s ruling (ground 3) but again there is nothing in the point. The Crown case was based on circumstantial evidence. On its case a substantial quantity of heroin had been found in a blue plastic shopping bag in the front passenger side of the vehicle the appellant was driving. He denied all knowledge of the bag or its contents prior to his arrest. He had collected the car, which belonged to his girlfriend, at 10.30 that morning and had had the sole use of it until his arrest about 5.30. His movements after collecting the car were highly relevant in assessing the credibility of his denials.  
     
      
    11 Counsel for the appellant objected to questions about the meetings with Mr Wan but the judge held that they were relevant and admissible. The questions would not reveal that the appellant had come to notice because Mr Wan had been under electronic surveillance. Counsel was vigilant in objecting to questions that might contravene the judge’s ruling and some were disallowed (T 101, 103). The consequential ground (ground 4) that the judge should have directed the jury that such evidence could not be used to prove the case against the appellant must also fail. 
     
      
    12 Ground 5 asserted error by the judge in failing to direct the jury that they could not draw an inference of guilt from circumstantial evidence unless each individual fact relied upon by the Crown was proved beyond reasonable doubt. Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 establishes that the law is otherwise. 
     
      
    13 Ground 6 asserted error by the judge in failing to direct the jury that no adverse inference could be drawn from Commonwealth Bank deposit receipts for $500 shown in the video taken at the scene of arrest, at least one of which had the hand written date 7 December 1998. This matter was first raised by questions from the jury after they had retired to consider their verdict (T 30 11/5/00). After hearing counsel the judge directed the jury there was no evidence to establish who made the deposits, or where and that because the appellant had not been cross-examined about the receipts he had had no opportunity to explain the documents or answer the jury’s questions.  
     
      
    14 He also told them that it would be “highly dangerous and quite unfair for you to draw an inference adverse to the accused in relation to the bank deposit with a hand written date of 7 December 1998” (T 36). No re-direction was sought. The edited video was in evidence and the jury were entitled to draw inferences from it and of course the decision on all matters of fact was for the jury and not the judge. However the direction to the jury was the most favourable to the appellant that could properly be given and there was no error. 
     
      
    15 There is nothing in ground 7 which was based on the judge’s statement to the jury, following his voir dire ruling, that the video tape taken at the scene of the arrest would be shown to them in an edited form (T 21-2). He had earlier told them that not all of the tape was being tendered and if it could be fast-forwarded they might be shown the relevant portion later that day (T 21). The direction complained of did no more than keep the jury properly informed of the reason for their absence from the court and why they would not see the video until the following day. The directions were not prejudicial to the appellant. 
     
      
    16 Ground 8 alleged that the judge failed in his summing up to provide “a factual summation of the defence case”. The ground is without substance. The standard directions on onus, fact finding, circumstantial evidence and some discussion of the elements of the offence took up pp 1-13 of the summing up. The judge reviewed some of the evidence at pp 14-16. This included reference to an inconsistency in the police evidence highlighted by Mr Watson in his address (15), and a warning that the jury should scrutinise with great care the evidence from the police officers about what occurred while the appellant was in police custody because of the risk of fabrication (15-16).  
     
      
    17 The elements of the offence were then analysed in detail in relation to the facts of the case to highlight what the Crown had to prove without, at that stage, reminding the jury of how the Crown had attempted to do this (16-25). The judge then summed up the Crown case (25-27), and concluded with a summary of the case for the appellant (27-29). Counsel for the appellant did not seek a re-direction and Mr Sukkar did not criticise the summing up. Ground 8 fails because the summing up was balanced and fair. 
     
      
    18 Ground 9, which was the principal ground relied upon, alleged that the appellant’s counsel at the trial “was so flagrantly incompetent in his representation of the appellant there has been a substantial miscarriage”. The relevant principles were established by R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. 
     
      
    19 Paragraphs (a)-(f) of ground 9 repeat grounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 and do not require further consideration.  
     
      
    20 Paragraph (g) alleges that counsel did not properly prepare the case and failed to exploit the discrepancies in the evidence of the three police officers, their knowledge prior to the search of the appellant that a video was available in a police car nearby, and that he failed to notice the bank deposit receipts shown on the video. 
     
      
    21 The second and third of these matters are baseless. The availability of a video camera in one of the police vehicles and the failure of the police to use it to video the initial body search of the appellant were raised in the cross-examination of the police and counsel’s final address. Far from the matter being overlooked it was an important, if not central, part of the defence case that no heroin had been found on the appellant and that the police evidence in this respect was a fabrication. 
     
      
    22 The possible significance of the three bank deposit receipts was missed by the police, the Crown prosecutor, and the legal representatives of the accused. However the appellant, in accounting for his movements that day, failed to mention either in conference or in evidence his visit to the Commonwealth Bank to make this deposit or deposits assuming he made such a visit. He did give evidence about his need to send money to Western Australia to pay his son’s school fees and that he drove to Burwood for this purpose but was unable to send the money because the Burwood post office had closed for the day.  
     
      
    23 As the judge said, after the jury’s questions had drawn attention to this evidence, it gave rise to an inference adverse to the appellant which if drawn “is pretty telling because it goes to the heart of why it was and where he was at the time of his arrest … I mean it could be described as fatal” (T 32). The judge’s re-direction on this point was favourable to the appellant and represented the best possible outcome for him. If, as appears, he did make these deposits that day he should have told his counsel about them and referred to them in his evidence. If Mr Watson had noticed the date on these deposits he could have done nothing. Any attempt to have this part of the video edited out would only have drawn attention to these receipts and their significance. Prima facie they were admissible. The incident is not evidence of incompetence and it did not occasion or contribute to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    24 The remaining particular under para (f) is that counsel failed to appreciate the discrepancies in the evidence of the police officers as to their positions when the appellant and his vehicle were being searched. The appellant was represented at his committal by Mr Steirn SC who cross-examined the police on this issue. Federal Agents Sykes and Lester drew plans of the scene showing the position of the police and the accused in relation to the vehicles and these became exhibits 3 and 4 in the committal. These plans and the evidence of Detective Newton at the committal revealed discrepancies. 
     
      
    25 Mr Watson was aware of this evidence but decided to ignore it because he considered that the discrepancies were relatively minor and not significant. He considered, rightfully in my view, that the failure of the police to video the body search of the appellant, after the blue bag with the drugs had been found in the front of his vehicle, when there was a video only a few feet away, was a more credible basis for an attack on the prosecution case. 
     
      
    26 Even if this was a wrong tactical decision, it was an informed and deliberate one made in an endeavour to present the defence case in the best possible way. Any tactical error, if such there was, would not be evidence of flagrant incompetence. See TKWJ v The Queen (2002) 76 ALJR 1579. This allegation must be rejected.  
     
      
    27 Paragraphs (h) and (i) assert that counsel failed to investigate the appellant’s claim that police officers Lester and Newton had threatened him at Burwood Police Station with prosecution for possessing a commercial quantity of heroin unless he co-operated with their investigation of Mr Wan, and that counsel advised him not to give such evidence. 
     
      
    28 Mr Watson denied receiving such instructions (affidavit 16/7/02, T 2). Mr Sukkar’s affidavit (23/11/01) refers to events at Burwood Police Station but did not mention any threat of this character. He gave oral evidence on this issue (T 63, 66, 69 and 79) which was vague and unconvincing. However the decisive fact is that the appellant did not mention this matter in his written complaint to the Legal Services Commissioner made prior to 5 September 2000 which was referred that day to the Bar Association. The complaint was supported by 14 particulars of alleged incompetence, but this allegation was not mentioned. I am satisfied that it is a recent invention which must be rejected. 
     
      
    29 Paragraph (j) alleges that counsel should have investigated, prior to the trial, the reason why Detective Newton had left the police force and whether this was due to corruption. This is an absolutely hopeless point. There is no evidence that the appellant, his solicitor or his counsel knew that Detective Newton had left the police force before he gave evidence at the trial and said that he was then employed by the Australian Stock Exchange (T 39). One would expect this organisation to make appropriate inquiries before employing a former police officer and there is no evidence that investigations would have revealed anything to Mr Newton’s discredit. 
     
      
    30 Paragraphs (k) and (l) are incapable of establishing incompetence on the part of counsel. 
     
      
    31 Paragraph (m) asserts that counsel failed to establish that the drugs found in the vehicle and on the appellant, which did not carry the appellant’s fingerprints, did not carry the fingerprints of Detective Newton either although, according to the latter’s evidence, he had handled these items.  
     
      
    32 Detective Newton did not give evidence at the trial that he was wearing gloves when he handled these items but cross-examination on this issue would have led nowhere because he gave that evidence in the committal (T 30, 37). 
     
      
    33 Paragraphs (n) and (o) allege that counsel failed to fully explore why the boot of the appellant’s car was open and whether it was searched, so that the jury were left with an improper inference that the police may have found something there. The politest thing to say about these allegations is that if anything incriminating had been found in the boot evidence to this effect would have been led by the Crown. Since there was no such evidence the jury would naturally infer that nothing of significance was found. It was not suggested that the police did not search the boot and the video showed that it was open. Defence counsel addressed on this point (address T 16). 
     
      
    34 The final para alleges that counsel failed to explore the reason why Detective Newton’s official notebook did not record the discovery of heroin in the appellant’s pocket until after the video had been activated and the cash had been found. It seems that his previous counsel, Mr Steirn SC and Mr Wilkinson, did not think that these matters were significant because Mr Sukkar had not been asked to subpoena this notebook. There is no evidence that it was available at the trial or that Mr Watson had access to it. It was not tendered in this Court, and we have had no opportunity to assess the significance of the entries. This paragraph also fails. 
     
      
    35 Mr Sukkar’s affidavit and oral evidence asserted in substance that Mr Watson failed in cross-examination and address to challenge the police evidence that drugs were found on the appellant. This allegation is comprehensively refuted by the transcript of the trial, Mr Watson’s closing address and the summing up which demonstrate that this challenge was at the forefront of the defence. Mr Sukkar agreed that the appellant had never instructed him that the drugs found in the car had been planted by the police (T 68) and Mr Steirn SC specifically disavowed any such suggestion at the committal (T 16).  
     
      
    36 Mr Sukkar’s evidence in chief was to the general effect that Mr Watson had not conducted the defence in accordance with the appellant’s instructions and had failed to properly present his case. However this was contrary to his statement to the Bar Association. The report of the Professional Conduct Committee which was adopted by the Bar Council, was annexed to Mr Watson’s affidavit. This stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “20. The complainant’s solicitor, Steven Sukkar, reported that it was his observation that the barrister questioned the police evidence satisfactorily, and that the Filippetti defence was discussed by the complainant and the barrister and then put to the court. Mr Sukkar implies that the defence was put to the court as a result of agreement between the barrister and the complainant.” 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Sukkar agreed that he said this to the Bar Association, but claimed in his oral evidence that it was a lie, and he only said it to protect Mr Watson in the belief that whatever he said could not help the appellant. This admission discredits his evidence. His evidence in this Court has been given since his arrest on 5 December 2001 on a charge of being knowingly concerned with the importation of 123 kilos of amphetamine. He has been in custody, bail refused, ever since (T 98). 
     
      
    38 There are two other matters that should be mentioned. The appellant submitted that the evidence at the trial was that the blue plastic bag containing the bulk of the heroin was “tucked” or “squeezed” between the central console and the front passenger seat in the vehicle so as to be, in effect, out of his line of sight. Much time was spent on this issue but a careful reading and re-reading of the transcript of the trial has failed to reveal any reference to this bag being tucked or squeezed in this position. The judge in his ruling on the voir dire stated that “the drugs were found stuffed down between the passenger seat and the console” but the evidence on the voir dire did not support this statement. 
     
      
    39 The other matter relates to an inconsistency between the evidence given by Federal Agent Sykes during the voir dire on 9 May and his evidence in the trial given the following day. At T 17 during the voir dire he said that he was not present when the appellant’s car was pulled over, and when he arrived the appellant and the other two police officers were at the rear of the appellant’s vehicle. He said he did not see the initial search of the vehicle by Detective Newton, or the search of the appellant which revealed the presence of the cash and the two small packets of heroin. 
     
      
    40 On the other hand his evidence in chief given when he read his statement (T 64-5) and his evidence in cross-examination (T 65-7) was that when he arrived he saw the appellant and the police at the rear of the vehicle, that he saw Detective Newton enter the driver’s side of the vehicle, come back, and arrest the appellant. He then saw Detective Newton search the appellant and discover first the cash and then the heroin.  
     
      
    41 These inconsistencies were not explored in cross-examination. However similar inconsistencies between the evidence of this police officer at the trial and his evidence at committal were explored (T 66-7).  
     
      
    42 Mr Sukkar said in his oral evidence that the appellant noticed the inconsistencies between the evidence of this police officer on the voir dire and his evidence at committal and raised the matter with Mr Watson and himself during what must have been the lunch break that day. Neither he nor Mr Watson had picked them up (T 70-1, 102-6) but neither made any attempt to have the tape played back. 
     
      
    43 The appellant again raised this point after Agent Sykes had given evidence in chief in the trial but he was cross-examined about his inconsistent evidence at committal. This officer was called as a corroborating witness. The principal witnesses for the Crown were Agent Lester and Detective Newton. In his final address defence counsel relied on inconsistencies between the evidence of Agents Lester and Sykes (T 14) to discredit Lester. This was more important than discrediting Sykes.  
     
      
    44 The failure, if that it be, of defence counsel to extract the last ounce of advantage from the cross-examination of a Crown witness cannot establish incompetence, let alone flagrant incompetence and cannot constitute a miscarriage of justice. Agent Sykes was only a marginal witness and the appellant’s case would not have been greatly assisted if his evidence had been totally discredited. The better option was to use the evidence of Agent Sykes to discredit the evidence of Agent Lester. 
     
      
    45 Neither of these matters, which were not covered by the amended notice of appeal, have been established and ground 9 fails. 
     
      
    46 The appellant sought to support ground 10, that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory, on the basis of the matters covered by grounds 1-9. Legal error has not been established and there is nothing in the complaints and allegations of the appellant which required the jury to find that there was a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant. They saw and heard the police officers and the appellant giving evidence and being cross-examined. The case turned partly on the credibility of the police officers but principally on the credibility of the appellant, and in particular the credibility of his denials of any knowledge of the blue plastic bag and its contents. This was essentially a jury question. In my judgment the verdict was not unsafe or unsatisfactory and ground 10 fails. 
     
      
    47 Ground 11, that the sentence was excessive, is without merit. The judge found there were special circumstances and made an appropriate allowance. The sentence was otherwise well within the range established by the judicial statistics and properly reflected the objective criminality of the offence. 
     
      
    48 The appeal therefore fails on all grounds and must be dismissed. The exhibits from the trial and committal may be returned to the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions.

     REGINA v Bruce ROBERTS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
      
      
    1 LEVINE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J and with his reasons therefor. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: On 17 April 2002 the applicant pleaded guilty before Acting Judge Stewart to three counts on an indictment: the first count being an offence of buggery committed with LH between 1 January 1972 and 31 December 1972; the second, an offence of buggery with DB between 1 January 1976 and 31 December 1977; and the third, an offence of indecent assault on GS between 1 January 1976 and 31 December 1977. The maximum penalty for the offence in each of the first two counts was 14 years imprisonment and, for the offence in the third count, 5 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 The indictment came to be formulated in this way as a result of an agreement reached between the Crown and the defence. The applicant had been convicted after trial of seven offences against DB. Judge Stewart sentenced him for those matters on 9 February 2001. Those convictions and the accompanying sentences were quashed on appeal. At the time that the Crown was preparing to reindict the applicant with the original seven counts, there were a further eight charges of a similar nature, relating to two other complainants, then before the Local Court. The agreement between the parties was that, if one of the original counts and two of the new charges were placed on an indictment, the applicant would plead guilty to those three charges and ask that the remaining matters be dealt with under s 33 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As a result of this being done, there was before his Honour a Form 1 containing twelve matters relating to sexual offences committed on the three victims named in the indictment between 1971 and 1978. These matters were to be taken into account when the applicant was sentenced for the first count on the indictment. 
     
      
    4 On 7 March 2003, Judge Stewart sentenced the applicant as follows: in respect of count 1, and taking into account the Form 1 matters, imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years; in respect of count 2, 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years; and, in respect of count 3, a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months. The sentence for count 2 was cumulative on the sentence in respect of count 1. The sentences for the first and third counts were to commence on 17 October 2000 and the sentence for the second count is to commence on 17 October 2006. The overall sentence imposed was, therefore, imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of 10 years, the applicant being eligible for release to parole on 16 October 2010. 
     
      
    5 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant had little prospect of rehabilitation. 
         
         
        2. The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the Form 1 offences. 
         
         
        3. The sentencing judge erred in failing properly to take into account the sentence imposed on the applicant in 1979. 
         
         
        4. The sentencing judge erred in failing properly to take into account sentencing patterns at the time the offences were committed. 
         
         
        5. The sentencing judge erred in failing properly to take into account the applicant’s subjective circumstances. 
         
         
        6. The sentencing judge failed properly to discount the sentence imposed by reason of the pleas of guilty. 
         
         
        7. The sentencing judge erred in imposing a wholly cumulative sentence in respect of count 2. 
         
         
        8. The sentencing judge erred in failing to reflect his finding of “special circumstances” in the sentence imposed in respect of count 1. 
         
        
       
      
    6 The first count and three of the matters on the Form 1 related to LH, who at the time of the offences was aged eight or nine years. The offences were committed between 1971 and 1973 when the applicant was in his early twenties. The matters on the Form 1 comprised two indecent assaults and the commission of an act of indecency. It is unnecessary to set out the facts of the matters in detail. The statement of facts contained the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The [applicant] took [LH] along with other boys of similar age to the circus, roller skating, motor bike riding and treated them with ice cream and food. When at the [applicant’s] home he would engage in playful activity with the boys which involved physical contact. 
        
       
      
    7 The second count and six matters on the Form 1 related to DB who at the time of the offences was aged 7 or 8 years. The offences were committed between 1976 and 1978. The matters on the Form 1 involved an offence of buggery, three indecent assaults, and an assault. The assault related to an incident in which the applicant administered ether to the complainant. These charges arose from complaints made by DB in 1997 after he saw the applicant in Queensland in company with a young child. 
     
      
    8 The third count and three matters on the Form 1 related to GS who was aged seven or eight years at the time of the offences. The offences were committed between 1976 and 1978 when the applicant was aged between 25 to 26 years. The matters on the Form 1 involved an indecent assault, procuring an act of indecency and an assault. The applicant was arrested for these offences on 31 July 2000. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was aged 52 years at the date of sentence. He has a record that relevantly includes two offences of buggery and two offences of attempted buggery. The applicant was sentenced in January 1979 to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months for the offences of buggery. In November 1983 he was placed on a Griffith remand for an offence of attempted buggery. In June 1984 he was placed on a bond for 5 years for an offence of attempted buggery. Since that date the applicant has only one offence recorded against him for shoplifting in June 1998 for which he was fined. 
     
      
    10 The applicant has a severe hearing disability apparently arising from his employment for a number of years as a welder. He was described by his Honour as “almost stone deaf” but he can participate in conversations with the assistance of hearing aids. He is otherwise generally in fair physical health but does suffer from arthritis and migraine. He has been in custody since October 2000 and has been held in protection because of threats of attacks upon him as a result of the nature of the offences he committed. 
     
      
    11 A psychiatric report was prepared in May 2002 at the request of the District Court. The applicant told the psychiatrist that his last sexual relationship with a male child was in 1982. He had a history of anxiety and depression that was then under control by the use of medication. The psychiatrist noted that, although statistics suggested that persons such as the respondent had a significantly high risk of re-offending, the risk could be diminished by psychological, or if necessary, pharmacological intervention. 
     
      
    12 A psychologist, Mr Diment, in May 2002 reported that the applicant suffered from long-standing depression and anxiety that would require “appropriate psychiatric monitoring”. He was said to be “at strong risk of suicide”. The psychologist found him to be remorseful for what he had done. The applicant reported being assaulted in gaol in 1982 and he was fearful of further assaults while in prison. The report contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The applicant] has had a difficult life, sustaining a head injury while very young, resulting [in] long-term learning difficulties and physical abuse at the hands of an alcoholic father. Dr Walker's report is enlightening in this regard and she has assessed his cognitive functioning as somewhat below average…`he has chronically low self-esteem and suffers episodes of Major Depression with strong suicidal impulses. In clinical presentation he is simple and childlike and he is ill-equipped to cope alone in the adult world.’ he has looked to long-term counselling and involvement with community support programs and the Salvation Army for direction and support………… 
        
       
       
      The reference to “ 
      Dr Walker's report 
      ” is a reference to a report prepared on 6 December 2000 and which was before Judge Stewart when he originally sentenced the applicant. 
       
      
    13 The sentencing remarks by Judge Stewart were brief on this occasion but his Honour annexed to his remarks the agreed statement of facts and his sentencing remarks given when he sentenced the applicant following the earlier trial. His Honour stated during the course of the more recent remarks on sentence; 
     
      
       
        
         
        I have taken account of the sentencing principles of deterrence, denunciation and protection of the public, and of course prospects of rehabilitation. In the case of this offender there is, I am sad to say, little prospect of rehabilitation. He is a predator who either does not know the harm he has caused or does not want to know; but like-minded people must be deterred, and the public, particularly vulnerable children, must be protected. 
        
       
       
      
    14 This passage of the sentencing remarks gives rise to the first ground of appeal. The argument in support of this ground, at its simplest, is that his Honour was in error in using the words “he is a predator” to describe the applicant at the date of sentencing in 2003, when the evidence was that the applicant had not committed any like offence since 1982. The complaint has merit. True it is that there was little evidence to indicate that the applicant would be rehabilitated in the sense that he might receive treatment of some kind or other to avoid committing offences against young boys. Further, there was little true contrition or insight into his behaviour. Although the applicant had expressed remorse to Mr Diment, much of his concern seemed to be for himself and his mother. 
     
      
    15 However, the evidence was that his avoidance of offending over the last two decades was because of his fear of gaol and the threat of further violence as he suffered in 1982. The court is not so concerned with why a person is unlikely to re-offend in the future: it may be because the offender has reformed by the date of sentence, or because the person has good prospects of rehabilitation. Or it might be, as in the case of the applicant, a fear of being caught and returned to prison which is so strong that it overcomes his impulses to offend. The important point was that the offender is unlikely to re-offend and the sentence had to reflect this undisputed fact. 
     
      
    16 The material before his Honour should have led to a finding that there was little, or no, need for specific deterrence in determining the appropriate sentence. Nor did the applicant himself any longer pose a threat to the public so that it was unnecessary to impose a sentence that contained an element of preventative detention. However, his Honour was, with respect, correct insofar as he recognised that there was still a need to both denounce the applicant’s conduct and to provide for general deterrence. The ground of appeal is made out. 
     
      
    17 Senior Counsel for the applicant abandoned the second ground during the course of oral submissions. 
     
      
    18 There is no merit in the next two grounds which deal with the relevance of the applicant’s prior convictions and the sentences imposed in 1979 and 1982. The third ground was not pressed during argument. The fourth contends that the sentences can be taken as examples of the type of sentences imposed at the time of the applicant’s offending and indicate that the sentences imposed by Judge Stewart were manifestly excessive by that standard. But the Court knows nothing about the facts or circumstances surrounding those offences or the applicant’s subjective features at the time of sentence. For example, it may be the case that, in determining not to impose a gaol sentence in 1983, one of the matters taken into account by the court was the fact that the applicant had been assaulted in custody prior to the sentence being imposed. Nothing can be gleaned from these sentences as to the pattern of sentencing at the time the present offences were committed. 
     
      
    19 The Crown produced to the Court a treatise entitled Sentencing Sex Offenders in New South Wales, An Interim Report by Ivan Potas and published by the Australian Institute of Criminology in July 1977. In respect of the offence of buggery, the following was stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As with rape, the offence of buggery may attract heavy custodial sentences. Generally, where the offender has committed the offence by the use of considerable force or violence, he may expect sentences in excess of 5 years, even though the maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years' penal servitude………….. 
         
         
        Data Analysis 
         
         
        Although, like rape, custodial sentences are commonly imposed for this offence, unlike rape a large proportion of convicted offenders are released on recognizance………. The following Table also indicates the sentences imposed on persons who were brought before the Higher Criminal Courts for this offence. However, as the sample is small, only a very general trend may be inferred from the statistics. 
        
       
       
      The Table reveals that, of the 11 cases analysed for offences of buggery and bestiality dealt with in 1975, four persons received a recognizance, one received a sentence of imprisonment of between six months and one year, two persons received sentences of imprisonment of between two years and five years, and two persons received sentences of imprisonment of more than 5 years. The author noted that one explanation for the fact of the few cases coming before the courts was that the offence might involve little or no violence, especially where the offence was committed between consenting males. 
       
      
    20 In my view the statistical information available cannot assist in determining what sentences might have been imposed upon the applicant had he been before a court for the offences for which he was sentenced by Acting Judge Stewart shortly after the offences were committed. In those circumstances it is necessary to approach the matter in the way that I suggested in R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at 511 and which was approved by this Court in R v MJR (2002) 130 A Crim R 481 at [107] by Sully J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed). I said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender for the particular crime committed. Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence: ………………… , and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed:………………….. . Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence. 
         
         
        When sentencing an offender for offences committed many years earlier and where no sentencing range current at the time of offending can be established, the Court will by approaching the sentencing task in this way effectively sentence the offender in accordance with the policy of the legislature current at the time of offending and consistently with the approach adopted by sentencing courts at that time."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    21 This ground will thus be determined by a consideration of the length of the sentences imposed having regard to the maximum penalty, the subjective circumstances of the offender and the requirement of punishment notwithstanding the lengthy period of time that has expired since the offences were committed. As I have determined that there is an error disclosed in his Honour’s remarks, it is unnecessary to determine this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    22 The fifth ground of appeal asserts that his Honour did not give full regard to the applicant’s subjective circumstances. Senior Counsel for the applicant at the hearing of the appeal admitted that “this was a difficult ground”. In effect the argument was that, by reason of the applicant’s strong subjective case and the length of time that had passed since the commission of the offences, there was little need for the sentence to do other than act as a general deterrent and in that regard the applicant was not a suitable person upon whom to impose a sentence to achieve that purpose. 
     
      
    23 One of the difficulties for the applicant in succeeding on this ground is that Acting Judge Stewart set out the applicant’s subjective case at length in his earlier sentencing remarks and, in particular, stressed the difficulties for the applicant in serving a sentence of imprisonment in light of his physical disabilities. But at the end of the day, this ground cannot be resolved simply by a consideration of the sentencing remarks. If there is error, as asserted, it will be manifest in a sentence which this Court finds to be unjustifiably severe having regard both to the seriousness of his criminal conduct and his subjective circumstances. In my view the sentence is excessive for reasons that will become apparent shortly. 
     
      
    24 The sixth ground asserts that his Honour failed to give sufficient discount for the plea of guilty, particularly so far as the first offence on the indictment was concerned. In respect of the offences against LH he had pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. Again the answer to this ground must be found in an evaluation of the sentences because his Honour did not indicate what discount, if any, he was giving for the pleas, at least by reason of their utilitarian benefit. However, his Honour mentioned the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty and the pleas were not likely to have been overlooked given that his Honour was concerned at one stage as to whether he should accept them in light of the applicant’s subsequent denial of guilt. The applicant did ultimately confirm his guilt of the offences personally before the court and Judge Stewart proceeded to accept and act upon the pleas. 
     
      
    25 Counsel for the applicant contended that his client was entitled to a discount of 25 per cent in respect of the first and third counts and about 10 percent in respect of the second count. 
     
      
    26 At one stage in his remarks his Honour referred to a discount of 25 per cent that he was applying to the sentence. But this seems to me to have been in the context of the fact that the applicant was going to serve his sentence on protection and because of the added difficulties for him caused by his hearing problems. Why his Honour should indicate a discount for those matters but not for the pleas of guilty, is not clear to me. His Honour’s method of determining the sentence in this regard is also inconsistent with the line of authority against a two-step approach to sentencing; that is where the court quantifies the discount being allowed for subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    27 A nice question arose in argument on the hearing of the appeal as to how a court applies a discount to the sentence for an offence in respect of which matters are being taken into account. On one view the sentence for the offence should be determined and then the discount applied: on another view the discount should be applied to the sentence for the principal offence and then the matters on the Form 1 taken into account. It is unnecessary, in my view, for present purposes to resolve that question, if it is one of practical significance, which I doubt. Whatever mathematics are applied, it is the result that is important and at the end of the day the sentence must perform the functions required of it in endeavouring to fulfil the multiple, and sometimes competing, policy considerations. 
     
      
    28 The Crown conceded that no discount appears to have been applied in sentencing for the second offence on the indictment but relied upon his Honour’s statement that he was granting a 25 per cent discount in answer to the ground of appeal so far as the other two counts are concerned. As I have indicated, I do not believe that what his Honour said about a discount related to the pleas of guilty. If his Honour had given a 25 percent discount for the plea of guilty to the first count and a discount of the same magnitude by reason of the onerous conditions of the applicant’s custody, his Honour must have started with a sentence close to, if not exceeding, the maximum penalty. This ground has been made good. 
     
      
    29 The seventh ground is that his Honour erred in imposing a wholly cumulative sentence for count 2. In my opinion this ground has been made out. One of the difficulties in the present matter was that the Crown elected to put all the matters to be taken into account on the one schedule to the Form 1 and asked that the matters be taken into account in respect of the first count. This approach was taken regardless of the fact that there were three different complainants involved, three different sets of offences and there was a count referable to each of the complainants on the indictment. That situation made it difficult for his Honour to sentence in a logical and appropriate manner. By proceeding in that way, the Crown caused an overlap between the offences on the indictment which would not have occurred had their been three separate Forms 1, one in respect of each complainant. As his Honour was taking into account serious offences in respect of DB on the Form 1 in sentencing for the offence in count 1, it seems to me to have been inappropriate to make a wholly cumulative sentence for count 2 which related to an offence against DB. In my view the manner in which the Crown proceeded by taking all matters on the one Form 1 was illogical and inappropriate. The practice, if there is one, should be discontinued. Senior Counsel for the Crown on the hearing of the appeal conceded as much. 
     
      
    30 In my opinion the sentences are manifestly excessive having regard to the pleas of guilty and the subjective circumstances of the applicant. The sentences for the first and second counts were excessive in themselves even before they were totally accumulated. 
     
      
    31 The last ground is that his Honour failed to reflect his finding that there were special circumstances in the over-all non-parole period specified. His Honour found special circumstances by reason of the fact that the applicant was to be held in protective custody and that the sentences were to be cumulative. However, the total non-parole period is 77 per cent of the total head sentence. I do not believe that this is the result intended and I assume that the sentencing judge has failed to have regard to the necessity of adjusting the non-parole period on the cumulated sentence to ensure that at least the statutory relationship is preserved unless the judge intends to fix a non-parole period of more than 75 per cent. 
     
      
    32 There would be a strong argument to support a finding that in the present case there are no special circumstances. As his Honour found, there was no likelihood of rehabilitation but none was required in order to ensure that the applicant would not re-offend. Although the applicant was being held in protective custody, that fact had been taken into account in reducing the sentence by 25 per cent. To reduce the non-parole period to again reflect that fact and the applicant’s hearing difficulties would be to double discount for those matters. I do not accept the applicant’s submission that such matters are primarily to be reflected in the non-parole period. They are principally to be taken into account in fixing the overall sentence because, firstly, the offender may have to serve the whole of the sentence imposed, and, secondly, because by reducing the overall sentence, the non-parole period will also be reduced: see R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299. While the applicant was, by reason of his protective status, deprived of participation in courses, and that fact in many cases will result in a finding of special circumstances, it was of little relevance in the present case because the applicant had little prospect of being assisted by any course that might otherwise have been available to him. 
     
      
    33 However, a finding of special circumstances was made and the Court should give the applicant the benefit of that finding. But the reduction in the non-parole period should not be substantial otherwise the minimum term that the applicant is to serve as punishment for his crimes might fail to reflect the objective seriousness of the offences he committed. 
     
      
    34 In redetermining the sentences to be imposed upon the applicant I have taken into account the matters of aggravation and mitigation set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    35 I propose that the following orders be made: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The application for leave is granted, the appeal allowed and the sentences for the first and second counts are quashed. 
         
        2. The applicant is sentenced for the first count, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, to imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. The sentence is to commence on 17 October 2000. The non-parole period expires on 16 April 2005. 
         
        3. The applicant is sentenced on the second count to imprisonment for 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. The sentence is to commence on 17 October 2004 and the non-parole period expires on 16 April 2007 the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
        
       
       
      It is intended by these orders to impose a total sentence of 9 years 6 months to date from 17 October 2000 and an overall non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months from the same date. 
       
      
    36 SMART AJ: I agree with Howie J.

     Judgment 
    1 The Court: On 21 February 2001, the appellant was convicted by a jury of the charge of murdering Trevor Climpson (the deceased) on 8 January 1988. This was his third conviction for that offence, the two previous convictions having been set aside after successful appeals to this Court. Simpson J sentenced the appellant to 10 years and 10 months imprisonment, commencing on 20 February 2001, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 10 months to expire on 19 December 2007. The appellant appeals against both the conviction and sentence.2 Thirteen grounds of appeal are relied upon by the appellant in respect of his conviction for murder. These relate to the admissibility of evidence and the contents of the summing up. There is no ground of appeal asserting that the conviction was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
      THE CROWN CASE 
       
      
    3 The Crown case was that the appellant was either the person who inflicted one or more of the bullet wounds to the deceased or, alternatively, was present at the time of the shooting, aiding or encouraging the person responsible for inflicting the wounds. It was a circumstantial case based upon the following categories of evidence: the opportunity of the appellant to be present at the time of the killing; motive; inclination; evidence linking the appellant to weapons associated with the killing; and behaviour evidencing a consciousness of guilt. In the last category of evidence there were three sub-categories: five instances of lies; the concealment of weapons; and statements of the appellant in a telephone call.4 In light of the grounds of appeal filed on behalf of the appellant, the facts can be stated relatively briefly. The deceased had been married to the appellant’s sister, but had left her approximately 5 weeks prior to his death. He had then moved into a caravan with his son, Ian Climpson, on a property where the deceased worked, known as the “Plough and Harrow”.5 At about 10.58 pm on 8 January 1988, the police attended 2 Villiers Road, Cecil Park, the property where the deceased had previously resided with his wife and where she was still living after their separation. The deceased had apparently been shot dead and was lying in a crouched position beside the open door of his vehicle. The police searched the house on the property and retrieved a number of firearms. 6 The next day, the police recovered a .38 calibre spent projectile on the ground near where the deceased’s head had been lying. They also located a .22 calibre Winchester fired cartridge near the door of a shed, not far from where the deceased’s body had been found. When the deceased’s body was searched at the morgue, a .22 revolver was located in his pocket. The revolver contained four unfired and two fired .22 calibre Winchester cartridges.7 A post-mortem examination of the deceased revealed that he had sustained three bullet wounds: a wound to the back of the head above and behind the ear; a wound to the left loin; and a wound to the left chest under the collar bone near the fourth rib. A .38 calibre projectile was recovered from the left chest area. All three wounds were potentially fatal, although the wound to the left loin would not have caused immediate death. Due to the amount of blood in the chest cavity, it is possible to infer that the wound to that area of the body was the first wound inflicted upon the deceased.8 The wounds to the deceased’s head and chest were the same size and were consistent with having been caused by a .38 or .357 calibre projectile. The wound to the loin area was larger and was consistent with having been caused by a .22 calibre projectile. Although two .38 projectiles were recovered, the police were unable to locate a .22 projectile, notwithstanding an intensive search of the yard at 2 Villiers Road on 18 January. 
     
      
      (a) Opportunity of the appellant 
       
      
    9 On 21 January 1988, the police attended the premises of the appellant at Boggabilla Road, Moree. A search of the premises failed to locate any firearms. During the course of a recorded interview following the search, the appellant said that on 8 January he had attended his sister’s home at Villiers Road and returned home at about 6 pm. He had stayed with his father until later that evening when he left to purchase some cigarettes from a vending machine. He was, however, unsuccessful in doing so as there had been a blackout in the area. He ended up driving to the Villiers Road property, arriving there at approximately 10.10pm. At the property he encountered Deborah Dickson, who told him that his sister was asleep. The appellant gave evidence that he subsequently left the property and returned to his home, after having stopped at a hotel at approximately 10.30 pm to purchase cigarettes (after power had been restored). 10 The appellant told the police that he used to own two rifles, including a .22, but that he had sold them the previous year. He denied ever having owned a pistol.11 Deborah Dickson, who kept horses at 2 Villiers Road, gave evidence that she had arrived at the property at approximately 7pm on 8 January. A storm arose and she stayed in the house with the deceased’s wife and another woman until such time as the storm passed. She left the property at about 9.45pm, at which time it was still raining. As she walked to her vehicle, she saw the appellant drive his vehicle up the driveway. They greeted one another as she passed by his vehicle. She then entered her vehicle and drove away from the property.12 Kathleen Lancaster gave evidence that the appellant left her premises at around 10.30 pm and drove off towards the “Plough and Harrow”. She said that it took approximately 10 minutes to drive from her house to 2 Villiers Road, a distance of 4.8 kilometres.13 The appellant’s son, Adam Fowler, gave evidence that on the night in question the appellant had not returned home by the time he retired to bed at 11pm. That evidence, however, is in issue, as one of the grounds of appeal in the present case relates to her Honour’s comments about Adam Fowler’s evidence in summing up. Therefore, we will return to consider his evidence in more detail when considering that ground of appeal.  (b) Motive and inclination 
     
      
    14 The Crown called Ronald Doran, a one-time friend of the appellant, to give evidence. The witness proved unfavourable to the Crown and the trial judge granted leave to the Crown under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine him in relation to a statement he made to the police in December 1992 about events in 1986, two years before the shooting. In his statement, Mr Doran said that the appellant had spoken to him about the deceased in 1986. His statement went on:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “Fowler and I were talking and he started telling me about what a prick his brother-in-law was and that he was giving his sister a hard time. He said, “I’ve had a gutful of him and he has got to go”. He said his sister rang him up all the time complaining about her husband treating her badly.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Doran told the police that the appellant had complained on numerous occasions about the trouble the deceased was causing his sister. These conversations occurred after the appellant had spoken to his sister. He said that the appellant was in general a placid sort of person and that each time he was in a state of agitation, the cause appeared to be his brother-in-law or his sister. 
       
      
    15 Mr Doran also told the police that the appellant had said that he was going to shoot his brother-in-law. He said that the appellant asked him to drive his car and pick him up “after he had done the job”, for which the appellant offered him “10 grand”. He also told the police that when he suggested to the appellant that he would get caught, the appellant replied, “No way. I’ll use hot ice and it will melt”. He also said that the appellant told him he was going to Sydney “to do something with his brother-in-law” but that he understood from the appellant that his brother-in-law had gone away and that nothing had happened. When the police asked Mr Doran whether the appellant had discussed plans about how he would kill his brother-in-law, he replied, “A couple of ideas. One with hot ice and the other with a .22 rifle and silencer”.16 There is a ground of appeal relating to the admission of this evidence and the directions given by her Honour in relation thereto, hence we will return to this evidence in more detail later.17 The appellant’s ex-wife, Noella Harb, gave evidence that the appellant’s sister had rung at some unspecified time and was “quite upset and hysterical almost”. Ms Harb passed the phone to the appellant. Later he told her that his sister was very upset and that the deceased had been abusing her. The appellant “was quite upset at the time as well”. The appellant told her that the deceased had been drugging his sister and that “she was being injected or it was being put in her tea”. (c) Evidence linking the appellant with the alleged murder weapons18 On 19 September 1990, the police searched the appellant’s premises at Boggabilla Road. They located a .22 calibre Sterling rifle with a telescopic sight between the mattress and the base of the bed in the front bedroom. This weapon became Exhibit E in the trial. The appellant’s nephew, Bradley Walsh, who was living in the premises and apparently occupying that room, said that he owned the rifle. At the trial it was an agreed fact that Bradley Walsh’s statement was untrue and that he did not in fact own the rifle.19 Ian Climpson, the deceased’s son, gave evidence that Exhibit E was one of two .22 calibre rifles owned by the deceased and kept in the bedroom at 2 Villiers Road. The .22 calibre cartridge located by the police in the yard of that property was discharged from that weapon. However, evidence was given that both .22 rifles owned by the deceased had been fired regularly in the yard in order to ward off unwanted visitors including stray dogs. The ballistics expert was unable to indicate how long the cartridge had been exposed to the elements. There was also evidence as to the varying factors that would impact upon the distance travelled by a fired cartridge when ejected from such a rifle.20 The appellant was present while the police were searching the lounge room of the premises at Boggabilla Road. After he left the room, the chair in which he had been sitting was searched and a sawn-off .357 Armi Jager pistol was found in the cushion. This weapon became Exhibit K in the trial. According to the police, the appellant said that the pistol had been left two or three months earlier by a truck driver, whose name he did not know. In his unsworn statement at the trial, the appellant denied having said this to the police. He told the jury that he had refused to answer police questions at that time.21 Following the search, the police interviewed the appellant and a typed record was made of the interview. According to the recorded interview, the appellant confirmed having told the police that the Armi Jager pistol had been left on the premises by a truck driver who was to have collected it on his return from Brisbane. The appellant denied ever having fired it. In respect of the .22 Sterling rifle, the appellant told police that it belonged to Bradley Walsh and denied having fired it also. The appellant signed each page of the typed record of the interview. At the conclusion of the interview, the Inspector in charge of the police station at the time spoke to the appellant and confirmed that he had made the record and signed the interview of his own free will. The appellant completed and signed a form to this effect.22 In his unsworn statement at the trial, the appellant told the jury that the police fabricated the type-recorded interview and threatened that his house, which was for sale at the time, would be ripped apart and his yard dug up if he did not sign it. He said that he had not read the interview because he did not have his glasses with him. He also did not read the form that he signed in front of the police inspector.23 On 11 October 1990, the appellant was arrested for the murder of Trevor Climpson. He maintained his right to silence at that time. On 12 October 1990, a further search was conducted of the appellant’s premises. The police found in the freezer chest a box containing three .357 Magnum cartridges and seven .38 special calibre PMC cartridges. The evidence was that the box was damp but not frosted, as were other items contained in the freezer. A ballistics expert gave evidence that these cartridges were all suitable for use in the Armi Jager pistol, Exhibit K.24 On 21 September 1993, the police once more searched the premises at Boggabilla Road. They located a bullet hole in the floor and recovered a projectile from under the house. Evidence was given at the trial that the projectile had been fired from the Armi Jager pistol.25 A substantial part of the Crown case at the trial was concerned with proving that the appellant was in possession of the Armi Jager pistol found in the chair. The Crown’s case was that this pistol and the .22 Sterling rifle found in the bed at Boggabilla Road were the weapons used to shoot the deceased. However, neither of those weapons could be positively identified as those which fired the projectiles inflicting the fatal wounds.26 Noella Harb gave evidence that the appellant had bought a couple of pistols during their married life. She could not remember exactly when they had been purchased, but said that at the time, their son (who was born in 1986) was a baby and still wearing nappies. She described the pistols as a “475 magnum or 357 Magnum, the one that Clint Eastwood uses”. She did not recognise the Armi Jager pistol (Exhibit K). She said that the appellant used to keep his rifles under the bed and she believed that she had seen a weapon similar to the .22 Sterling rifle (Exhibit E). 27 Ronald Doran, in his statement to police made in 1992, described the appellant’s weapons at the relevant time as being a Ruger mini 14 rifle, a .223, a .22 rifle with a scope and a .222 rifle with a scope. He told police that he had never seen the appellant with a handgun.28 Michael Clarke gave evidence that in 1987 the appellant used to come to his property to shoot feral animals. The appellant used a .223, being a Ruger mini 14 semi-automatic rifle, a .222 bolt action rifle and, on occasions, a .22 rifle. He also saw the appellant with two pistols, one of which the witness described as an Uberti six-shot revolver but which he identified as the Armi Jager pistol (Exhibit K). He said he was confident that it was the appellant’s weapon because of a white paint mark. Mr Clark told the jury that he had seen the two pistols towards the end of 1988, although he conceded that on a previous occasion he had given a date of June 1989. He also gave evidence that the appellant had left in his safekeeping three rifles, the two pistols and a box of ammunition, all of which he had returned to the appellant in early 1990. He identified the box of ammunition found by police in the freezer as that which he had returned to him.29 In October 1990, Mr Clarke gave the police a box containing spent cartridges which had been fired by him using the weapons left at his property by the appellant. Seventy-two of these cartridges were found to have been fired by the Armi Jager pistol (Exhibit K). There were also 28 cartridges found to have not been fired from that weapon.30 As has already been noted, the ballistics evidence was that the .22 cartridge found in the yard at 2 Villiers Road had been fired from the deceased’s Sterling rifle (Exhibit E), found by the police in the bed at Boggabilla Road. In respect of the two .38 cartridges, one recovered from the deceased’s body and the other located on the ground near where his head had been lying, the ballistics evidence was less certain. They were both discharged either from the same weapon or from two weapons with identical rifling characteristics. The cartridge found in the yard was in a damaged condition, but the other showed a skid mark that indicated that it had been fired from a weapon with a revolver action, such as the Armi Jager pistol (Exhibit K). The two .38 cartridges had similar characteristics to cartridges obtained from test-firing that weapon. However, the evidence was that there were possibly 20 different types of weapons manufactured by Colt and Rutgers, which could produce similar characteristics. It was estimated that there might be 20,000 Rutgers weapons alone which would do so. There have been several thousands of Armi Jager pistols lawfully imported into Australia. (d) Evidence of consciousness of guilt 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Lies 
        
       
      
    31 The Crown relied upon a number of alleged lies told by the appellant. These related to the following: his denial of ownership of pistols; his statement that the Armi Jager pistol was left by a truck driver; his denial of owning rifles at the relevant time; his statement that the .22 Sterling rifle found in the bed belonged to Bradley Walsh; and his statement to Ms Harb that he had never seen the weapons found by police at Boggabilla Road. The appellant admitted that he had lied in relation to his possession of the rifles but had told the truth about his non-ownership of pistols. He denied that he made the statements attributed to him by the police about the truck driver or Bradley Walsh. He asserted that what he said to Ms Harb was true. (ii) Concealment of weapons 
     
      
    32 Noella Harb gave evidence that when the appellant returned to Moree after the deceased’s death, he moved his weapons from the Boggabilla Road premises to a storage shed off the property. The appellant later told her not to tell the police about the guns in the shed. In his statement to the jury the appellant said that he had taken this action because he did not have a current shooter’s licence at the time. The appellant held a shooter’s licence between 2 June 1983 and 1 June 1986. Ms Harb agreed in cross-examination that in July 1990 she had told police that the appellant took his rifles to the shed and she did not know whether he had any pistols at that time. (iii) Telephone conversation 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    33 After Ms Harb had spoken to police in July 1990, a listening device was lawfully installed by police into a telephone in the Boggabilla Road premises. This fact was unknown to Ms Harb. On 24 September 1990, a conversation between the appellant and Ms Harb was recorded, during which the appellant told her that the police had found weapons in his house, and that he had never seen these weapons before. When the appellant told her that a pistol had been found, Ms Harb said, “Which one? Not the, not the Magnum”. The appellant told her that “telephones have ears” and ""not to say anything"". He informed her that police had planted a pistol and rifle in the house and forced him to sign a statement. 
     
      
       
      THE DEFENCE CASE 
       
      
    34 The appellant’s case was that he was not responsible for the killing of the deceased and that there were other persons who had a motive for wanting to harm him. Defence counsel at the trial referred to the “secret life of Mr Climpson”.35 The appellant made an unsworn statement denying that he had any dispute with the deceased, asserting that as brothers-in-law they got on fairly well. He was not aware of the deceased mistreating his sister. The appellant denied ever having owned a pistol. He told the jury that Ms Harb’s brothers and their mates owned a number of firearms, including an Armi Jager pistol that had been left with Mr Clark. It had been returned to the owner in 1990. He said that there were a number of persons who could have placed the pistol in the chair, including Ms Harb or the police. He believed that Ms Harb was trying to set him up in the telephone call when she mentioned a Magnum. He said that Mr Doran had lied to the police and that he suspected that Doran had been in a relationship with his, the appellant’s, wife.36 There is no ground of appeal that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence, hence it is unnecessary to detail the material relied upon in the defence case. In summary, there was evidence called as to the involvement of the deceased in illegal activity in relation to greyhound racing and the hostility of bookmakers toward him. Evidence was given that the deceased had expressed fears for his life and had armed himself accordingly. He had also told a number of persons that his vehicle had been shot at and he had indicated the bullet holes.37 Before dealing with the grounds of appeal, some comment should be made about the conduct of the trial and the grounds of appeal raised. The appellant was represented at the trial by a Public Defender, a counsel very experienced in criminal matters, who frequently appears before the Supreme Court and this Court. There is no ground of appeal, nor could there be, that defence counsel acted in any way incompetently in the defence of the appellant. To the contrary, the transcript reveals that he was assiduous to ensure that his client received a fair trial, within the bounds of ethical conduct, the responsibilities of counsel and his duty to the court. As seems to be almost inevitably the case, counsel unconnected with the trial has conducted the appeal and, not uncommonly, grounds are raised in respect to matters which were not the subject of complaint before the trial judge. Less common is the fact that complaint is now made about the admission of evidence where no such objection was raised at the trial. Quite exceptionally, there is at least one ground asserting that trial counsel was mistaken in concessions he made to the judge as to the manner in which her Honour should direct the jury on certain aspects of the trial.38 We take this opportunity for the Court once again to deprecate what has been referred to as an “armchair appeal” (see R v Fuge (2001) 123 A Crim R 310 at [40]), where counsel briefed on appeal takes points, often of a technical nature, without any apparent regard to the manner in which the trial was conducted by competent defence counsel and where an easy remedy would have been available at trial, had counsel believed that his or her client was prejudiced by what the trial judge said or failed to say. Once again, there is little if any regard to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules in raising such grounds of appeal, treating it as a technicality of little or no moment, notwithstanding repeated statements of this Court to the contrary: see for example R v King [2000] NSWCCA 507; the long line of authorities referred to in the judgment of Whealy J; R v Button and Griffin [2002] NSWCCA 159 per Heydon JA; and most recently R v Ita [2003] NSWCCA 174.39 These preliminary observations having been made, we turn now to consider the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Appeal against Conviction 
       
      Ground 1: The trial judge erred in her directions to the jury on lies 
       
      
    40 We have referred in [31] to the reliance placed by the Crown upon a number of lies told by the appellant to the police and, on one occasion, to Ms Harb, as evidence of consciousness of guilt.41 Her Honour, in [149] of her summing up, noted that the Crown relied upon five categories of circumstantial evidence. The fifth category was the behaviour of the appellant in the months following the murder, which behaviour the Crown submitted was suggestive of an awareness that he was guilty of the offence charged. One of the three sub-categories of this fifth category concerned five lies told by the appellant. 42 It was necessary for her Honour not only to precisely identify each of the lies relied upon by the Crown to prove guilt, but also to identify the circumstances and events that were said to indicate that the lies constituted an admission against interest. Further, it was necessary for her Honour to instruct the jury that they might take the lie into account only if they were satisfied, having regard to those circumstances and events, that it revealed a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it, and that it was told because the appellant knew that the truth would implicate him in the commission of the offence or because of “a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth”. It was also necessary to instruct the jury that there might be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realisation of guilt, and those reasons needed to be identified and explained: Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 210-211. As the Crown had argued that the appellant lied due to a consciousness of guilt, it was mandatory for her Honour to give what has been referred to as an Edwards-type direction: Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 at 244 [16]; Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 77 ALJR 1433 at 1438 [34].43 The appellant’s complaints regarding her Honour’s directions on this issue are that they were unbalanced, that they attached excessive significance to the issue and that they over-emphasised its importance, causing the jury to focus unduly on the issue. It was observed that her Honour’s directions concerning lies as consciousness of guilt occupied some 90 paragraphs of the 431 paragraphs of her summing up. In the main, however, her Honour’s directions with respect to the issue of lies commenced at [268] of the summing up and concluded at [346], comprising 79 paragraphs.44 Her Honour commenced her directions on the issue of lies in [268] of the summing up in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The lies that the Crown alleges the accused told is quite an important part of the circumstantial case. So I need to say something to you about the manner in which you can use evidence of lies.” 
        
       
      
    45 In [269] of the summing up, her Honour told the jury that a person who is accused of a crime may tell a lie to investigating police or some other person because that person knows that he or she is guilty of a crime and does not want that guilt to be discovered. Then, in [270], she gave an example of such a lie in a context removed from the issues of the case. In [271]-[273], her Honour explained the necessity for the jury to be cautious about relying on a lie as a relevant circumstance to found an inference of guilt and, as required by Edwards, instructed them to the effect that there may be reasons for the telling of a lie apart from the realisation of guilt. 46 In [274], [276] and [281], her Honour set out the three conditions which the Crown had to satisfy before lies could be used as evidence as part of a circumstantial case. In [286], she recapped those three conditions. She was clearly correct in so doing.47 In the remaining paragraphs [287]-[346], her Honour, as mandated by Edwards, identified with precision the five lies upon which the Crown relied. She dealt with the first lie in [287]-[295], the second in [296]-[317], the third in [318]-[323], the fourth in [324]-[329] and the fifth in [330]-[334]. In so doing she referred to the evidence relied upon by the Crown in support of each lie. After identifying the relevant facts, circumstances and events relied upon by the Crown in respect of each, she reminded the jury that before they could take that lie into account as evidence of a consciousness of guilt they had to be satisfied of the three conditions to which she had earlier referred. Apart from the second, each of the other four lies were dealt with by her Honour with reasonable brevity, involving no repetition except, as we have indicated, with respect to the requirement that each of the three conditions to which she had earlier referred be satisfied in respect of each lie. 48 With respect to the second lie, her Honour was more expansive. This was because there was a conflict between the evidence of the police and that of the appellant, the latter having denied the truth of the police evidence in his statement. In our opinion, her Honour’s directions with respect to this lie were proper and, given the issues that the evidence raised, balanced and not unduly emphatic.49 Finally, in [336]-[346], her Honour summarised the evidence concerning the lies and the competing positions of the Crown and the appellant in relation to them. 50 Having concluded her directions with respect to the issue of lies, her Honour, in the absence of the jury, asked counsel whether at that point they had anything they wished to submit. Relevantly, the following exchange took place:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “HAESLER: The only matter I would ask your Honour to add, in the various summaries that you have given of lies you have usually finished off by words, ‘If you find it is a lie, you will consider it as one of the strands in the case’ and there is no problem with that. But I would ask when you tie it altogether at the end. And you did make this point at the very beginning, but once, but unfortunately the care which your took on the lies direction may well have given it more importance in the overall scheme of things than perhaps it deserves. 
         
          
           
            
             
              
              I would ask you to add ‘consider as one of the strands which, together with the other evidence, which as a whole’ – reading from Shepherd which, as a whole, must establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt if the accused is to be convicted. 
               
              That last rider, you did say it at the beginning but you didn’t mention it each of the times that you raised the question of strands. 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        HER HONOUR: So you want me to say… 
         
        HAESLER: If you consider them to be strands in the case, then just to repeat essentially what you said at the very beginning, that they must be together with the other evidence, establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt before the accused can be convicted. 
         
        HER HONOUR: I thought I had made that quite clear. 
         
        HAESLER: You said it once. 
         
        HER HONOUR: I thought I said that in relation to each…..I said a number of times, in fact, I think perhaps more favourably than necessary to the accused, that if they are satisfied of these things, they can use them as strands in their cable and that may be taken to imply that they have got to be satisfied of individual facts, which is not really correct. More favourable perhaps than it needs to be. 
         
        HAESLER: I only as at some stage, when you are tying it altogether… 
         
        HER HONOUR: I probably will do something like that.” 
         
        
       
      
    51 It is apparent from the above exchange that trial counsel for the appellant was asserting that the careful manner in which her Honour had given directions on the issue of lies “may well have given it more importance in the overall scheme of things than perhaps it deserves”. This seems to have been more an observation than a complaint. In any event, insofar as it is a criticism, in our view it has no substance. 52 Reliance was placed by the appellant upon a passage in the decision of the Privy Council in Broadhurst v The Queen  (1964) AC 441 where, at 457, Lord Devlin observed that it was very important that a jury should be carefully directed on the effect of a conclusion, if reached, that the accused is lying. This passage was cited with approval by Kirby J (dissenting) in Zonoff (at 257 [57]) and, again, by King CJ in Harris v The Queen  (1990) 55 SASR 321 at 323 in a passage, which, in our opinion, reflects the later statement of principle articulated by Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Edwards at 210-211.53 In our opinion, her Honour’s directions with respect to the issue of lies accorded with these principles. They were accurate, balanced and went no further than was necessary to ensure that the jury was in no doubt as to the manner in which it could utilise such lies as evidence of guilt.54 The appellant further submitted that, because the issue of lies as consciousness of guilt was such an essential part of the Crown case, consciousness of guilt should have been regarded as an essential intermediate fact to be established beyond reasonable doubt and the jury should have been so directed. 55 In our opinion, there is no substance in this submission. As her Honour made clear throughout her summing up, the Crown’s circumstantial case involved a series of strands and, as she indicated in [295] and [314] of her summing up, each lie, if established, could be added to the strands of the cable in the jury’s consideration of the Crown case. Being a “strands in a cable” case rather than a “links in a chain” case, none of those strands, including each of the lies, was an intermediate fact the proof of which was an indispensable link in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. Accordingly, none of the strands, including any of the lies, was required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt: Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579-580; 585 per Dawson J with whom Mason CJ, Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed; at 593 per McHugh J; R v Dellapatrona & Duffield (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 at 149-150. In the latter case where the Crown relied upon lies as evidence of consciousness of guilt, it was expressly held by this Court that there was no need for the Crown to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the accused lied with a consciousness of guilt on his part before that lie can amount to corroboration of the Crown evidence against him: at 150 E-F. 56 Finally, in R v Adam (1999) 106 A Crim R 510 at 52 [55], this Court (constituted by Spigelman CJ, James and Bell JJ) expressed itself thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “Since  
        Edwards 
         it has been repeatedly held by this Court that “where lies are used merely as evidencing a consciousness of guilt, as part of the circumstantial evidence case, it is unnecessary to establish either the lie or its character beyond reasonable doubt” ( 
        Taylor 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 18 April 1995) at p 19 per Hunt CJ at CL, citing  
        Dellapatrona 
         (1993) 31 NSWLR 123 at 150;  
        Sandford 
         (1994) 72 A Crim R 160 at 181;  
        Small  
         (1994) 33 NSWLR 575 at 596; 72 A Crim R 462 at 481-482.” 
         
        
       
      
    57 We would therefore reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The trial judge erred in her directions to the jury on circumstantial evidence;  
       
      AND 
       
      Ground 5: The trial judge erred in her directions to the jury on motive 
      
    58 It is convenient to deal with these grounds together. With respect to Ground 2, it was submitted by the appellant that as the Crown case involved proof that the accused was present at the time of the murder and that the pistol and rifle used in the killing belonged to him, in order for the Crown to establish these facts it was also necessary for the Crown to establish the following: that the appellant was not at his mother’s home at the time of the murder; that he owned or had in his possession the weapons that were used in the murder; and that the projectiles which caused the death of the deceased were fired from those weapons at the time. Accordingly, it was open to the jury to regard these matters as intermediate facts constituting indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. This being so, her Honour should have directed the jury that, if they considered that such facts were indispensable links in their chain of reasoning, they would need to be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict the appellant. 59 In her final written directions to the jury, her Honour stated the following [415]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “1. A circumstantial case depends upon inferences to be drawn from a collection of facts, events and circumstances.  
         
        2. No individual fact or circumstance needs to be established beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
        3. Individual facts and circumstances on which the Crown relies may draw strength from one another. Even weak strands may be strengthened by being put together with other evidence.” 
         
        
       
      These written directions also included a direction that, before the jury could convict on the basis of circumstantial evidence, they must be satisfied that the guilt of the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. These written directions were “ 
      settled 
      ” with the approval of the appellant’s trial counsel. 
       
      
    60 Motive was the second of the five different categories of evidence on which the Crown relied as part of its circumstantial case. Her Honour directed the jury with respect to motive in [180]-[202] of the summing up. In the first of those paragraphs she directed the jury that where, as in the present case, the Crown sets out to prove that the accused had a motive, that was one piece of evidence or one circumstance on which they could rely. 61 The appellant submitted that, because the Crown had opened motive to the jury and had relied upon it “as an essential part of its case” in respect of which her Honour had given extensive directions, the jury should have been directed that they could not use motive unless they were satisfied that it had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.62 We have already referred in [53] to the decision of the High Court of Australia in Shepherd. The appellant sought to call in aid that decision, in particular the statement of Dawson J (at 579) that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “If it is appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable it may well be appropriate to tell the jury that that fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn.” 
         
        
       
      His Honour then made it clear that, where the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it is not appropriate to give such a warning, and that in any event it should not be given where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so. He continued: 
       
        
         
        “It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt when the other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence.” 
         
        
       
      
    63 As we have already observed, the Crown’s case, as accepted by her Honour, was one in which the evidence consisted of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain. This notwithstanding, the appellant submits that some of these “strands” were in fact “links” and constituted indispensable intermediate facts which required proof beyond reasonable doubt. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in R v Merritt  [1999] NSWCCA 29 at [70] and [71], where the Court said (omitting citations): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “70. Ultimately, of course, it is for the trial judge to determine whether to give directions that relate to the standard of proof to what are, or might be, intermediate facts ‘which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards a inference of guilty. It is important in this regard, we think, to appreciate that the trial judge should, in considering this question, ask whether  
        the jury 
         might reasonably regard certain facts as intermediate facts even if, as it happened, his Honour did not regard any of the facts in that light…In our opinion, where one or more facts might reasonably be regarded as intermediate facts, it would usually be essential for the trial judge to identify those facts and instruct the jury that if the jury considered that such facts were indispensable links in their chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt, they would need to be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt before convicting. If the case is one where, in the judge’s opinion, there were no such crucial intermediate facts, it “will generally be sufficient to tell jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference 
          
        consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence’.” 
         
        
       
      
    64 The Court then referred to the words of McHugh J in Shepherd which we have emphasised in the following passage (at 693): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “In a particular case, an inference of guilt beyond reasonable doubt may not be able to be drawn unless each fact relied on to found the inference is established beyond reasonable doubt. This is  
        likely to be the case where the incriminating facts relied on to establish the inference are few in number 
        . But the more facts that are relied on to found the inference of guilt, the less likely it is that each or any fact will have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
      
    65 The Court then considered in [71] that, as there were relatively few incriminating facts in that case, it was both desirable and necessary for the trial judge to have identified for the jury the crucial factual issues and assisted them to apply to them the legal rule requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt of the Crown case. In particular, the jury should have been directed that, if they regarded any particular fact as being an indispensable link in the chain of proof, that fact must be proved to their satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt before they could convict.66 Given the appellant’s submission that it was an essential part of the Crown case that the jury should be able to infer that the appellant was present at the time of the killing and, hence, the facts necessary to enable this inference to be drawn could have been regarded by the jury as intermediate facts which constituted indispensable links in their chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt, the following passage from the judgment of Dawson J in Shepherd (at 579) is apposite: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “For example, with most crimes it is a necessary fact that the accused was present when the crime was committed. But it may be possible for a jury to conclude that the accused was guilty as a matter of inference beyond reasonable doubt from evidence of opportunity, capacity and motive without expressly identifying the intermediate fact that the accused was present when the crime was committed.” 
         
        
       
      
    67 One of the facts, which if proved would assist any inference that the appellant was present when the crime was committed was, as the appellant submitted, whether he had returned to his mother’s home before the murder took place. But we see no basis upon which it can legitimately be argued that this fact was other than a “strand in the cable” along with many other strands upon which the Crown relied. In our opinion, no proper basis existed for erecting that or any other fact into an intermediate fact constituting an indispensable link in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt and thus requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt. 68 It was acknowledged by the appellant that his trial counsel made no objection at the trial to that part of her Honour’s summing up which repeatedly asserted that the case was a “strand in a cable” case: nor was a direction sought. In fact, counsel for the appellant at the trial conceded that it was a “strands” case and disavowed any submission that any individual fact had to be established beyond reasonable doubt. We see no merit in the appellant’s submissions on the matter and as such we would refuse leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on this aspect of Ground 2. 69 The appellant further submitted that, as it was an essential part of the Crown’s case that the wounds fatal to the deceased were made by a .357 Armi Jager pistol and a .22 calibre Sterling rifle, her Honour should have referred in her summing up to the evidence of Sgt. Constable that there have been several thousand Armi Jagers lawfully imported into Australia and that such a weapon was only one of a number of weapons that could have been used to fire the fatal projectile, there being some twenty different types of weapons produced by other manufacturers with similar rifling characteristics. It was also submitted that her Honour had failed to make specific reference to the evidence with respect to the .22 shell casing which was found near the deceased’s body and that the most that could be said was that the .22 Sterling rifle could have fired the projectile that caused or contributed to the fatality. There was also evidence from Sgt. Constable as to where a shell casing would be projected from a .22 on ejection which, it was submitted, cast real doubt on whether the casing found at the scene could be linked to the murder.70 Her Honour directed the jury with respect to the .22 cartridge case found at the scene in [213] of the summing up. She referred to the submissions of the appellant’s counsel and to the evidence suggesting that the jury could not be satisfied that the cartridge case was in any way connected with the murder, given the location in which it was found. 71 In [214], in the absence of the jury, counsel were asked whether there was anything arising “out of what I’ve said so far”? The appellant’s counsel answered in the negative. As to the Armi Jager pistol, her Honour directed the jury at [366] of the summing up that Sgt. Constable had said that the Armi Jager pistol could have been the murder weapon, not that it was in fact the murder weapon.72 In our opinion, her Honour’s failure to refer to each and every aspect of these two matters does not constitute a valid basis for criticising the summing up on these issues. It is trite that, in a summing up, a trial judge is not required to refer to each and every piece of evidence. In the paragraphs referred to, her Honour emphasised the essential fact that there was no evidence that the Armi Jager pistol was in fact used in the murder, only that it could have been, as one of the projectiles found in the deceased’s body was from a weapon of a similar calibre. Equally, her Honour directed the jury as to the appellant’s case at trial that the .22 cartridge had nothing to do with the murder. Further, as no objection was made at the trial by the appellant’s counsel to the relevant omissions, we would refuse leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on that part of Ground 2.73 As to motive, we noted earlier that the appellant submitted that motive was an intermediate fact indispensable to a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. However, her Honour made it clear to the jury that motive was one of the “strands” upon which the Crown relied as part of its “cable”. Reliance was placed by the appellant upon the decision of this Court in R v Murphy  (1985) 4 NSWLR 42, where, applying the decision of the High Court in Chamberlain v The Queen (No 2) (1984) 153 CLR 520, it held that, because the evidence was relevant as tending to show that the accused had the intention asserted by the Crown, it was not merely a subsidiary fact and was therefore required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 74 However, Murphy was decided prior to the High Court decision in Shepherd, which explained Chamberlain. Shepherd was not referred to by Callinan J (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) in the later High Court decision Penny v The Queen (1998) 72 ALJR 1316 at 1321 [26], where his Honour, in obiter, seems to have resurrected Murphy. However, in R v Pantoja [1998] NSW CCA 5, James J (with whom Wood CJ at CL agreed) noted that the decision in Murphy was based on what is now known to be an erroneous interpretation of Chamberlain, and that Callinan J in Penny had made no reference to Shepherd, which had made it clear that in a case resting upon circumstantial evidence it was not necessary that each individual fact be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Adams J, who agreed with James J, also referred to Murphy, Penny and Shepherd and concluded that, although there may be cases depending upon circumstantial evidence in which proof of motive is an indispensable link in the chain of proof of guilt of the accused and would thus need to be established beyond reasonable doubt, such cases would be rare and the present was not one of them. 75 These issues also came before this Court in R v Plevac [1999] NSWCCA 351, where Grove J, with whom James and Dowd JJ agreed, after referring to Murphy, Penny and Pantoja, held at [28] that, as the case before the Court was circumstantial and the jury was not being invited to infer guilt from motive alone, it was not one of the rare cases referred to by Adams J in Pantoja that required a direction that motive need be proved beyond reasonable doubt.76 Finally, we refer to R v Fowler (No 2) [2000] NSWCCA 142, which concerned an appeal from the second conviction of the appellant in respect of the murder of the deceased, and where the same evidence of motive was relied upon as in the present case. Wood CJ at CL, with whom Hulme and Barr JJ agreed, said [83]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “This was not a particularly helpful direction, although so far as it went it was correct in law. Preferably, his Honour should have explained that motive was a matter relied upon by the Crown as a strand in a circumstantial case, which if made out would support that case but if not made out would be neutral. It was not an intermediate fact and the reasoning in  
        Shepherd  
        (1990) 97 ALR 161 applied. It was accordingly not necessary that motive be established in this case beyond reasonable doubt:  
        Penny  
        (1998) 155 ALR 605 
        ; Plevac  
        (1999) NSW CCA 351.” 
         
        
       
      
    77 As already noted, her Honour dealt with motive as one of the “strands” and no request for further directions in the nature of that which it is now submitted should have been given was sought. In our opinion, the appellant’s submissions lack merit and we would refuse leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon Ground 5. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The trial judge erred in not referring the jury to the evidence of Sgt. Constable as to other weapons 
       
      
    78 This ground overlaps with part of Ground 2 and relates to the expert evidence of Sgt. Constable that several thousand Armi Jager pistols were lawfully imported into Australia and that it was only one of a number of weapons that could have been used to fire the fatal projectile. Sgt. Constable also gave evidence that other manufacturers, including Colt and Rutger, produced weapons with rifling characteristics similar to the Armi Jager and that there were probably 20 different types of such weapons and 20,000 Rutger weapons alone.79 After the jury retired, her Honour asked counsel whether there were any further matters for consideration. The following exchange then took place between her Honour and counsel for the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “HAESLER: Just two matters: I would ask your Honour, your Honour mentioned in regard to Sgt. Constable and raised the topic of the probability of the Armi Jager. You said the question of possibility and you mentioned Sgt. Constable again in summary. I would ask your Honour to remind that that when he was speaking of the probability of the Armi Jager being the murder weapon, he agreed there were many other weapons with those same characteristics. He agreed there were many thousands of weapons. The probability depends upon how many other weapons could have been the murder weapon. 
         
        HER HONOUR: What do you say, Mr Crown? 
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I take a neutral stand, your Honour, but if you do that, I would ask that you do it this afternoon rather than tomorrow morning. 
         
        HER HONOUR: I have told them they can go now and my guess is they are out the door. I am not inclined to, it was said in address and to do it now would give it too much emphasis and confuse them.” 
         
        
       
      
    80 We have already referred to the fact that her Honour had extensively summarised the principal points of Sgt. Constable’s ballistics evidence. As her Honour indicated in the exchange referred to above, then counsel for the appellant had in his address to the jury referred to the evidence in respect of which the appellant now submits that her Honour should have further directed the jury. In fact, his submissions on this point took up approximately one page of the transcript of that address. It could hardly have been overlooked by the jury given her Honour’s directions referred to above. In our opinion, no relevant prejudice to the appellant arose from the failure of her Honour to accede to counsel’s request. It is clear that the jury were fully cognizant of the issue and it required no further emphasis. 81 Accordingly, we would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The trial judge erred in the directions to the jury on accessorial liability 
       
      
    82 In [61] and [62] of her summing up, her Honour directed the jury in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “61. Now, let me just say, firing three bullets into another person is quite obviously done with the intention of killing or causing really serious injury to the person who is shot. 
         
        62. There is no dispute in this case that Trevor Climpson was murdered, that whoever fired those shots did so deliberately and with the relevant intention. So you are not concerned about whether the act of killing, the act that caused death, amounts to murder or not; your concern is whether it was the accused who did it.” 
         
        
       
      
    83 In [63] she turned to the question of accessorial liability. She said this:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “But that brings me to another matter which is slightly more complex. A person may also be guilty of murder by being present when another person commits the murder and the first person intentionally gives assistance or encouragement in that murder.” 
         
         
        She then repeated the last sentence. 
         
        
       
      
    84 She elaborated on the foregoing in [64] and [65]. In [67] she directed the jury that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “There is no dispute that Mr Climpson was murdered. The issue is whether the Crown has proved either that it was the accused who fired those shots, or that he was present giving assistance or encouragement to the person who did fire the shots.” 
         
        
       
      
    85 Her Honour returned to the matter at [72] and directed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The intention to assist or to encourage must have been based on knowledge of the essential facts. Now, what does that mean? I know it probably sounds quite confusing. If you were to find the accused guilty of murder on the basis that he was present assisting or encouraging the actual killer, you would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of these things: 1. That the murder was committed by somebody else; 2. That he was present – I have already mentioned these; 3. He knew all the essential facts or circumstances necessary to show that the murder was committed by the other person; and 4. With this knowledge, he intentionally assisted or encouraged the principal offender to commit the crime.” 
         
        
       
      
    86 Her Honour then referred in [73] to “the essential facts or circumstances”, being that the principal offender or the actual killer fired the shots and did so with the intention of killing or causing really serious harm. In [74] she referred to the statement of the Crown Prosecutor in his address that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “a person is guilty of murder if he is present when somebody else commits and he knows what that person is up to. That is the colloquial way of putting it. It is fairly accurate. What he has to know is, firstly, the other person does the act that causes the death and b) that the other person has the intention of killing or causing really serious injury.” 
         
        
       
      
    87 In [75] her Honour directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “You might think it is perfectly clear that a person who fires three shots at another person intends to kill or do really serious injury, so that if you were satisfied that the accused was present and he knew that somebody else fired the shots did so with the relevant intention, then he knew the essential facts or circumstances.” 
         
        
       
      
    88 After the jury had retired, her Honour asked whether counsel on either side had anything further to submit. The following exchange took place: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “HAESLER: The other question is, the Crown in his address without specifically mentioning Vicki Climpson, did point out to the jury that it would not be enough on the Crown case to prove murder if they were satisfied (paraphrasing) that the accused had disposed of weapons on behalf of some other person and that was not mentioned by her Honour. 
         
        HER HONOUR: I have made it perfectly clear the accessory case is – I have said it over and over again – being present and helping.” 
         
        
       
      
    89 Notwithstanding the limited nature of counsel’s request to her Honour identified in the above exchange, it was submitted by the appellant that her Honour’s directions in [61], [62] and [75] would have entitled a jury to convict the appellant merely on the basis that he was present at the time of the shooting, it being obvious from the shots fired that the person(s) firing intended to kill. It was contended that such directions did not bring home to the jury the necessity to be satisfied that the person present was linked in purpose with the person(s) actually committing the shooting. 90 One day following retirement the jury returned with the following question: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Further, can we have a clarification of the issue of whether the accused would be guilty of murder if he assisted in hiding the murder weapons after the fact, when he did not (‘ 
        did not 
        ’) have any knowledge of the essential facts in the circumstances at the time?” 
         
        
       
      
    91 The jury was brought back and her Honour further directed it as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “402. The third part of your question concerns the question of whether the accused would be guilty of murder if he assisted in hiding the murder weapon, but did not have any knowledge of the fact of the essential facts and circumstances at the time. The answer is that if the accused did no more than hide a murder weapon after the murder was committed, without knowledge of those essential facts and circumstances, he would not be guilty of murder. 
         
         
        403. I will, if you wish, remind you of the directions I gave you about what constitutes murder in both of the senses which I referred to during the course of the directions, but it does not include mere concealment of the weapon. There would have to be some act of the accused causing the death, or his presence aiding or encouraging the person who did.” 
         
        
       
      
    92 The jury once again retired but shortly returned when her Honour gave directions in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “409. The Crown put before you the various facts and events and circumstances that I have already directed you on and invited you, from that collection of facts and circumstances, to draw the inference that the accused is guilty of the murder. You may not convict on that basis unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a combination of those facts and circumstances establishes that the accused did commit the murder in one of the two ways that I have already mentioned to you. That is, acting by himself or being present while somebody else committed the murder and being ready to offer assistance of encouragement.” 
         
        
       
      
    93 It was submitted that from the tenor of the question referred to in [90], the jury may well have thought that being present when the shots were fired and then removing and hiding the weapons was sufficient for the appellant to be convicted. Criticism was also made of the further directions given by her Honour at [402] and [403] of the summing up. 94 In support of his submissions which we have summarised in [89] above, the appellant referred to the following passage of Wood CJ at CL (with whom McClellan J and Smart AJ agreed) in R v Phan (2001) 123 A Crim R 30 at 45, where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “69. Moreover, mere acquiescence or assent to a crime does not make a person liable as a principal in the second degree. What was needed in such a case is proof that the principal in the second degree was linked in purpose with the person actually committing the crime, and was by his or her words or conduct doing something to bring about, or rendering more likely, through encouragement or assistance, its commission.” 
         
        
       
      
    95 To similar effect, in R v Adam (1999) 106 A Crim R 510 this Court held that a person who is present at the commission of a crime is not liable as an accessory unless she or he intentionally assists or encourages the principal offender to commit the crime. The trial judge’s directions must be sufficient to instruct the jury that on the accessorial basis of liability it must be satisfied that the accused was not merely present but was intentionally assisting or encouraging those inflicting grievous bodily harm.96 In our opinion, her Honour’s directions on this issue accord with authority. She made it patently clear to the jury that if it was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant, being present at the shooting, fired the fatal shots, it could only find him guilty of murder if the following criteria were proved beyond reasonable doubt: firstly, he had knowledge of all the essential facts or circumstances necessary to show that the murder was committed or going to be committed by a third person; and secondly, he intentionally assisted or encouraged the principal offender to commit the crime. The combination of directions adopted by her Honour made clear the elements of which the jury needed to be satisfied and left no room for the jury to interpret her directions as suggesting that mere presence at the scene of the crime would be sufficient to found liability. Accordingly, there is no substance in this ground of appeal.97 It is to be noted that after directing the jury in terms of [402] and [403] of her summing up, her Honour asked whether either counsel wanted anything added to what she had just said. Mr Haesler answered in the negative. In these circumstances, we would in any event refuse leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: The trial judge inaccurately summarised the effect of Adam Fowler’s evidence  
       
      
    98 Earlier in this judgment, we briefly referred to the evidence of Adam Fowler, the appellant’s son, concerning the night of 8 January 1988. In order to determine the sixth and seventh grounds of appeal, it is necessary to examine his evidence in more detail.99 Adam Fowler gave evidence that he was born on 2 November 1976. Hence he was eleven years of age at the time the alleged offence occurred and was twenty-four years of age when he gave evidence at the trial before the primary judge.100 Adam Fowler gave evidence in chief that his parents had separated when he was about six years old. After his parents had separated, he lived with his mother but regularly visited his father.101 In January 1988, Adam Fowler travelled with the appellant to the home of the appellant’s parents at Wallacia. On 8 January 1988, Adam Fowler went with the appellant to the home of his aunt, Vicky Climpson. He and the appellant stayed most of the day at Vicky Climpson’s house and then returned to the house at Wallacia.102 On the night of 8 January 1988, Adam Fowler did not leave the house at Wallacia. He recalled that there had been a storm that night, that there had been a power failure, but that the power had later been restored.103 The concluding part of Adam Fowler’s evidence in chief was as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. At any time during the storm did your father leave the house? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. What were you doing when your father was away from the house? 
         
        A. Oh as I remember I was staying with my grandfather. 
         
        Q. What were you doing? 
         
        A. Waiting for the power to come back on. 
         
        Q. Did you watch TV that night? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Do you recall watching a Sherlock Holmes movie? 
         
        A. I don’t really recall it but, yes, it was in the statement, so yes. 
         
        Q. In any event you remember watching a movie that night. 
         
        A. That’s correct, yes. 
         
        Q. And while you were watching television, was your father out? 
         
        A. I think so. 
         
        Q. When the film finished, did you then go to bed? 
         
        A. No, I flipped channels I think and then yeah watched a bit more and then I went to bed. 
         
        Q. When you went to bed was your father home? 
         
        A. No. 
         
        Q. When was the next time you saw your dad? 
         
        A. The next morning.” 
        
       
      
    104 The reference in the above exchange to “the statement” is a reference to a statement Adam Fowler had made to police in question and answer form.105 In cross-examination, Adam Fowler was asked whether the first time he was asked to recall the events of the night of 8 January 1988 was when police had interviewed him in Queensland “on 25 February”. He answered in the affirmative and said that he had made a statement to the police on that date. He also said in cross-examination that he had no independent recollection of the events of 8 January 1988, and that he was giving evidence on the basis of that earlier statement.106 Cross-examining counsel read the following questions and answers in Adam Fowler’s statement: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. Do you remember what movie you were watching? 
         
        A. Yeah it was a Sherlock Holmes movie, it was on channel 7. 
         
        Q. How long did you watch television that night? 
         
        A. I watched the end of that movie and when we changed channels and we watched something about Jesus on another channel, it was the end of another show, then we talked for a while, then I went to bed. 
         
        Q. Do you know what time that was? 
         
        A. It was about 11 o’clock”. 
        
       
      
    107 Adam Fowler was then shown two television programme guides, one for 8 January 1988 and one for the following day, 9 January 1988. The following exchange took place. 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. I will show you two documents. (Documents shown). They have been marked. They are both television programmes and the first document has a red mark with a Sherlock Holmes movie on Channel 7? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. You will see if you have a look at the time the Sherlock Holmes movie is scheduled to finish, there are no Jesus movies on that night, are there? 
         
        A. No, there aren’t. 
         
        Q. If you look at the second document, the next page? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. You will see marked is a movie or a mini series called “Anno Domini”? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. It is a movie about Jesus? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. It is on the following night? 
         
        A. Right. 
         
        Q. Do you accept that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Would you accept that when you were trying and doing your best to answer the questions of the police in February 1988, you did make a mistake about the Jesus movie? 
         
        A. Yes, quite possible. 
         
        Q. Would you concede, having made that mistake, that you may have made a mistake about you watching the Sherlock Holmes movie until its very end? 
         
        A. That could be possible, yes”. 
        
       
      
    108 The television program guide for 9 January 1988 was marked for identification and was later tendered and admitted into evidence in the defence case.109 Her Honour summarised Adam Fowler’s evidence at [171]-[174] of the summing-up. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “171. There is also evidence of Adam Fowler, the accused’s son. He was a 12 year old at the time. He did not live with his father. He was on, what used to be called at least, an access visit. He said he had gone with the accused to the accused’s mother’s home at Wallacia and they had spent the afternoon of 8 January at Vicky Climpson’s house at Villiers Road. Adam Fowler said they stayed there most of the day, they had arrived about lunchtime and they left about what he called the end of the day. He said they drove back to Wallacia, which wasn’t very far away and he spoke about the storm also. There is no question there was a violent storm that night and there was a blackout in some parts of the areas we are concerned about. 
        
       
       
        
        172. Now, this question, the significant evidence given by Adam Fowler, was that the accused left the house and that after power was restored and that was at 9.30, Adam watched television for a time. When he gave evidence in this Court, not surprisingly, he did not have a very clear recollection but he agreed that he had made a statement to police shortly afterwards in which he said he had watched a Sherlock Holmes movie and we know there was a Sherlock Holmes movie on that night and it finished at 11.08 pm. 
        
       
       
        
        173. He said he flicked channels and watched another film which he said was something about Jesus. Then he and his grandmother – he said ‘they’, but presumably he means he and his grandmother, talked for a while, went to bed about 11 o’clock and his father was still not home when he went to bed. 
        
       
       
        
        174. It is quite clear from evidence produced in the defence case, that is the photocopies of the TV programmes for that night, that Adam’s recollection was imperfect from the point there was a religious film on television the following night, but not that night, but we do know that he was correct in saying there was a Sherlock Holmes movie on that night. So if he was correct in saying that he watched that to the end and we know it finished at 11.08, the accused was still not home by that time”. 
        
       
      
    110 In the present appeal, it was submitted by the appellant that her Honour’s summary of Adam Fowler’s evidence in her summing-up was inaccurate in certain respects. We will deal separately with each of the submissions made by counsel for the appellant.111 (i) It was submitted that her Honour said, inaccurately, that Adam Fowler had given evidence that the appellant left the house at 9.30 pm, after power was restored.112 It is correct that Adam Fowler did not give evidence that the appellant had left the house after power was restored. However, her Honour did not say that Adam Fowler had given evidence that the appellant left the house after power was restored. What her Honour said in [172] of her summing-up was that Adam Fowler had given evidence that the appellant left the house, and that after power was restored, he watched television for a time. In actual fact, the event which her Honour related to the restoration of power was Adam Fowler watching television, not the appellant leaving the house.113 (ii) It was submitted that her Honour said, inaccurately, that in his evidence Adam Fowler agreed that he had made a statement to police “shortly afterwards”.114 Her Honour did say in [172] of the summing-up that Adam Fowler “agreed that he had made a statement to police shortly afterwards”. This was, however, warranted with regards to his answers to the questions asked in cross-examination, which established that he had made a statement on 25 February 1988. In our opinion, the statement made on 25 February 1988 could accurately be described as having been made “shortly afterwards”.115 (iii) It was submitted that there was no evidence to support what her Honour said in [172] and substantially repeated in [174] of the summing-up that “we know there was a Sherlock Holmes movie on that night and it finished at 11.08 pm.” A related submission was made that television programme guides could not establish whether particular programmes listed in the guides were actually shown or whether they were shown at the times stated.116 At the trial there was no dispute that a Sherlock Holmes movie had been shown on television on the night of 8 January 1988 and that it had finished at 11.08 pm. There were a number of agreed facts at the trial and in his closing address the Crown Prosecutor, without any complaint from counsel for the appellant at the trial, said: “it is an agreed fact that the show that was being screened on television that particular night (8 January 1988) finished at eight minutes past eleven”.117 Adam Fowler was cross-examined by counsel for the appellant at the trial, on the basis that the programme guides were evidence of what programmes had actually been shown on the nights of 8 and 9 January 1988 and of what time the Sherlock Holmes movie shown on 8 January 1988 had finished.118 As previously indicated, the television programme guide for 9 January 1988 was tendered by counsel for the appellant at the trial and admitted into evidence, as being evidence that the film about Jesus had been shown on the night of 9 January 1988.119 It was put to Adam Fowler in cross-examination that he might have been mistaken about watching the Sherlock Holmes movie “until its very end”. It was not put to Adam Fowler that he might have been mistaken about watching a Sherlock Holmes movie at all or that the Sherlock Holmes movie might have finished at some time other than 11.08 p m.120 No objection was made at the trial to any part of her Honour’s summary of Adam Fowler’s evidence and we would refuse leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7: The trial judge failed to give the jury a warning in respect of the evidence of Adam Fowler 
      
    121 It was submitted that the trial judge should have given the jury a warning about Adam Fowler’s evidence “pursuant to the provisions of s 165 of the Evidence Act” having regard to the following factors: his age as at 8 January 1988; the number of years which had elapsed between 8 January 1988 and the time of the trial in February 2001; his lack of any independent recollection of the events of 8 January 1988; and the answers he gave in the concluding part of his cross-examination in which he conceded that he might have been mistaken in two parts of his evidence. 122 Under s 165(2) of the Evidence Act, a trial judge is required to give a jury directions in accordance with s 165 only if “a party so requests”. At the trial, no such request was made. Accordingly, the trial judge was not required by s 165 to give directions in accordance with that provision in relation to the evidence of Adam Fowler.123 At the trial, not only was no request made that a s 165 direction be given in relation to Adam Fowler’s evidence, but no application was made by appellant’s counsel for any kind of warning to the jury in relation to his evidence. 124 Shortly prior to commencing her summing-up, the trial judge invited submissions from counsel about a number of matters, including s 165 of the Evidence Act. Counsel for the appellant submitted that her Honour should give a s 165 warning in relation to the evidence of Ronald Doran. However, as we have already observed, counsel did not make any submission of the kind in relation to Adam Fowler’s evidence. We would, therefore, infer that counsel made a considered decision not to seek any kind of direction or warning in this regard.125 Section 165(5) of the Evidence Act provides that s 165 does not affect any other power of a trial judge to give a warning to a jury. Even if no party requests that a warning be given, one must be given “whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case”. Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 86 per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ; R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301 per Howie J at 318 (86). A warning may be required where the courts have special knowledge or experience about the kind of evidence which has been given which a jury may not possess or where there is a risk that a jury may attribute more weight to the evidence than it actually deserves. See R v Baartman [2000] NSWCCA 298 at [62] and R v Stewart at [97] and [101].126 In the present case, the evidence given by Adam Fowler was not evidence about which the Court had any special knowledge or experience not shared by the jury, nor was it evidence to which the jury was likely to attribute more weight than actually deserved. It would have been quite obvious to the jury that his evidence concerned events, which had happened when he was eleven years old and that thirteen years had elapsed by the time of the trial. The jury also would have been aware that he had no recollection independent of the statement he had made to the police of what had happened on 8 January 1988 and that he had conceded in cross-examination that he might have been mistaken in two parts of his evidence.127 We would refuse leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 8: The trial judge erred in permitting cross-examination of Ronald Anthony Doran 
      
    128 Earlier in this judgment, we referred to evidence given by Mr Doran about a statement made in 1992, in which he described conversations between himself and the appellant concerning the appellant’s brother-in-law. In order to consider properly the present ground of appeal (and the following ground of appeal, which also relates to Mr Doran), it is necessary to examine in greater detail the evidence given by him at the trial and the stages in which such evidence was given.129 Mr Doran was called by the Crown. He gave evidence in chief that he had been good friends with the appellant from his teens until his early twenties. Mr Doran was forty-one years old at the time of the trial. The Crown Prosecutor then asked him a number of questions, the answers to which were unresponsive or largely uninformative. The following exchange provides an example of such: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. Have you ever had a conversation with Mr Fowler about his brother-in-law? 
         
        A. We could have done. 
         
        Q. Has he ever said anything to you nasty about his brother-in-law? 
         
        A. We all say nasty things about people from time to time, don’t we? 
         
        Q. Has he ever said anything nasty about his brother-in-law? 
         
        A. He may have done. I don’t know”. 
        
       
      
    130 The Crown Prosecutor indicated that he wished to make an application in the absence of the jury, who then left the courtroom. Whilst the jury was absent, the Crown Prosecutor asked Mr Doran questions about the statement he had made to the police in 1992. He admitted to having said in that statement that the appellant had approached him in 1986 asking for help to kill the appellant’s brother-in-law and that on a number of occasions the appellant had spoken ill of his brother-in-law. During this examination by the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Doran gave the following answer: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “A. Your Honour, in 1992, I was well and fit. I have gone through hell. I have gone through a drought that is a one in one hundred year drought. I have had four floods in three years. I have just been wiped out. I – I have just about put my brains through our family home because of the bloody financial bloody troubles. This is bloody insignificant to the battles we have had at home. I have been on drugs for bloody depression and whatever and I just – look, if I made this – at the time I made it, I signed it – I signed it, fine, that’s great, but I can’t – they handed me this here and I said, ‘Look, I cannot learn it like Shakespeare because it is not in my heart what is written’”. 
        
       
      
    131 The Crown Prosecutor made an application that the trial judge give leave for the statement made in 1992 to be used to revive Mr Doran’s memory. Her Honour said that her “immediate reaction” to the application was that a statement made in 1992 was not made at a time when the events recorded in it were “fresh” in Mr Doran’s memory (s 32(2)(b)(i) of the Evidence Act) within the restrictive interpretation of the word “fresh” in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606. The Crown Prosecutor did not further pursue his application under s 32.132 The Crown Prosecutor then made an application pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act for leave to cross-examine Mr Doran. The application was based on s 38(1)(b), that is that Mr Doran did not in his examination in chief make a genuine attempt to give evidence about matters of which he might reasonably be supposed to have knowledge. The Crown Prosecutor said that he could call a police witness who could give evidence that Mr Doran had refused to read his statement before giving evidence.133 Counsel for the appellant at the trial opposed the finding that Mr Doran was not making a genuine attempt to give evidence. However, her Honour expressed the tentative view that she was against counsel for the appellant on this point and hence it was not pressed any further.134 The appellant’s counsel then said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Let us presume for the moment that leave might be granted under s 38. The question then comes as to the potential for unfair prejudice under s 137…” 
        
       
      
    135 In support of this submission, counsel for the appellant pointed out that the statement was made in 1992; six years after the alleged conversation took place. It was further pointed out that the account of the conversation in the statement was in indirect rather than direct speech. It was also said that the conversation, if indeed it did occur, did so more than one year before the death of the deceased, “so there is a degree of remoteness in regard to the evidence the Crown wished to lead”.136 It was further submitted that Mr Doran had admitted to having psychiatric problems. Counsel for the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…if he is suffering from a mental illness at this time and he is allowed to be cross-examined, then the jury will be left with an inference that he is either bunging it on to retract or to protect the accused or that he is somehow associated with the accused and doing it to assist the accused, when in fact it may be merely a product of his own mental illness…” 
        
       
      
    137 It was also submitted that it was possible that Mr Doran had not told the truth when he made the statement to the police in 1992 and that he was seeking to avoid giving “an accurate recollection” because he was fearful of repeating his original lies. 138 On the basis of the above arguments, counsel for the appellant submitted that “the prejudice outweighs the probative value of any such conversation and to allow it would be unfair” and that leave should not be granted under s 38 (the transcript refers to s 138 but this is obviously an error).139 After hearing brief submissions from the Crown Prosecutor, her Honour announced her decision on the application under s 38 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It does appear to me that Mr Doran is not, so far as he has been examined in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence and I will grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine in relation to the matters that are contained in the record of interview of 8 December 1992 and evidence given by him on 8 May 1997”. 
        
       
       
      Apart from the above passage, the trial judge gave no further judgment on the application under s 38. 
       
      
    140 After leave had been granted, the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined Mr Doran in the presence of the jury about the statement he had made to the police in 1992, which was in question and answer form. Mr Doran said that what he had told the police in 1992 was true. However, at the time of giving evidence at the trial, he had a “very poor recollection” of the conversations between himself and the appellant concerning the appellant’s brother-in-law. Mr Doran agreed that the following questions and answers appeared in the statement: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. Is it correct during the course of our conversation that you told me that you had some information regarding the death of Fowler’s brother-in-law and that you had been approached by Fowler to help kill his brother-in-law 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Question 9: 
         
        Q. Can you now tell me in as much detail as you remember the conversation that you had with Warwick Fowler in relation to this incident? 
         
        A. Some time later in 1986 I was at Fowler’s Disco Donuts and having something to eat after hours. Fowler and I were talking and he started telling me about what a prick his brother-in-law was and that he was giving his sister a hard time. He said, ‘I’ve had a gutful of him and he has got to go. He said his sister rang him up all the time complaining about her husband treating her badly. He then asked me to go and give him a hand. I said ‘To do what?’ He said he was going to shoot his brother-in-law and to go with him and drive the car and pick him up after he had done the job. He said there was 10 grand in it. 
        
       
       
        
        “Question 10: 
         
        Q. What did you say in reply to this proposition? 
         
        A. I said ‘Get real. You must be joking’ or words to that effect. I said, ‘You’re mad, you’ll get caught’. He said, ‘No way. I’ll use hot ice and it will melt and there will be no evidence’. 
        
       
       
        
        Question 12: 
         
        Q. Did he ever discuss this matter with you again? 
         
        A. Yes. On one occasion not long after, he said he was heading for Sydney and if I wanted to come along. 
        
       
       
        
        Question 14: 
         
        Q. Did Fowler ever discuss instances about his brother-in-law on other occasions? 
         
        A. On numerous occasions he commented on what a prick his brother-in-law was and the trouble he was causing his sister. These conversations appeared to happen after he had spoken to his sister. Generally he was a placid sort of bloke. Every time he seemed agitated it was over his brother-in-law or his ex missus. 
        
       
       
        
        Question 15: 
         
        Q. Do you know if Fowler ever went to Sydney in relation to doing something against his brother-in-law? 
         
        A. On one occasion he said he was going to Sydney to do something with his brother-in-law. He led me to believe he went to Sydney there but apparently his brother-in-law went away and nothing happened. 
        
       
       
        
        Question 16: 
         
        Q. How do you know this information? 
         
        A. He told me. 
        
       
       
        
        Question 17: 
         
        Q. Do you remember the time and date this took place? 
         
        A. In the last four months of ’86. 
        
       
       
        
        Question 29: 
         
        Q. Is there anything else that you can help us with in this enquiry? 
         
        A. I’m absolutely certain of the facts about the conversations however the exact times and dates I am not certain of but the years they took place are correct”. 
        
       
      
    141 In cross-examination, Mr Doran agreed that he had made the statement in 1992, after the police had come to his property and given him the impression that he was in some sort of trouble because a car had been dumped on his property by Noella Harb’s brother. He denied having made up a story about the appellant in order to get rid of the police.142 As to his medical condition at the time of giving evidence, Mr Doran said, “I consider myself to be back on my feet, sort of”. He said that he was not currently taking any anti-depressants and had taken them for less than a year in about 1998. When asked, “Can you remember what your mental state was like when you came to sign that statement?” he replied, “I didn’t think I had any problems at the time”.143 As to the fact that his account of the 1986 conversation was in indirect speech, he explained that they were “just general summaries of what was said”, “because (he) could not remember the exact words of what was said six years after the event”.144 As to whether what he had said in the 1992 statement was true, he said that at the time of giving evidence he was unsure, but that “I’m not in the habit of signing a false document” and that he would only have signed the statement if it were true.145 Mr Doran agreed in cross-examination that the arrest of the appellant in October 1990 had received publicity in the Moree area, and that despite being aware of such, he did not provide the information contained in his statement to the police until 1992.146 In re-examination by the Crown Prosecutor, two answers given by Mr Doran to the police in 1992 were read. In these, Mr Doran said that he had not told the police about the appellant approaching him to help kill his brother-in-law at the time because he was frightened of what the appellant might do to him and his family if the former thought that he was informing on him. He finally told the police in 1992 because they had come to his property about another matter. In this regard, he said, “I can’t live with myself. It’s worried me ever since he asked me. I finally decided it was time to clear the air”. Mr Doran agreed that what he had said in those answers was true.147 In the present appeal, the appellant has submitted that the trial judge should have rejected the evidence of the alleged conversations between the appellant and Mr Doran on the ground that the evidence was not relevant. It was submitted that the times at which the conversations occurred were not sufficiently proximate to the time of the alleged murder to enable any inference that any state of mind of the appellant manifested in those conversations had continued up to the time of the alleged murder. Counsel cited R v O’Leary (1946) 73 CLR 566 at 577 and R v Adam (1999) 106 A Crim R 510 at 516.148 However, counsel for the appellant at the trial did not submit that Mr Doran’s evidence of the conversations was irrelevant. The submission which counsel made in opposing the granting of leave under s 38 was that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. In doing so, counsel implicitly accepted that the evidence was at least relevant.149 In our opinion, Mr Doran’s evidence regarding the conversations with the appellant, including the conversation described in the answers to questions 9 and 10, satisfied the criterion of relevance under s 55 of the Evidence Act, namely that it was evidence which, if accepted, could rationally affect directly or indirectly the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue at the trial. Further, we consider that evidence of the conversation described in answers 9 and 10 would have been relevant, even if it had stood by itself. The other evidence that on an occasion ""not long after"", ""in the last four months of '86"", the appellant said that he was going to Sydney to do something about his brother-in-law and asked Mr Doran if he wanted to accompany him heightened its relevance. There was also other evidence that “on numerous occasions” the appellant had talked of “what a prick his brother-in-law was” and of “the trouble he was causing his sister”.150 O’Leary and Adam, which the appellant has sought to rely on, differ from the present case, and what was said therein on the subject of relevance must be understood contextually. In each of those cases, the question arose whether evidence of an incident was admissible on the basis that it was an integral part of a connected series of events, lasting over a few hours or no more than a day. In Adam, the evidence in question (the admissibility of which is discussed at p 516 of 106 A Crim R) was that earlier on the night of the offence, the appellant had stared in a hostile manner at a person other than the victim of the offence.151 The principal submission made by the appellant in relation to this ground of appeal was that her Honour erred in granting leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine Mr Doran because she had not taken into account s 192 of the Evidence Act.152 Section 192 of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
         
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account: 
         
          
          (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and 
           
          (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and 
           
          (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and 
           
          (d) the nature of the proceeding, and 
           
          (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    153 In Stanoevski v The Queen (2001) 202 CLR 115, the High Court held that, in deciding whether leave should be granted under s 112 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine an accused about matters arising out of evidence of a kind referred to in Pt 3.8 of the Act (relating to “character”), a court must have regard to the matters contained in s 192.154 In R v Hogan [2001] NSWCCA 292, this Court referred to Stanoevski and held that s 192 applies generally to applications for leave under the Evidence Act, including applications for a grant of leave under s 38.155 Nowhere in the submissions made to her Honour or in any of the remarks made by her Honour in the course of the application is there any reference to s 192 of the Evidence Act. In our opinion, it can be inferred from this that in granting leave her Honour did not have regard to the provisions of s 192. The Crown has not disputed this conclusion in the present appeal. 156 However, the above conclusion does not necessarily mean that the appeal should succeed. In Stanoevski, McHugh J said at [56] that, notwithstanding a failure by a trial judge to refer to s 192 in deciding whether to grant leave under the Evidence Act, an appeal against conviction will not be upheld if the prosecution can establish that the conviction has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice. His Honour elaborated that one of the ways in which the prosecution can establish that no miscarriage of justice has occurred is by establishing that, had the trial judge had regard to s 192, “the trial judge could not reasonably have refused to grant leave”.157 In R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186, a case in which the trial judge had made a grant of leave under s 38 without having had regard to either s 192 or s 137, Heydon JA said at [49]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It follows that the s 38 order which the trial judge made was under an error of law. However, the conviction could still stand if the Crown could establish that the trial judge could not reasonably have refused to grant the prosecution’s application under s 38 even if all relevant provisions had been taken into account:  
        Stanoevski v The Queen 
         (2001) 202 CLR 115 at par 56 per McHugh J”. 
        
       
      
    158 In our opinion, for the reasons given below, had the trial judge had regard to s 192, she could not reasonably have refused to grant leave under s 38. 159 As regards s 192(2)(a), it was apparent from the evidence Mr Doran had already given in the absence of the jury (that he had no independent recollection of the contents of the statement) that the taking of his evidence would not be likely to add unduly to the length of the trial. Mr Doran’s entire evidence, interrupted though it was by the applications made by the Crown Prosecutor, was given in less than an afternoon of court time.160 As to s 192(2)(b), the appellant submitted that Mr Doran’s evidence should be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act because the probative value of the evidence he would give would be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. However, her Honour found that this was not the case. Given this conclusion, it is our opinion that, had she had regard to s 192(2)(b), her Honour could not reasonably have found that it would be unfair to the appellant to grant leave under s 38 so that the evidence could be elicited by cross-examination.161 As to s 192(2)(c), Mr Doran’s evidence would clearly be an important part of the Crown’s circumstantial case. As to s 192(2)(d), the proceedings were a criminal trial for murder. As to s 192(2)(e), there was no other power available to her Honour, the exercise of which would have brought about the adducing of evidence from Mr Doran. 162 We would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 9: The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act in respect of the evidence of Mr Doran. 
       
      
    163 In dealing with the eighth ground of appeal, we summarised the evidence given by Mr Doran at the trial and the stages in which his evidence was taken.164 Shortly before her Honour began her summing-up, she raised a number of matters with counsel, including “the s 165 direction sought”.165 Counsel for the appellant had prepared a document containing a “brief resume” of a direction under s 165, which he submitted her Honour should give. The Crown Prosecutor opposed the giving of such directions. This document was not available on the hearing of this appeal. 166 There was discussion between her Honour and counsel about whether Mr Doran’s evidence fell within any of the kinds of evidence listed in s 165(1). It was suggested that Mr Doran’s evidence might be evidence of “admissions” made by the appellant (s 165(1)(a)), within the definition of “admission” in Part 1 of the Dictionary at the end of the Act. Her Honour commented that, if a trial judge was required to give a warning under s 165 about any evidence which fell within the definition of “admission”, “that would have to mean that any evidence of what the accused person said that was proposed to be used by the Crown would have to be the subject of a s 165 warning” and that she would have to give a s 165 warning with respect to all the evidence relied on by the Crown as being evidence of lies told by the appellant in consciousness of guilt.167 On the question of whether evidence of lies told in consciousness of guilt is evidence of “admissions”, the Crown Prosecutor referred to the decision of Hulme J in R v Esposito (22 August 1997). However, as counsel for the appellant later pointed out, Hulme J was overruled on this point on appeal to this Court: R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442. In Esposito, it was held that evidence of statements made by an accused, even if on their face they were exculpatory, were nonetheless “admissions” within the definition in the Evidence Act if they were relied on as implied admissions of guilt as being lies told in consciousness of guilt.168 After hearing further argument her Honour said at p 603 of the trial transcript: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “What I had in mind doing was reminding the jury of the evidence given before they were sent out, which was fairly short, but suggest they might have thought he was being evasive, and not attempting to answer the questions. That he had said when he was cross-examined, he said he had no recollection of what he had said but he wasn’t in the habit of signing false statements. And then give another direction that they may have formed the view he was not being completely truthful. That they might find it difficult to believe the assertion that because of all that has happened to him since 1992 this event was insignificant. If they are sceptical about part of his evidence they might be sceptical about other parts of his evidence they might be sceptical about other things but they should scrutinise his evidence with some care and, having done so, decide to accept or reject it. 
        
       
       
        
        That witnesses who tell the truth about one thing are not necessarily telling the truth about everything, and vice versa. Refer to such evidence as there is of his mental condition, and then refer to his evidence which would include a reference to that part of it that is consistent with Noella Harb, and then remind them of the explanation given to the police for not having gone to the police sooner. 
        
       
       
        
        That is some sort of compromise. It is not intended to be a 165 unreliability direction and I do have difficulty with the proposition that it is a 165 case”. 
        
       
      
    169 There was further discussion between her Honour and counsel, parts of which were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “HER HONOUR: Do you persist in the submission that it is evidence properly characterised as 165 evidence? 
         
        HAESLER: Yes, I do. 
         
        HER HONOUR: Under which subparagraphs? 
         
        HAESLER: Mental health. 
         
        HER HONOUR: Not the admission? 
         
        HAESLER: Well, your Honour, the dictionary points to the part of the Evidence Act concerning admissions. 
         
        HER HONOUR: As I said to the Crown, I have difficulty with the proposition it is an admission in any sense, but it does seem to fit within the language”. 
         
        … 
         
        HER HONOUR: Do you accept that on that construction, on the most obvious construction of the definition, anything said by an accused of which the Crown sought to lead evidence, other than in its duty of fairness, would have to be the subject of a 165 direction unless the judge found there were good reasons for not doing so? 
         
        HAESLER: It would appear to be the case. 
         
        HER HONOUR: That would be the case in relation to any lies the Crown relied on? 
         
        HAESLER: Yes, it would, your Honour. 
         
        HER HONOUR: That points up how ludicrous it is. 
         
        HAESLER: That appears to be what it says. The law is not always rational, your Honour. 
         
        HER HONOUR: It may be a good reason under subs (3), but what the law apparently requires is ridiculous”. 
         
        … 
         
        HER HONOUR: The difficulty I have is not giving a direction about the potential difficulties with Mr Doran’s evidence. I recognise that that’s necessary. The difficulty is the warning in terms of subs (2), because that specifically requires the jury to be told that it might be unreliable. 
         
        HAESLER: I framed my written submissions in terms of (c) the mental health reasons, but there is nothing, and I wouldn’t resile from saying that the nature of the admission is something that requires that direction. Your Honour could say “No, in the circumstances, having considered all the matters, I will not exercise my discretion to give that warning or caution”. But in my submission, it would be appropriate to give that warning. That doesn’t mean you can’t say it with other things, giving balance to the Crown. But there is a real danger of this particular evidence, in the way it fell, being given too much prominence in this case. 
         
        HER HONOUR: I can’t make a decision at the moment. I will have a look at that overnight. I will certainly give some sort of direction about Mr Doran’s evidence, but whether it goes so far as to classify it as unreliable, potentially unreliable, I haven’t yet decided. Do you say I should go that far, Mr Crown? 
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour”. 
        
       
      
    170 The question of whether a s 165 direction should be given in regards to Mr Doran’s evidence was not raised again before her Honour gave her summing-up.171 In [100] of the summing-up, her Honour told the jury that “there are two (witnesses) whose credibility has been put in issue and who you have been invited to treat either very sceptically or with caution”. Her Honour told the jury that the first of these witnesses was Noella Harb and at [101]-[112] of her summing-up she discussed the evidence of that witness. In [113] of the summing-up, her Honour turned to Mr Doran.172 [113]-[124] of her Honour’s summing-up were in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “113. The next witness about whom I wish to speak is Mr Doran. This is evidence that does require careful scrutiny on your part. You might remember there was something unusual about the way in which he gave his evidence. I will just remind you of the circumstances in which his evidence was given. 
        
       
       
        
        114. Initially he came into the witness box, as did every other witness in the case and when he was asked questions by the Crown, he said he could not remember anything. You might remember that I then asked you to leave the Court for a short time, we had some discussions in the Court and when you came back I allowed the Crown to adduce Mr Doran’s evidence in a way that was different from the way other witnesses gave their evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        115. Effectively, what happened was that the Crown read to him answers that he had previously given in 1992 to police. Mr Doran continued to maintain that he had no recollection and he said that was because of all the unfortunate and disastrous things that had happened to him since 1992. He said he had four floods in three years, he had to shoot stock and he had suffered from depression. You may have formed the opinion that as a witness Mr Doran was somewhat fragile. You might remember he turned directly to you and explained to you that he regarded these events as insignificant because of what had happened to him in the meantime. 
        
       
       
        
        116. It is also necessary to observe that the position he adopted, that is that he could not remember anything, made it extremely difficult for Mr Haesler to cross-examine him. You might ask yourselves how do you cross-examine a witness who simply says, ‘I don’t remember anything’. Further, the events to which he referred in his interview with police which were put to you in that indirect way, allegedly occurred in 1986. He had said nothing about them until December 1992. In other words, he was telling police in 1992 about something that he said had happened six years previously. 
        
       
       
        
        117. The only evidence Mr Doran gave directly in this Court was that he was not in the habit of signing false statements and he maintained that. So that what you had, and what Mr Haesler had to deal with, is the contents of some information given by Mr Doran to police in 1992 about events in 1986 and of which Mr Doran said he now has no recollection. You can imagine I think, how difficult that would be to, that would make it for Mr Haesler to test that evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        118. One of the purposes of cross-examination is to test what the witness says, to possibly put alternative propositions, to confront the witness sometimes with something that has been said that was different. In the case of a witness who simply says, ‘I don’t remember anything now’, it is very difficult indeed to cross-examine and that was a handicap that Mr Haesler had to face. 
        
       
       
        
        119. You need to bear all this in mind in assessing Mr Doran’s credibility. I am going to read to you at a later stage the substance of the evidence he gave. The direction I am giving you at the moment is concerned with your approach to his evidence, given in this very unusual way. 
         
         
        120. In addition to that, Mr Haesler referred to what he described as Mr Doran’s mental illness and again, it is for you to assess whether that evidence has any impact on your acceptance of the substance of what he said in 1992. I will just remind you what was said about his mental condition and I will read it to you directly so it is completely accurate. Mr Haesler said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. What is your present diagnosis in regard to your mental condition, what do the doctors say? 
           
          A. I consider myself to be back on my feet, sort of. 
           
          Q. Are you taking antidepressants? 
           
          A. No. 
           
          Q. Were you taking antidepressants? 
           
          A. I was. 
           
          Q. What years were you taking antidepressants? 
           
          A. I couldn’t tell you. 
           
          Q. For years? 
           
          A. No, I wasn’t taking it for years. I stopped taking them because I found it was making me worse in some instances. 
           
          Q. When did you stop taking it? 
           
          A. That would be a couple of years ago “98. 
           
          Q. How many years did you take them for? 
           
          A. I didn’t take them for long actually. 
           
          Q. For more than a year? 
           
          A. No, it was under a year. 
           
          Q. You were suffering depression all through the nineties, weren’t you? It’s just got worse as the nineties went on? 
           
          A. I couldn’t tell you. 
           
          Q. Back in 1992 you were having trouble sleeping at night? 
           
          A. I wouldn’t know. 
           
          Q. Would you describe yourself as scared and paranoid? 
           
          A. No. 
           
          Q. You used those terms to police though, didn’t you? 
           
          A. I can’t remember’’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        121. And we will come later to the passages in the statement made by Mr Doran to police in which he used those expressions. 
         
         
        122. As I said, it is for you to assess whether Mr Doran was, in 1992, suffering from any mental illness such as to affect the credibility of what he said to police. I remind you how difficult it was for Mr Haesler to cross-examine or to test what he had said in 1992, in the face of his denials that he recalled anything of what had been said, either by him by police or by Mr Fowler to him. 
         
         
        123. In this context I point out it is not in dispute that Mr Doran told police in 1992 that the accused had stated an inclination and even an intention to harm Mr Climpson and he had given a reason for that. What is at issue here is whether what Mr Doran said in 1992 was the truth. As I said, it is very difficult to cross-examine on that when he maintains that he can’t remember any more. 
         
         
        124. I will come back to the detail of what Mr Doran said later. At the moment I mention him only as an example of a witness whose evidence you should look at carefully. I do not say by that, that you could not accept what he said previously, but you do need to give careful consideration to what he said for the reasons I have just outlined to you”. 
        
       
      
    173 At [189]-[198] of the summing-up her Honour summarised the evidence given by Mr Doran. In [191], she said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “191. I have reminded you Mr Doran told you from the witness box he had no recollection of telling this to the police and no recollection of the accused having said it to him, but it is accepted that he made that statement to police in 1992”. 
        
       
      
    174 In [392]-[393] of the summing-up, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “392. … One strand (of circumstantial evidence) may gain strength from another and in that respect I give you one illustration – I could use any of the pieces of evidence in this case, but I will refer to Mr Doran’s evidence about which you have been given a warning, a caution. 
        
       
       
        
        393. Those cautions do not mean that you must reject his evidence. They mean that you should not act on his evidence without giving it careful scrutiny. But, if having scrutinised the evidence you thought that his evidence gained some support, for example from the evidence given by Noella Harb, you would be entitled to use that as one of the strands in your cable”. 
        
       
      
    175 At [411] of her summing-up, her Honour reminded the jury about “what I said to you about treating his (Mr Doran’s) evidence with some caution”.176 It was submitted by the appellant in support of this ground of appeal that his counsel at the trial had made a request for the trial judge to give directions in accordance with s 165 in relation to Mr Doran’s evidence. This request was based on: firstly, Mr Doran’s evidence being evidence of admissions by the appellant within the definition of “admission” in Part 1 of the Dictionary at the end of the Act and hence was evidence within s 165(1)(a); and secondly, Mr Doran’s evidence being evidence the reliability of which might be affected by mental ill health and hence was evidence within s 165(1)(c). The appellant submitted that further grounds that could have been relied on were: firstly, “the age” of the alleged conversations and the inconsistency between Mr Doran’s evidence in chief and his evidence when cross-examined by the Crown; and secondly, although the trial judge had given certain directions about Mr Doran’s evidence, she had not, as required by s 165(2)(a), warned the jury that Mr Doran’s evidence might be unreliable.177 The relevant provisions of s 165 are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1)  
        This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
         
          
          (a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies,  
           
          (b) identification evidence,  
           
          (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like,  
           
          (d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,  
           
          (e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer,  
           
          (f) oral evidence of official questioning of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant,  
           
          (g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person---evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive.  
          
         
        (2)  
        If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
         
          
          (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and  
           
          (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and  
           
          (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.  
          
         
        (3)  
        The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.  
         
        (4)  
        It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.  
        
       
      
    178 It seems clear from the trial transcript that defence counsel did request that a warning be given under that section in respect of Mr Doran’s evidence on two bases: firstly, that it contained an “admission” under Part 3.4 of the Act; and secondly, the effects that the state of the witness’s mental health may have had on the reliability of the evidence. It also seems to be reasonably clear that her Honour ultimately declined to give a warning under that section as she was not persuaded that it applied to Mr Doran’s evidence. In particular, she thought it was inappropriate to warn the jury that his evidence may be unreliable in accordance with s 165(2)(a). Her Honour’s chief concern appeared to be the width of the term “admission” as defined for the purposes of the Act, and the potentially “ludicrous” or “ridiculous” results that would arise if the section applied to all evidence amounting to an admission under Part 3.4. There is some support for this view that a section of the Act should not be read literally if to do so would result in absurdity.179 Section 116 of the Act appears to mandate that where “identification evidence” as defined in the Act is admitted, the jury is to be informed of the “special need for caution” in respect of such evidence and the reasons for such caution. However, in Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] 77 ALJR 1433 the High Court held that, despite the wording of the section, it had no operation where the reliability of the identification of the accused was not an issue in the trial. Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in a joint judgment stated (at 1436): 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""[19] If read literally, and apart from its statutory context, s 116 could be taken to mean that a judge is always required to inform the jury that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence whenever identification evidence has been admitted, even if the reliability of the evidence is not in dispute. That would be absurd. If a witness claims to have seen an accused at a particular place on a particular occasion, and the truth of that assertion is not questioned or in any way put in issue, then ordinarily there is no special need for caution before accepting the evidence. The common law principle, expressed in the passage from  
        Domican 
         quoted above [(1992) 173 CLR 555 at 561], contains the obvious qualification that the warning is to be given where the reliability of the evidence of identification is disputed. The same qualification is implied in s 116; if it were otherwise the provision would offend common sense."" 
         
        
       
      
    180 McHugh and Gummow JJ stated (at 1441): 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""[53] The obligation imposed by s 116 must be read in the context of the adversarial system of criminal justice. It is not to be supposed that, in enacting that section, the legislature intended that juries be given directions concerning identification evidence when identification was not an issue. It is not to be supposed that the legislature intended a trial judge to give a direction that was not relevant to the issues in the case. Not only would it be a waste of curial time and effort but the giving of an irrelevant direction would be likely to confuse the jury who understandably would be puzzled as to what significance the direction had."" 
        
       
      
    181 However, it is unnecessary to construe s 165 in any particular way in order to avoid an absurd result or to ensure that unnecessary directions and warnings are not given to a jury. As her Honour noted, s 165(3) provides that the trial judge is not required to comply with s 165(2) where “there are good reasons for not doing so”. Clearly, if the reliability of any evidence falling within the section was not in issue at the trial, that would be a good reason for not complying with s 165(2).182 Further, it has been held that even though the evidence before a particular jury falls within one of the categories specified in s 165(1), a trial judge is not required to give a warning unless there is a real possibility that the evidence is unreliable: see R v Flood [1999] NSWCCA 198 at [14]; and generally R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301 at [95]. In R v Clark (2001) 123 A Crim R 506 at [70], this Court held that the opening words of the section qualified the words of the particular categories mentioned in s 165(1), so that even though the evidence fell within one of the categories, a warning was not required by the section where the evidence was not of a “kind that may be unreliable”. In Clark it was held that, in the circumstances of that case, there was no need for the trial judge to give a warning in relation to an indemnified witness, even if it were assumed that he was a witness otherwise falling within s 165(1)(d), because there was nothing about his evidence to suggest that it might be unreliable. In any event, a finding by a trial judge that there was no reason to suppose that the particular evidence under consideration might be unreliable would itself provide a good reason for the trial judge not to give a warning.183 The present ground of appeal asserts that her Honour erred in determining that the section did not apply in respect of Mr Doran’s evidence and, therefore, in failing to give a warning in terms of s 165(2). We are prepared to consider the matter on the basis that, prima facie at least, the section did apply to the evidence of Mr Doran in that it contained an admission for the purposes of Part 3.4. Although her Honour was concerned that inappropriate warnings might have to be given because of the width of the meaning of the word “admission” for the purposes of the Act, we do not believe that there is any need to read down the words in s 165(1)(a) or otherwise to limit the operation of s 165 in order to avoid the problems referred to in the passage we have quoted from the judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Danhoah.184 The purpose of the section is to ensure that the jury is alive to any factor that might adversely affect the weight to be given to evidence before them. If there is a real possibility that, without an appropriate warning from the trial judge, the jury might not identify such a factor or might not appreciate its importance or might in some other way be misled about the weight to be given to the evidence, a warning should be given. The risk of unreliability might arise for various reasons: the evidence is of a certain kind (such as hearsay evidence); the witness is of a certain class (such as a person implicated in the offence); the evidence might be affected by some personal characteristic of the witness (such as age); or the witness may be honestly mistaken (such as in identification evidence).185 Of course, the risk of unreliability might arise from the presence of a number of circumstances that impact upon the weight to be given to the evidence in different ways. For example, in the case of an admission there may be an issue about the reliability of the evidence that the accused made the statement amounting to the admission. That issue will arise where the evidence of the making of the admission is itself evidence of a kind that might be unreliable because, for example, the evidence comes from a prison informer. There may be a further issue about whether the statement made by the accused might itself be unreliable as an admission because, for example, of the accused’s mental condition at the time the statement was made.186 Where a party has requested a warning under s 165 about a particular witness or a particular piece of evidence, the trial judge must consider what issues (if any) were raised during the course of the trial about the reliability of the witness or the evidence, in order to determine whether a warning is required by the section and what the content of any such warning should be. If there was no issue raised about the reliability of any aspect of the evidence, then no warning should be given, notwithstanding that it might otherwise have fallen within the ambit of the section.187 If, for example, the Crown relies upon a lie allegedly told by an accused as evidencing a consciousness of guilt, the lie will amount to an admission for the purposes of Part 3.2 of the Act. Whether a warning under s 165 should be given about that evidence depends upon the issues raised in relation thereto during the trial. If there is no issue that the accused made the statement upon which the Crown relies, it is unlikely that any warning will be required. The directions to be given to the jury identifying the pre-conditions that must be fulfilled before the statement can be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt would be sufficient to fully alert the jury as to the way in which they are to consider that evidence and determine the issues raised before them. In such a case, there will usually be no risk of unreliability notwithstanding that the statement may amount to an admission for the purposes of the Act. A warning is not required where, even though it falls with the ambit of s 165(1)(a), the evidence is not “of a kind that might be unreliable” (applying Clarke), or where there are good reasons for not giving a warning (applying s 165(3)). If the accused denies making the statement relied upon by the Crown, the question of whether a s 165 warning is required will depend upon the nature of the attack made upon the evidence of the making of the disputed statement.188 Where the issue raised concerns the honesty of the witness’s evidence, a warning will not normally be required unless the witness falls within a category mentioned in s 165(1). As a general rule, the court has no particular advantage over a lay jury in determining whether a witness is telling the truth. General matters used by a tribunal of fact to assess a witness’s credibility, such as demeanour, consistency, recent invention, and the presence of a motive to lie are readily appreciated by members of a jury as part of their normal life experiences. In such a case, if anything needs to be said by the trial judge about the evidence, it would normally be sufficient for the judge to comment on the evidence by reminding the jury of criticisms of it made by counsel during addresses.189 In the present case, the evidence given by Mr Doran amounted to an admission for the purposes of Part 3.4 of the Act because the Crown was relying upon statements allegedly made by the appellant to him as proving a motive to kill the deceased and a previously expressed intention to do so. The two issues raised in respect of Mr Doran’s evidence were his honesty as a witness and, to a much lesser extent, whether he was suffering from some mental disorder at the time of making his statement to police or when giving evidence. The appellant’s case was that he never made the statements attributed to him by Mr Doran and he was deliberately lying when he made the statement to the police in 1992. In his address, defence counsel put to the jury that Mr Doran’s evidence was “complete nonsense” and “an invention from someone who was and is mentally ill”. He was critical of the circumstances in which Mr Doran came to give his statement to the police and submitted to the jury that he was lying, in particular, when he explained that he delayed telling the police about what the appellant had said because he was frightened of him.190 Insofar as the evidence of Mr Doran contained an admission, her Honour was right not to give a warning to the jury under s 165. The evidence did not fall within the ambit of the section. The principal attack upon the witness was that his statement to the police was untrue. In order to determine that issue, the jury was asked to take into account the circumstances in which Mr Doran came to make his statement to the police in 1992, including the period of delay after the appellant’s arrest and the fact that the police were investigating possible illegal activity by the witness at the time. There was nothing in the matters placed before the jury on the issue of Mr Doran’s credibility which the jury could not appreciate, understand and evaluate, relying only upon the collective common sense and experience of its members. We are of the opinion that, applying Clark, the evidence was not “of a kind that might be unreliable” within the terms of the section, notwithstanding that it was an admission under s 165(1)(a). We note that her Honour appropriately told the jury that the issue was one of Mr Doran’s credibility.191 In respect of the witness’s mental state, her Honour quoted verbatim the evidence arising from Mr Doran’s cross-examination. We have set out that passage earlier in the judgment. There was little (if any) evidence that the witness was suffering from a “mental illness” as defence counsel described it, either at the time he made the statement to the police, or at the time of giving evidence before the jury. The evidence revealed no more than that for some unspecified period the witness had suffered from depression and that he had taken anti-depressant medication for less than a year, ceasing its use in 1998. There was no evidence as to the effect of his depression or any medication he might have taken on his reliability. In any event, the witness stated in evidence that at the time of making the statement in 1992 he was “fit and well”. There was no evidence to the contrary. The jury was able to assess his demeanour at the time of giving evidence and what he said about his recollection of events. Her Honour left it to the jury to determine whether he might have been suffering from some “mental illness” and what effect it might have had on his reliability. There was no error in this approach, which, with respect, appears unduly favourable to the appellant. The evidence was not such that a warning was required under s 165.192 There was only one matter which might have been of importance to the assessment of the weight to be given to Mr Doran’s evidence in respect of which the jury needed the assistance of the trial judge: namely, the difficulty confronted by the defence in testing the evidence because of its nature and the way in which it was presented to the jury. However, as revealed in the passages of the summing up referred to above, her Honour was at pains to alert the jury to this difficulty and to assist them in understanding its relevance in an assessment of the witness’s credibility. Her Honour warned the jury on more than one occasion to approach Mr Doran’s evidence with care before acting on it. In our opinion, nothing more was required.193 In any event, the principal criticism made of what her Honour said about Mr Doran’s evidence was that she had not told the jury that it might be unreliable in accordance with s 165(2)(a). However, it is not necessary that any particular form of words be used where a warning under the section is being given: s 165(4). As we have already noted, unreliability might arise either because the evidence is deliberately untrue or because it is honest but mistaken. There is no reason why, in an appropriate case, the trial judge cannot choose some other word in preference to the word “unreliable” to make the distinction plain for the jury. In the present case, her Honour made it clear that the principal issue was one of credibility, in the sense that the defence was asserting that Mr Doran was lying to the jury. Her Honour told the jury why his evidence might be unreliable in that respect and cautioned them about relying upon it.194 The submission that there were further grounds for a warning under s 165, other than those relied upon by defence counsel at the trial, has no substance at all. The fact that the evidence concerned alleged conversations which took place in 1986 and which were not reported to the police until 1992 are not matters which fall within the ambit of s 165. This is not “evidence of a kind that might be unreliable”. Nor did the fact that there were inconsistencies in the witness’s evidence require or justify a warning. These are matters upon which her Honour might have made comment to the jury, but she was not required to do so in order for the appellant to receive a fair trial.195 This ground should therefore be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 10: The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of a conversation between the appellant and Noella Harb 
       
      
    196 Earlier in this judgment, we summarised the evidence given at the trial by Noella Harb, the appellant’s former wife. This evidence concerned a telephone call by Vicky Climpson and a subsequent conversation between the appellant and Ms Harb, in which the appellant had said that Vicky Climpson was very upset, that the deceased had been abusing and drugging her. Ms Harb said that the appellant “was quite upset at the time as well”.197 Ms Harb said in her evidence that she could not remember when this telephone call and conversation had occurred, or how long it was prior to the death of the deceased. However, the telephone call was to the house into which the appellant and Ms Harb had moved in 1985.198 In cross-examination, it was put to Ms Harb that she had invented the evidence about the telephone call and her conversation with the appellant and about the appellant himself being upset. This she denied. 199 On this appeal, it was submitted that her Honour erred in admitting this evidence of Ms Harb, on the basis that it did not pass the test of relevance enunciated in R v Adam.200 No objection was made at the trial to the giving of any of this evidence. Accordingly, leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is required before the admission of this evidence can be relied on as a ground of appeal.201 As we explained earlier in this judgment when dealing with the eighth ground of appeal, the statements of this Court in R v Adam on the subject of relevance must be understood in the particular context of that case.202 In our opinion, even though Ms Harb could not say how long before the death of the deceased the events of which she gave evidence had occurred, the events must have occurred no earlier than 1985 and her evidence passed the test of relevance under s 55 of the Evidence Act.203 We would refuse leave under r 4 to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 11: The trial judge erred in directing the jury that they could use the evidence of  
       
      the witness Noella Harb to support the evidence of Mr Doran 
       
      
    204 A preliminary submission was made that her Honour misstated Noella Harb’s evidence in the summing-up, saying at [101] and [108] that she had given evidence of telephone calls (in the plural) by Vicky Climpson, whereas Ms Harb had in fact given evidence about only one telephone call.205 However, when her Honour summarised Ms Harb’s evidence, she referred, and in detail, only to one telephone call. There was no risk of the jury being misled into thinking that Ms Harb had given evidence about more than one telephone call.206 In order to consider properly the principal submission made in support of this ground of appeal, it is necessary to say something about the structure of her Honour’s summing up. At [149], her Honour told the jury that the Crown relied on five different categories of circumstantial evidence, the second of which was evidence of motive. Her Honour dealt with the evidence of motive relied on by the Crown in [180]-[196] of the summing up. In [182], she said that evidence of motive came from two sources, the first being Noella Harb. In [183]-[185], her Honour accurately summarised the evidence of Ms Harb regarding the telephone call by Vicky Climpson, the subsequent conversation between herself and the appellant, and the appellant’s emotional state. In [189], her Honour said that the other source of evidence of motive was Mr Doran. Her Honour commented that Mr Doran’s evidence, insofar as it was evidence of motivation “is, to some extent, consistent with the evidence of Noella Harb”. In [190], her Honour quoted accurately the evidence, which Mr Doran had given, by means of his statement, about the conversation in 1986 between himself and the appellant and about what the appellant had said on other occasions about his brother-in-law.207 In [362], her Honour, as part of what she described as a “very short sharp summary” of the Crown’s circumstantial case, said with respect to the evidence of motive: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The next circumstance is motive. The Crown Prosecutor relies on the evidence of Noella Harb and Ron Doran. Remember what I have said to you about the evidence of each of those and also you are entitled to use the evidence of each of them to strengthen the other…” 
        
       
      
    208 After her Honour had concluded her principal summing-up, the jury asked, at intervals, a number of questions. In particular, the jury asked whether it could have a copy of her Honour’s directions or whether her Honour could clarify “the direction with regards to circumstantial evidence”. Her Honour gave the jury further directions, including the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “410. I pointed out that it is not necessary for each one of those facts and circumstances to be proved to you beyond reasonable doubt. Sometimes one fact on which the Crown relies might initially appear not very strong, but may gain strength when you put it together with the evidence, or with another fact or circumstance, or you put the evidence of a witness together with the evidence of another witness. 
        
       
       
        
        411. An example of that in this case is the evidence of motive. Ms Harb gave evidence on which you might infer that the accused had a motive to kill Mr Climpson. That of course was attacked on behalf of the accused. There was some support for what she said in the evidence of Mr Doran and you will remember the attack that was made upon Mr Doran and what I said to you about treating his evidence with some caution. But those two pieces of evidence are an example of what I am saying to you now about how one circumstance or one fact might gain strength from another circumstance or fact in the case, or the evidence of one witness might gain strength from the evidence of another witness in the case”. 
        
       
      
    209 It was submitted that [362] and [410]-[411] of her Honour’s summing up were erroneous and unduly magnified the strength and reliability of Noella Harb’s evidence.210 At the trial, no complaint or request for a re-direction was made by counsel for the appellant with respect to what her Honour had said in either [362] or [410]-[411], and accordingly leave under r 4 is required to rely on this ground of appeal. 211 In our opinion, there was no error in what her Honour said in either [362] or [410]-[411]. A jury is entitled, if it sees fit, and particularly in a circumstantial evidence case, to regard evidence of one circumstance as strengthening the evidence of another circumstance and the evidence of one witness as strengthening the evidence of another witness. Although certain parts of the joint judgment of Gibbs CJ and Mason J in Chamberlain v The Queen (No.2) (1983-1984) 153 CLR 521 no longer represent the law, the following passages at 535 are still authoritative: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “At the end of the trial the jury must consider all the evidence, and in doing so they may find that one piece of evidence resolves their doubts as to another. For example, the jury, considering the evidence of one witness by itself, may doubt whether it is truthful, but other evidence may provide corroboration, and when the jury considers the evidence as a whole they may decide that the witness should be believed. 
         
        … 
         
        Similarly, in a case depending on circumstantial evidence, the jury should not reject one circumstance because, considered alone, no inference of guilt can be drawn from it. It is well established that the jury must consider ‘the weight which is to be given to the united force of all the circumstances put together’”. 
        
       
      
    212 We do not accept that in [362] or [410]-[411] or elsewhere in the summing up her Honour inaccurately magnified the strength and reliability of the evidence of Noella Harb. In the summing up, her Honour referred to the criticisms, which had been made of Ms Harb’s evidence, and to the appellant’s response to her evidence in the statement he had made at the trial.213 We would refuse leave under r 4 to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 12: The trial judge erred in her directions to the jury in respect to Noella Harb 
       
      
    214 In cross-examination, Noella Harb was shown copies of a number of cheques, with the corresponding cheque butts, which had been drawn on the bank account of the business conducted by the appellant and herself. She agreed in cross-examination that she had written out or altered the cheques. She further agreed that the amount shown on each cheque was greater than the amount shown on the corresponding cheque butt. The following question and answer then occurred: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. And what you were doing was writing in the cheque butt an amount which matched the amount for which a bill was due, and on the cheque itself you were adding, in some cases, a couple of hundred dollars and you were pocketing the difference, paying the bill with the amount matched on the cheque butt, but keeping the true amount which was written on the cheque or the difference between that butt and the true amount written on the cheque? 
         
        A. That’s right.” 
        
       
      
    215 Ms Harb said that she had engaged in this conduct because she knew that she would soon be leaving the appellant and she was in need of money. She agreed that her conduct had been deceptive and dishonest.216 It was submitted that, in [109] of the summing-up, her Honour erred in leaving it to the jury to determine whether Ms Harb’s conduct had been dishonest or deceitful. 217 What her Honour said at [109] of the summing up was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Mr Haesler’s submission to you was in quite clear terms: That you would not believe Ms Harb because she had shown herself to be dishonest and deceitful during her preparations for departure from the matrimonial home and after her husband had been charged with murder when she sought to take money from the drawer at the shop. It is for you to consider whether her conduct in that way was dishonest, in the sense that would affect your assessment of her credibility. Was her conduct in her preparations for leaving the matrimonial home dishonest or deceitful and, if it was, does that have a bearing on whether you accept her evidence in this Court? The Crown argued that her behaviour in relation to the separation from her husband is irrelevant to her truthfulness on oath in a criminal court”. 
        
       
      
    218 At the trial, no complaint or request for a redirection was made in relation to [109].219 In our opinion, there was no error in what her Honour said at [109]. The evaluation of Ms Harb’s conduct and the making of an assessment of whether her conduct, should it be regarded as dishonest, affected the credibility of her evidence were pre-eminently matters within the province of the jury. Her Honour was not obliged to direct the jury that it had to regard Ms Harb’s conduct as dishonest.220 It was also submitted that her Honour erred in telling the jury in [111] of the summing up: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “It is necessary to comment on the level of iniquity of which Ms Harb is accused by Mr Haesler on behalf of his client. It is difficult to imagine a more serious or evil act than to take steps to have another person charged with murder, that is, to have another person falsely charged with murder. This is one of those instances in which you make your assessment of the witnesses. You had the opportunity of observing Ms Harb in the witness box, you should consider how she impressed you. Did she strike you as the sort of person who might engage in the sort of behaviour that is now attributed to her? Remember, it was not just any person she is said to have set up for a murder charge, it is the father of her children”. 
        
       
      
    221 It was submitted that the terms of [111], and in particular the use of the expression “level of iniquity"", amounted to an invitation to the jury to reject the defence submission that Ms Harb had been lying in her evidence.222 At the trial, no complaint or request for a redirection was made in relation to [111].223 In a criminal trial, it is permissible for a trial judge, within certain limits, to comment on arguments advanced by counsel, including defence counsel. The argument by defence counsel did postulate “a high level of iniquity” on the part of Ms Harb, namely a preparedness to give knowingly false evidence in support of a charge of murder against the father of her children. In our opinion, her Honour’s comment was permissible.224 We would refuse leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely on this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 13: The trial judge erred in her directions to the jury on the accused’s statement. 
       
      
    225 The appellant made an unsworn statement. Her Honour’s directions with respect thereto are to be found in [159] and [160] of the summing up, where she directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “159. An unsworn statement is something the law requires you to take into account as one possible version of the facts. What weight you give it is a matter for you. Such a statement is not evidence in the same sense as the statement of a witness given on oath. It has not been made under the sanction, that is, the binding obligation imposed by an oath or affirmation to tell the truth. You saw some witnesses take oaths, some affirmations. It makes no difference, it obliges them to tell the truth. Nor has it been possible to test what the accused said in his unsworn statement by cross examination. An unsworn statement is not subject to cross-examination by the Crown. 
         
         
        160. You may take those circumstances into account in determining what weight you give to the statement he made. That is not to suggest that the sworn evidence is to be preferred to an unsworn statement. My only purpose in giving you this direction is to point that when determining what weight should be given to that statement, you are entitled, if you think it appropriate, to take into account the fact that it is not on oath and it has not been subject to cross-examination, but you must nevertheless keep firmly in mind that the onus at all times remains on the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. He had a right not to give sworn evidence and indeed he had a right to say nothing to you at all. He has exercised the right to make an unsworn statement.” 
         
        
       
      
    226 Her Honour returned to this matter in [370] and [371], where she reminded the jury of her earlier directions as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “370. But I remind you firstly about the statement made to you by the accused. As I said, he was not obliged to give sworn evidence. He could have done so if he had chosen. Equally he could have remained silent if he had chosen. You may think in fact he has taken the middle course. The unsworn statement must be taken into account as one possible version of the facts. The weight you give it is a matter for you. It is not evidence in the same sense as evidence given by witnesses from the witness box. That evidence is given on oath, a statement is not. A statement is not made under an obligation to tell the truth. It has not been possible for the Crown to test what the accused said by cross-examination. 
         
         
        371. You can take those circumstances into account in determining the weight that you give to what he said. I am not suggesting that sworn evidence is to be preferred to the unsworn statement, I am giving you this direction in order to point out that when determining what weight should be given to the statement, you are entitled to take into account the fact that it is not on oath, it has not been the subject of cross-examination, you should not lose sight of the fact that the onus at all times remains on the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.” 
         
        
       
      
    227 The appellant submitted that her Honour erred in instructing the jury that the appellant’s statement had “not been made under the sanction, that is, the binding obligation imposed by an oath or affirmation to tell the truth” ([159]) and that “a statement is not made under an obligation to tell the truth” ([370]). It was submitted that the effect of these directions was to unduly emphasise that what the appellant had said was in a different and possibly inferior category to the other evidence given in the trial. It was further submitted that such directions were of particular concern where so much emphasis had been placed by the Crown and by her Honour on established and asserted lies.228 In our opinion, there is no substance in these submissions. As was submitted by the Crown on this appeal, it would have been apparent to the jury that the appellant gave “evidence” in a manner notably different to that of the other witnesses. It was important that the jury be given proper instructions concerning the distinction between the different modes of evidence in order that it not make any inappropriate assumptions. In any event, her Honour made it clear in [160] of her summing up that it was not suggested that sworn evidence was to be preferred to an unsworn statement. 229 There was a morning tea adjournment shortly after the directions in [159] and [160], when the opportunity arose the appellant’s counsel to raise any objection or concerns with respect to the passages in question. No such objections or concerns were raised. Furthermore, just prior to the luncheon adjournment on the same day, her Honour asked counsel whether there was anything arising out of what she had said thus far and counsel answered in the negative. In addition, before the summing up commenced, the appellant’s counsel had discussed with her Honour her proposed directions with respect to the appellant’s unsworn statement. It was after that discussion that her Honour instructed the jury in the terms recorded above. Given that there was no request by counsel for a further direction on this matter, it can be inferred that counsel considered that her Honour’s directions were consistent with those which he had himself sought prior to the commencement of the summing up, and that they manifested no unfairness to the appellant. 230 For the foregoing reasons, we would refuse leave under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules for the appellant to rely upon this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Appeal against sentence 
      
    231 As was indicated at the commencement of this judgment, the primary judge sentenced the appellant to 10 years and 10 months imprisonment commencing on 20 February 2001, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 10 months to expire on 19 December 2007. It is asserted by the appellant that her Honour made three errors in arriving at this sentence: firstly, it was not open to her to sentence the appellant on the basis that he fired one or more of the shots that killed the deceased; secondly, that her Honour failed to take into account the period during which he was subject to bail conditions; and thirdly, that her Honour ought to have found special circumstances.232 In order to indicate the basis upon which her Honour determined the period of the sentence imposed, it is necessary to refer briefly to the history of the matter. The appellant was first convicted of the offence on 28 October 1993. Newman J sentenced him, in accordance with the statutory regime then operating, to a minimum term of 13 years 6 months imprisonment with an additional term of 6 years imprisonment. The sentence was to begin on 18 March 1994, the date upon which the sentence was imposed. The minimum term fixed by his Honour took into account a period of 6 months that the appellant had spent in custody on remand. The total sentence was, therefore, effectively 20 years imprisonment.233 The appellant was released to bail following the quashing of his conviction on 15 November 1995. He had served about 1 year and 8 months of the sentence imposed upon him. He remained on bail until he was convicted after the second trial.234 The appellant was again convicted of murder on 4 June 1997. Dowd J sentenced the appellant on 23 June 1997 to a minimum term of 9 years 10 months imprisonment with an additional term of 4 years. The sentence was to commence from the date of the conviction. This sentence was less severe than that imposed after the first trial because, unlike Newman J, Dowd J was not satisfied on the material before him that the appellant had fired any of the shots that wounded the deceased. Taking into account the period served by the appellant, the effective total sentence imposed was 16 years imprisonment.235 The appellant was again released to bail on 31 May 2000, following the quashing of the second conviction. The primary judge calculated that, at the time she was to sentence the appellant, he had spent a total of 5 years, 1 month and 16 days in custody.236 Her Honour approached the task of sentencing the appellant having regard to the usual convention that the sentence following re-trial should normally be no greater than that imposed after the original conviction: see R v MM [2002] NSWCCA 431, and the cases cited and discussed therein. As the Crown did not contend otherwise, her Honour determined to impose the same sentence that had been imposed by Dowd J. This was notwithstanding that her Honour found beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant fired at least one of the shots, which fatally wounded the deceased.237 Although it was argued before us that her Honour was not entitled to come to that finding, there is no need to resolve that issue. Her Honour indicated that she was not increasing the sentence beyond that imposed by Dowd J, even though she was sentencing the appellant upon a different factual basis. Apart from the matter to which we will shortly refer, there was no reason for her Honour to have imposed a sentence less than that imposed by Dowd J, even had she not found that the appellant was a principal in the first degree. In any event, we doubt that on the facts and circumstances of this particular matter there was a significant difference in the degree of criminality between the person firing the shots and a person present assisting or encouraging the principal to do so, given that the killing was obviously premeditated and planned. Both Newman and Dowd JJ described it as an assassination. The deceased was murdered in retribution for his conduct towards the appellant’s sister.238 The only basis upon which it is asserted that the primary judge should have imposed a lesser sentence was that her Honour failed to take into account: the history of the appellant’s conditional liberty pending the proceedings leading to his conviction on the third occasion; the uncertainty for the appellant caused by three trials; and the length of time since the commission of the offence. This criticism must be viewed in the light of the manner in which the sentencing proceedings were conducted before her Honour.239 During the course of her sentencing remarks, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Although counsel for the prisoner has noted that the prisoner has undergone the undoubted stress of three trials and has, whilst at liberty, endured and complied with relatively onerous bail conditions, including regular reporting, he has not argued that the sentence now to be imposed should be any less than the sentence selected by Dowd J, other than to take account of almost three years of that sentence served before the prisoner was released to bail."" 
         
        
       
      Her Honour then stated that she did not believe that the appellant was entitled to any other reduction of the sentence imposed by Dowd J. 
       
      
    240 The appellant relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Keyte (unreported, 16 March 1986) to support the submission that the sentence was excessive. In that case, conditional liberty by way of bail over a lengthy period was taken into account in determining the outcome of the appeal as representing a “penal consequence” already suffered by the applicant before the Court. The appeal related to a sentence of 2 years imprisonment imposed for an offence of supplying a relatively small quantity of Indian hemp. The applicant was 29 years of age, without any previous convictions and had been on bail for three years leading up to the hearing of the appeal. Although the Court considered that some custodial sentence would have been called for at the time of sentence, it intervened to quash the sentence and imposed a bond and fine.241 In the present case, the appellant was first granted bail on 14 November 1990, approximately one month after his arrest for the murder. The conditions of bail required him to remain in Moree, unless he was attending conferences with his legal advisers, and to report to the police three times a day. On 18 November 1991, the reporting conditions were varied so that he was required to report to police twice daily. On 8 April 1993, the bail conditions were again varied, requiring him to report once a day. The appellant went into custody following his conviction before Newman J on 28 October 1993. After this conviction was quashed on appeal, he was again released on bail on 15 November 1995. It was a condition of his bail that he was to reside with his mother and to report to police twice a week. He was also required to surrender his passport. He was returned to custody on 4 June 1997, following his conviction before Dowd J. On 31 May 2000, he was again released on bail following the quashing of the conviction on appeal. It was a condition of that bail that he was to reside with his mother and report to police once a week.242 We accept that in an appropriate case the length and terms of an offender’s period on bail awaiting trial or sentence is a matter relevant to the determination of the proper sentence to be imposed. What weight is to be given to such a matter will vary from case to case, depending upon what other factors need to be considered and what sentence is required in the particular case to address the purpose of punishment. Where that purpose is the protection of the community and the conditions of bail are particularly onerous, such as where the offender has been required to reside at a rehabilitation establishment, very significant weight might be placed upon such a factor where it is appropriate having regard to the nature of the offence. However, in other cases, less weight may be given to such a consideration, particularly where the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is required for the purposes of denouncing the crime and reflecting general deterrence.243 There was here an obvious and significant disruption to the appellant’s life and restrictions upon his liberty over a lengthy period as a result of the offence he committed. Dowd J, while accepting that this was a relevant matter, declined to reduce the sentence by reason of the period served on bail. The primary judge also appears to have accepted that it was a relevant matter, as was the uncertainty undoubtedly felt by the appellant during the period involving the three trials. But her Honour was not required to reduce the sentence because of these considerations. Clearly her Honour viewed the sentence imposed by Dowd J as the very least that the appellant should serve for the offence he committed. Experienced counsel, who appeared for the appellant, seems to have been of the same view. We are also of that opinion. There was no error in the sentence imposed on the appellant.244 Nor is there any merit in the submission that these same considerations should have given rise to a finding of special circumstances. They are not the type of matters that would justify a reduction in the non-parole period from that which would automatically flow from the operation of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There is nothing to indicate that a longer period of supervision on parole is warranted and no other reason why the otherwise appropriate non-parole period should be reduced. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    245 It follows from the foregoing that the orders of the Court are as follows: 
     
      
       
      a) Appeal against conviction is dismissed; 
       
      b) Leave to appeal against sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the inadequacy of sentence imposed by Payne DCJ in the Penrith District Court on 29 May 2003. The respondent was sentenced on five principal charges to which he had previously pleaded guilty before a magistrate and had been committed for sentence. 
     
      
    2 Her Honour also took into account two series of offences on respective Forms 1. Without detailing the structure of the individual sentences, the effective consequence was a head sentence of three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year and nine months. 
     
      
    3 The respondent was born on 11 November 1983. He had a significant, substantially juvenile, prior record. Among entries on the record were findings of guilty for two charges of robbery whilst armed in respect of which, in April 1996, without conviction, the respondent was subjected to a control order for a total term of five months. 
     
      
    4 On 19 March 1997 he appeared in the Sydney District Court and was convicted on two counts of assault with intent to rob and sentenced to a minimum term of twelve months and sixteen days, together with an additional term of one year eleven months and twelve days, the custodial portion of which was to be served in a juvenile justice centre. 
     
      
    5 On 15 December 2000 the respondent again appeared before a Children’s Court on five counts of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, and on each count was subjected to a control order without conditions for twelve months, with a non-parole period of twelve months. 
     
      
    6 On 2 October 2001 he again appeared before a Children’s Court on charges of robbery, affray and attempting to escape from lawful custody, for which offences he was again subjected to control orders. He lodged an appeal to the Penrith District Court. He was in detention pending the hearing of that appeal which was scheduled for 1 March 2002. He absconded from detention on 2 January 2002 and was at large until arrested on 14 July 2002. 
     
      
    7 On the following day he was convicted of an offence of goods in custody at Blacktown Local Court and sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of one month, which term accordingly expired on 13 August 2002. There are other offences on his record, but I have scheduled the apparently more serious ones. 
     
      
    8 The facts found by her Honour for the purpose of sentence were expressed in a somewhat unconventional fashion and, by way of example, I recite those pertinent to the first charge; 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Date: 23 February 2002. Offence: break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, larceny. Location: Woodcroft. Amount: $24,052. Section, maximum penalty: Section 112(1), fourteen years imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    9 I am moved to comment that expression which is produced along the lines of some formula which can be likened to a filled-in form may not serve the primary purpose of remarks on sentence of advising an offender of why he or she is to be subjected to the assessed punishment about to be meted out. I am conscious that there are secondary purposes which may not be so affected, such as exposing reasons as to enable an appellate court to adjudicate if necessary, and publication for general deterrence and the information of the public, but in my view, informing the one who is to suffer punishment is the primary purpose of remarks, and this is not done by incantations of references in terms which the offender cannot reasonably be expected to understand. 
     
      
    10 The evidence before the sentencing Court included “facts sheets” to which her Honour made reference by exhibit number, but it is appropriate in order to achieve a proper understanding of what was involved in the offences to examine those facts. We are today informed of some supplementary facts to which I will later turn. I shall first summarise the facts as they were stated in the Court below. 
     
      
    11 In relation to the first charge, between 7.30 pm and 10 pm on Sunday 23 February 2002 the respondent went to premises in Woodcroft which were locked and secured. He went to the rear yard and forced entry through a ground floor door and, once inside, he searched several rooms and stole property. This included lady’s earrings, wristwatch and a handbag containing perfume, $70 in cash, mobile telephones, photographic, computer and electronic equipment, keys and remote alarm controls for two vehicles, the total value of which was stated at $24,052. The respondent decamped with the property, which he disposed of in return for cash and drugs. 
     
      
    12 For this offence her Honour imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment commencing on 12 August 2002 and expiring on 11 August 2004, with a non-parole period of fifteen months. 
     
      
    13 In relation to the second charge, at about 7 pm on Friday 15 March 2002 the respondent and a co-offender, then aged seventeen years, went to different premises in Woodcroft. They went to the side ground floor window of the premises and forced entry by breaking it. Once inside they stole property from numerous rooms including a mobile telephone, electronic and photographic equipment, clothing, and a lady’s black handbag containing jewellery and other property, the total value of which was stated to be $11,000. 
     
      
    14 The respondent and his co-offender moved the property to the garage of the premises where a Toyota Camry motor vehicle was stored. The keys to that vehicle had been acquired and they decamped in it with the stolen property. The vehicle was later dumped at Doonside and was recovered by police the next day in Penrith, where it was discovered to have been involved in a collision and was severely damaged. The value of the vehicle was stated to be $26,500. The stolen property was disposed of in return for cash and drugs. 
     
      
    15 On the charge of aggravated breaking, entering and stealing, the respondent was sentenced to two years seven months imprisonment, commencing on 12 August 2002 and expiring on 11 March 2005, with a non-parole period of one year six months. Four offences on a Form 1 were taken into account. 
     
      
    16 An offence of taking and driving a conveyance relating to the acquisition of the Toyota Camry motor car was taken into account on the Form 1. 
     
      
    17 In relation to the third charge, during one evening between Thursday 21 March 2002 and Sunday 24 March 2002, the respondent and another co-offender, also aged seventeen years, went to a third premises in Woodcroft. They entered the premises through an open garage door and the respondent smashed a hole through a gyprock wall thus gaining access to the inside of the premises. 
     
      
    18 Once inside they stole a DVD/video player and a watch, the total value of which was stated to be $780. That property was disposed of in return for cash and drugs. 
     
      
    19 For this offence the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for one year and ten months, commencing on 12 August 2002 and expiring on 11 June 2004, with a non-parole period of twelve months. 
     
      
    20 In relation to the fourth charge, at about 7 pm on Friday 7 June 2002, the respondent went to a fourth premises in Woodcroft, the address of which suggests that it was two doors away from the premises mentioned in the facts concerning the third charge. He went to the rear yard of the premises and entered through a rear sliding door which was open and unlocked. There were several people inside the premises at the time and he saw them. 
     
      
    21 From the rear kitchen area he stole three mobile telephones and a bum bag, the total value of which was stated to be approximately $2,300. He left the premises but was later contacted by the victims on the stolen mobile telephone services and he directed verbal abuse at the callers. He later disposed of the mobile phones in return for cash and drugs. 
     
      
    22 On this charge the respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for one year and eight months, commencing on 12 August 2002 and expiring on 4 April 2004 with a non-parole period of twelve months. 
     
      
    23 In relation to the fifth charge, between midday and 10 pm on Saturday 22 June 2002, the respondent broke and entered premises at Granville by moving a window to a bedroom off its track. Once inside the premises the respondent stole property including computer and electronic equipment, jewellery, clothing, cordless and mobile telephones, sunglasses, a lady’s handbag and dress watches, the value of which was stated to be $10,000. 
     
      
    24 For this offence her Honour imposed a sentence, taking into account two offences on a Form 1, of two years and three months commencing on 12 May 2003 and expiring on 11 August 2005, with a non-parole period of twelve months, commencing on 12 May 2003 and expiring on 11 May 2004. Her Honour directed the release of the respondent to parole on the last mentioned date. 
     
      
    25 I have mentioned above the offence taken into account in the sentence on the second charge relating to the Toyota Camry sedan. Three other offences were taken into account on that sentence. 
     
      
    26 On 27 May 2002 at 9 am the respondent went to yet another house in Woodcroft, which was locked and secured. He attempted to force entry but triggered an alarm whereupon he decamped the premises without stealing any property. A short time later he went to still other premises in the suburb, which were locked and secured. He used a small hammer to break a rear bathroom window and gained entry thereby. Inside the premises he stole property including a wristwatch, clothing, television and electronic equipment, the total of which was said to be $10,270.  
     
      
    27 The fourth offence taken into account related to yet another house in Woodcroft, into which the respondent on 20 June 2002 gained entry by opening a sliding door, which was closed but unlocked. He stole property including mountain bikes, a photographic camera and a torch, the value of which was stated to be $900. He later disposed of the property in return for cash and drugs. 
     
      
    28 As also indicated, two offences were taken into account when sentence was imposed in relation to the fifth charge. The first of these involved breaking into the same premises as were concerned in the fifth charge. Between Thursday 6 June and Sunday 9 June, again by moving a window from its track as he did on the later occasion, the respondent entered and stole a DVD player, the value of which was stated to be $300. 
     
      
    29 The second offence taken into account was committed on Thursday 11 July 2002 when the respondent removed a flyscreen and forced a window to the bathroom of other premises in Granville. Once inside he stole property, including photographic and electronic equipment with a stated value of $2,500. 
     
      
    30 As can be observed from the preceding statements, all of the offences by the respondent were committed whilst he was at large after absconding from detention. 
     
      
    31 Although the respondent made full admissions to his crimes when interviewed by police, including the disposal by him of the stolen property, he would not inform police where he disposed of that property. Save the damaged car, none has been recovered. 
     
      
    32 There were significant factors to be taken into account in assessing subjective matters. Her Honour stated that she had taken into account the content of a pre-sentence report, a juvenile justice report and a psychological report, but did not elaborate. She also adverted to the respondent’s previous record, which was correctly described in Crown submissions as “extensive”. I have made some reference to this earlier. 
     
      
    33 Her Honour’s remarks included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The prisoner is still only a young man, he having been born on 11 November 1983. He is now aged about nineteen and a half years. He has spent a considerable part, if not the large bulk of his life, in juvenile custody. This is tragic for him and his offending is very bad for the community. 
         
         
        The prisoner had a very difficult early life. His intellectual functioning is below average. 
         
         
        .... 
         
         
        Given his age, his rehabilitation must be of consideration. In my view there are certainly special circumstances in this case. The Crown accepted that this was so. See also the pre-sentence report at page 4, under supervision. He will need assistance with institutionalisation which he must be suffering from. Also he has a history of drug abuse. He has other conditions noted in the psychological report.” 
        
       
      
    34 It is convenient to turn to a written submission by the Crown in terms that it is suggested that insofar as her Honour took into account the respondent’s attention deficit hyperactive disorder as meriting a reduction of sentence imposed, her Honour fell into error. R v Dunn [2003] NSWCCA 169 is cited as authority for this proposition. 
     
      
    35 In fact, her Honour made no reference to the specific disorder, although she did direct attention to a psychological report in which this, amongst other things, is mentioned. R v Dunn is not authority for the wide proposition advanced by the Crown. As Meagher ACJ pointed out in that case, the sentencing judge had found that such a malady had nothing to do with the commission of the subject offences and it was therefore irrelevant to the appeal. 
     
      
    36 Barr J referred to cases supporting the principle, well accepted, that offenders suffering from mental illness or having severe intellectual deficit are usually not suitable persons, in respect of sentence, upon whom an element of general deterrence is appropriate. The Crown submission should be rejected. It might be noted that her Honour stated specifically that: 
     
      
       
        
        “General deterrence must be a feature of this sentencing exercise.” 
        
       
      
    37 A submission is made on behalf of the respondent that, contrary to Crown submissions, he was not on any form of conditional liberty at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    38 It is true that the tabulation of factors in the guideline judgment in Re Attorney General’s Application No 1 (Ponfield) 1999 45 NSWLR 327 does not include a factor in terms of the offence being committed whilst the offender is at large after escaping from lawful custody. However, the first stated factor of enhanced seriousness is commission of an offence whilst at conditional liberty on bail or parole and it scarcely would need expression that it is, in a scale of seriousness, above that to commit an offence when one is not lawfully at liberty at all. 
     
      
    39 I recognise that counsel for the respondent does not contend that the status of the respondent as an absconder from detention is not capable of being regarded as an aggravating feature, but to foreclose submissions in the future, I would expressly state that “offence committed whilst the offender is unlawfully at large” should notionally be added to the table in Ponfield. 
     
      
    40 It is again observed that all of the offences for which the respondent appeared for sentence, including those taken into account, were committed whilst he was an absconder from detention. 
     
      
    41 In my view the principal issue to be addressed by this Court is whether the sentences, given their overall effect, are so low that they fail to give proper reflection to the respondent’s criminality and the seriousness of his offences, even after making the fullest possible allowance for favourable subjective factors. In my opinion, the conclusion that the sentences are manifestly inadequate is inevitable when comparison is made between them and the facts which I have summarised above. 
     
      
    42 It is submitted that the residual discretion of this Court not to intervene should be exercised, having regard to the notice given by her Honour to the Crown that she was contemplating an effective sentence such as that ultimately imposed, and the absence of a contesting submission from the Crown. 
     
      
    43 The “notice” was given in oblique terms in that in an exchange her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, Mr Webb, would you say this is a case where he’d be looking perhaps at automatic release?” 
        
       
      
    44 This is invited to be taken to be a reference to the circumstance that sentences of three years or less are accompanied by a judicial order for release to parole at the expiry of the non-parole period in contrast with the situation where a sentence exceeding three years is imposed and a date of eligibility is specified, but the matter of actual release is committed to the Parole Board. Mr Webb was counsel then appearing for the respondent. Her Honour’s words appear to encourage submission. I note the response, “I think it’s within the range”. 
     
      
    45 I do not regard her Honour’s remark, and the absence of intervention by the Crown Prosecutor, as giving rise to a circumstance in which this Court should regard itself as inhibited from exercising its power to intervene to substitute an adequate sentence for one that is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    46 Today we have been provided with further information concerning co-offenders who have been dealt with in the Youth Drug Court, as well as an affidavit setting out some of the difficulties which the respondent has encountered in custody. In particular, his status as an escapee inhibits his progression into the less onerous forms of custody. Any alteration in status will be dealt with in accordance with the exercise of powers by a classification committee. The impediment would have been apparent at the time of sentence. Aspects of custody, it should be observed, are consequent upon the respondent’s own history. 
     
      
    47 There can be no justifiable sense of grievance harboured by the respondent where co-offenders in some of the offences are dealt with in an entirely different regime. We have today been handed the previous records of the co-offenders. These are not impressive, and I do not regard them as giving rise to what are generally called parity considerations. 
     
      
    48 We were also, by consent, handed a sheet which indicates that, contrary to the facts before her Honour, the respondent was accompanied by a co-offender on two occasions by each of the two different co-offenders, rather than, as in the facts which I have recited, been accompanied by a particular co-offender, once each on the occasion of the offences specified in charges 2 and 4. It is to be noted, of course, that in respect of charges 2 and 4, the respondent was charged with an aggravated form of offence because he was in company and the facts now tendered to us show incidentally that there might have been available that charge of the more serious nature in respect of two other offences. 
     
      
    49 Given the whole of the circumstances, and accepting the conceded further facts that have been offered to this Court, I do not regard these as matters which affect either the discretion of this Court or the orders that it should make. 
     
      
    50 As her Honour said, it is important to take into account the respondent’s comparative youth, his difficult early life, and the misfortune of spending so much of it in juvenile custody. Giving these matters, as I have said, the fullest account, there must in my view be a substitution by this Court of appropriate sentences. 
     
      
    51 Her Honour found that the respondent should have a 25 per cent discount for his confession and his pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity, and that there were special circumstances justifying reduction in the respondent’s favour of the proportion between non-parole period and head sentence. I would implement both these findings for similar reasons on re-sentence. 
     
      
    52 The sentences which I propose are assessed in the light of the restraint which should be exercised when re-sentencing after a successful Crown appeal. Each head sentence now proposed has been reduced by 25 per cent from my assessment otherwise. 
     
      
    53 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the respondent sentenced as follows: 
       
        
        (a) On the first charge, to four years and six months imprisonment to date from 12 August 2002 and to expire on 11 February 2007, with a non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from 12 August 2002 to 11 May 2005; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) On the second charge, taking into account the four matters on the first Form 1, to six years imprisonment to date from 12 August 2002 and to expire on 11 August 2008, with a non parole period of three years and six months to date from 12 August 2002 to 11 February 2006; 
         
        (c) On the third charge, to four years six months imprisonment to date from 12 August 2002 and to expire on 11 February 2007, with a non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from 12 August 2002 to 11 May 2005; 
         
        (d) On the fourth charge, to four years six months imprisonment to date from 12 August 2002 and to expire on 11 February 2007, with a non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from 12 August 2002 to 11 May 2005; 
         
        (e) On the fifth charge, taking into account the two matters on the second Form 1, to four years six months imprisonment to date from 12 August 2002 and to expire on 11 February 2007, with a non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from 12 August 2002 to 11 May 2005. 
         
        The first date of eligibility for parole is specified as 11 February 2006. 
        
       
      
    54 HANDLEY JA: I agree.55 ADAMS J: I agree. I wish to add some comments of my own. 
     
      
    56 These were not impulsive crimes. They comprised the invasion of people’s homes. As difficult and harsh as the respondent’s upbringing was, he knew the seriousness of the crimes and made deliberate decisions to undertake them. It has often and rightly been said that rehabilitation is an important objective of sentencing. But it is not the only objective. 
     
      
    57 There are some signs in this case that the respondent can be rehabilitated, and it was right of the learned sentencing judge to give them real significance. But there are other important considerations, to which Grove J has called attention. The balance is never easy to make. But the seriousness of the crimes, considered objectively, which includes, of course, the actual moral culpability of the offender, is always the most important factor and provides the fundamental measure against which subjective considerations are but counterweights. 
     
      
    58 In the result, I am of the respectful view that the learned sentencing judge weighed the relevant factors in a mode that was significantly mistaken, and that the sentences proposed by Grove J are necessary to restore a proper balance, although they also reflect a degree of leniency that has always been extended by this Court when increasing punishment on a Crown appeal. 
     
      
    59 HANDLEY JA: The sentence of the Court and the orders of the Court will be as announced by Grove J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 19 November 2002, the appellant was indicted before his Honour Acting Judge Shillington QC at Sydney District Court on the following charges:  
     
      
       
      Count one: for that he on 12 December 2001 at Maroubra in the State of New South Wales did assault Chie Sakaguchi and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency on the said Chie Sakaguchi (section 61L Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years).  
       
       
      Count two: for that he on the 12 December 2001 at Maroubra in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with Chie Sakaguchi without the consent of the said Chie Sakaguchi knowing that she was not consenting (section 61I Crimes Act 1900, maximum penalty imprisonment for 14 years).  
       
      
    2 The appellant pleaded not guilty, and was tried before his Honour and a jury of twelve. On 26 November 2002, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the first count and not guilty to the second count.  
     
      
    3 On 21 February 2003, the appellant was sentenced on count one as follows: imprisonment for one year to commence 21 February 2003 and expire 20 February 2004, the execution of that sentence being suspended under section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for the term of the sentence.  
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals to this Court from his conviction, on one ground, namely that in the light of the evidence, the guilty verdict was unreasonable and illogical.  
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE 
      
    5 The complainant gave evidence (through an interpreter of the Japanese language) that she lived in Japan, and that she had come to Australia in August 2001 on a working holiday to study English and to work. In December 2001, she was living in Maroubra with Tomoya Adachi, who she described as her ex-boyfriend. She had joined the Maroubra Seals Sports and Community Club.  
     
      
    6 Her evidence was that on 12 December 2001, she went to the club. After going to the women’s change room, she went to the gym area where she used the walking machine. The appellant started using the machine next to her, and spoke to her. He asked her name and other questions. He was wearing a blue t-shirt and light brown shorts.  
     
      
    7 The complainant’s evidence then was that, after using another machine, she went to the women’s change room. The appellant said to her, “are you going to the pool?” and the complainant replied that she was. She changed into her swimming costume and went to the pool. The appellant was also there, and spoke to her again. After she left the pool, the appellant said to her “are you already going?”, and she said “see you” and went to the women’s change room.  
     
      
    8 The complainant’s evidence was that she then took off her swimming costume and went into a shower cubicle. While she was washing her hair, she heard a man call her name, and she later opened her eyes and saw the appellant, wearing a red t-shirt and light brown shorts. He said things she could not understand, but did say the word “coffee”. She said in Japanese “get out of here”, and wrapped the shower curtain around her body. He came close to her and touched her back and bottom with his hands. (This was the incident alleged in count one). She said in Japanese “get out” and “don’t touch me”. He asked where she was going, she replied “home” and he disappeared. She went to where her clothes were and began drying her hair. She then saw a red shadow in the mirror and tried to run away. The appellant grabbed her hand and forcefully took her towards the sauna area of the women’s change area. He pushed her into the sauna, and down to where the chairs were. According to the complainant “after that he used his finger and put it into my vagina and touched me a few times”. (This was the incident alleged in count two).  
     
      
    9 According to the complainant, the appellant then took his belt off, started to take off his trousers, and tried to insert his penis, unsuccessfully. She then heard a sound from outside like a door closing, and the appellant stopped and left suddenly. She then went back to where her clothes were placed. After she put her clothes on, she saw somebody and screamed, then realised it was a woman and tried to hide the fact she had screamed and said “hi” to the woman. She tried to tell the woman what had happened but she was shaking so much and couldn’t express herself in English, and so she left the room.  
     
      
    10 The complainant then went home. Her boyfriend was there, but she could not tell him immediately what happened. She cried for about ten minutes, then told him that at the sports club she was nearly raped. Her boyfriend went to the club the following day, and she went with him the day after and spoke to the manager.  
     
      
    11 The complaint identified a blue t-shirt and a red t-shirt as those worn by the appellant, and identified herself and the appellant on a security video.  
     
      
    12 Mr Adachi, also a Japanese citizen, gave evidence that in December 2001 he lived in Maroubra with the complainant. On 12 December 2001, he and the complainant left the house at about 11am, and he went to the beach. He arrived home at about 1pm, and the complainant got home about 20 minutes later. The complainant was crying and he asked her what happened. She cried for about 30 minutes, and then told him that she had been nearly raped. He said: “She told me a man came into the shower room and that man was calling out her name. Chie was scared to answer back to his name-calling and afterwards the man was standing in front of the curtains. And he opened the curtains and said ‘let’s go for a coffee’ but Chie refused. Even though she refused she was pulled by his hand or arm. Even though she resisted she was taken into the sauna room and she was nearly – and she says she was nearly raped. Because there was sound (sic) like a woman entering like a person entering the female change room the man left suddenly”.  
     
      
    13 Next day, Mr Adachi went to the club and spoke to the manager. The day after, he went to the club with the complainant and the complainant then spoke to the manager through Mr Adachi.  
     
      
    14 Peter Reid, the General Manager of the club, gave evidence of his conversation with Mr Adachi on 13 December 2001, in which Mr Adachi said that his girlfriend had been hassled in the pool and in the change room. He then looked at the security video, and on it saw a Japanese girl on the running machine and in the pool talking to the appellant. He telephoned the appellant and told him of the allegation, and the appellant denied doing anything wrong. The following day, the complainant and Mr Adachi attended the club, and through Mr Adachi the complainant said that the appellant “had gone into the change room and while she was having a shower and asked her for – if she wanted to go for a cup of coffee or something. Then she pushed him away or something like that, and he’d gone, and then he’d come back a second time and had forced her into the – and touched her, and forced her into the sauna”. Mr Reid then contacted the police.  
     
      
    15 Mr Reid said the appellant had been a member of the club since he was 18, was now in his early 30’s, and had been an employee of the club about 10 years earlier.  
     
      
    16 An employee of the club Malcolm Allen confirmed that the security video showed the appellant talking to a Japanese girl. Security videos in fact showed that the appellant had entered the club at 11.39am wearing a red t-shirt, and had left the club at 1.15pm in a red t-shirt. The club register showed that the complainant had signed into the club at 11.30am, the appellant had signed in at 11.45am, and that the only young women who had signed in between 11.10am and 1.50pm were two young women who had signed in at 1.20pm.  
     
      
    17 A policeman Detective Hughes gave evidence that on 16 December 2001, the complainant attended the police station with Mr Adachi and made a statement with the aid of an interpreter. He further gave evidence that on 22 December 2001 he spoke to the appellant, cautioned him, and told him of the allegations against him. The appellant said “I can’t believe this, this is bullshit”. However, he declined to be interviewed. He did provide a red and blue t-shirt that he had been wearing on 12 December 2001. Detective Hughes also gave evidence that the appellant had no criminal record apart from a drink driving offence some years ago.  
     
      
    18 The appellant did not give evidence. However, he called very favourable character evidence from his work supervisor, who was a senior operations officer at Sydney Airport Corporation; and also from the manager of a gym where he had been employed for approximately three years.  
     
      
       
      APPELLANT’S SUBMISSIONS 
      
    19 Mr Thangaraj, for the appellant, submitted that the guilty verdict was unreasonable and illogical, having regard to the improbability of the offence occurring in the circumstances, the lack of support for the complainant’s account, crucial variations in the complaint’s accounts of what happened, and inconsistency between the verdicts on the two counts.  
     
      
    20 As regards improbability, he submitted that the offence was alleged to have occurred in the middle of the day, in a club of which the appellant was a member and well known, in the women’s change room, when there were other people around, when people could see the entrance to the change room and when a woman could have walked into the change room at any time. He submitted that the complainant’s evidence was that she screamed, yet there was no evidence that anyone heard a scream. The complainant gave evidence that she saw a woman shortly after the incident, screamed and tried to speak to her. This woman could only have been one of two women, but she was not called to give evidence. The complainant claimed to have been roughly handled, but there was no physical injury.  
     
      
    21 Mr Thangaraj submitted that there was no support for the complainant’s account. Although the appellant did not give evidence, it was put to the complainant in cross examination that the appellant did not enter the women’s change room, but merely called out from the door asking if she wanted coffee. It was submitted for the Crown that the complainant’s identification of the red t-shirt contradicted this, because the complainant could only have seen the red t-shirt if the appellant had entered the room; but this was an invalid submission, because the complainant could have seen the appellant in a red t-shirt at other times.  
     
      
    22 The original complaint made by Mr Adachi to the club manager was only of the complainant being hassled, so the jury should not have accepted that the complainant said to Mr Adachi on returning home that she had been “nearly raped”, or indeed that the complainant was grossly upset when she returned home. Even if the jury had accepted that the complainant said she was “nearly raped”, as it should not have, this would at most support the count on which the appellant was acquitted.  
     
      
    23 Mr Thangaraj pointed to what he submitted were crucial variations in the complainant’s account of what happened. On returning on 12 December, at best she said to her boyfriend Mr Adachi that she had been “nearly raped”. On 14 December, to the manager, she did not say that she had been touched in the shower, or that there had been any penetration, digital or otherwise. In cross examination, both the complainant and Mr Adachi accepted that all they had said relevantly was that when the complainant was in the shower, the appellant walked in, called her, opened the curtain, asked her for coffee, and she pushed him away; and that later he took her into the sauna and tried to do something.  
     
      
    24 In her statement to police on 16 December she did not say that the appellant undid his belt, lowered his trousers and attempted penile penetration. Nor was this said at the committal hearing. The first time this was alleged was at the trial itself.  
     
      
    25 Mr Thangaraj also submitted that there was inconsistency in the complainant’s evidence in relation to screaming. In some places, she said that she was screaming loudly throughout the incident in the sauna, and at other times she said that she was trying to scream but could not make a loud sound. He also submitted that the complainant significantly altered her estimate of the time the appellant was in the women’s change room from 10 to 15 minutes at the committal to 5 minutes at the trial.  
     
      
    26 Finally, Mr Thangaraj submitted that there was inconsistency between the verdicts on the two counts. In each case, the guilt of the appellant was supported entirely and only by the evidence of the complainant. The verdict of not guilty on the second count showed that the jury did not accept that the complainant’s evidence was reliable. Accordingly, it was unreasonable and illogical for them to find a verdict on the first count. Mr Thangaraj referred to the most recent authority on inconsistent verdicts, namely, MFA v R (2002) 193 ALR 184. He also pointed out that the trial judge had given a direction in accordance with Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44 concerning the resolution of disagreement, confirming that there was a real possibility that the jury had reached an unreasonable verdict by way of compromise.  
     
      
       
      DECISION 
      
    27 The factors relied on by the appellant as going to the improbability of the offence occurring are matters of some weight, but were all fairly before the jury. I would note that it does appear that there were no more than 25 people altogether coming into the club between 11.10am and 1.50pm on that day, and it also appears that no other woman in fact entered the women’s change area after the complainant until after 1.20pm, at least five minutes after the appellant had left the premises. In my opinion, the improbability factors relied on by the appellant are certainly insufficient in themselves to make the guilty verdict unreasonable or illogical, but I will have regard to them in combination with the other factors which I will discuss. The absence of evidence from the woman seen by the complainant after the incident means that the complainant’s evidence was unsupported in this respect; but to go further than this would be to speculate.  
     
      
    28 In my opinion, the circumstance that Mr Adachi spoke to the manager the following day in terms of the complainant being “hassled” is not a powerful factor against acceptance of the evidence of the complainant and Mr Adachi that she was greatly distressed when she arrived home and complained that she had been “nearly raped”. The jury may reasonably have considered that Mr Adachi would have been circumspect in his account of the complaint at that stage. In my opinion, the jury were well entitled to accept the evidence of the complainant and Mr Adachi that she was greatly distressed when she came home and did complain that she had been nearly raped.  
     
      
    29 In my opinion also, the evidence about the red t-shirt did confirm that the appellant entered the women’s change area. The plan that was exhibit E in the case makes it improbable in the extreme that the complainant could have seen the appellant from the female change area if he had merely opened the door and called out from the door. The evidence is clear that the appellant was wearing a blue t-shirt when he was exercising in the gym area. It is unlikely in the extreme that he was seen by the complainant entering the club in the red t-shirt, and he left the club in the red t-shirt more than five minutes before the complainant left the female change area. To that extent, the identification of the red t-shirt did confirm that the appellant came right into the women’s change area.  
     
      
    30 As regards the variations in the account given by the complainant, in my opinion it is reasonable to have regard to language difficulties and an understandable initial reticence about giving full details. There is no suggestion that the accounts of touching in the shower and digital penetration given in evidence were different from those given in the police statement made four days after the incident. In my opinion, there is no outright inconsistency in the accounts, so as to substantially damage the credibility of the complainant. I do not think the variations in the time estimates, or the variation between an assertion of screaming loudly and an assertion of trying to scream but being unable to make a loud scream, are of great significance.  
     
      
    31 As regards the different verdicts, in my opinion in this case it cannot be said there is no rational explanation of them. The jury may have taken the view that, by the time of the alleged digital penetration, the complainant was greatly upset and therefore less able to give a completely reliable account of what happened. Her report to Mr Adachi and she was “nearly raped” could be seen as suggesting that what happened fell short of penetration of any kind. This is also a case where a jury may properly have taken a “merciful” view of the facts: see MacKenzie v R (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 367; MFA at para [85]. Finally, by reason of the events introduced for the first time at the trial concerning evidence in the sauna, the jury may have taken the view that her evidence of events in the sauna was less reliable than that in relation to events in the shower, as to which there was no suggestion of inconsistency from the time of her making a statement to the police right up to the time of giving evidence at the trial.  
     
      
    32 In my opinion, the giving of the Black direction does not suggest an unreasonable compromise verdict. I note that it was given after the jury had deliberated for some time, suggesting care and conscientiousness, and without any communication from the jury that they were unable to agree.  
     
      
    33 Having regard to all these considerations, in my opinion the verdict of guilty is not shown to have been unreasonable or illogical. In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    34 GROVE J: I agree with Hodgson JA. 
     
      
    35 HOWIE J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences which were imposed upon him by Mahoney ADCJ on 6 February 2003. These sentences, which resulted in an effective overall sentencing order of imprisonment for fifteen years, with a non-parole period of eleven years and three months, related to a night of extreme violence, involving what amounted to a home invasion followed by an armed robbery, the kidnap of one victim and the kidnap and sexual assault of the other victim. 
     
      
    2 The sentences which were imposed following pleas of guilty, that were accepted as having been made at the first available opportunity, were as follows:  
     
      
       
      Count 1: Break and enter dwelling and commit a serious indictable offence (armed robbery) in circumstances of aggravation (in company) - maximum available penalty imprisonment for twenty years (s 112(2)  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      ) -imprisonment for eight years with a non-parole period of six years. 
       
       
      Count 2: Kidnap Tony Nguyen with intent to hold him for advantage (obtain money) - maximum available penalty imprisonment for fourteen years (s 90A  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      ) - imprisonment for seven and a half years with a non-parole period of five years and seven and a half months.  
       
       
       
      Count 3: Sexual intercourse with Vicki Dlask without her consent, in company, and prior to the commission of that offence depriving her of her liberty for a period - maximum available penalty life imprisonment (s 61JA(1)  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      ) - imprisonment for fifteen years with a non-parole period of eleven years and three months. 
       
      
    3 The sentences were directed to be served concurrently. Special circumstances were not found, the respective non-parole periods in each case being set at seventy-five per cent of the head sentence. 
     
      
    4 One offence was taken into account on a Form I in relation to count 1, being an offence which had been committed a month earlier, and which had involved the applicant acting as an accessory after the fact to a break and enter of a dwelling house, and the commission therein of a robbery in company. 
     
      
       
      FACTS 
      
     5 Tony Nguyen lived in a unit in the suburb of Russell Lea with his fiancee Vicki Dlask and a flatmate, Timothy Sung. They were young people, in their early twenties.  
     
      
    6 The unit in which they lived was situated on the third floor of the block. Entrance to the unit block could only be gained through the underground security car park or via a security door at the front of the block.  
     
      
    7 In the early hours of Saturday 3 November 2001, Timothy Sung was woken up by a hand around his throat. There were three people in his room with weapons. Two offenders, Kogi Elwood-White and Sydney Kim, wore balaclavas and the third, the applicant, wore a white bandanna covering the bottom half of his face. One carried a small knife, one carried a small machete with a curved blade (Kogi) and the other a pump-action shotgun (Kim). Sung was told not to struggle or to scream. His hands were tied behind his back and a piece of material was put in his mouth.  
     
      
    8 The offenders then walked into the room occupied by Tony Nguyen and his fiancee. Tony Nguyen was dragged by the back of the head into Timothy Sung’s room where his hands were tied behind his back and a blanket put over him so that he could not see. A blanket was also wrapped Vicki Dlask and a pillowcase was placed over her head. She was pulled and pushed into Timothy Sung’s room with the shotgun pointed at her head. Her hands were tied behind her back. 
     
      
    9 Tony Nguyen was then led to the bathroom where a demand was made for money, jewellery or watches. After he surrendered his wallet he was taken to his bedroom, instructed to dress and advised that if he turned around and looked at the man with him or made any noise, then he would be killed. 
     
      
    10 Vicki Dlask said that a number of items belonging to her were stolen from the unit, including jewellery, a mobile telephone and a Commonwealth Bank keycard. These events gave rise to count 1. 
     
      
    11 Tony Nguyen was led by the applicant to a waiting car. He was seated in the back of the car and the driver was told by the man who had led him out of the house, “If he says anything or looks at you, cut him.” 
     
      
    12 Vicki Dlask was led by Kogi out of the house. As she left, Timothy Sung heard a man tell her, “We have your boyfriend. We have a gun to his head.” At this time Timothy Sung felt a foot against his neck and a metal object against his head. He was instructed, “Don’t do anything. Don’t scream. Don’t move. I will back.” Vicki Dlask was ordered to climb in the boot of the vehicle to which she was taken. It was then closed on top of her. 
     
      
    13 The vehicle drove off and travelled for about forty minutes to its destination. Vicki Dlask was carried from the boot into a house and placed on a bed in one of the rooms. Her hands were untied from behind her back and then retied on the top of the bedhead. Earplugs were inserted in her ears and she was ordered not to scream or move for her “boyfriend’s safety”. Some time later the pillowcase over her head was removed, sticky tape was placed over her eyes and mouth and the pillowcase replaced. 
     
      
    14 Her T-shirt and shorts were then cut and ripped from her by Kogi. One leg was tied to the rail on the side of the bed and the other held. She protested but she felt her throat being grabbed. She felt her nipple being licked, fingers inserted inside her vagina and then a penis. She felt warm semen drop onto her stomach. The appellant then had penile/vaginal sex with her and again she felt warm semen drop on her side.  
     
      
    15 She was left lying naked for fifteen minutes before she was given a T-shirt and boxer shorts. Her earplugs were removed and she was permitted to go to the toilet and told to clean up. She was carried to the toilet over the applicant’s shoulder. She used the toilet in the presence of this man. She was then taken to the bed and re-tied. 
     
      
    16 These events gave rise to count 3. 
     
      
    17 In the meantime, with the scraping of what had felt like a knife near his ear, Tony Nguyen had been taken out of the car and blindfolded with a balaclava. He was taken into the room to which Vicki Dlask had been taken and forced to lie under a bed with his arms tied. He was then tied to the frame of the bed and ordered, under the threat of harm, to reveal the pin number of his and his girlfriend’s bank accounts. Tape was wrapped around his eyes and he was led into another room. The sum of $2500 was demanded from him with the threat of seeing his girlfriend die and being killed himself. He was asked whether he “would rather be shot in the stomach or have his hand chopped off."" He heard his girlfriend crying and screaming in the distance. 
     
      
    18 Tony Nguyen promised to obtain the $2500 provided his girlfriend was not hurt. He was told that, in fact, something had already happened to her. He was taken back to the original room and forced to lie again under the bed. He could hear his girlfriend crying on the bed above him. 
     
      
    19 These events gave arise to count 2. 
     
      
    20 Both he and Miss Dlask were taken back to the car. Miss Dlask was again put in the boot. They were both driven to a location in Punchbowl where they were pushed out of the car and left. Both were still tied up but managed to free themselves and called the police. The ordeal extended over about two to three hours. 
     
      
    21 Police investigating the matter found the unit where they lived to have been ransacked. Timothy Sung was seen to have red marks around his wrists together with the laceration near one of his wrists.  
     
      
    22 The applicant was arrested on 3 April 2002. Sydney Kim was the first to be spoken to by police and he nominated the applicant as a co-offender. When the applicant was arrested and interviewed by police at Burwood Police Station he admitted his involvement. In the course of his interview the applicant told police he had known Sydney Kim for six years, from schooldays. Kogi was known to him by reputation as a “big timer with gangs”. He said that Sydney Kim had informed him that Tony owed Kogi money and they knew Tony had money because he had been doing some credit card rorts. 
     
      
    23 The matter on a Form I involved an offence committed at a house in Campsie, which was occupied by a number of Chinese people, who rented rooms on a weekly basis. On the night of 1 October 2001, two armed men wearing balaclavas entered those premises and confronted a family and friends who were having dinner. The occupants were forced to surrender their mobile phones and wallets, and one victim was forced to disclose the pin number to his credit card. One of the women, who was pushed on to a bed, had her clothing cut and a necklace and bracelet stolen.  
     
      
    24 The two armed men were Kogi and Sydney Kim. The applicant, who had driven the getaway car, was arrested and charged with this offence on 12 February 2002.  
     
      
    25 It is the case that the co-offender, Kim, who pleaded guilty to that offence, was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years. That circumstance indicates that the matter was regarding by the sentencing judge as having been particularly serious.  
     
      
    26 Although the applicant’s involvement was as an accessory after the fact as a driver, nevertheless he knowingly lent himself to what was a particularly serious offence. 
     
      
       
      SUBJECTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES 
       
      
    27 The applicant was aged eighteen at the time of the offence and nineteen and a half at the time of sentence. He had no prior convictions. 
     
      
    28 He was the eldest of four children to parents of Vietnamese origin and had arrived in Australia when he was aged two years. He was unmarried. He completed the Higher School Certificate and worked at a Tandy Electronics store. He had taken up employment at an early age due to his father’s illness. He came from what appears to have been be a stable and happy home. He did not give evidence but various reports were placed before the Court which recounted his thought processes and attitude to the offences.  
     
      
    29 He claimed, in a history given to a psychiatrist, Dr Nielssen, that he had begun to use drugs (amphetamines) two months before the offence, and had in fact used drugs about one hour prior to arriving at the premises of the victims. He also claimed, in a history given to a clinical psychologist, John Machlin, that he had joined a group of friends who were involved in drug use and offending and who referred to one another as “brother”. This “brotherhood”, he said, had certain expectations of loyalty. 
     
      
    30 I his report, Mr Machlin, identified the five circumstances which he considered had contributed to the applicant’s involvement in this episode of serious criminality. None of those operate, to my mind, as a mitigating circumstance, although they perhaps tend to explain why it was that a person of otherwise good character chose to lend himself to delinquent behaviour, and to become involved in what was a particularly serious offence. 
     
      
    31 The applicant said to the psychologist that since the offences he had been particularly depressed, with thoughts of suicide. He also said that he had not been gratified by the sexual assault and had felt “a bit sick” immediately after it. He claimed to have felt “blank” after the offences and wanted to pretend they had never happened. He also said that he knew he would eventually be caught, that he had attended confession at church where he made a full disclosure and had been advised to accept whatever punishment was coming.  
     
      
    32 Evidence was given by Father Knight, a parish priest from Waterloo, who knew his family and who said that the applicant was contrite and that his behaviour had been out of character. 
     
      
    33 His Honour expressly took into account the fact that he had taken over the role as the “family breadwinner” due to his father’s stroke, which had occurred in 1999, and the apology which his counsel had offered to the victims, on his behalf. He observed that “the rehabilitation prospects for this young man not only appear to be very promising but have gone a long way towards having been accomplished already.” He accepted that he had demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition and took into account what he considered to have been an impressive testimonial from a work supervisor. 
     
      
    34 He also noted the circumstance that, while the applicant had provided some assistance in acknowledging his own criminality, he had refrained from providing other information, particularly that relating to his co-offenders, out of fear of repercussions for his family. That circumstance perhaps explains why it was that he took that stance, but it does not operate in mitigation of his objective criminality, nor does it stand in his favour as a special circumstance. The simple fact is that he did not provide that measure of assistance. He has not been punished additionally for it, but he is not entitled to any mitigation for it.  
     
      
    35 His Honour applied a discount of twenty-five per cent to the sentences which he would otherwise have imposed due to the early plea. 
     
      
    36 His Honour drew attention to the distinction between subjective features and special circumstances, noting that the two are not synonymous. He specifically considered, but declined to find that a number of factors qualified as special circumstances, including his youth and prospects for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    37 It is submitted by the applicant that the sentence was manifestly excessive, and that the learned sentencing judge also erred in declining to find special circumstances in not reducing the non-parole period.  
     
      
    38 Essentially, the same arguments were advanced, in relation to each ground, to the effect that, while recognising the considerable remorse and contrition, the youth of the offender and his favourable prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour did not give effect to these findings, or to the general principle that rehabilitation is the primary aim in sentencing young offenders, when setting the head sentences and the non-parole periods. 
     
      
    39 This case was one involving very great objective criminality on the part of all who were involved. The Courts have made it clear that offences of this kind, which involve the invasion of the victim’s home, followed by robbery or acts of violence, cannot be countenanced by decent living members of the community. Inevitably, in such cases, condign sentences must be passed which convey a very strong message of general and personal deterrence: R v Li NSWCCA 9 July 1997. 
     
      
    40 The kidnap and sexual assault of the young victim was particularly serious, and similarly demanded a condign sentence. That offence, in my view, fell within the upper range of seriousness for such an offence, the seriousness of which is, itself, underlined by the fact that the maximum available penalty for it is imprisonment for life. In this instance, a young, defenceless victim was abducted and subject to an ordeal that could only be described as having been terrifying, as well as one involving her complete and utter humiliation and debasement.  
     
      
    41 The kidnap and ill-treatment of the other victim and the attempted extortion fair little better in terms of objective criminality. 
     
      
    42 This community will not, and it cannot, tolerate the activities of marauding young gangs of the kind to which this appellant attached himself, and it is time that he and his ilk understood that to be the case, at the penalty otherwise of facing lengthy terms of imprisonment.  
     
      
    43 In most instances the youth of an offender and the objective of rehabilitation are properly to be taken into account when assessing his or her objective criminality and then given a loading in favour of a degree of leniency that would not otherwise be available for an adult offender: R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112. That arises, for example, where the offending arises out of immaturity: R v Hearne [2001] NSWCCA 37, or where the offender has an impoverished or deprived background and shows positive signs for rehabilitation.  
     
      
    44 However, these considerations have very much less weight when the offender has behaved with extreme violence or has acted as an adult, as has occurred in this case: R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 and R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58.  
     
      
    45 Additionally, the weight to be given to these considerations diminishes the closer the offender approaches the age of maturity: R v Bus NSWCCA 3 November 1995 and R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182. 
     
      
    46 The remarks of Lee CJ at CL in R v Pham and Ly (1991) 55 A Crim R 128 at 135 are apposite: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst the early background of each respondent merits sympathy and understanding it can not be used to cloak or disguise the fact that the actions of the respondents and the other men involved can only properly be described as the actions of a gang of thugs and armed thugs at that, violently invading the home of the victims and rendering them helpless. 
        
       
       
        
        It is true that Courts must refrain from sending your persons to prison, unless that course is necessary, but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal courts function will cease to operation.  
        
       
       
        
        In short, deterrence and retribution do not seek to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are the persons committing grave crimes, particularly crimes involving physical violence to persons in their own homes. It is appropriate to refer to the decision of  
        Queen v Williscroft 
         [1995] VR 292 at 299 where the majority of the Full Court of Victoria expressed the view that notwithstanding the enlightened approach that is now made to sentencing compared to earlier days, the concept of punishment, i.e. coercive action, is fundamental to correctional treatment in our society.” 
        
       
      
     47 In the present case the offences were those of an adult; they involved extreme violence or serious threats thereof; the applicant did not have a deprived background and he was close to the age of eighteen years. 
     
      
    48 Although the head sentences were towards the top of the range, I am not persuaded, having regard in particular to the objective seriousness of the offences and to the matters outlined, that they were outside a proper range of sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    49 The case was, in fact, one where the sentencing judge would have been well justified in imposing sentences that were partly cumulative upon one another, so as to give effect to the overall objective criminality involved in what were discrete acts of serious criminality involving more than one victim, in accordance with the principle noted in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; see also R v Weldon and Carberry [2002] NSWCCA 475.  
     
      
    50 Moreover, it was a case where there had to be an additional component of imprisonment in relation to the Form I offence, which was also particularly serious.  
     
      
    51 While the overall sentence is one of considerable length, and while it could possibly have been constructed differently, to reflect totality, I am not persuaded, particularly in the absence of a Crown appeal, that such circumstance calls for intervention or for any re-structuring of the sentence. In short, I am not persuaded that any less severe head sentences were called for. 
     
      
    52 In this regard, the Court has been informed this morning that, for reasons which are not apparent, Kim has not been charged with this offence, while the co-offender Kogi was sentenced by Greg Woods DCJ to sentences which were very differently constructed, but which resulted overall in a sentencing order of seventeen years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of twelve years and nine months. That appears to have been achieved by way of an accumulation of the individual sentences and also taking into account some further matters which were referred to the Court pursuant to s 51A.  
     
      
    53 Having regard to the practical outcome of the two sentencing proceedings, counsel for the applicant does not advance any argument based upon parity. That, in my view, is a proper concession. If it were necessary to reconstruct the individual sentences so as to make them approximately equivalent to those imposed in relation to Kim, then I am of the view that as a result of the need for accumulation, which would then arise, precisely the same overall sentencing order would be achieved.  
     
      
    54 In those circumstances, while it may well be that Pearce has not been strictly reflected, I am of the view that this is not a case where any other sentence than that imposed was required or should have been passed. 
     
      
    55 Accordingly, for those reasons there is no error which calls for appellate intervention, so far as the head sentences are concerned.  
     
      
    56 I am, however, persuaded that special circumstances should have been found, arising from the applicant’s age and his demonstrated commitment to rehabilitation.  
     
      
    57 It is correct, as the learned sentencing judge failed, that favourable subjective features and special circumstances are not synonymous. As Sully J said in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704: 
     
      
       
        
        “... it does not follow, in my opinion, that it is correct in principle to say that in any and every particular case the subject matters that have been factored correctly into the definition of a head sentence and a non-parole period can simply be regurgitated as ‘special circumstances’ so as to require a reduction in what would be, otherwise, a proper non-parole period. Relevant subjective factors and ‘special circumstances’ are not synonyms. They are discrete considerations.” 
        
       
      
    58 Any other view is in fact likely to lead to a double discounting in relation to the non-parole period. 
     
      
    59 Quite separate considerations are involved in determining whether special circumstances exist. The most relevant consideration in this case concerns the desirability of providing for the opportunity of an extensive period of release on parole: R v Fong [2002] NSWCCA 320. In that regard, care does need to be exercised to ensure that the reduction in a non-parole period does not result in a period of potential release that is so lengthy as to be likely to achieve little in the way of supervised assistance.  
     
      
    60 In its later years, on the other hand, an extended period on parole, which includes a period where supervision has been withdrawn because it is no longer considered necessary, may still have a very real significance for a young offender. It can operate as a continuing and effective constraint, since the offender remains subject to the risk of revocation of parole and return to prison for the balance of parole, if he or she re-offends. 
     
      
    61 What is needed is a considered balance to ensure that the non-parole period remains proportionate to the objective and subjective criminality of the offender and also provides a real encouragement and opportunity for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    62 In this case, the length of the sentence, the youth of the applicant, the favourable prospects for his rehabilitation, and the fact that this was his first time in custody, were matters that should, in my view, have been found to constitute special circumstances.  
     
      
    63 The case is, accordingly, one where I have reached the conclusion that, in relation to the non-parole periods, sentences other than those imposed were warranted in law and should have been imposed: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    64 I consider that leave to appeal should be granted and the non-parole periods reduced in relation to each offence. In that regard, I would propose that a non parole period should be set in the order of two-thirds of the head sentences in relation to counts 1 and 2. A somewhat larger reduction of the non-parole period would be appropriate for count 3, by reason of the lengthy head sentence for that count. Again, so far as the possibility of release on parole is concerned, it is the ultimate overall effect of the sentencing order that is critical. 
     
      
    65 In this regard, I find that the present case falls on the other side of the line to that examined in R v Holmes and Ratu [2003] NSWCCA 28, where the discretionary nature of the judgment, involved in this aspect of sentencing, was emphasised, and there held to be such as to require the Court to refrain from intervention.  
     
      
    66 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
      2. Head sentence in relation to each count confirmed but non-parole periods quashed. In lieu thereof, specify non parole periods as follows:  
       
        
        (a) Count 1: five years and four months to commence on 3 April 2002 and to expire on 2 August 2007. 
         
        (b) Count 2: five years to commence on 3 April 2002 and expire on 2 April 2007. 
         
        (c) Count 3: nine years and three months to commence on 3 April 2002 and to expire on 2 July 2011. 
        
       
      3. Specify 2 July 2011 as the earliest date on which the applicant would be eligible for release on parole. 
       
       
        
        The consequence in practical terms is to reduce the non-parole period by two years.  
        
       
      
    67 SMART AJ: I agree. 
     
      
    68 WOOD CJ at CL: The order of the Court will be as I proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentences imposed upon him by her Honour Hock DCJ, in the District Court, on 14 February 2003, following pleas of guilty which had been entered in the Local Court to one count of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of the prohibited drug methylamphetamine (count 1), and to one count of supplying not less than the large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine (count 2). Five offences of supplying a prohibited drug, and one count of supplying not less the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, were taken into account on a Form 1, when the applicant was sentenced on count 2. 
     
      
    2 The sentence imposed in relation to count 1 was one of imprisonment for a fixed term of four years, while that imposed, in relation to count 2, was one of imprisonment for nine years with a non-parole period of six years. The sentences were directed to be served concurrently with one another. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 The facts are fully set out in her Honour’s reasons for judgment, and no issue is taken in relation to her analysis of the circumstances that gave rise to the pleas. 
     
      
    4 In brief summary, the applicant became the subject of an undercover police operation, in the course of which he supplied drugs to two undercover officers, and was detected, via telephone intercepts, in arranging sales to other customers.  
     
      
    5 The first three of the matters on the Form 1 relate to sales of small quantities of methylamphetamine, totalling 73.3 grams, which were made by the applicant to undercover operatives on 22 May 2000, 23 May 2000 and 7 June 2000, after they met at the McDonalds car park at Revesby, for a total sum of $8300. On one such occasion the applicant, when asked about the possibility of obtaining some “goey”, and the amounts which he could provide, replied, “as much as you want”. 
     
      
    6 The offence giving rise to count 1 occurred following a number of conversations, over the ensuing days, when on 13 June 2000, the applicant met one of the officers in the car park of a McDonalds outlet at Woodbine. On this occasion the applicant handed the officer ten large re-sealable bags of methylamphetamine weighing 274.9 grams, in exchange for $11,000. When the undercover officer indicated that he wanted a lot more during the following week, the applicant replied, “No worries”. 
     
      
    7 The remaining matters on the Form 1 were detected via the telephone intercepts, which were placed on the two mobile phones that the applicant was known to use, between 9 June 2000 and 28 June 2000. The tapes revealed that the applicant was engaged in the business of supplying heroin and methylamphetamine. The fourth matter related to supplies, over a three week period, of various quantities of heroin being not less than fifteen grams and probably considerably more. The precise quantity involved is not capable of precise definition, however I believe the matter can properly be approached on the basis that at least fifteen grams were involved. 
     
      
    8 The fifth matter involved an agreement for the sale of a commercial quantity of 2000 methylamphetamine tablets for $34,000.  
     
      
    9 The sixth matter involved an agreement for the sale of five ounces of pure methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    10 There was no evidence as to whether the sales of the drugs, the subject of items 5 and 6, proceeded. The applicant suggests that they did not. Whether that is correct or not, it is evident that the applicant had at least engaged in conduct that amounted to a deemed supply. 
     
      
    11 The count 2 offence related to the supply, on 28 June 2000, of 1347.6 grams of methylamphetamine by the applicant to one of the undercover officers, again at the Woodbine McDonald car park, for $28,000. On this occasion the applicant was accompanied by some associates, including Jason O’Brien, who had been detected on the intercepts as having been a co-supplier. They were arrested and the undercover operation came to an end. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was sentenced on the following basis: 
     
      
       
      (a) at the time of the offences, he had been a heroin addict, and the profits from the sale of the drugs went to support that habit rather than an extravagant lifestyle; 
       
       
      (b) at the time of the offences he had been a willing participant in the drug trade, and had been involved in the business of drug supply; 
       
       
      (c) at the date of the offence he was aged thirty-two. He had left school halfway through year nine, had married at the age of twenty-one, and after the marriage had broken down, he had become depressed and turned to drugs, including heroin; 
      
     
     
      
      (d) he had been involved in a serious motor bike accident in 1997 which left him with a damaged hand and leg; 
       
       
      (e) he had been assaulted by other inmates following his arrest and as a result he was likely to remain in protection, a circumstance rendering his imprisonment more onerous; 
       
       
      (f) his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable; 
      
     
     
      
      (g) special circumstances were found to exist in relation for the need for him to serve the sentence on protection and to have a larger than usual period of supervision to foster his rehabilitation. 
      
    13 The co-offender O’Brien was charged with the same offences as those which gave rise to counts 1 and 2, so far as the applicant was concerned. However, there were no offences dealt with on a Form 1 in his case.  
     
      
    14 He was sentenced by his Honour Coleman DCJ in the District Court, on 27 May 2002, in relation to count 1 to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years. On count 2 he was sentenced to imprisonment for six years with a non-parole period of three and a half years.15 He was sentenced on the following basis: 
     
      
      (a) he was 25 years old; 
       
      (b) he had a criminal record; 
       
      (c) he came from a deprived and disadvantaged background which included domestic violence; 
       
      (d) he had been a drug user from an early age and his drug use had escalated in the two years prior to the offences; 
       
      (e) he had supplied the drugs, the subject of these counts, to the applicant, who had on-sold them to the undercover operatives; 
       
      (f) he had become involved in the supply of drugs to take advantage of what he perceived to be an easy, willing and pliant customer to the applicant; 
       
      (g) prior to the supplies, the subject of the two charges, he had not been involved in the supply of drugs to others; 
       
      (h) he had been a willing and enthusiastic participant in the supply, although he had not been part of a manufacturing drug ring; 
       
      (i) he had been willing to use his access to methylamphetamine in bulk to cut it and satisfy large block orders; 
       
      (j) he had been an essential link in the chain of supply who had been able to obtain the necessary methylamphetamine to produce the mixtures required on little notice. 
      
    16 The sole ground of appeal relates to an alleged disparity in the overall sentence between that imposed upon the applicant, effectively of nine years with a non-parole period of six years, and that imposed on O’Brien of six years with a non-parole period of three and a half years. 
     
      
    17 It was the case that her Honour proceeded to sentence upon the assumption that the criminality of the two offenders in relation to the two counts was equal. However, she found it appropriate to differentiate between them for the reasons that the applicant: 
     
      
       
      (a) had a lengthy criminal history; 
       
      (b) was on a bond and on parole at the time of the offences; 
       
      (c) had a number of Form 1 offences to be taken into account; and 
       
      (d) had entered a plea of guilty at a later point in time than O’Brien. 
      
    18 The applicant accepts that the sentencing Judge was properly entitled to impose a lengthier sentence upon the applicant, by reason of these matters, and additionally concedes that no express error in principle emerges on the face of the reasons. However, it is submitted that the difference in sentence was so disproportionate to the respective positions of the two offenders, as to suggest latent error of the kind referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. 
     
      
    19 I am not persuaded that there is any substance in this submission. Disparity justifying appellate intervention is not made out by reason of a simple difference in sentence; nor is made out by the fact that an offender entertains a personal sense of grievance as a result of receiving a sentence which is heavier than that received by a co-offender. 
     
      
    20 The test enunciated in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606, Postiglione v The Queen (1996) 189 CLR 295 and Regina v Koklas [2003] NSWCCA 302, depends upon the sense of grievance being one that is justifiably entertained. That only arises where the apparent different in sentence cannot be explained by reference to a relevant difference in the criminality of the two offenders, or in their subjective circumstances, or in the proper application of sentencing principle. 
     
      
    21 I am satisfied that the differences between the two offenders in this case are such that the applicant cannot satisfy the Lowe test. Those differences may be shortly summarised: 
     
      
       
      (a) the applicant had six serious offences involving the supply of drugs taken into account on a Form 1, which had to be reflected by a suitable addition to the sentence for count 2, for the reasons outlined in  
      Regina v AEM 
       [2002] NSWCCA 58, and  
      Attorney-General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) 
       (2002) 57 NSWLR 146. 
       
       
      (b) the applicant’s criminal record was considerably worse than that of O’Brien, having spanned not only a longer period (13 years compared with six years) but also having included more convictions. 
      
      
     
      
       
        
        (i) As a result, he had been sentenced to, and had served, more prison time than O’Brien; and he had paid, at best, lip services to the non-custodial alternatives which had been extended, including community service orders and bonds to be of good behaviour. In this regard, her Honour’s assessment of his attitude as having involved “a blatant disregard” for the opportunities provided through conditional liberty, was well justified.  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          While neither had prior convictions for drug supply offences, the applicant’s record included offences of use offensive language, resist arrest, assault police, escape lawful custody, malicious damage, cruelty to animals, possess prohibited drugs, receiving, stealing, larceny, as well as multiple serious offences concerning the unlawful use of motor vehicles and driving while cancelled or disqualified. He also had convictions for failure to appear, as well as for acts of dishonesty concerned with the provision of false particulars, the use of plates calculated to deceive, and obtaining benefits by deception. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (ii) O’Brien’s record also involved some offences of dishonesty in relation to the theft and use of motor vehicles, as well as some drug-related offences, and Coleman DCJ also noted that he had demonstrated a “continued attitude of disobedience to the law”. However, he had less items on his record and he had only received relatively short sentences, on one occasion following revocation of a sentence of periodic detention. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (c) at the time of the present offences, the applicant had been on parole and was subject to a three year bond to be of good behaviour, circumstances which had to be regarded as serious aggravating factors:  
      R v Richards 
       [1981] 2 NSWLR 464 and  
      R v Readman 
       (1990) 47 A Crim R 181: 
       
       
        
        (i) He had only been out of prison for three months when he committed the first offence on the Form 1, and thereafter he conducted what was obviously an active business of supplying drugs from which he stood to earn a significant profit, as well as being able to feed any addiction he may have had.  
         
        (ii) O’Brien had not been subject to conditional liberty at the time of his offences and there was no evidence to show that he had been engaged in drug dealing on a commercial basis, to the same extent as the applicant. He had been found by Coleman DCJ to have been a user, but not a dealer, at the time of his first offence and he was not regarded as being part of any supply distribution network at the time that the applicant’s offences had begun. 
         
        (iii) Additionally, the applicant’s offences on the Form 1 extended to heroin and to “shaboo”, or drugs of higher purity than that involved in the offences for which O’Brien was sentenced. 
        
       
       
      (d) the applicant’s subjective circumstances were less favourable since he had not held regular employment for the four years before his arrest, and had been involved in the heavy use of cannabis over the preceding two months. O’Brien, on the other hand, had obtained employment while on bail. Coleman DCJ had been impressed by the evidence which suggested that he had become a changed person who had grown up, who had been trying to stop his brother from repeating his mistakes, and who had been a reliable and hard-working young man. 
       
       
      (e) the applicant’s plea of guilty had been entered on a much later dated (4 September 2002) than O’Brien (25 January 2002), a circumstance which became reflected by the twenty-five per cent discount given to O’Brien compared with the fifteen per cent discount given to the applicant. Her Honour did, however, recognise the need for some accommodation in relation to this factor since the delay in sentencing had not been occasioned by the applicant. 
       
      
    22 The differences identified are real, and the two cases do not stand on an equal footing, either objectively or subjectively. The sentences imposed by her Honour were, in my view, well within the proper exercise of sentencing discretion for offences that called for significant punishment and in respect of which the elements of personal and general deterrence loomed large. 
     
      
    23 I would grant leave to appeal but I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    24 SMART AJ: I agree. 
     
      
    25 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the court will be as I proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against orders made by his Honour Judge Coorey in the District Court at Sydney ruling inadmissible evidence of the finding of 27.44 grams of Methylamphetamine, two resealable plastic bags and a foil in a motor vehicle driven by the respondent, and the contents of an electronically recorded interview with the respondent following his subsequent arrest on the same day. His Honour held that the search of the respondent’s vehicle which resulted in the finding of the drugs was illegal, being not authorised by s 357E of the Crimes Act 1900, and that consequently the finding of the drugs and the admissions made by the respondent in the interview was improperly or illegally obtained evidence within the terms of s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995.2 The trial of the respondent commenced on 14 July 2003 before his Honour sitting without a jury on the charge that, on 19 December 2002 at Narrabeen, he did supply a prohibited drug, namely, Methylamphetamine, contrary to the provisions of s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1986.3 After the respondent had pleaded not guilty, his counsel submitted that the evidence of the search and recorded interview should be excluded and his Honour heard the relevant evidence, including evidence from the respondent, on the voir dire. 4 The evidence for the Crown was that at about 3.30pm on 19 December, Detectives Arthurs and Mulheron, who were then on foot, saw the respondent, the sole occupant, driving slowly along Pittwater Road, Narrabeen in a dirty late model Holden Commodore car bearing the number plate RSX-374. On returning to their police car Detective Arthurs made inquiries which showed that the car was unregistered and uninsured, the registration having expired on 30 November 2002.5 On that information, Detective Arthurs decided to stop the car and at about 6pm later that day, when they were in an unmarked police vehicle, the detectives again saw the respondent driving the same vehicle on Pittwater Road. The police car siren was activated whereupon Detective Arthurs saw the respondent immediately reach down with his left hand and forward to the floor area, continuing to do so until the car stopped. Detective Mulheron also saw the respondent reach to his left and slightly forward, at which stage Detective Arthurs said to him, “that looked a bit odd”.6 After the car had been stopped the respondent produced to Detective Arthurs a driver’s licence which had also expired and this was confirmed by inquiry. When asked by Detective Arthurs, “When we pulled you over you were bending to your left, what was that all about?” the respondent replied, “I don’t know, I’ve got a lot of stuff in my car”. Detective Arthurs asked, “Is there anything in your car which should not be there?” to which the respondent replied, “No”.7 Detective Arthurs then looked into the car and saw a large number of clothes, which appeared to be rubbish, drinks and things like that, on the front passenger seat and also on the rear seat and floor areas. He saw on the driver’s side floor, halfway between the seat and the brake peddles, leading up to the central console area, what he said appeared to him as “a small crowbar 15 to 20 cm long and a pair of gloves”.8 When asked by Detective Arthurs “What are the gloves and tool for?” the respondent replied, “Scaffolding”. Detective Arthurs then asked, “Where do you do that?” and the respondent replied, “I don’t any more, I work for URM”. Detective Arthurs understood this to be a reference to United Resource Management, the Warringah Council Waste Depot at Belrose, and this was confirmed by the respondent. Detective Arthurs said that, taking into account the respondent bending down as described, he thought the tool and gloves might be used as housebreaking implements and decided to search the car pursuant to s 357E of the Crimes Act.9 He then said to the respondent, “I am going to search your car. Is there anything in here that you want to tell me about or anything in here that may hurt me such as syringes?” The respondent replied “No”. He said in evidence he asked that because the car appeared to be dirty and he wanted to be sure that he would come to no harm himself. 10 Upon searching the car Detective Arthurs found under the driver’s seat a plastic bag containing beige powder which he suspected to be Methylamphetamine and when he asked what it was, the respondent replied “I’ve never seen that before”. 11 Detective Arthurs arrested and handcuffed the respondent and asked, “Is there anything else here that I should know about?” to which the respondent replied “No”. The two detectives then further searched the car and Detective Arthurs found under the driver’s seat another plastic bag of beige powder and a foil also containing beige powder, which he showed to the respondent and asked, “What are these?”. The respondent replied “Speed”. In a pocket of a pair of shorts on the back seat of the car, Detective Mulheron found 24 resealable plastic bags which were later explained as being for the respondent’s son’s medication and, in the boot of the car, a glass bong.12 The beige powder was on analysis found to be Methylamphetamine weighing in total 27.44 grams. The trafficable quantity for this drug is 3 grams.13 Later that day the respondent was interviewed by way of an electronically recorded interview, during the course of which he said that the powder in the two bags and foil was “Speed”, which he understood to be a prohibited drug, that he had bought it the day before at Lane Cove and had paid $470 for it, of which he contributed $50, and the rest was from some friends with whom he intended to share the drugs.14 There was evidence in the Crown case that the street value of the Methylamphetamine was not less than $950 to $1350 in its then condition or, if sold in one gram deals, up to $2430, but his Honour rejected this evidence as there was no basis for inferring that it was going to be cut, sold or supplied, otherwise than shared between the respondent and his friends.15 No photographs of the tool or the gloves was produced, but it was not put to Detective Arthurs in cross-examination that when he decided to search the car he had decided to search for drugs and not in relation to house- breaking equipment or illegally obtained goods. Detective Arthurs evidence was generally corroborated by that of Detective Mulheron.16 The respondent’s evidence on the voir dire was that he had worked as a scaffolder for 12 years but the previous 2 years he had been employed by United Resource Management and had not worked full-time as a scaffolder during that time, but had only done occasional work of that nature. He said he bought the car during the week before 19 December and had put old tools in it because he was going to move house and was using the car as storage.17 He said the tool seen by Detective Arthurs was a scaffolding hammer which he described and drew (Exhibit 1), that he had used it in an attempt to start the car when his battery needed changing and afterwards he had dropped it on the front floor of the car on the driver’s side, but the gloves were heavy duty issue from United Resource Management.18 He described his movements on 19 December, and said that after leaving a bottle shop where he had bought four cans of Bourbon and Coke, he put his wallet on the centre console of his car and when he saw the lights of the police car, he reached to the left to pick up his wallet. He did not remember being asked by Detective Arthurs why he had been leaning down. He did not deny it had happened and accepted that he had not said “I leaned over to pick up my wallet”. 19 He said that when asked by Detective Arthurs about the gloves and tool he said the tool was for work. He accepted he it was a strong tool with a little bit of weight and was comparable to a shifting spanner. He agreed that Detective Arthurs had then searched under the driver’s seat and found the bags and foil; he had placed them there the day before because he did not want them in the house with his children there, and he wasn’t really using the car. 20 He accepted that he had not told Detective Arthurs that he leant forward to pick up his wallet nor that he had taken the tools for use with him on the battery terminals. The property record of the respondent did not show that he had a wallet in his possession at the time of his arrest (Exhibit J).21 In delivering judgment his Honour, in accordance with the concession made by counsel for the respondent, made a specific finding that there was a proper basis for stopping the vehicle. He then referred to the evidence of the accused bending over to his left, the finding of the gloves and the tool described, and the evidence given by Detective Arthurs that he decided to search the vehicle when he saw the tool and gloves.22 His Honour was concerned that before the search the respondent was not asked whether he had any stolen articles or told of the detectives’ suspicions, and noted that there was no photograph of the tool or gloves, although there were photographs of the drugs. He concluded that there was no basis for the suspicion, required by s 357E and, accordingly, that the search of the car was unlawful.  
     
      
    23 He then referred briefly to s 138 of the Evidence Act and said that, taking into account all the considerations referred to therein, it was proper that he should exclude the evidence. 24 On being asked to give reasons in relation to the discretion under s 138, his Honour set out the provisions of subs (1) and said, “I am not satisfied that the desirability of admission outweighs the undesirability of admission”. He then set out the provisions of subs (3) and found that the evidence had a probative value and clearly was important.25 As to the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, he said it seemed that the officer was of the view that he had a legal right to search, but he was puzzled as to why the respondent was never asked for permission to search, which may have been given, and he was unable to decide whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless and said that it was the right of every person not to have his vehicle searched unless there was sufficient reason.  
     
      
    26 His Honour continued as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other thing that does concern me about the case is this, that this application has no merits in a moral sense because the applicant is clearly guilty; he has admitted his guilt. The sole basis of this application is the legality of the search but, as I remind myself, this is a court of law and not a court of morals. If it was a court of morals my result would be different because it seems to me that the guilt of this person is so obvious 
        , but I am unable to say that there was a sufficient basis for the search and therefore I reject the evidence 
        .” (my emphasis) 
        
       
      
    27 Following this, in a separate judgment, his Honour excluded the evidence of the electronically recorded interview because that interview had taken place in consequence of the illegal search.28 Section 357E of the Crimes Act provides that a member of the police force may stop, search, and detain any vehicle in which he or she reasonably suspects there is anything stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained or anything used or intended to be used in the commission of an indictable offence. The onus of proving that the evidence was illegally obtained within the terms of s 138(1) of the Evidence Act rests on the party asserting the same, in this case the present respondent.29 A reasonable suspicion involves less than a reasonable belief, but more than a possibility and some factual basis for it must be shown: R v Rondo [2001] NSWCCA 540, 126 A Crim R 562 at [53].30 Notwithstanding his Honour’s concern about the failure of the police to inquire of the respondent whether he was carrying any stolen goods or housebreaking implements in the car, the lack of a photo of the tool and gloves, and the respondent’s description of the tool as a “scaffolding hammer”, I am satisfied that when Detective Arthurs saw the tool, which appeared to him to be like a small crowbar, and the gloves, that he had seen the respondent leaning to his left and forward when the police alarm was activated, and that the car contained a lot of clothes and other material, the police had reasonable grounds to suspect that the vehicle contained items which might be used for housebreaking or in the commission of another indictable offence. The respondent’s movement forward to his left, consistent with placing something in the glove box.31 I do not regard the absence of the photographs of the tool to be of significance because after the discovery of the drugs, it was hardly to be anticipated that the appearance of the so-called scaffolding hammer would become an issue at the trial.32 The respondent agreed in his evidence that the tool and gloves were on the floor of the car, and drew a sketch of it. His Honour also placed reliance on the failure of Detective Arhurs to inquire whether the respondent had any stolen goods in his car and on his failure to ask for permission to search the car. I would not place the same significance on these omissions. If he had been intending to search for drugs, he could equally as well have asked for permission.33 For these reasons I am satisfied that his Honour was in error in finding that the search of the vehicle was illegal and, therefore, there was no ground for excluding the evidence of the finding of the drugs, or the evidence of the electronically recorded interview.34 However, on the hypothesis that the search of the vehicle was illegal, I am still satisfied that his Honour was in error in excluding the evidence. Section 138(1) of the Evidence Act provides that improper or illegally obtained evidence is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence has been obtained. 
     
      
    35 Subs 3 is as follows:  
     
      
      Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
      
     
     
      
      (a) the probative value of the evidence, and  
      
    (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and  
     
      
      (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and  
      
    (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and  
     
      
      (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and  
       
      (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the  
      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
       , and  
       
      (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and  
       
      (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.  
       
      
    36 Once the illegality or impropriety has been established, the onus is on the party seeking to lead the evidence that the discretion and balancing exercise conferred on the Court by subs (1) should, by reference to the matters set out in subs (3), and any other relevant matters, be exercised by admitting the evidence. 
     
      
    37 Although his Honour referred to a number of the particular items referred to in s 138(3) he does not appear to have attempted any weighing up or balancing exercise so as to inform a proper exercise of his discretion. The matters in the sub-section are not exhaustive and in the passage quoted above from his judgment, he made an express finding that the objection to the evidence was totally without merit and the respondent was clearly guilty of the offence.38 This consideration should have been given significance by his Honour in the exercise of his discretion but having referred to it, and having previously referred to the relevant matters specified in s 138(3), he concluded his judgment without further referring to these matters and simply stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am unable to say there was sufficient basis for the search and therefore I reject the evidence”. 
        
       
      
    39 On first reading this passage it seemed to indicate that his Honour had not taken either the lack of merit or any of the matters he had considered by reference to subs (3) into account, but having found the search was illegal he had rejected the evidence as a matter of course.40 That, however, may be a misreading of his Honour’s judgment, bearing in mind the pressure that Judges in the District Court are under to produce judgments and rulings at short notice. However, assuming that his Honour did take those matters into account and did weigh them up, he does not appear to have come back to the essential question which subs (1) required him to consider, namely, to determine whether the public interest in admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting the evidence that had been obtained in the way in which this evidence was obtained.41 As pointed out in Bunning v Cross (1978) 141 CLR 54 at 74, what must be resolved is:  
     
      
       
        
        “the apparent conflict between the desirable goal of bringing to conviction...whose task it is to enforce the law”. 
        
       
      
    42 His Honour does not appear to have adverted to the public interest in bringing offenders to conviction provided it is not done at too high a price.43 His Honour’s discretion, and the balancing exercise required, not having been properly exercised in accordance with the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, it becomes necessary for this Court to carry out this exercise. As well as his Honour’s finding that the application was without merit in that the respondent was clearly and admittedly guilty, the other relevant considerations under subs (3) all strongly favoured the admission of the evidence, namely, its probative value, its importance in the proceedings, the nature of the offence, namely, the supply or dissemination of prohibited drugs, and his Honour’s finding that the detective was of the view that he had the legal right to search, which indicated that the impropriety or contravention was not deliberate or reckless, particularly in light of the fact that the police had good reason to stop the car in the first place.44 It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that this was only a minor offence, a victimless crime. I disagree. Every dissemination of prohibited drugs in our community is a serious offence, including the purchase of such drugs for distribution to and sharing amongst friends. It is an indictable offence and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years or a fine of $220,000 or both. Moreover, although it involved an invasion of the respondent’s privacy in a search of his car, I would not regard such impropriety or contravention as very grave.45 All the relevant considerations therefore pointed to the balancing exercise required by subs (1) being exercised in favour of the admission of the evidence, and there were no indicators to the contrary.46 Accordingly, the evidence of the search should have been admitted, and once that evidence was admitted, there was no basis for excluding the evidence of the electronically recorded interview.47 For these reasons I am satisfied that his Honour was in error in ruling as he did. The Crown appeal should be allowed and it should be ordered that the evidence of the search of the motor vehicle and of the electronically recorded interview are admissible in the trial of the respondent. The matter should be remitted to the District Court for the continuation of the respondent’s trial.48 SPIGELMAN CJ: The foundation of the jurisdiction that his Honour exercised under s 138 of the Evidence Act was a finding by his Honour that the search of the vehicle was not authorised pursuant to s 357E of the Crimes Act 1900.49 Dunford J has come to the view that the search was justified on the basis of the facts that his Honour has set out in his reasons. I am not so satisfied.50 The critical matter upon which the police acted was observing a crowbar type of instrument, referred to as a scaffolding hammer, together with some gloves used for working purposes, in the car. That was reinforced by the statement made to the effect that whilst the person had once worked in the scaffolding industry, he was not at that time working in the scaffolding industry.51 I am not of the view that that created a basis for a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle contained instruments that may have been used in housebreaking.  
     
      
    52 In my view there was no basis for the search of the vehicle pursuant to s 357E and, accordingly, the evidence had been obtained as a consequence of impropriety or contravention, within the meaning of s 138(1). 53 As Dunford J has outlined, his Honour first adverted in general terms to the contents of s 138(1) and announced a conclusory opinion that, taking into account the considerations set out in that sub-section, it was “proper” that the evidence be excluded. Thereafter, his Honour was asked to state his reasons more fully, which his Honour proceeded to do.54 The first thing that his Honour did was to direct attention to sub-s 1 of s 138 and then outline, again in a very conclusory way, the fact that he was not satisfied that the desirability of admission outweighed the undesirability of admission. His Honour did not state in any manner the reasons for this conclusion, which involved a balancing of the conflicting public interests which may, in short measure, be referred to as the desirability of giving effect to the public interest in ensuring that a criminal is punished for the crime, on the one hand, and the desirability, on the other hand, of proper and legal conduct particularly, relevantly for present purposes, on the part of those whose job it is to enforce the law.55 In so far as his Honour gave reasons for reaching the balance that he did, they were outlined in the manner referred to by Dunford J. This included a recitation of the matters in s 138(3), with observations leading to a conclusory statement, namely, that there was “not a sufficient basis for the search” and, therefore, as his Honour put it, “I reject the evidence”.56 In coming to my conclusion, I have been reluctant to apply too fine an analysis to his Honour’s reasons. District Court Judges operate under considerable pressure and one should not parse and analyse their judgments.  
     
      
    57 Nevertheless, for the reasons mentioned by Dunford J, I am on balance satisfied that in these particular circumstances his Honour, in the end, did not undertake a balancing exercise, although he asserted in a conclusory fashion that that was what he did.58 The reasons he gave were not of a character indicating any form of balancing. In so far as something like balancing is to be encompassed in the terminology “sufficient basis”, on my reading of the judgment it is, in my opinion, unlikely to reflect a balancing process. Rather, it reflects a process in which his Honour moved directly from the existence of the illegality to the conclusion of rejection.59 I must say this is something on which my mind has fluctuated during the course of preparing for this trial and also in the course of the hearing. Nevertheless, I come to the conclusion, on balance, that the alternative way in which Dunford J outlined in his reasons, namely, on the assumption that there was illegality, is justified. I adopt his Honour’s reasons in that regard. I also adopt the reasons of Dunford J for concluding that this Court ought to make the judgment under s 138 in a manner favourable to the admissibility of the evidence.60 I accordingly agree with the orders proposed by Dunford J.61 HIDDEN J: I also agree. I find it unnecessary to determine whether the search was legal. It is sufficient to say that I agree that his Honour does not appear to have performed the balancing act that s 138 of the Act requires. I agree with the orders proposed.62 SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders are as indicated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 DUNFORD J: This is an application for leave to appeal by Craig Besant against the sentences imposed on him by Judge Graham in the District Court at Sydney on 2 May 2002 in respect to two counts of dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 10 years. He had originally pleas not guilty but on the fourth day of the pre-trial voir dire, he changed his plea to guilty.2 A Form 1 matter of refusing to provide a blood sample was taken into account on count 1. On count 1 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years commencing on 2 May 2002 and expiring on 1 May 2007 with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 2 May 2002 and expiring on 1 May 2006.3 On the second count, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years commencing on 2 May 2003 and expiring on 1 May 2008 with a non-parole period of three years commencing on 2 May 2003 and expiring on 1 May 2006.4 Count 1 related to the death of Wendy Brazier, who was 54 years old at the time of her death. Whilst count 2 related to the death of her daughter Heather, who was 20 years old at the time. Mr Brazier, who was driving the vehicle hit by the applicant’s semitrailer, survived the impact, which killed his wife and daughter, suffering a broken jaw and bruising. He could not remember the impact.5 The sentence on count 2 was partly cumulative upon the sentence for count 1. Thus the total period of imprisonment ordered was 6 years from 2 May 2002 to 1 May 2008 with a total non-parole period of 4 years from 2 May 2002 to 1 May 2006.6 The sentencing Judge found special circumstances, namely that this was the applicant’s first time in custody; that he was in a psychological state of depression with a possible risk of self-harm and that he needed an acceptable period of parole for his treatment and supervision. Although not reflected in the sentence on count 1, the special circumstances were reflected in the sentence on count 2 and, because of the way the sentences were structured, in the total sentence to be served.7 The facts revealed an extremely high level of moral culpability in respect of the applicant. The impact causing the death of the victims occurred on Thursday 1 February 2001 when the applicant was driving his semi-trailer north on the Pacific Highway at Tabbimoble. The applicant was a professional truck driver. He had set off between 8.30 pm and 9.00 pm the previous night from Blacktown in Sydney heading for Brisbane. He was on a tight time schedule and said he needed to be in Brisbane within nine hours. It is not clear from where the nine hours was, and he did not record any rest times in his log book. 8 He told police he had stopped at Wyong for fuel, at the Shell Service Station at Port Macquarie and that he had slept at Woolgoolga near Coffs Harbour. He had a passenger, who confirmed the stop at Wyong and a lunch stop at Woolgoolga, but said that the lunch stop was for about 10 minutes and they ate their lunch in the cabin of the truck because of the time constraints on the applicant. The passenger was asleep at the time of the collision and throughout the part of the journey relied upon by the Crown as the dangerous driving. 9 The fatal impact occurred when the applicant fell asleep while driving his semitrailer. It veered onto the southern carriageway of the Pacific Highway narrowly missing two oncoming cars. The applicant woke up and swerved back to the correct side of the road to avoid hitting the victims’ car, which was travelling south on the Pacific Highway. At the same time, Mr Brazier, also swerved to the northern carriageway to try and avoid being hit by the applicant’s truck, which, until Mr Brazier swerved, had been coming towards him in the wrong lane. The vehicles collided. The main force of the impact was to the passengers’ side of Mr Brazier’s car where his wife and daughter were seated. That side of the car was destroyed and Wendy and Heather Brazier died as a result of the impact.10 The applicant refused to undergo a blood test, claiming he had a fear of needles. He provided a urine sample that was positive to the presence of amphetamines, and a bag of white powder containing amphetamines was found under the driver’s seat cover of his vehicle. The applicant denied to police having taken any drugs in the 24 hours prior to the collision and denied any knowledge of the drugs found in his vehicle. 11 The expert evidence on the voir dire was to the effect that the course of the applicant’s driving prior to the collision was consistent with the applicant being affected by fatigue due to amphetamine use. The expert witnesses said that as the urine sample did not provide any details as to quantity, it could not be said that the applicant was under the influence of the drug at the intoxication stage, but rather in the subsequent “coming down” phase where symptoms of fatigue were likely.12 The sentencing judge found that the principal cause of the applicant’s fatigue was his lack of sleep caused by working all day and driving through the night with inadequate rest stops during his journey. A contributing factor to that fatigue was his use of amphetamines.13 The applicant’s drug use was one aggravating feature of the case. Another aggravating feature was the prior driving of the applicant. For a distance of between 50 and 58 kilometres leading up to the collision over about half an hour, the applicant drove his vehicle in a highly erratic and dangerous manner. Three witnesses, who were driving three separate cars in the area, provided evidence of eight occasions when the applicant either drove onto the wrong side of the Pacific Highway and then corrected erratically, overtook dangerously or pulled out onto the highway without warning. Fatalities were only prevented by the other drivers involved taking emergency action to avoid being hit by the applicant’s semi-trailer. One driver, Mr Lewis, was forced onto the wrong side of the highway by the applicant.  
     
      
    14 In addition to these incidents, immediately before the collision two other cars travelling southbound on the Pacific Highway were narrowly missed by the applicant before he hit the victims’ car. One of these cars had to swerve off the road into a ditch to avoid being hit by the applicant’s semi-trailer and the other had to swerve left to avoid him, missing the semi-trailer by inches.  
     
      
    15 Leaving aside the people in the victims’ vehicle, 10 other persons (11 if one includes the applicant’s passenger) were lucky to escape with their lives as a result of the applicant’s driving. One of these people, Mr Armstrong, had obtained the registration number of the applicant’s semi-trailer and reported his dangerous driving to the Grafton Police at 2.43pm on 1 February 2001, about 15 minutes before the fatal collision.16 The applicant’s course of dangerous driving was aggravating in itself. However, an additional aggravating feature in respect of it was that it demonstrated that throughout this part of his journey the applicant had lost and then regained control of his vehicle in circumstances where he must have known he had fallen asleep and was a danger to other road users. He clearly woke up on numerous occasions on the wrong side of the road and then corrected violently. Nevertheless, he continued his journey in heavy rain; the weather conditions at the time described by one witness Mr Lewis as “almost cyclonic” and “quite appalling”. The applicant’s speed, although not by and large above the legal speed limit, was too fast for these conditions. 17 His Honour took these matters into account and, in sentencing the applicant, said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Those witnesses provided compelling evidence of a course of erratic – and seriously erratic – driving on the part of the offender, stretching over a substantial period of time and over a distance in excess of fifty kilometres. Whilst it is true the driving was not erratic over every moment of that journey, the number, nature and the spread of those incidents observed by the various witnesses establishes that the incident, which occurred at Tabbimoble could not be regarded as an isolated incident but was consistent with an earlier pattern of driving and consistent, also, with the driver of that prime mover having had a number of warnings, arising out of these incidents, which would have caused any responsible motorist, let alone one driving a heavy semi-tailer, to take stock of the situation, stop and obtain sufficient rest. That course of driving ought to have made it perfectly plain to the offender that he simply could not have continued his journey no matter how urgent the necessity for him to reach Brisbane to deliver his load.” 
        
       
      
    18 Those findings were open, if not inevitable, on the evidence and, in my view, accurately sum up the proper basis for sentencing the applicant.  
     
      
    19 The applicant relies on a number of grounds and the submissions relating to them overlap to a considerable degree. Although little purpose is to be served in dealing with them all individually, one matter that does call for some particular comment is Ground 1 to the effect that his Honour misdirected himself by placing too much emphasis on the judgment in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. In that case, this Court revised and reformulated the guidelines laid down for cases of this nature in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 in the light of what had been said by the High Court in Wong v The Queen (2001) 207 CLR 584 and Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339 and by this court in R v Sharma (2002) 54 NSWLR 300. It also took into account the provisions of s 21A (particularly s 21A(4)) and s 42A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, both of which require the Court to have regard to guideline judgments as well as other matters specified in s 21A. Section 21A has since been replaced but subs (4) remains the same. 20 In his written submissions, counsel for the applicant in relation to this ground appears to identify the principles of sentencing with those subjective matters favourable to the applicant. This is a mistake. The principles of sentencing, including those set out in s 21A(2)(a), include objective features of the offence, the need for general and personal deterrence, protection of the community, the need for punishment, as well as subjective features both favourable and unfavourable, see in particular s 21A(2)(i) and (j). 21 I do not see in his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence any failure to take into account the subjective considerations favourable to the applicant. He accepted and took into account that the applicant had been depressed at the time of the offences due to the turmoil in his personal life, and that his offending (including previous and subsequent offending) was a manifestation of this turmoil. This was reflected in both the head sentences and the finding of special circumstances.  
     
      
    22 The sentencing judge also accepted that the applicant was remorseful. He had expressed remorse to a psychologist, Miss Kathleen Barrier, and to Ms Lynch of the Probation and Parole Service. His Honour was prepared to accept the applicant’s remorse as genuine despite the fact that the applicant had not complied with previous probation requirements, had driven whilst disqualified twice since the present offences, and had been described by Ms Lynch, as a man who: 
     
      
       
        
        “has difficulty in accepting responsibility for his offending behaviour by his continued blaming of the system and his poor choice of associates. The offender has also failed to take advantage of the opportunities afforded him by both the court and this Service by way of a previous supervised Section 9 bond”.  
        
       
      
    23 One matter that I would like to comment on is that his Honour regarded this as an early plea of guilty. I do not see it in that way. The position from the day of the accident was that the applicant had driven onto the incorrect side of the road and, in attempting to correct, had collided with a vehicle, which had been forced by his driving to take evasive action. He could have pleaded guilty at the committal and argued any disputed issues of fact in the sentencing proceedings. Instead of that he pleaded not guilty on arraignment and disputed the pharmacological evidence and the evidence of a number of witnesses relating to his earlier driving.24 The examination of these witnesses took something like two and a half days and it was only on the morning of the fourth day that he changed his pleas to guilty. This change of pleas certainly had a utilitarian value and he is entitled to have it taken into account in his favour. It saved probably four or five days of the actual trial before a jury, but to describe it as ""an early plea"" is, in my view, a misuse of the word ""early"".25 R v Whyte and R v Jurisic deal with typical cases as outlined in para [204] of Whyte, but this was not such a typical case. He was not such a young offender, being aged 31 at the time. He had been of generally good character, but in the months before these offences he had been charged with, and was subsequently convicted of, driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, 2 counts of goods in custody, possessing a prohibited drug, larceny, and failure to allow a blood sample to be taken.26 He also had a bad driving record. His Honour did not regard it as so bad for a truck driver, but it certainly cannot be classified as a good one. In the two years prior to this unfortunate accident, there were three fines for exceeding the speed limit by more than 15 kilometres an hour, another exceeding the speed limit and one of negligent driving. There were 2 persons, not 1, who had been killed, and they were both strangers.27 The applicant suffered no sufficient injuries, but his Honour did find genuine remorse and a plea of limited utilitarian value.28 Turning to the list of aggravating factors set out in paras [216] and [217] of Whyte, I have already referred to the fact that 2 persons were killed. The number of persons put at risk extended beyond those killed and included Mr Brazier, the drivers and passengers of the two vehicles ahead of Mr Brazier's vehicle, who had to take evasive action to avoid collision, the persons who gave evidence on the voir dire of their observations of the applicant driving for a half hour and 50 kilometres prior to the collision and, indeed, any other persons, at least those travelling south, who were on the relevant part of the roadway at the time. His Honour found the speed was not excessive in the sense of beyond the speed limit, but a bit too high having regard to the weather conditions.29 I have already referred to the amphetamines and their “coming down” stage and to the length of time during which others were exposed to risk. The degree of sleep deprivation and the ignoring of warnings can be considered together and I won't repeat the facts relating to that but, in summary, the applicant had very little sleep for close to 18 hours, and should have realised that he was too tired to continue driving.30 Beyond that, there was the driving described by the witnesses over the previous 50 kilometres. This obvious difficulty in controlling the vehicle must have brought home to the applicant that he was simply too fatigued to drive, and to continue driving in those circumstances constituted a complete negation of his responsibilities to his fellow road users. It would not have been surprising if more people had been killed.31 This is not a case of simply one or two aggravating factors such as referred to in Whyte and Jurisic, but the combination of a significantly large number of such matters. It does not lessen the moral culpability to say that the applicant was not intoxicated.32 As Whyte and Jurisic make clear, where there are a number of such aggravating factors and the moral culpability is high, a sentence higher than the three years indicated as a guideline may be appropriate. In my view, this was such a case.33 As pointed out, and Mr Bonnici referred to this, in Jurisic at 228 citing R v Musumeci (CCA – 30/10/1997), the legislature has always placed a premium upon human life, the real substance of the offence is not just the dangerous driving; it is the dangerous driving in association with the taking of a human life, or in this case, two human lives, there is a need for public deterrence in this type of case, the courts must tread warily in showing leniency for good character in such cases, and persuasive subjective circumstances must not lead to inadequate weight being given to the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    34 Although it has undoubtedly been said many times before, it bears repeating yet again that motorists must not drive when they are over tired and this applies particularly to long distance truck drivers in control of heavy vehicles attempting to meet deadlines. In cases such as the present, general deterrence is an important element in the sentencing process. 
     
      
    35 For these reasons, I am satisfied that the head sentence of 6 years was well within the range of a proper sentencing discretion.36 Counsel for the applicant has made special reference in his submissions to his Honour's finding of “special circumstances” and has submitted that, the way the sentence was structured, insufficient weight was paid to them.37 I have already referred to the considerations that his Honour referred to when finding special circumstances. They are set out in more detail in the report of Katherine Barrier, which was exhibit 1 before the learned sentencing Judge.38 These offences occurred at a time when his life had become somewhat chaotic with his attempts to save his marriage, but its ultimate breakdown, his engagement of other drivers to do the driving of his truck for him, and the fact that those attempts also turned out to be disastrous. There was the loss of his children and he ultimately went back to long distance driving when he was depressed and, as I say, his life was in a state of turmoil.39 In those circumstances, I have ultimately - and after a lot of thought - come to the conclusion that the special circumstances, including his depression, the fact that he had not previously been in gaol and that, until this turmoil in his life, he had not committed any offences other than the traffic matters for which he had been fined, although his Honour found special circumstances and took them into account, in all the circumstances, he should have taken them into account to a degree more favourable to the applicant and that, accordingly, some adjustment of the nonparole period is appropriate.40 I would, therefore, propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted. I would confirm the head sentences in each case. I would set aside the nonparole periods. On count 1 I would fix a nonparole period of three years commencing on 2 May 2002 and expiring on 1 May 2005, and in respect of count 2, I would fix a nonparole period of two and a half years commencing on 2 May 2003 and expiring on 1 November 2005. I would confirm the order for disqualification from holding a driver's licence.41 WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. I only add that I would specify the first day in which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole would be 1 November 2005.42 GROVE J: I agree.43 WOOD CJ at CL: The orders of the Court will be as stated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BARR J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court. The applicant, Sonia Hide, was to stand trial for one count of the ongoing supply of cocaine and methylamphetamine for financial reward.2 On 4 November 2002, the date fixed for the commencement of her trial, she pleaded guilty. On 31 January 2003 Sides QC DCJ sentenced her to imprisonment for four years and fixed a non-parole period of two years. In doing so his Honour took into account under the provisions of s32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the fact that at the time of her arrest the applicant had in her custody the sum of $975 in cash which had been unlawfully obtained.3 On 16 October 2001, in the course of her work of supplying illegal drugs, the applicant was introduced to an undercover police operative who was using the name Jamie. On that day she met him by arrangement in a car park in Cartwright. She supplied him with .82 grams of cocaine which was 58.5 per cent pure. The price was $200. They spoke about further sales.4 Two days later they met according to similar arrangements and the applicant supplied .87 grams of cocaine for $200. There was no evidence of the purity of the substance sold. Shortly afterwards the applicant rang the operative and asked to meet him again. She said there had been a mix-up. As a result they met again and the applicant added a further small quantity of drug to the amount supplied earlier on that day. It was apparent from conversations of which there was evidence that the confusion had been with drugs intended for another purchaser.5 On the following day the applicant and the operative met again by arrangement in the same place. The applicant supplied 3.1 grams of methylamphetamine for $200. The purity was 12.5 per cent. On the next day they met again and the applicant sold him 2.8 grams of methylamphetamine for $160.6 Two days later the applicant supplied him with 3.74 grams of methylamphetamine, some in powder and some in tablets. The purity was 10.5 per cent.  
     
      
    7 During that meeting the applicant and the undercover operative spoke about the further supply of drugs and the applicant indicated that she could supply an ounce of amphetamine for $1000. A little later there was a telephone conversation between the two in which the supply of an ounce of amphetamine was requested. The applicant asked for time. Ultimately the projected sale went off when the applicant said that she could not supply the drug without a further extension of time.8 His Honour was satisfied that there was an agreement on the part of the applicant to supply the operative with one ounce of amphetamine and that the applicant withdrew from the agreement to sell because she was becoming suspicious about the operative and feared detection. Although she had some concerns about her family and perhaps herself, his Honour found, they were not the principal reason for backing out.9 On each of the occasions when she met the operative the applicant was in a car. Also in the car was a woman who was never identified, presumably the supplier or an agent of the supplier of drugs to the applicant, and the applicant’s four year old daughter. 10 At the time of sentence the applicant was a single woman of twenty-nine years of age. She had the sole care of her daughter, who was then aged almost four and a half years. Although she had obtained her school certificate, the applicant was said to be illiterate and innumerate. She had had various unskilled jobs but had not worked since the birth of her child. She was five months pregnant.11 There are three grounds of appeal. The first is that the sentence did not reflect the hardship which would result to third parties, namely the applicant’s daughter and her unborn child. The second is that the sentence did not give expression to any mitigation by virtue of the fact the applicant had been entrapped into the commission of the offence. The third is that, in combination with the first two grounds, the very length of the sentence demonstrates error, especially in view of sentencing patterns discernible from Judicial Commission statistics and from certain cases concerned with the ongoing supply of drugs which have been dealt with in this court.12 Before hardship to dependants, family or third parties can be taken into account in imposing sentence it must go beyond the sort of hardship that inevitably results from sending any family member to prison. It is to be taken into account only in extreme or wholly exceptional circumstances: R v Edwards (1986) 90 A Crim R 510. 13 No case of hardship was put to his Honour. His Honour knew that the applicant was the sole carer of her daughter and himself precipitated evidence about the arrangements that would be made for her if he should sentence the applicant to full-time custody. It emerged that the applicant expected her mother to look after the child. No evidence was adduced to show that such hardship as would result was greater than that which would ordinarily result in such circumstances.  
     
      
    14 His Honour found that no such hardship had been demonstrated. It seems to me that that was a proper finding.15 It was not put to his Honour that the sentence should be any shorter because the undercover police operative had pretended to be a willing buyer, thereby encouraging the applicant to commit an offence she would not otherwise have committed. That is not surprising in view of other evidence about the applicant’s activities. A statement of the operative showed that the applicant was prepared to negotiate prices and to supply mixtures stronger than those commonly supplied. His Honour found that the $975 was the proceeds of drug sales. The applicant was wary of the police. Not only did she withdraw from the final offer because of her suspicions about the identity of Jamie, but she told him to take care, that the police were about.16 The onus of proof was on the applicant to show that she was entitled to a reduced sentence because of any activity of the operative. In R v Taouk (1992) 65 A Crim R 387, Badgery-Parker J said at 404: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question is not whether an accused can show that but for the involvement, encouragement or incitement by police he or she would not have committed the crime, rather whether in all the circumstances of the case the involvement of the police was such as to diminish the culpability of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    17 In my opinion, if a case had been put forward for a reduced sentence on account of the activities of the undercover police operative it would have failed. The features which I have summarised combine to show the applicant was engaged in the business of supplying drugs of her own volition. They would not support an argument that but for the activities of the operative the culpability of the applicant would have been diminished. In my opinion, there is no substance in this ground.18 It was finally submitted that Judicial Commission statistics and recent sentencing experience of the courts illustrated that the sentence was so severe as to be outside the range of discretion of the sentencing Judge. There was nothing about the features of this case, it was submitted, that justified such a harsh approach. 19 The Judicial Commission statistics that were put before the court do not, in my opinion, support the case the applicant seeks to make. Altogether, they show there have been 228 convictions for the offence of the ongoing supply of a prohibited drug which have resulted in a custodial sentence. About two-thirds of them concerned heroin. The head sentences range from six months to eight years and non-parole periods from six months to six years. For pleas of guilty there are only fifteen cases and ten of them concerned heroin. Head sentences range up to five years and non-parole periods up to three years six months.20 When amphetamine and cocaine cases are extracted, there are eighty-nine custody cases with head sentences ranging up to six years and non-parole periods to four years six months. Pleas of guilty total only five cases, too few to give any indication of a range. Although the head sentence and the non-parole period of the sentence appealed from each exceed the maxima so revealed by six months that, to my mind, cannot demonstrate error. There are simply too few cases to demonstrate a range of discretion.21 The court was taken in detail through most of the cases in a schedule of thirty-two cases summarising the facts of ongoing supply cases which have been dealt with in this court. I do not need to repeat the detail of the cases. Most produced sentences less than the one here appealed from. Of course, it is not appropriate to attempt to demonstrate error by reference to a sentence imposed in an unrelated case whose facts are said to be similar to the one under consideration: R v Jason Paul Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL at 371.22 Counsel sought to use the cases to demonstrate that there was an established pattern of sentences and that a broad range of criminality greater than the applicant’s had resulted in lower sentences than the one imposed on the applicant. The offence of the ongoing supply of a prohibited drug is a new offence. I think that the cases in the schedule referred to by counsel for the applicant can take his case so far but no further. They do show, I think, that the sentence appealed from was high when compared to a number of sentences imposed on other drug dealers. However, they do no more than that. It is not possible by consideration of so few cases to demonstrate error, in my opinion. It seems to me that the courts are still working out what will ultimately turn out to be a recognisable range of discretion in sentencing for this offence.23 I have omitted to deal with one matter. Mr Nicholson added to his submissions a submission that, given the fifteen per cent discount allowed by his Honour for the plea of guilty on the first day of the trial and the resulting head sentence of forty-eight months, his Honour must be taken to have commenced with a sentence of something like fifty-six or fifty-seven months. To that had to be added whatever value might be attributed to a further discount his Honour expressed as appropriate for the fact that the applicant withdrew from the final offer to supply the one ounce of amphetamine.24 This submission does not seem to me to advance the case significantly. Overall, it seems to me that it is still demonstrated that the sentence imposed by his Honour was high compared with an identifiable number of other cases but not that the sentence fell outside the range of his Honour’s discretion. His Honour’s judgment was detailed and careful and took into account every relevant feature. His Honour concluded, correctly on the evidence, that the applicant had entered the drug industry to make a large amount of money in quick time. Her business was flexible. She could supply a number of different kind of drugs and apparently in different degrees of purity.25 It is necessary to impose sentences which provide a strong deterrence against such activity. In my opinion, his Honour has not been shown to have exceeded the proper bounds of his discretion in imposing the head sentence or the non-parole period. 26 I would grant leave to appeal and would dismiss the appeal.27 NEWMAN AJ: I agree.28 BARR J: The orders of the court are as I have proposed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BARR J: The appellant Anthony Stavrinos appeals against convictions entered in the District Court and seeks leave to appeal against the resulting sentences. On 23 April 2002 the jury found him guilty of supplying the drug 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) also known as ecstasy, on each of two occasions. On 6 June 2003 Shillington QC ADCJ sentenced him to two concurrent terms of imprisonment, each for two years with a non-parole period of one year.  
     
      
    2 The first occasion was late at night on 24 January 2002. The police had been watching the appellant for some time and followed him to a car park at the Spit. Another car arrived at that place at about the same time. The appellant and the driver of the other car got out of their cars and walked a little distance and spoke. The other driver re-entered his car and drove away. The police did not stop him. They spoke to the appellant and searched his car. They found quantities of two drugs in the car, namely 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or Ecstasy and 3,4 methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), or Speed. The amount of Ecstasy exceeded the trafficable quantity, but the amount of Speed was less than the trafficable quantity.  
     
      
    3 Over the next few hours the police searched the house where the applicant was living. In his bedroom they found further quantities of prohibited drugs and a number of resealable plastic bags. They also found a briefcase containing several envelopes, each containing amounts of cash. The total sum so found exceeded $17,000. Also in the briefcase were Ecstasy and Speed, a number of resealable plastic bags and a number of manilla folders containing the appellant’s personal papers. 
     
      
    4 The amount of Ecstasy found in the appellant’s bedroom exceeded the trafficable quantity. The Speed weighed less than the trafficable quantity. 5 It was the Crown contention that the appellant possessed all the quantities of drug for supply. There were thus four charges, two relating to the Ecstasy found in the car and in the bedroom and two relating to corresponding items of Speed. The Crown case on all the charges relied on the inference available from all the circumstances that the appellant was dealing in drugs, particularly his possession of the sums of money in the envelopes and the plastic bags. The Crown case on the Ecstasy counts was strengthened by the statutory presumption raised by the very amount of the drug possessed. On those counts the only issue for the jury was whether the appellant had shown that it was more likely than not that he did not have the drug in his possession for the purpose of supply. On the Speed counts, however, the Crown had to prove his intention beyond reasonable doubt. The jury found him not guilty on those counts. 
     
      
    6 The money in the briefcase was a matter of some importance on all four counts. The Crown said that, like the plastic bags, it showed that the appellant was a man who received substantial amounts of cash, as drug dealers do. The defence case was that the appellant, a man of Greek extraction, was holding the money in trust for persons who in accordance with Greek tradition had contributed to wedding presents for his brother. The brother had recently died. Some witnesses gave evidence in support of the appellant’s contention. 
     
      
    7 The investigating police officers gave evidence. Detective Crisafulli said he told the appellant at the police station that the police had found a briefcase in his room. They wanted to ask him about the contents. Detective Crisafulli cautioned him and asked him if he could tell him what was inside the briefcase. The appellant replied “just some personal papers”. The Detective tried to open the briefcase but it was locked with a combination lock. The appellant told him the combination and Detective Crisafulli opened the briefcase. So the money was revealed. 
     
      
    8 Detective Crisafulli gave evidence that in due course the appellant was invited to participate in a recorded interview and declined the invitation. The trial judge informed the jury immediately of the accused’s right to silence and of the unavailability of any inference adverse to him arising out of his exercise of that right.  
     
      
    9 Only one ground of appeal was pressed. It complained that the trial judge erred in not giving adequate directions to the jury concerning the appellant’s right to silence. In her closing address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor said this about the appellant’s answer to the investigating police officers in response to their question about what was in the briefcase -  
     
      
       
        
        Ladies and gentlemen when the property was found - when the drugs were found – both in the car and in the briefcase, the accused indicated words to the effect of he didn’t know what it was or he didn’t know how it got there. Not whilst that is certainly a matter for you to take into consideration, I would remind you and his Honour will, I have no doubt, also tell you as a direction, that the accused had no obligation to say anything to the police. He’s given a warning, he doesn’t have to say anything and he doesn’t say anything – as his Honour has already told you once and I’ve got no doubt will tell you again – you don’t hold it against him for not saying anything. That’s one of the four corners of our legal criminal system, the right to silence. But in relation to that ladies and gentlemen, you may think and this is entirely a matter for you, when you consider that warning that his Honour’s given you and will no doubt give you again, that this money doesn’t belong to the accused and it belongs to other people – quite apart from the money from his father – belongs to other people. Why didn’t he say something? It’s just something I’d ask you to think about ladies and gentlemen. 
        
       
      
    10 Having summed up on the law the trial judge went on to rehearse the submissions of the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the defence. His Honour reminded the jury about the $17,000 found in the briefcase and continued- 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown puts to you there is nothing in the briefcase to in any way differentiate between the different amounts which are said to have come from different people. It was not divided into bundles. There was nothing on the envelopes to relate those amounts of money to what was inside them and the paper bag, to suggest that this was money gifts. The Crown says well why would the accused not have told the police when they found that money, that it was not his money, it was in effect, his late brother’s money, or perhaps it was the money of the persons who had given to him for safe keeping. Bearing in mind, as the Crown concedes, that there was certainly no obligation on the accused to say anything when he was asked about the items found in that briefcase. The Crown has submitted to you that when dealing with the two MDA charges, upon which charges the Crown has to prove that it was in possession for supply, that you would look at those general matters, which I have already referred to, the large amount of money, the envelopes with writing on them, which was really not explained and the presence of those resealable plastic bags. As I have already said, the Crown of course does concede, when dealing with the failure of the accused to make any mention of, on his case, who owned the large sum of money in the briefcase. It was certainly no obligation upon him to say anything.  
        
       
      
    11 It was submitted on appeal that those directions permitted the jury to reason in the way suggested by the Crown Prosecutor in her final address, namely that while the appellant had no obligation to say anything to the police about the money in the briefcase, the explanation offered at trial, that it was not his money but money he was keeping for his brother’s wedding, could be discounted by reason of his failure to tell this to the police.  
     
      
    12 In Petty and Maiden v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 95 it was observed that in a criminal trial it should not be suggested that previous silence about a defence raised at trial provides a basis for inferring that the defence is a new invention or is rendered suspect or unacceptable. See the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ at 99.  
     
      
    13 The Crown submitted on appeal that the right of silence was not immediately invoked. Rather, at the Spit the appellant had denied knowing the nature of the tablets police found in the car. It seems possible that the difficulty with this submission maybe no more than a matter of terminology, but I would wish to make clear that a suspect’s right to silence is not something that needs invocation. It exists. Moreover, I would not regard whatever the appellant may have said at the Spit as affecting in any way his right not to speak about things later found at the house.  
     
      
    14 Then it was submitted that after being cautioned the appellant told the police that the briefcase contained personal papers. The implication was that he had chosen not to exercise his right to silence and fell under an obligation, if he wanted to avoid an adverse inference in due course, to tell the police the source of the money he knew they would find in the briefcase. It was submitted that read in context the Crown Prosecutor’s submissions amounted only to a comparison of the appellant’s initial version - that the briefcase contained only personal papers - and the version put forward at trial - that it contained wedding presents in cash.  
     
      
    15 I do not accept that by asserting that the briefcase contained just some personal papers the appellant waived his right to silence about the money and its provenance. He did not assume any obligation to inform the police about the source of the money the failure to meet which would entitle the jury to draw any inference adverse to his interests, whether as to the novelty of the version put forward at trial or as to its suspicious nature or unacceptability. 16 In the passage which I have extracted the Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury at some length about the appellant’s right to silence and only then invited them to ask themselves why he had remained silent. The Crown Prosecutor nowhere asserted that the right to silence had been waived or abandoned because of what the appellant had chosen to say about the contents of the briefcase. The question of waiver never arose at the trial. It follows, I think, that the jury must have understood that the Crown was telling them that notwithstanding the appellant’s right to silence they could evaluate the version put forward at trial (and discount it) by reference to his earlier silence about it. It must have led the jury to believe that the right to silence had its limitations. 
     
      
    17 The Crown Prosecutor’s speech was self-contradictory and the trial judge should have told the jury that to reason in the manner invited would negate the appellant’s right to silence and was impermissible.  
     
      
    18 The trial judge uncritically repeated the Crown’s submission and impliedly lent it authority. I think that the jury must thereby have received the impression that the right to silence about which they had been told a number of times was subject to an exception that permitted them to infer from the appellant’s failure to inform the police about the source of the money that his version put forward at trial was less likely to be true. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion this ground of appeal has been made good.  
     
      
    20 It was submitted that if the appeal was successful the Court ought not to order a new trial. S 8 Criminal Appeal Act relevantly provides as follows- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.  
        
       
      
    21 A new trial is not the inevitable result of a successful appeal against conviction and the Crown has to show that such a result is the most appropriate remedy: King v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423.  
     
      
    22 The amount of Ecstasy found in the car and the bedroom weighed 2.58 and 3.4 grams respectively. The corresponding amounts of Speed were 0.32 and 0.7 grams respectively. The trafficable quantity of both drugs is 0. 75 grams.  
     
      
    23 The acquittal of the appellant on the Speed counts shows that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had the Speed for supply to others. His conviction on the other counts shows that they were not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he did not possess the Ecstasy for supply. The only logical and evidential basis for distinguishing between the Ecstasy and the Speed lay in the amounts. Although they exceeded the trafficable quantity, the amounts of Ecstasy were not great. Users of that drug might well possess such quantities for their own use.  
     
      
    24 The money in the briefcase was not the only independent piece of evidence that tended to show the appellant’s intention to supply. There were the plastic bags. The money was very important, however. The evidence of the appellant was that it had been made over to him by his father, his mother, and three family or personal friends named Crapis, Korkidas and Fawcett. The appellant’s mother and father gave evidence, as did Mr Crapis and Mr Fawcett. All said that they had handed to or for the appellant amounts of cash as presents. Mr Korkidas did not give evidence but evidence was adduced about his temporary absence overseas. It seems to me that this evidence about the provenance of money and the fact of the acquittals on which the Crown bore the onus of proof shows that the Crown case is not of the strongest kind. Furthermore, at any retrial the defence case might become stronger because of the availability of Mr Korkidas.  
     
      
    25 The sentences imposed by his Honour commenced on 6 June 2003 and the appellant has now served almost half the non-parole period. I am not persuaded that there ought to be a new trial.  
     
      
    26 I propose the following orders- 
     
      
       
        
        1. Allow the appeal. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Quash the convictions and direct the entry of verdicts of acquittal.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
    27 GREG JAMES J: I agree with Barr J.  
     
      
    28 MILES AJ: The facts and background to this appeal are set out in the judgment of Barr J. 
     
      
    29 I agree that the appeal should be allowed and the conviction set aside. I also agree, for the reasons advanced by Barr J, that there should be verdicts of acquittal. 
     
      
    30 I would restrict the basis for allowing the appeal to the erroneous reference in the address of prosecuting counsel and in the summing up to questions by the police about the contents of the briefcase and statements by the appellant to the effect of not knowing what they were or how they got there. In fact he was asked no such questions and made no such statements. The erroneous references mean that the possibility of a miscarriage of justice cannot be excluded. 
     
      
    31 Without those errors, I think that it may be well arguable that neither the prosecutor nor the trial judge was in breach of s. 89 of the Evidence Act 1995. When the cash was taken out of the bag and counted in front of the appellant, it was arguably not in the course of official questioning, and further, there may have been no failure or refusal to answer a question or respond to a representation as contemplated by s89, simply because there were no questions and no representations. 
     
      
    32 If the case is outside s. 89, the extent to which the common law right of silence and its consequences go beyond s. 89 would have to be considered. 
     
      
    33 Further, I think that there is a real question about whether or how far the common law prohibition on drawing inferences from an accused’s silence applies to an issue on which the accused bears the onus of proof. 
     
      
    34 BARR J: The orders of the Court are therefore as I have proposed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 Shaw J: The plaintiff claims damages for injuries said to arise as a result of work performed at markets in Flemington, operated by the defendant, in the course of his employment by the cross defendant. The cross claim has been the subject of settlement between the defendant and the cross defendant. The issue that remains for determination by this Court is whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff to prevent the injuries suffered, and whether this duty has been breached, causing those injuries. 
     
      
    2 There are said to be three separate injuries suffered by the plaintiff. The first is that on or about 10 June 1998 the plaintiff was wheeling produce on a pallet jack down a ramp when he slipped on vegetable matter and fell. The second is that on and after March 1998 until May 1999 the plaintiff drove a forklift over large numbers of potholes and roadways in a poor state of repair and that this was a cause of some injury. The third allegation is that on or about 17 February 1999 the plaintiff inadvertently tripped over a ramp edge of approximately 5 metres height and was thereby injured. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiff alleges that it was a failure of Sydney Markets Limited, the controlling body over the internal workings of the markets, to institute, maintain and supervise a proper system of cleaning, or of warning workers in the markets of the dangers of deposited vegetable matter, that caused the first injury. 
     
      
    4 The particulars of negligence in relation to the second injury are that the defendant failed to warn of the danger pot holes represented; failed to repair the roadways or adequately mark and identify the pot holes; failed to heed complaints about pot holes; and failed to ‘introduce a safe system of traversing the roadway area in the market to avoid the risk of injury to persons including the Plaintiff’.  
     
      
    5 The particulars of negligence in relation to the third injury alleged are a failure to have a safety rail on the ramp; a failure to ensure the ramp was constructed so that persons were unlikely to fall; and a failure to warn the plaintiff of the ‘construction and design’ of the ramp. During the trial the plaintiff sought to add a further particular relating to the installation of a separate pedestrian walkway and I granted leave for the plaintiff to amend the statement of claim in this respect. 
     
      
    6 In general, the plaintiff claims that he suffers from pain, soft tissue injury, damage to the legs, anxiety, depression, an injury to the left arm and elbow, as well as damage to the back, neck and pelvis.  
     
      
    7 The plaintiff was formerly an employee of the cross defendant working at the markets in Flemington. Before these injuries, and his operations and complaints about ill health, the plaintiff was a fit and active man. He played rugby league, and was involved in surf life saving, including being a club captain and boat captain of Burning Palms Surf Life Saving Club. He says that he can no longer participate in these activities due to his injuries.  
     
      
    8 A video shown to the Court demonstrates that the plaintiff, even after these accidents, remains capable of some physical activity, although I did not see any particularly strenuous activity in the material tendered. It is not entirely clear whether his alleged incapacity is a result of a physical problem, an emotional disability, or a combination of both. 
     
      
    9 The plaintiff presents as a reasonably articulate and intelligent man. In evidence, the plaintiff appeared as a credible witness in most respects. Over three days in cross examination he admitted that he had not sought work since May 1998 on the basis that he had no medical advice that he should return to work. It is of some concern that since the third of the incidents referred to, he has taken no steps to obtain alternative employment, either with the characteristics of light duties or of a sedentary nature. This factor may go more to the quantum of damages rather than the central question which presently faces the Court as to whether the defendant is liable in negligence.  
     
      
    10 It has been agreed between the parties that the Court should determine the question of liability as a prior matter and then hear subsequent submissions, if there is liability, about the amount of any damages that should be awarded. 11 The plaintiff was clear and insistent that he fell on vegetable matter on the date of the first injury, and, though subject to some criticism by the defendant for failing to have a corroborative account of this incident, the Court is satisfied that this is what occurred. Similarly, there is no reason to dispute the plaintiff’s account of the circumstances said to give rise to the third injury. On the balance of probabilities, I accept the plaintiff’s evidence that the second alleged fall occurred. 
     
      
    12 However, the defendant disputes the circumstances giving rise to the injuries as well as causation and the extent of the plaintiff’s injuries.  
     
      
       
      Defendant’s medical evidence relating to the plaintiff 
       
      
    13 The defendant’s medical evidence casts light upon the plaintiff’s claims.  
     
      
    14 Dr B J Ireland, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in his opinion of 3 October 2001, said that the plaintiff was a:  
     
      
       
        
        remarkably fit, powerfully built, well muscled man with a musculature such that one associates with body builders. 
        
       
      
    15 Dr Ireland said that the plaintiff showed no evidence of discomfort, at least in relation to his neck, as he sat and conversed with the doctor. The doctor took the view that if there was some discomfort in relation to the neck it was not inhibiting, in any way, the use of the neck in a ‘significant’ fashion. Dr Ireland could find no evidence of impairment of function in relation to the shoulders; doubted any major degree of weakness in the left elbow on the plaintiff’s version of how the injury arose; and discerned only ‘small radiological abnormalities’ in the lower back. He saw no evidence of a rupture of the right leg, although he could find a 15% impairment of function of the left leg, with half of that impairment being a consequence of the injury at aged seventeen, and the remaining half the consequence of further incidents in 1998 and 1999. In short, Dr Ireland found evidence of ‘discomfort’ in various areas of the plaintiff’s body and some ‘limited ability to be doing heavy work’ but that:  
     
      
       
        
        he should be able to do most forms of moderate work, other than those that require him to be getting a squatted situation or doing repeated work on stairs. 
        
       
      
    16 In a further opinion, dated 13 March 2002, Dr Ireland is sceptical of the need for occupational rehabilitation, continued weekly medical attendances, or consultation with pain management psychologists. The reason for this doubt is, as Dr Ireland opines (though perhaps outside the realm of his expertise): 
     
      
       
        
        …[the plaintiff] has to accept that he has certain continuing symptoms and he must learn to live with them and he must get on with his life… 
        
       
      
    17 The defendant tendered an opinion of Dr Sikander Khan dated 10 July 2003, which proffers the view that it should not be believed that because the plaintiff drove over potholes, this act ‘would have lead to this injury’. Rather, it was Dr Khan’s opinion that any injury more likely resulted from an ‘abnormal posture’ adopted by the plaintiff whilst driving. This view was shared by Dr Ireland. The logical consequence of this opinion is an inference that driving over potholes caused some injury but the extent of that injury was, perhaps, exacerbated by the plaintiff’s posture while driving.  
     
      
    18 Dr Kim Edwards, surgeon, in an opinion of 31 January 2000, suggests that the plaintiff ‘seemed to be engrossed in his symptoms’. The doctor also points to a suggestion of ‘exaggeration or fabrication’ of the plaintiff’s condition in that he was not convinced that some of the range of movement demonstrated by the plaintiff on examination was genuine.  
     
      
    19 Dr Edwards considered the plaintiff fit:  
     
      
       
        
        for light work which does not require him to squat or kneel, climb, or to walk long distances if his complaints are genuine.  
        
       
      
    20 Reference to exaggeration or fabrication of the plaintiff’s condition is also made in the opinion of Dr Edwards of 30 October 2002. The doctor states: 
     
      
       
        
        There is evidence of exaggeration or fabrication noted on examination, as is indicated by his ability to sit erect on the couch with his legs extended without complaining of pain despite the limitation of forward flexion and straight leg raising. 
        
       
      
    21 Dr Tim Anderson, in an opinion of 1 February 2001, noted an exaggeration of the plaintiff’s restriction on movement regarding his back. Dr Anderson does not find the driving posture of the plaintiff abnormal but states:  
     
      
       
        
        [t]his unfortunately was the only way he was able to drive the forklift’.  
        
       
      
    22 Dr Anderson did not find ‘a great deal wrong with his neck or back’ though did associate the condition complained of to the fall in February 1999. Dr Anderson also noted: 
     
      
       
        
        I believe, however, that he could do considerably more in terms of physical activity if he chose to try.  
        
       
      
    23 This was reinforced in an opinion of 1 November 2002 in which the doctor deposes: 
     
      
       
        
        Although he continued to have genuine findings and dysfunction it was most unfortunate that there were non-organic features becoming more prevalent in his overall situation. 
        
       
       
        
        The best part of two years have past since I last saw him although there has been relatively little change of his views on his condition and similarly he does not seem to have made any effort at trying to improve himself or get back into the workforce. 
        
       
      
    24 Dr Anderson also noted improvements, in November 2002, to the forward flexion of the back despite complaint that the distribution of pain and tenderness ‘was exactly the same as before’. There was also improvement to the cervical spine. Dr Anderson noted that there was ‘grossly reduced’ function of the left upper arm but was ‘not convinced that he was voluntarily demonstrating maximum effort’. Similarly, the doctor noticed ‘grossly reduced’ movement of the lumbar spine to less than half the normal range but thought that this was a ‘manufactured’ restriction. Dr Anderson did note a ‘minor partial rupture of part of the quadriceps femoris complex’. He said that: 
     
      
       
        
        It is still most important that Mr Jenkins should be maximally active. This is just not happening at present. I would suggest that his major contribution to improving his circumstances would be in the water. He does a limited amount of this but nothing like enough. 
        
       
      
    25 Dr Grant Walker, consultant neurologist, in his opinion of 2 July 2003, expresses the view that the fact that the plaintiff has developed further muscular skeletal problems in the absence of any work is further suggestion that his original complaints ‘had little to do with the designated “injuries” that he reported’. He did find, in an opinion dated 12 October 2001, that the plaintiff had a 6.4 per cent loss of function of the upper left arm that equated to 4 per cent ‘whole person loss’. Dr Walker also noted that the plaintiff did not ‘give maximal effort at times’. 
     
      
    26 An assessment by Trevor Hawkins, Vocational Psychologist with the Vocational Capacity Centre, dated 24 May 2002, accepts that the plaintiff impressed as having ‘mild depression’ but presented with a more considerable focus on his physical condition. That is:  
     
      
       
        
        His potential to engage in some form of gainful employment, a more immediate issue, is thus being put off for consideration until he has resolved all of his physical problems. This approach is likely to see him unemployed for a considerably longer period of time. 
        
       
      
    27 The opinion goes on to assert:  
     
      
       
        
        His previous careers have been unskilled in nature and as a result he has developed a restricted range of transferable skills. His jobs in the past have involved customer service skills; driving; sales and routine administrative and clerical skills….There are certainly no major problems of a cognitive nature that would stand in the way of his entry into many alternate vocational options in the labour market… 
        
       
      
    28 Dr Wendy Roberts, a clinical psychologist, said in her opinion of 28 November 2002, that she was yet to be convinced that the plaintiff ‘is clinically anxious, depressed or irritable now’ about his injuries. Dr Roberts opined: 
     
      
       
        
        It is not at all clear to me that he meets diagnostic criteria for any psychological disorder, but I could not assess this accurately because his performance on paper and pencil testing was suggestive of exaggeration. I also note that with two of the accidents he continued working, did nothing about the repetitive arm injury until after February 1999 and then continued working after February 1999 until May when he went off work. I would like to see his employer’s file and any statements. In terms of my area of expertise, I doubt that there are psychological barriers preventing him from returning to work of the sort which he did before, nor should they be problematic in the future. He is cognitively quite capable of doing further study to refrain if medical opinion were to be that he is medically unfit for work of the sort he did at the markets.  
        
       
      
    29 Magri MacMaster, Director of a Rehabilitation and Medico-Legal Consultancy, deposes in an opinion of 13 February 2002 that the plaintiff has ‘demonstrated self-limiting movement and what appears to be exaggerated pain behaviour’. It is also said: 
     
      
       
        
        He appears to have some functional overlay and he is very preoccupied with his injuries. He said he spends some time reading at the library about them.  
        
       
       
        
        There was no evidence of physical discomfort or distress during any activities requested [of him]. 
        
       
      
    30 Mr MacMaster did not think that the plaintiff required assistance with personal care or domestic tasks. This opinion was shared by Dr Roberts. 
     
      
       
      Other aspects of the defendant’s medical evidence 
       
      
    31 There are some aspects of the defendant’s medical evidence relating to the plaintiff that give some support to the plaintiff’s claims. These include: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The recorded history of operations, which medical practitioners presumably thought were required, as well as a requirement for physiotherapy and hydrotherapy. There are continued references to evidence of the regular use of pain relief tablets and the plaintiff’s abandonment of previous sporting and other activities as a result of the injuries suffered at work; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Dr Khan in his opinion of 10 July 2003, said that the plaintiff is ‘ 
        unfit to perform his pre-injury work duties 
        ’. The focus of that opinion is on an impaired ability to work because of the incident on 17 February 1999 and ‘ 
        the repetitive chronic trauma to the left elbow 
        …’. With the qualification that the Doctor took the view that the plaintiff could do sedentary work, the opinion is proffered that: ‘ 
        he is unfit to carry out his pre-injury activities of a handyman or maintenance worker and would have difficulty in doing any lawn mowing or heavy work in the garden 
        ’. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Dr Edwards deposed that the plaintiff presented on that examination day with a limitation to the right knew that would mean he had ‘ 
        difficulty driving a forklift 
        ’.  
        
       
       
        
        (e) Other opinions speak of a functional (psychological) overlay associated with the plaintiff’s physical symptoms. For example, Dr Anderson in his opinion of 1 February 2001 talks of ‘ 
        quite a lot of associated dysfunction 
        ’. The doctor deposes to a ‘ 
        fairly powerful non-organic feature creeping in to the perpetuation of his current condition. It also looks as though he is now suffering from a chronic pain condition. This unfortunately does not bode well for the future 
        ’. In the same report, proffers the opinion that the current condition of the plaintiff’s left arm ‘ 
        could have followed from the repeated banging up and down of the forklift, which does not have a decent suspension 
        ’. Furthermore Dr Anderson does not regard the plaintiff as fit to return to his previous occupation and says that: “ 
        it is wide constellation of dysfunction I cannot think of any specific occupation he would be able to follow at this stage. Nevertheless, in time, if he can control his current pain condition a bit better, it may be possible for him to do some fairly lightweight office-based occupation 
        ’. But what is unequivocal in this opinion is that the plaintiff ‘ 
        is not fit for his previous occupation… 
        ’. 
        
       
        
       
        
        (e) Dr Walker says that ‘ 
        apart from being unable to work, he is unable to perform any heavy work around the house, such as lawn mowing and gardening 
        ’.  
        
       
       
      Plaintiff’s medical evidence 
       
      
    32 The plaintiff’s medical evidence does lend support to a link between his injuries and disabilities and his job as a forklift driver at the markets.  
     
      
    33 Dr Raymond Schwartz, a specialist physician, said in his report of 13 April 2001: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Jenkins’ problems occurred on a background of apparent repeated trauma with Mr Jenkins as a forklift driver needing to keep his arm over the seat thereby exposing his ulnar nerve on that side to trauma. Mr Jenkins had a history of neck trauma as well and had suffered a fall earlier in 1999 which he sustained several soft tissue injuries including exacerbation of his neck injury.  
        
       
      
    34 In his report of 26 June 2001, Dr Kwok, a neurosurgeon, concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Jenkins has suffered ulnar entrapment neuropathy as a result of the nature of his job having to rest his left elbow on the back of the seat causing constant compression on that area. This was further aggravated by the fall that he suffered.  
        
       
      
    35 In his opinion of 9 July 2001, Dr Beer, an orthopaedic surgeon, concluded that the plaintiff sustained the following injuries ‘at work’: 
     
      
    · Internal derangement of the left knee – damaged lateral meniscus left knew joint with cystic degeneration as a result of the injuries; 
     
      
    · An aggravation of degree of degeneration of his left knee joint twice resulting in significant disability that he has with his knee at the moment;  
     
      
    · Soft tissue injury to his cervical spine and lumbar spine and aggravation of degenerative changes in both areas; 
     
      
    · A muscle injury to his right thigh and partial rupture of his Rectus femoris muscle – one of the muscle bellies or structures constituting the Quadriceps Femeris on the anterior aspect of the thigh; 
     
      
    · Soft tissue injury resulting in some superficial nerve injury to his adductor region of his thigh consistent with such a fall at work; 
     
      
    · An injury to his ulnar nerve of the left arm resulting in surgery; 
     
      
    · Residual disability with his left arm due to his forklift driving work. 
     
      
    36 The plaintiff has baldly summarised some of the medical assessments as to the degree of that disability in the following terms: 
     
      
    · Dr Kahn – 30 per cent left arm impairment; 
     
      
    · Dr Anderson – 20 per cent left arm impairment; 
     
      
    · Dr Adler – 30 per cent loss of efficient use of left arm; 
     
      
    · Dr Brimage – 30 per cent loss of efficient use of left arm; 
     
      
    · Dr Beer – 15 per cent loss of efficient use of left arm. 
     
      
    37 In addition there is evidence of psychological disability suffered by the plaintiff. A clinical psychologist, Ms Susan Bourne, in her opinion of 14 August 2002, has recounted a history, asserted by the plaintiff, of mood fluctuations, depression, worry about the future, anxiety and a lack of motivation. In a qualified opinion, based on the plaintiff’s account, Ms Bourne concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        His prognosis is uncertain and dependent upon his physical recovery. Given the complexity of his physical injuries and continuing pain it is my opinion that it is unlikely that Brad will be pain free. It is also my opinion that despite his efforts to manage his pain he will continue to experience fluctuating psychological symptoms for some time and will require ongoing psychological support. 
        
       
      
    38 Dr Strum, consultant psychiatrist, in his opinion of 2 May 2001, proffered the view that the majority of the plaintiff’s disability is due to his physical injuries; but as far as his psychiatric disabilities are concerned, Dr Strum opined that the plaintiff’s overall disability was 10 per cent. 
     
      
       
      Issues for determination 
       
      
    39 In my view, there can be no real doubt that the plaintiff is at least partially disabled. The real question in the case is whether there was a causal link between work injuries suffered in his employment and the control over the markets exercised by the defendant. 
     
      
      Control 
       
      
    40 There is no dispute that the defendant would owe a duty of care to prevent foreseeable injury to the plaintiff, as an occupier of the markets, over elements of the markets in which the defendant had exercised control or had the power to exercise control over its operations. The test for a duty of care is based upon control in all the circumstances as described in Hackshaw v Shaw (1984) 155 CLR 614 at 662-663 approved in Australian Safeway Stores Pty Limited v Zaluzna (1987) 162 CLR 479. Further: 
     
      
       
        
        The touchstone of its existence is that there be reasonable foreseeability of a real risk of injury to the visitor or to the class of person of which the visitor is a member. The measure of the discharge of the duty is what a reasonable man would, in the circumstances, do by way of response to the foreseeable risk. 
        
       
      
    41 The duty is to take reasonable care to prevent a foreseeable risk of injury, however ‘the occupier is not an insurer’: Shoeys Pty Limited v Allan (1991) Aust Torts Reports ¶18-104 at 68,942 per Handley JA. 
     
      
    42 I accept the submission that it is the employer that has a high, non-delegable, duty of care over its employees, and further, a duty to direct and control the day-to-day activities of the employees by training and supervision but it may be that the same duty is not imposed upon an occupier. However, the defendant, as the occupier of the markets, thereby undertook a duty to take reasonable care (by carrying out appropriate steps) to prevent reasonably foreseeable injury to persons present upon those premises: Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd v Zaluzna (1986) 162 CLR 479. 
     
      
    43 However, I accept that such a duty cannot extend to injuries that so are far fetched and fanciful so as not to be reasonably foreseeable, nor is there liability for injuries caused to a plaintiff that has a sufficient knowledge of the likelihood of injury to know the dangers involved: see Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Johnson [2003] NSWCA 40. 
     
      
    44 Further, I accept that proof that a danger could possibly occasion some harm is not a sufficient discharge of the plaintiff’s onus and a defendant is not liable to a plaintiff that does not take sufficient care with regard to obvious risks: see Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v McGuiness [2002] NSWCA 210.  
     
      
       
      State of the surface at the markets 
       
      
    45 Three specific incidents of breach are alleged by the plaintiff, and all relate, in some minor or major respects, to the state of the surface of the area occupied by the defendant at Flemington. 
     
      
    46 For slip accidents that involve an allegation of an inappropriate cleaning system, it is important to bear in mind what was said by McHugh JA in Brady v Girvan Bros Pty Limited (1986) 7 NSWLR 241 at 256: 
     
      
       
        
        The critical question…is…whether the evidence gives rise to an inference that the cleaning system would have avoided the plaintiff’s injury. For it is no comfort to show that the defendant did not have a proper system unless she can show that the existence of a proper system would have avoided her injury… 
        
       
      
    47 In this respect, I am not satisfied that a warning, by sign or otherwise, would have prevented the plaintiff from falling on either 10 June 1998 or 17 February 1999. The plaintiff gave no evidence that such a sign would have altered the manner in which he performed his work tasks and I cannot see how a sign would have that effect. Further, the lack of such a sign has, in my view, no necessary or logical connection to the injuries that are said to have occurred.  
     
      
    48 With regard to the cleaning system I am bound by the decision of Shoeys Pty Ltd v Allan in which it was said (by Handley JA, Priestley JA concurring) that a ‘problem’ in causation arises: 
     
      
       
        
        …where an appropriate inspection and cleaning system would not have secured the prompt removal of dropped or spoiled material from the floor of the premises.  
        
       
      
    49 This problem is manifest in these proceedings in that the defendant had in place a regular system of cleaning at the markets. To that extent, they had fulfilled, at least in part, their duty to avoid foreseeable risk of injury from people falling on dropped vegetable matter. However, the question of the reasonableness of this system remains a live issue between the parties.  
     
      
    50 The plaintiff relies on the fact that the cleaning system seemed to be in operation when the markets were not, and so the real risks of injury from falling vegetable matter was not, and could not be, prevented by the cleaning system in place at the material times.  
     
      
    51 The defendant relies on the evidence it has tendered to the effect that the cleaning system was multi-staged and dedicated to the precise problem: fallen vegetable matter that could cause injury.  
     
      
    52 An important question for the Court is whether the system was inadequate to its purpose or whether, on balance, some other system would have been more appropriate to prevent injury from waste vegetable matter. In my opinion while the cleaning system adopted was directed to the problem that gave rise to the plaintiff’s injuries it was not appropriately or sufficiently adapted to preventing those reasonably foreseeable injuries that would result from a person slipping on fallen vegetable matter. This was because the cleaning system was not in operation at the times when injuries to the workers at the markets, as opposed to the general public, were most likely to occur. 53 A similar issue arises with respect to the state of the roads and surfaces at the markets.  
     
      
    54 The plaintiff asserts that the surfaces of the markets were inadequate to prevent the real risk of injury that arose out of those poor conditions. 
     
      
    55 The defendant relies on the fact that the markets were regularly checked for deficiencies and occasionally re-surfaced. In my view, it is relevant that this re-surfacing was always done with asphalt rather than concrete or some other, more stable (though more expensive) material. 
     
      
    56 The Court has had the benefit of a view in these proceedings at a prime time of the market’s operations (at or about 7.30 am). There are over 700 forklifts working at the location. Despite the existence of speed limits, and an absence of evidence that those limits are regularly exceeded, the work of the markets operates at a significant velocity. The forklift drivers are responsible for the transport of produce from the stalls to drivers. It is a very busy location. The forklift drivers often drive the vehicles in reverse. They work on ramps, across asphalt areas to delivery trucks, and do so under pressures of congestion.  
     
      
    57 Common practise does not equal the absence of negligence, but the plaintiff must show that the defendant was not acting reasonably in taking some alternative course: Dovuro Pty Limited v Wilkins (2003) 77 ALJR 1706. In my opinion, the plaintiff has shown real, tangible defects in the system at work at the markets at the material times including the insufficiency of the cleaning and the lack of adequate surfacing over which the forklift drivers had to travel. 
     
      
    58 The plaintiff has established, on the balance of probabilities, a causal link between the working environment supervised by, and under the control of, the first defendant and the injuries and incapacity which, I find, he has undoubtedly incurred. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    59 Accordingly, I would order: 
     
      
     1) Enter verdict for the plaintiff;

     PARSONS v RANDWICK MUNICIPAL COUNCIL 
      
    The appellant was returning home late at night from a social function where he had been drinking. He was being driven by another man, with a third man also in the vehicle. The third man left the car and walked off along the footpath. The appellant left the car and followed. The appellant fell from the footpath onto the kerb and hit the back of his head. At the point where the appellant fell, the footpath was broken in a U-shape and there was a grass verge that sloped up from the kerb to the footpath. 
     
      
    At first instance the appellant claimed that the respondent, the Council, had been negligent in failing to maintain the section of footpath, which the appellant fell on, which was in the Council’s care and control. The trial Judge held that the Council did owe the appellant a duty of care, however that duty did not extend as far as to cover a situation as depicted by the appellant, where his state of sobriety at the time of the fall would have been such that he was extremely impaired physically and mentally. Further, the trial Judge said that because of his self-induced alcoholic state, the appellant was not able to take reasonable care of himself by seeing the large, obvious subsidence at the edge of the footpath and avoiding it.  
     
      
    The appellant appealed on a number of grounds. These included that the trial Judge erred as to the obviousness of the subsidence; failed to take into account the question of inadvertence or thoughtlessness of the appellant; his Honour erred in finding that the Council’s duty of care did not extend to cover an intoxicated person; erred in finding that because of his self-induced alcoholic state the appellant was not able to take reasonable care of himself by seeing the large subsistence at the edge of the footpath and avoiding it; and his Honour erred in finding there was no negligence on the Council’s part because the appellant did not exercise reasonable care. 
     
      
    The respondent filed a notice of contention that the decision ought to be affirmed, on the grounds that the Council did not breach its duty of care, and that the damage was not caused in law or fact by the respondent. HELD (per Sheller JA, Ipp JA agreeing): 
     
      
       
      1. The danger presented by the break in the footpath would have been visible to pedestrians walking along the footpath during daylight hours and keeping a lookout for where they were going. Such pedestrians could have avoided the area of damage. There was no evidence to support the trial Judge’s conclusion that at 1 am in the morning the subsidence in the footpath was obvious and one which the appellant should have been aware “with the slightest observation”. However, it is equally true that there was no evidence that the light from the lamps was inadequate in the sense that any witness expressed such an opinion. 
       
       
      2. The question of the adequacy or inadequacy of the lighting was only relevant to the question of whether the appellant, exercising reasonable care for his own safety ought to have seen and recognised the fault in the footpath in time sufficient to step around it or safely through it. What the appellant could see and do in reaction to what he saw was almost certainly affected by his intake of alcohol.  
       
       
      3. A person in the state of sobriety of the appellant is not one necessarily able to take reasonable care for his or her own safety when walking along a darkened footpath in the middle of the night. If it was open to find that the appellant, able to use such reasonable care for his own safety, would have fallen in the way he did because in the light provided he would not have seen the fault, then his state of sobriety would only have had consequences in looking at causation and the question of contribution. The onus was on the appellant to prove that such was the state of the lighting that he could not have seen and recognised the nature of the fault in the pavement, even if he had been sober and taking care for his own safety. That onus, the appellant failed to discharge. 
       
       
      4. Though the appellant pleaded a case that the footpath was not properly constructed, the trial Judge found this not to be part of the appellant’s case. However, regardless of such a pleading, if on the night in question the fault in the footpath was visible to a user of the footpath taking due care, the Council was not in breach of the duty of care it owed to the appellant. The evidence did not indicate that the Council had failed in such a duty of care to the appellant. 
      
    HELD (as per Beazley JA, dissenting): 
     
      
       
      5. As Sheller JA has pointed out, a significant issue in the case related to the state of the lighting. There is no doubt that the evidence about the lighting was scant. However, there was more evidence than referred to by his Honour. The evidence was that there were no streetlights directly at the spot of the accident. Further, the appellant’s principal witness, whose evidence was unchallenged, was that the light was “reflected”, and this witness, about whom it was never suggested was not taking reasonable care for himself, did not see the footpath was broken until after the appellant fell. Given the evidence from the appellant’s witness and common experience, the broken footpath at night, even with street lighting of the type provided, presented a danger to persons who were taking care for their own safety. Accordingly, the trial Judge erred in his conclusion that the danger was obvious. 
       
      
    6. The unchallenged evidence was that the signs of failure of the footpath would have been evident for several months, with “severe” failure becoming increasingly apparent. Further, the Council had been in the area carrying out repairs shortly prior to the accident. Given the unsafe state of the footpath, and given that the respondent either was, or should have been aware of the danger it presented, the respondent was negligent in failing to repair the footpath and/or maintain it in proper condition.  
     
      
       
      7. The negligent construction of the footpath could have been a further basis, upon which his Honour could have held that the Council was negligent. However, given senior counsel for the appellant’s disavowal of this basis, the matter falls to be determined on the first basis only. On that basis, the appeal would be allowed. 
       
      
    8. The Council pleaded contributory negligence. The evidence showed that the appellant was significantly intoxicated, that his motor co-ordination, gait and balance would have been seriously impaired as would his mental alertness. As such that appellant’s own negligence was substantial and should be assessed at 50 per cent.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA:  
     
      
       
      Introduction 
       
       
      The appellant and plaintiff in the District Court, Barry John Parsons, appeals from a decision of his Honour Judge Sorby given on 17 July 2002. His Honour had entered a verdict and judgment for the respondent and defendant, Randwick Municipal Council (the Council), in proceedings in which Mr Parsons claimed to recover damages from the Council for injuries he suffered as the result of the Council’s alleged negligence in failing, inter alia, to maintain a section of footpath of which the Council had the care and control in Alison Road, Randwick.  
       
      
    2 According to the trial Judge’s findings at about 1 am in the morning of 25 October 1999 Mr Parsons was on the footpath on the northern side of Alison Road adjacent to St Marks Road. He had left a vehicle driven by a Mr Pritchard to go after another passenger in the vehicle, Mr Mansfield, who had left the vehicle and, according to his Honour, had walked off along the footpath. Mr Pritchard had also left the vehicle. He was concerned for both Mr Parsons and Mr Mansfield because each had drunk a substantial amount of alcohol during the evening. All three had attended a social function at the Australian Golf Club at Kensington. Mr Parsons said he was a weekend drinker and on the night consumed wine and beer. He did not think it was as much as twelve schooners of beer. When it was suggested that he had had a lot to drink he said that he did not feel “that bad”. 
     
      
    3 The parties agreed that Mr Pritchard would drive Mr Mansfield to his daughter’s flat in Coogee and then take Mr Parsons to his home in Darling Point. Mr Pritchard observed Mr Parsons at the Club after Mr Pritchard had finished playing cards and on the 50 metre walk to the motor vehicle. He said that he noticed that Mr Parsons “had had a lot to drink”. Mr Parsons described his state of sobriety as not drunk “according to my feelings”. He was surprised to learn his blood alcohol reading at the hospital was .268.  
     
      
    4 Mr Parsons said that when Mr Pritchard’s car stopped in Alison Road and Mr Mansfield had got out he had attempted to get Mr Mansfield back into the car as they had stopped in Randwick not Coogee. He could not precisely say where on the footpath he was when he spoke to Mr Mansfield. He was “about 2 metres from him”. Mr Mansfield probably said “no” to his request to return to the car. Mr Parsons was “starting to go back to the car when he fell”. He next remembered waking up in the Prince of Wales Hospital where he was diagnosed with severe traumatic brain injury. His blood alcohol level at the hospital was .268 or five times higher than the legal limit to drive a car. 
     
      
    5 The Council tendered a report from Dr Helen Dauncey, a consultant pharmacologist. Dr Dauncey assumed that blood plasma was used at the hospital. She made a “conversion allowance” to calculate Mr Parsons’ blood alcohol at 1 am when the incident occurred. She concluded that his BAC at the time he fell “is most likely to have been about 0.259% with a 5% probability that it was as low as 0.232% or as high as 0.277%”. From this she drew several conclusions. Dr Dauncey said that a BAC reading of .259% “would be expected to produce extreme intoxication in most people”. She said that “although it is likely that Mr Parsons showed a tolerance to the onset of impaired balance, gait and motor coordination because of his heavy alcohol use, at such an extreme BAC serious impairments to these functions would have been present.” In her opinion Mr Parsons’ cognitive and physical skills were likely to have been extremely impaired by alcohol when the accident occurred. In her opinion at a BAC over 0.259% he would have been seriously impaired physically (impaired motor coordination, gait and balance) mentally (very groggy, diminished ability to judge distance and place, reduced capacity to assess potential for harm, distorted vision, slow perception/reaction time, narrowed focus of attention, inability to think clearly and plan ahead) and behaviourally (more likely to be impulsive). His impairment would have very significantly increased the chances of falling in any environment and decreased his ability to save himself when he did fall. 
     
      
    6 Mr Parsons said that he did not count how many drinks he had had that night. He had tried not to drink a lot because of the next day’s golf game. He denied he had an alcohol problem and said he had only discussed drinking with his GP as far as his weight was concerned. Some months before his fall he had suffered from episodes of dizziness but the trial Judge accepted that by the day of the accident the vertigo had ceased. 
     
      
    7 Mr Parsons denied that he was staggering on the footpath before his fall or that he was unsteady on his feet. He could not remember the mechanics of the accident. He relied upon the evidence of his friend and the driver of the vehicle, Mr Pritchard. According to him Mr Mansfield did not get back into the car as he was asked and had walked off by the time Mr Parsons fell. Mr Mansfield was not called and the trial Judge accepted that he was absent from the scene at the time of Mr Parsons’ fall “and would not have been able to give relevant evidence of the actual fall by” Mr Parsons. 
     
      
    8 Mr Pritchard had been at the Club for the social event. He had been playing cards for about two hours before he offered Mr Parsons a lift home. He left the Club with Mr Parsons and Mr Mansfield. He noticed that Mr Mansfield had had a lot to drink and Mr Parsons had had some as well. Mr Parsons was the rear passenger in the car. When they got to Alison Road, Randwick, Mr Mansfield said it was where his daughter lived even though he had previously that evening asked Mr Pritchard to take him to his daughter’s house in Coogee. Mr Pritchard was concerned for Mr Mansfield’s well-being because of his alcoholic state. Mr Mansfield got out of the car and walked to the footpath which was slightly uphill. He was walking in a westerly direction. Mr Parsons got out of the car to try and get Mr Mansfield back into it. Mr Pritchard also got out. Mr Pritchard said that Mr Parsons got “briskly” out of the car and went “smartly” after Mr Mansfield and was walking “quite well”. Both Mr Parsons and Mr Mansfield had their back to him. He saw Mr Mansfield “make off” up the hill. The trial Judge said that this was “along the footpath”. There was no evidence of this. One can, however, infer from the evidence that Mr Mansfield had proceeded along the footpath to a point beyond the place where Mr Parsons fell. Mr Parsons followed “lost his footing, spun round and pitched straight off the footpath onto his head”. Mr Pritchard went straight to Mr Parsons who was bleeding from his head and was “out cold”.  
     
      
    9 Mr Pritchard said he knew where Mr Parsons feet were before he fell. Mr Parsons was facing due west and had turned towards the south. He fell backwards onto the street. Mr Parsons had initially stepped off the footpath which had a raised edge. Mr Pritchard said that when Mr Parsons had the accident he had “looked almost immediately” and “identified” where he had fallen. This was five to six feet from the kerb. He could see the break in the pavement. He could see the detail of the crumbling cement. Mr Parsons had no recollection of what lights there were or of the state of the footpath. Mr Parsons was unconscious when the ambulance arrived at the scene and on his arrival at the hospital. 
     
      
    10 Judge Sorby found on the balance of probabilities that Mr Parsons fell from the footpath onto the kerb and hit the back of his head. Before he fell he was standing on the edge of the broken footpath. The Judge referred to one of the photographs, part of Exhibit A, to show the extent of the broken footpath which had, after the date of the accident, been repaired with new concrete. The photograph was taken before the repair work. Photographs in evidence showed that there were two light poles fairly close to the accident scene. Judge Sorby observed that there was no independent evidence about the adequacy of the lighting at 1 am on the night of the accident or otherwise. Mr Parsons’ case proceeded on the basis of an allegation that the footpath was poorly maintained. An allegation that it was badly constructed, though pleaded, was not apparently pursued at the trial although not formally abandoned. 
     
      
    11 The trial Judge did not describe the state of the footpath beyond reference to the photographs in evidence. According to these photographs the footpath ran from east to west along the northern side of Alison Road. At the point where Mr Parsons fell there was a grass verge that sloped up from the kerb to the footpath. On the other side of the footpath there was a level grassed area. On the southern side of the footpath and nearer to the kerb was a stepped wall with the lowest step at the eastern end and two further higher steps both lower than the footpath up to a wall which appears to have been at about the level of the footpath to the north of which there appeared to be a covered drain in the area between the wall and the southern edge of the footpath. Except in the area of this drain between the wall and the footpath was a grassed area with a vertical fall at the edge of the footpath.  
     
      
    12 The break in the concrete where Mr Parsons fell was U-shaped running for at least a metre along the southern edge of the footpath, the top of the arch of the U-shape extending perhaps half a metre into the footpath. As shown in the photographs the broken concrete from the surface of the footpath was lying for the most part sloping from the point of the break down into the grassed verge area with one piece slightly further to the south lying on the verge but leaving a gap in the concrete verge at the point from which it had fallen. The danger presented by this break in the footpath to anybody stepping from the footpath into it is obvious and it is not surprising that Mr Parsons having done so fell across the verge which sloped to the road and hit his head in the road. His Honour found that the footpath was obviously unsafe at the point where Mr Parsons fell. The trial Judge said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The plaintiff lost his footing on the collapsed part of the footpath, as I have found on the probabilities losing his balance and falling down the embankment hitting his head on the gutter or road. That the defendant did work of a maintenance kind on footpaths, including Alison Road is in evidence by tendered subpoenaed documents, although the work was not done to the pavements on the side of Alison Road where the plaintiff fell.” 
        
       
      
    13 From looking at the photographs it can be said that the break and the nature of the break in the footpath would have been obvious to a person who could see and was keeping a lookout for where they were going while walking along the footpath in either direction during daylight hours. 
     
      
       
      Reasons for judgment in the District Court 
       
      
    14 Judge Sorby referred to several authorities and to a report dated 9 May 2000 of Dr J R Cooke, whom Mr Parsons called as an expert. The Judge said that the subsidence in the footpath was considerable. Dr Cooke viewed the site on 24 March 2000 by which time the broken part of the footpath had been repaired. He had available to him the photographs which were part of the evidence and to which I have referred. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “2.4 In summary, it is apparent that the area on which the footpath is built has been subject to erosion caused by surface water run-off for many years. The path followed by the surface water can be seen in the area near the base of the steps up hill from the footpath in Photograph No 1 in Appendix A and Photographs Nos 7 & 12 in Appendix B and continuing down hill towards the roadway. It is also apparent that the footpath was built without reasonable precautions being taken to minimise the risk that the footpath would be undermined as the result of erosion. The footpath collapsed because of the erosion caused by surface water run-off through the soil and fill material beneath the concrete footpath. 
        
       
       
        
        2.5 When the plaintiff stumbled on the broken edge of the footpath he was in danger of falling down towards the roadway because of the relatively steep slope of the partly eroded embankment between the footpath and the kerb. The account of the accident given by the eyewitness is consistent with an accident caused by the claimant losing his footing on the collapsed part of the footpath, losing his balance and then falling backwards down the embankment. 
        
       
       
        
        2.6 The pattern of scouring by run-off is readily apparent and would have been readily apparent at the time when the footpath was originally built. Without incurring significant additional initial expense the Council could have installed a drainage channel to collect water up hill from the footpath, with one or more pipes laid through the fill material under the footpath to carry the water beneath the footpath to discharge through the kerb into the roadway gutter without eroding the fill under the footpath. The additional initial expense would have been saved in long term repair costs. 
        
       
       
        
        2.7 An alternative to the provision of drainage would have been for the Council to have constructed a reinforced footpath with edge beams to span across the area affected by erosion or supported the footpath on low masoning or concrete walls (similar to the wall in the embankment in the foreground of Photographs Nos 11 & 12), with weep holes in the walls to permit surface water to run through the walls in accordance with normal practice for retaining walls.” 
        
       
      
    15 In a supplementary report of 30 April 2002 Dr Cooke said: 
     
      
       
        
        “4 As discussed in paragraph 2.4 of my initial report, it is apparent that the area on which the footpath is built has been subject to erosion caused by surface water run-off for many years. As discussed in paragraph 2.3, the fill under the new section of footpath (replacing the collapsed section on which the plaintiff lost his footing) has already begun to wash away (or was inadequately prepared at the time of construction). In my view the fill has begun to wash away and will continue to wash away until the footpath loses support. Unless the new footpath has been designed (with reinforcements) to span across the area subject to erosion, the footpath will eventually subside and crack and further subside, creating a hazard to pedestrians. 
        
       
       
        
        5 From my inspection of the site and the photographs my opinion is that the erosion occurred over a considerable period of time. It would have taken many months or years before the concrete subsided and cracked as a result of the erosion and undermining of the fill material under the footpath by surface water. Unless concrete is reinforced, it is strong in compression but weak in tension (bending). The compressive strength depends upon the concrete bearing down on a reasonably intact fill material under the concrete. Once the concrete has cracked and lost its structural integrity it would have deteriorated further over a period of weeks or months as the concrete disintegrated through structural failure until the edge of the path fell away as shown in Photographs Nos 9-12 in Appendix B to my initial report. 
        
       
       
        
        6 The signs of failure (cracking, followed by subsidence) would have been apparent for several months. As the footpath deteriorated over a period of months the signs of severe failure would have become increasingly apparent, culminating in the collapse of the edge of the footpath.” 
        
       
      
    16 The trial Judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The subsistence [sic] in the footpath was not a slight imperfection in the footpath or unevenness of surface. Nor was it a ‘hidden danger’ or ‘trap’. It was obvious and one of which the plaintiff should have been well aware with the slightest observation, even at 1 am in the morning there being no evidence that the light from the lights on the two light poles was inadequate. The defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care and that duty extended in certain circumstances, to a situation where it was foreseeable that a person using the footpath might trip slip on the subsided footpath and suffer injury, that risk of injury being neither farfetched or fanciful. However in my view the duty does not extend as far as to cover a situation as depicted by the plaintiff where his state of sobriety was such that in the opinion of a pharmacologist the plaintiff would have been ‘extremely impaired physically (impaired motor coordination, gait and balance) and mentally (diminished ability to assess potential for harm, distorted vision, slow perception/reaction time, poor judgment of place and distance narrowed focus of attention, inability to think clearly and plan)’. Because of his self induced alcoholic state the plaintiff was not able to take reasonable care of himself by seeing the large subsistence at the edge of the footpath and avoiding it. The plaintiff therefore fails.” 
        
       
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    17 Without objection and by leave of the Court Mr Parsons filed an amended notice of appeal. The grounds of appeal were: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred in finding that the subsidence in the footpath was so obvious that the plaintiff should have been well aware of it with the slightest observation, even at 1.00 in the morning. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour failed to take into account the question of inadvertence or thoughtlessness on the part of the plaintiff in the circumstances of the plaintiff’s presence on the footpath. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour erred in finding that the defendant’s duty of care did not extend to cover an intoxicated plaintiff. 
        
       
       
        
        4. His Honour erred in finding that because of his self-induced alcoholic state the plaintiff was not able to take reasonable care of himself by seeing the large subsistence [sic] at the edge of the footpath and avoiding it. 
        
       
       
        
        5. His Honour erred in finding that because the plaintiff did not exercise reasonable care, there was no negligence on the part of the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        6. His Honour erred in failing to direct himself as to whether the subsidence in the footpath comprised a circumstance of the kind calling for some protection or warning, which was not present. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Having found the witness Mr Pritchard was a witness of truth his Honour erred in failing to find that the effect of the plaintiff’s alcohol intake was as described by Mr Pritchard at Black AB 45 I-J, Black AB 45 K-L and Black AB 46 D-F (see paragraph 19 of the Appellant’s Reply) and his Honour erred in finding that the effect of the plaintiff’s alcohol intake was as set out at Red AB 22 P-V.” 
        
       
      
    18 Also by leave and without objection the Council filed a notice of contention that the decision ought to be affirmed on the further and alternative grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The Respondent did not breach its duty of care. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The damage was not caused in law or fact by the Respondent.” 
         
        
       
      
    19 Brodie v Singleton Shire Council and Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council (2001) 206 CLR 512 were applications for special leave to appeal from decisions of this Court. The applications for special leave were referred to the Full High Court and heard together. In each case the defendant was a local council. In Brodie, the driver and owner of a truck sued the council within whose municipal area a wooden bridge was located which partially collapsed as the truck crossed it causing injury to the driver and damage to the truck. In Ghantous, a pedestrian who tripped and fell when walking along a concrete footpath sued the council within whose municipal area the footpath was located. In their joint judgment Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said at 577: 
     
      
       
        
        “150 The duty which arises under the common law of Australia may now be considered. Authorities having statutory powers of the nature of those conferred by the [Local Government Act 1919 (NSW)] upon the present respondents to design or construct roads, or carry out works or repairs upon them, are obliged to take reasonable care that their exercise of or failure to exercise those powers does not create a foreseeable risk of harm to a class of persons (road users) which includes the plaintiff. Where the state of a roadway, whether from design, construction, works or non-repair, poses a risk to that class of persons, then, to discharge its duty of care, an authority with power to remedy the risk is obliged to take reasonable steps by the exercise of its powers within a reasonable time to address the risk. If the risk be unknown to the authority or latent and only discoverable by inspection, then to discharge its duty of care an authority having power to inspect is obliged to take reasonable steps to ascertain the existence of latent dangers which might reasonably be suspected to exist. 
        
       
       
        
        151 The perception of the response by the authority calls for, to adapt the statement by Mason J in  
        Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
         (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48, a consideration of various matters; in particular, the magnitude of the risk and the degree of probability that it will occur, the expense, difficulty and inconvenience to the authority in taking the steps described above to alleviate the danger, and any other competing or conflicting responsibility or commitments of the authority. The duty does not extend to ensuring the safety of road users in all circumstances. In the application of principle, much thus will turn upon the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence in each particular case. 
        
       
       
        
        152 In dealing with particular cases and in determining factual issues respecting breach of duty, it may be convenient to differentiate between the design and construction of a roadway, between subsequent works done on it and between courses of inspection to ascertain its soundness. These matters are not mutually exclusive and sometimes may overlap.” 
        
       
      
    20 Under the heading “Repair, maintenance and works” the joint judgment continued at 579: 
     
      
       
        
        “158 A rejection of the ‘immunity’ for ‘highway authorities’ and the recognition of a duty of care in terms expressed above with reference to  
        Wyong Shire Council v Shirt  
        does not necessarily involve the imposition of an obligation in all cases to exercise powers to repair roads or to ensure they are kept in repair. An authority may have various statutory powers invested in it and would be under a duty not to use, misuse or fail to use those powers to create a situation of danger which creates a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to a user of the road. 
        
       
       
        
        159 The discharge of the duty involves the taking by the authority of reasonable steps to prevent there remaining a source of risk which gives rise to a foreseeable risk of harm. Such a risk of harm may arise from a failure to repair a road or its surface, from the creation of conditions during or as a result of repairs or works, from a failure to remove unsafe items in or near a road, or from the placing of items upon a road which create a danger, or the removal of items which protect against danger. 
        
       
       
        
        160 In dealing with questions of breach of duty, whilst there is to be taken into account as a ‘variable factor’ the results of ‘inadvertence’ and ‘thoughtlessness’, a proper starting point may be the proposition that the persons using the road will themselves take ordinary care. 
        
       
       
        
        161 Not all failures to repair will create risks to the users of a road, or at least not risks which would, as a matter of the reasonably foreseeable, pose a risk of injury. Although it has been said many times that the digging of a hole in a roadway constitutes an actionable misfeasance, the size and location of such a hole may vary and must be considered when determining, on the facts of the particular case, whether it will reasonably foreseeably lead to injury or harm to a user of the road. Depending on the conditions of the road, a ‘hole’ caused by removal of a portion of the road surface may not pose any foreseeable risk to cars; signs may provide adequate warning against whatever risks it poses to motor-cyclists or cyclists. On the other hand, a trench in the roadway, whether arising from active digging or decay of the road or structures within it, will more readily give rise to a foreseeable risk of injury, particularly where it cannot easily be seen or avoided by a road user. The nature of the defect, and not the question of whether it arose by action or ‘non-feasance’, should be significant. The court record and the report of  
        Gorringe 
         do not disclose sufficient material to enable it now to be said that under this dispensation the plaintiff in  
        Gorringe 
         would have recovered in respect of the injury sustained upon the collapse of the ‘appreciable depression’ in the road surface. 
        
       
       
        
        162 The formulation of the duty of care includes consideration of competing or conflicting responsibilities of the authority. In the circumstances of a given case, it may be shown that it was reasonable for an authority to deal in a particular priority with repairs in various locations. The resources available to a road authority, including the availability of material and skilled labour, may dictate the pace at which repairs may be made and affect the order of priority in which they are to be made. It may be reasonable in the circumstances not to perform repairs at a certain site until a certain date, or to perform them after more pressing dangers are first addressed. Even so, it may well be reasonable for the authority to exercise other powers including for example, by erecting warning signs, by restricting road usage or, in extreme cases, by closing the road in question.” 
        
       
      
    21 Thus in the present case the size, nature and location of the fault in the footpath must be considered when determining whether the fault will reasonably foreseeably lead to injury or harm to users of the footpath, and account must be taken of whether it could easily be seen or avoided by users, who are exercising reasonable care for their own safety. Much depends upon the nature of the defect. 
     
      
    22 In the joint judgment Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said, under the heading “Pedestrians”: 
     
      
       
        
        “163 The formulation of the duty in terms which require that a road be safe not in all circumstances but for users exercising reasonable care for their own safety is even more important where, as in  
        Ghantous 
        , the plaintiff was a pedestrian. In general, such persons are more able to see and avoid imperfections in a road surface. It is the nature of walking in the outdoors that the ground may not be as even, flat or smooth as other surfaces. As Callinan J points out in his reasons in  
        Ghantous 
        , persons ordinarily will be expected to exercise sufficient care by looking where they are going and perceiving and avoiding obvious hazards, such as uneven paving stones, tree roots or holes. Of course, some allowance must be made for inadvertence. Certain dangers may not readily be perceived because of inadequate lighting or the nature of the danger (as in  
        Webb v South Australia 
         (1982) 56 ALJR 912; 43 ALR 465), or by surrounding area (as in  
        Buckle 
        , where the hole was concealed by grass (1936) 57 CLR 259 at 266). In such circumstances, there may be a foreseeable risk of harm even to persons taking reasonable care for their own safety. These hazards will include dangers in the nature of a ‘trap’ or, as Jordan CJ put it, ‘of a kind calling for some protection or warning’ ( 
        Searle v Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board 
         (1936) 13 LGR 115 at 117). In  
        Romeo 
        , Toohey and Gummow JJ noted in a different context that the care to be expected of members of the public is related to the obviousness of the danger ( 
        Romeo 
         (1998) 192 CLR 431 at 455 [52]). Kirby J pointed out in the same case that even an occupier of premises ‘is generally entitled to assume that most entrants will take reasonable care for their own safety’. Each case will, of course, turn on its own facts ( 
        Perre v Apand Pty Ltd 
         (1999) 198 CLR 180 at 253 [198];  
        Avenhouse v Hornsby Shire Council 
         (1998) 44 NSWLR 1 at 8; ;  
        Stapelton,  
        ‘Duty of Care Factors: a Selection from the Judicial Menus’, in Cane and Stapelton (eds),  
        The Law of Obligations 
         (1998) 59, at pp 60-63.” 
        
       
       
      As Heydon JA pointed out by reference to this paragraph in a passage to which I shall return in  
      Richmond Valley Council v Standing 
       [2002] NSWCA 359 (unreported) “the existence of a duty must be assessed in part by reference not to any requirement that the footpath ‘be safe … in all circumstances’, but by reference to the position of ‘users exercising reasonable care for their own safety’.” 
      
    23 Under the head “Inspections” the joint judgment continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “164 Cases respecting inspections for dangerous conditions have been determined by the dichotomy between misfeasance and non-feasance. A ‘highway authority’ was not liable if it failed to conduct inspections but, seemingly, was liable if it began remedial work in response to the discovery by inspection of defects or, possibly, even once it discovered the existence of those defects. These cases usually involved ‘non-feasance’, as an inspection typically discloses a situation which is unsafe and needs repair. Allied to them are cases in which a danger first manifests itself when the road surface, or a structure, collapses or gives way either under the plaintiff or shortly before it is crossed. 
        
       
       
        
        165 Where the danger could not reasonably be suspected to exist, or could not be found except by taking unreasonable measures, generally there will be no breach of duty by the authority. On the other hand, there will be a breach of duty where an authority fails to take reasonable steps to inspect for such dangers as reasonably might be expected or known to arise, or of which the authority has been informed or made aware, and, if they are found, fails to take reasonable steps to correct them. In the cases, the danger usually manifests itself in decayed beams or supports of bridges, or drains or culverts, or other structures supporting a road or its surface. The reports of  
        Macpherson 
         ( 
        Borough of Bathurst v Macpherson 
         (1879) 4 App Cas 256),  
        Buckle  
        and  
         Gorringe  
        all disclose insufficient facts to determine the reasonableness of the inspections which did take place or of the failure to inspect and ascertain the existence of the danger which caused the injury to the plaintiffs in those cases.” 
        
       
      
    24 The three cases cited illustrate the uncertain development and limited application of nonfeasance immunity. The decision of the High Court has made these decisions of no more than historic interest. 
     
      
    25 In Richmond Valley Council v Standing the plaintiff was injured when she tripped and fell on an irregular paved concrete surface in the vicinity of a school which she had just visited. In a judgment with which the other members of the Court (Handley and Sheller JJA) agreed, Heydon JA quoted and summarised the law as stated in Brodie. In particular his Honour observed that although Gleeson CJ and Callinan J disagreed with the decision of Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ that the non-feasance immunity existing at common law should be abolished, their Honours said important things about when pedestrians might recover in relation to the condition of footpaths. Particularly Callinan J at 355 emphasised that in Ghantous where the plaintiff tripped because of the unevenness in height between two sections of the pavement that the difference in height was plain to be seen. “It is not unreasonable to expect that people will see in broad daylight what lies ahead of them in the ordinary course as they walk along.” Gleeson CJ, after noting that the non-feasance immunity had been abolished in England by statute in 1961, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… when general principles of negligence, unqualified by any rule of immunity, were applied, the courts insisted that an injured plaintiff had to show that the road or footpath was dangerous. That did not mean merely that it could possibly be an occasion of harm. The fact that there was unevenness of a kind which could result in a person stumbling or falling would not suffice. Not all footpaths are perfectly level. Many footpaths are unpaved. People are regularly required to walk on uneven surfaces on both public and private land.” 
        
       
      
    26 The first question, as posed by Heydon JA, was whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That turns on whether the failure of the defendant to repair the footpath created a ‘foreseeable risk of harm’ to pedestrians. That expression appears to be a reference to a reasonably foreseeable risk, since at 161 in  
        Brodie 
        , Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said: ‘Not all failures to repair will create risks to the users of a road, or at least not risks which would, as a matter of the  
        reasonably 
         foreseeable, pose a risk of injury.’ The existence of a duty must be assessed in part by reference not to any requirement that the footpath ‘be safe ... in all circumstances’, but by reference to the position of ‘users exercising reasonable care for their own safety’ (at 163). This was said to be particularly important in relation to pedestrians. The question is whether there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to a pedestrian exercising reasonable care for her own safety, bearing in mind the particular advantages of pedestrians. The issue of the capacity of the defendant to deal with particular risks and the competition between claims on scarce resources is not specifically relevant to the question of the scope of duty, but to the question of its breach.” 
        
       
      
    27 Heydon JA concluded in that case that a pedestrian exercising reasonable care for his or her own safety ought to have seen the hole in question and if the hole had been seen a pedestrian of that kind would not have placed his or her foot in it (para 53). His Honour observed that there was no concealment of any of the features of the site and no inadequacy in the lighting or obscuring of the hazard by grass or otherwise. “It was reasonable to expect the plaintiff to have seen what lay ahead of her as she walked along in broad daylight: what was there was obvious and called for no special vigilance.” 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    28 In the present case the photographs suggest, as the trial Judge found, that the fault in the pavement would have been visible to a pedestrian walking along the pavement during daylight hours and looking ahead to where he or she was going. Moreover such a pedestrian could have avoided the area of damage by walking along the north side of the pavement where there was plenty of room on an undamaged surface. 
     
      
    29 The problem in the present case was that Mr Parsons fell on the pavement at 1 am. Judge Sorby said that the subsidence in the footpath was not a hidden danger or trap. “It was obvious and one of which the plaintiff should have been well aware with the slightest observation, even at 1 am in the morning there being no evidence that the light from the lights on the two light posts was inadequate.”  
     
      
    30 If the lighting in the area of the fault in the pavement was inadequate in the sense that a person using the footpath and exercising due care could not have seen the fault and recognised its nature the fault became a concealed trap for such a person walking along the pavement and expecting to proceed along what appeared to be a defined concrete pavement available to be used by pedestrians during the night. However, the evidence does not enable this conclusion to be reached any more than it supports what the trial Judge said about it. One has only such inferences as can be drawn from the fact that Mr Parsons apparently while turning around on the pavement walked into the fault and Mr Pritchard who was close behind him did not immediately see the fault. 31 The trial Judge seemed to accept that Mr Pritchard was out of the car and not far from Mr Parsons when Mr Parsons fell. Mr Pritchard’s evidence was that he was a couple of metres behind Mr Parsons when he fell. He said that there were two light poles “with the arm out that puts light on to the street itself” and there was some reflected light on the area, “but that was sort of east of where Barry fell, so I imagine heading west as he was and he was on the southern side of the footpath where the pavement was missing, he probably wouldn’t have seen it in any case.” Mr Pritchard was asked “Where [sic – were] there any shadows being cast on the …” to which he answered “Yes I’d say there was”. At this point the trial Judge said that there was nothing from the plaintiff about the lighting. The plaintiff was recalled immediately and said he did not have any recollection of what the lighting conditions were in the area where he was standing before he fell nor did he have any recollection of seeing the state of the footpath before he fell. 32 Mr Pritchard was asked when it first became apparent to him that the footpath was in the condition he eventually saw. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well in the first instance I thought that Barry had stepped off the edge of the footpath and lost his balance bearing in mind that the footpath at that point was about 600 [sic] above the kerb and my main concern then was just the events that occurred after that when he fell and hit his head. I then looked around to see what was happening and I could see that the footpath - the pavement was missing.” 
        
       
      
    33 The trial Judge asked a question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just so I’m clear on that. Earlier evidence suggests that you came back – or later on, did you say, as I understand your evidence, that at the time he fell you thought he’d fallen off the edge of the footpath then after he fell you had a look and that’s when you saw the missing bit?” 
        
       
       
      Mr Pritchard answered: 
       
       
        
        “That’s when I saw the missing bit.” 
        
       
      
    34 There is no evidence to support the trial Judge’s conclusion that at 1 am in the morning the subsidence in the footpath was obvious and one of which Mr Parsons should have been well aware “with the slightest observation”. Equally it is true that there was no evidence that the light from the lamps on the two poles was inadequate in the sense that any witness expressed such an opinion. 
     
      
    35 In evidence there were photographs of the road showing the poles and the arms with lamps directed down on the road. Doing the best I can from looking at those photographs, I would not have thought that the light thrown on that part of the pavement where the fault was and which was approximately half way between the two poles, which could have been as much as 50 metres apart, would have been particularly good. However, surprisingly, no evidence was called beyond what Mr Pritchard said about the lighting. 36 The adequacy or inadequacy of the lighting was only relevant to the question of whether Mr Parsons exercising reasonable care for his own safety ought to have seen and recognised the fault in the footpath for what it was in time sufficient to step around it or safely through it. What Mr Parsons himself could see and what he could do in reaction to what he saw was almost certainly affected by his intake of alcohol if, as Dr Dauncey said, that would have reduced his capacity to assess potential for harm and distorted his vision. 37 Mr Pritchard was behind Mr Parsons, whom he could obviously see, and Mr Mansfield. When recalled Mr Pritchard was asked about the lighting condition and said “I think there would be shadows … there was [sic] shadows on the footpath” but later added that it would fair to say he did not recall seeing any shadows. He thought Mr Parsons had stepped off the edge of the footpath and lost his balance. His main concern was that Mr Parsons had fallen and hit his head. Mr Pritchard then looked around and could see the footpath and that the pavement was missing. That was when he saw the missing bit. That missing bit was visible to him, presumably standing, on or near the footpath. 38 I find it hard to accept that such evidence supports a finding that the lighting was inadequate or more importantly that the fault in the footpath would not have been visible to Mr Parsons as he approached it if he had been sober and exercising due care for his own safety.39 The situation was that Mr Parsons had no recollection. Mr Pritchard’s evidence was that he saw the fault in the pavement. I agree with the trial Judge that Mr Pritchard’s evidence of what Mr Parsons probably would not have seen, even if admissible, was of no weight, particularly having in mind his state of sobriety.40 There was no evidence from Mr Mansfield. His evidence was likely to have been the most important evidence of all about visibility of the fault in the pavement. Apparently he was the first out of the car and on to the footpath. He must have walked past or through the fault in the footpath. He may have seen it and walked around it or safely through it. He may not have seen it. The inference is that consciously or unconsciously he avoided it. 41 The onus was on Mr Parsons to prove that such was the state of the lighting that he could not have seen and recognised the nature of the fault in the pavement even if he had been sober and taking care for his own safety as he walked along the footpath. That onus, in my opinion, he failed to discharge.42 An important matter was the state of Mr Parsons’ sobriety when he fell. The trial Judge was satisfied, based on Dr Dauncey’s opinion, that Mr Parsons would have been “extremely impaired physically (impaired motor coordination, gait and balance) and mentally (diminished ability to assess potential for harm, distorted vision, slow perception/reaction time, poor judgment of place and distant, narrowed focus of attention, inability to think clearly and plan).” The Judge said that because of his self-induced alcoholic state Mr Parsons was not able to take reasonable care of himself by seeing the large subsidence at the edge of the footpath and avoiding it. 
     
      
    43 If it be accepted that the fault in the pavement was visible at 1 am in the morning, in the light conditions prevailing, by a pedestrian proceeding along the footpath and exercising due care, the question was, as Mr Toomey QC urged on behalf of the plaintiff/appellant, whether the Council’s duty was enlarged to require it to protect persons in the state of sobriety of Mr Parsons while using the footpath at that time. The basis for this submission was that the Council should expect people in Mr Parsons’ state of sobriety to be using the footpath in the middle of the night.  
     
      
    44 A person in the state of sobriety of Mr Parsons is not one necessarily able to take reasonable care for his own safety when walking along a darkened footpath in the middle of the night. If it was open to find that Mr Parsons, able to use such reasonable care for his own safety, would have fallen in the way he did because in the light provided he would not have seen the fault, then his state of sobriety would only have had consequences in looking at causation and the question of contribution. To make the point more precisely if there had been across the pavement an unguarded trench not visible at night and Mr Parsons had walked into it and injured himself, it would not matter, so far as the question of the Council’s breach of its duty of care was concerned, that Mr Parsons happened to be drunk. The Council’s duty, such as it was, was owed to him as a pedestrian on a footpath for which the Council had the care and responsibility.  
     
      
    45 In his two reports, which I have quoted, Dr Cooke said, in summary, that the area on which the footpath was built had been subject to erosion caused by surface runoff for many years. The footpath had been built without reasonable precautions being taken to minimise the risk that it would be undermined as the result of erosion. The footpath collapsed because of the erosion caused by surface water runoff through the soil and film material between the concrete footpath. In his opinion the erosion occurred over a considerable time. It would have taken many months or years before the concrete subsided and cracked as a result of the erosion and undermining of the fill material. The signs of failure (cracking followed by subsidence) would have been apparent for several months. “As the footpath deteriorated over a period of months the signs of severe failure would have become increasingly apparent, culminating in the collapse of the edge of the footpath.” The photographs suggest that the collapse of the pavement was not recent. There was no evidence that it had been reported to Council. Nor was there evidence about Council’s practice in inspecting and, if necessary, repairing footpaths in its control and care.  
     
      
    46 Although Mr Parsons pleaded a case that the footpath was not properly constructed (see para 7.3 and 7.4 of the statement of claim) the trial Judge said: “The plaintiff has not brought his case alleging the footpath was badly constructed but only poorly maintained.” This may have been a misunderstanding in light of the two reports by Dr Cooke which Mr Parsons tendered.  
     
      
    47 However this may be if on the night in question the fault in the footpath and its nature was visible to a user of the footpath taking due care the Council was not in breach of the duty of care it owed to Mr Parsons. In my opinion, the evidence did not allow the Court to conclude that the Council had failed in its duty of care to Mr Parsons. I have referred to the absence of any satisfactory evidence about the state of lighting on the night in question. Dr Cooke was of opinion that the signs of failure would have been apparent for several months. It is not possible to say for how long the footpath was in the state it appeared to be at the time Mr Parsons fell. On the evidence it is not possible to say whether the Council had failed to take reasonable steps to repair the footpath. In my opinion, Mr Parsons failed to make good his claim and the appeal must be dismissed.

    48 The appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
       
      Appeal book index 
       
      
    49 When the hearing of the appeal began, I drew to the attention of Mr Toomey to the inadequacy of the index to the blue appeal books. Exhibit C was described as no more than a bundle of hospital notes and reports from two hospitals which apparently extended from page 25 to page 156 without any indication whatever of where within all those pages any particular document in the bundle was to be found. The index was useless for any member of the Court who wanted to find without searching through the pages referred to the page at which a particular document was to be found. That to this extent the index was useless should have been apparent to the person that prepared it. I raised the question whether the solicitor responsible for the preparation of the appeal books should have the costs of preparing the blue appeal books. I note that, unfortunately, Part 51 r35 (1)(a)(ii) does not expressly require that the index set out the page reference of each document in an exhibit which contains many documents in a bundle. This should be obvious but is not required, at the present time, by the rules and, in my view, the rules should be amended accordingly. In light of the term of the rule I say no more about the costs of preparing the blue appeal books. 
     
      
    50 BEAZLEY JA: I have had the advantage of reading the draft Judgment of Sheller JA. Because of his Honour’s detailed consideration of the judgment the subject of this appeal, I am able to express my reasons and point of disagreement with his Honour shortly. 
     
      
    51 The trial judge, relevantly, made the following findings: there was no independent evidence about the adequacy of the lights; the footpath was obviously unsafe where the appellant fell; the respondent did maintenance work on footpaths under its management and control including on Alison Road, although the work was not done to the pavement on the side of Alison Road where the plaintiff fell; the subsidence in the footpath was considerable. The trail judge then quoted from para. 5 in Dr Cooke’s report, which is set out in para 15 of Sheller JA’s reasons. It appears therefore that his Honour accepted that the concrete path, once having cracked and having lost its structural integrity, would have deteriorated over a relatively lengthy period of time – weeks or months. The loss of structural integrity to which Dr Cooke referred was the gradual removal of the fill underneath the concrete over “many months or years”. Given the structure of the footpath, clearly apparent from the photographic evidence in the case, this gradual erosion even prior to the cracking would have been obvious. 
     
      
    52 His Honour then found that this “considerable” subsidence was not hidden. It was obvious. Presumably because it was “considerable”, the [appellant] “should have been well aware with the slightest observation [of the subsidence], even at 1.00 am in the morning there being no evidence that the light from the lights on the two poles was inadequate”. His Honour held therefore that the respondent owed no duty of care to the appellant because he was not able to take reasonable care of himself “because of his self induced alcoholic state”. 
     
      
    53 As Sheller JA has pointed out, a significant issue in the case related to the state of the lighting. This is obvious from the passage just quoted. His Honour’s approach to this issue was to note that “there was no independent evidence about the adequacy of the lighting at 1.00 am”. If by “independent evidence” his Honour meant expert evidence, then it was correct to say that there was no such evidence. However, whilst expert evidence may have been of assistance its absence ought not to have been determinative. In my opinion, the state and effect of lighting is a matter of ordinary observation. If his Honour intended with the above statement, to refer to any evidence as to the lighting, I consider him to be in error. There is no doubt that the evidence about the lighting was scant, but there was more evidence than that referred to by his Honour. 
     
      
    54 His Honour’s reference to the evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “There were two light poles fairly close to the accident scene as revealed in the photos. The plaintiff has no recollection of the lighting. Mr Pritchard identifies the light pole”. 
        
       
      
    55 However, Mr Pritchard’s evidence went further than that:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What was the condition of the lighting in the street at that time? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well there was a light pole just in front of the car. It’s one of those light poles with the arm out that puts light onto the street itself. There was some reflected light on the area, but that was sort of east of where Barry fell, so I imagine heading west as he was and he was on the southern side of the footpath where the pavement was missing, he probably wouldn’t have seen it in any case. 
        
       
       
      Mr Pritchard did not notice that the footpath was broken until he looked afterwards to see what had caused the appellant to fall.  
       
      
    56 Not only was there evidence about the lighting, lighting is a matter of common experience. It is a matter of common experience that street lighting does not replicate daylight. If it did, there would be no necessity for car headlights. The evidence here was that there were no street lights directly at the spot where the accident occurred, rather the accident spot was midway between two lights. The light fittings overhung the street. The only light on the footpath, on the unchallenged evidence of Mr Pritchard, was “reflected light”. There is to be added to that the fact that Mr Pritchard, about whom it was never suggested was not taking reasonable care for himself, did not see that the footpath was broken until after the appellant fell. At that time Mr Pritchard was approximately 1½ to 2 metres “at the outside” away from the plaintiff and his attention was only drawn to the state of the footpath because of the appellant’s fall. When he was challenged in cross-examination that he could see at that distance “the detail of the crumbling cement”, Mr Pritchard said “Yes. I moved closer to check it out as well”.  
     
      
    57 In my opinion, given Mr Pritchard’s evidence and common experience, the broken footpath at night, even with street lighting of the type I have described, presented a danger to persons who were taking care for their own safety. Accordingly, I consider the trial judge erred in his conclusion that the danger was obvious. 
     
      
    58 That of course is not the end of the matter. Sheller JA has given consideration to the state of law as discussed by and established in the recent decisions of Brodie v Singleton Shire Council and Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council (2001) 206 CLR 512. It will not be necessary, therefore, for me to discuss those authorities at great length. However, it is important to recognise, that they do not stand for the proposition that because a danger is obvious, there is no negligence. It might be surprising that such a simplistic statement is even made. However, there appears to be a trend in the cases that reflect that simplistic proposition.  
     
      
    59 In Brodie their Honours’ in the joint judgment said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not all failures to repair will create risks to the users of a road, or at least not risks which would, as a matter of the reasonably foreseeable, pose a risk of injury. Although it has been said many times that the digging of a hole in a roadway constitutes an actionable misfeasance, the size and location of such a hole may vary and must be considered when determining, on the facts of the particular case, whether it will reasonably foreseeably lead to injury or harm to the user of the road. Depending on the conditions of the road, a ‘hole’ caused by removal of a portion of the road surface may not pose any foreseeable risk to cars; signs may provide adequate warning against whatever risks it poses to motor-cyclists or cyclists.  
        On the other hand, a trench in the roadway, whether arising from active digging or decay of the road or structures within it, will more readily give rise to a foreseeable risk of injury, particularly where it cannot easily be seen or avoided by a road user 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The formation of the duty in terms which require that a road be safe not in all circumstances but for users exercising reasonable care for their own safety is even more important where … the plaintiff was a pedestrian. In general, such persons are more able to see and avoid imperfections in a road surface. … persons ordinarily will be expected to exercise sufficient care by looking where they are going and perceiving and avoiding obvious hazards, such as uneven paving stones, tree roots or holes. Of course, some allowance must be made for inadvertence. Certain dangers may not readily be perceived because of inadequate lighting … there may be a foreseeable risk of harm even to persons taking reasonable care for their own safety. These hazards will include dangers … of a kind calling for some protection or warning … the care to be expected of members of the public is related to obviousness of the danger. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Where the danger could not reasonably be suspected to exist, or could not be found except by taking unreasonable measures, generally there will be no breach of duty by the authority. On the other hand, there will be a breach of duty where an authority fails to take reasonable steps to inspect for such dangers as reasonably might be expected or known to arise, … and, if they are found, fails to take reasonable steps to correct them.  
        
       
      
    60 In my opinion this is not a case where the danger could not reasonably be suspected to exist, or which could not be found except by taking unreasonable measures. The unchallenged evidence was that the signs of failure of the footpath would have been evident for several months, with the signs of “severe” failure becoming increasingly apparent. Alison Road is one of the main thoroughfares through Randwick. It is heavily trafficked, both by vehicles and pedestrians. Although the place where the accident occurred is not in the shopping section area, it is clearly built up and well used. Given the obviously hazardous state of the footpath, a state that it had been in for a considerable period of time, the Council must, in my opinion, have been negligent in its system of inspection, maintenance and repair. But in any event, the Council had been in the area carrying out repairs shortly prior to the accident. The respondent’s Work Orders revealed that in the 3 month period immediately prior to the accident, the pathway outside No. 245 Alison Road was “sunken”; that there was a “bad dip/hole in Alison Road down from St Marks Street”; that there were “rutted concrete areas in Alison Road opposite the gully” and the Council had inspected these areas and either done work or commissioned work to be done. Although on the opposite side of he road, this work was in the same vicinity as the accident i.e. along the same stretch of roadway. One thing which is apparent from the evidence, including the photographic evidence, is that, in the daytime, the collapse of the footpath where the appellant fell was obvious.  
     
      
    61 Given the unsafe state of the footpath, and given that I consider that the respondent either was, or should have been aware of the danger it presented, I am of the opinion that the respondent was negligent in failing to repair the footpath and/or maintain it in proper condition. 
     
      
    62 There is a further basis, upon which his Honour could have held that the Council was negligent, namely, the negligent construction of the footpath in the first place. There was unchallenged evidence on this: 
     
      
       
        
        “In summary, it is apparent that the area on which the footpath is built has been subject to erosion caused by surface water run-off for many years. The path followed by the surface water can be seen in the area near the base of the steps up hill from the footpath in Photograph No. 1 in Appendix A and Photographs Nos. 7 & 12 in Appendix B and continuing down hill towards the roadway. It is also apparent that the footpath was built without reasonable precautions being taken to minimise the risk that the footpath would be undermined as the result of erosion. The footpath collapsed because of the erosion caused by surface water run-off through the soil and fill material beneath the concrete footpath. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The pattern of scouring by run-off is readily apparent and would have been readily apparent at the time when the footpath was originally built. Without incurring significant additional initial expense the Council could have installed a drainage channel to collect water up hill from the footpath, with one or more pipes laid through the fill material under the footpath to carry the water beneath the footpath to discharge through the kerb into the roadway gutter without eroding the fill under the footpath. The additional initial expense would have been saved in long term repair costs.” 
        
       
      
    63 His Honour did not refer to this evidence in his judgment although he quoted lengthy portions of Dr Cooke’s report. Indeed, his Honour considered that the plaintiff had not brought such a case. There is an issue as to whether that was so, as that case was both pleaded and evidence advanced in support of it. In the appellant’s Written Submissions in Reply, the issue was directly raised and relied upon although senior counsel for the appellant appeared to disavow that case in his oral submissions.  
     
      
    64 If it were not for that disavowal, I would have thought that the case against the Council on that ground had been made out and was unanswered. However, given senior counsel’s disavowal of that case, the matter falls to be determined on the first basis only. On that basis, I would allow the appeal. 
     
      
    65 The Council pleaded contributory negligence. The appellant argued that the footpath was so hazardous that there could be no question of contributory negligence. I do not agree. The appellant was significantly intoxicated having a blood alcohol reading of .268 and there was evidence that his motor co-ordination, gait and balance would have been seriously impaired as would his mental alertness. In my opinion, the appellant’s own negligence was substantial and should be assessed at 50%. 
     
      
    66 There are a number of other issues in the case which require mention. First, the respondent filed a Notice of Contention contending that his Honour should not have admitted Dr. Cooke’s report or, alternatively, should have given it no weight. No submissions were advanced either in writing or orally in support of the Notice of Contention and accordingly, there is no need to consider it further. 
     
      
    67 There was also some argument as to whether his Honour failed to award interest on the Griffith v Kerkemeyer amount and wrongly applied a vicissitudes discount to the award for future out of pocket expenses. There was also an alleged error in respect of interest on past economic loss. Except for interest on the Griffith v Kerkemeyer amount, the Council does not dispute that these errors were made. It is appropriate they be corrected. As to the award of interest for the Griffith v Kerkemeyer figure, it was submitted that the amount claimed did not reflect the historical cost but was averaged out over the period so that interest was not payable. That is not obvious from his Honour’s judgment, nor perhaps likely, given that the claim was for a year. Accordingly the appellant’s claim on this point should also be allowed. 
     
      
    68 IPP JA: I agree with Sheller JA. 
     
      
    69 At about 1.00 am on 25 October 1999 Mr Parsons, while intoxicated, fell while walking on the footpath in Alison Road, Randwick. The Randwick Municipal Council was responsible for the care and control of the footpath.  
     
      
    70 Mr Parsons’ fall was at least partly caused by a large hole in the footpath into which Mr Parsons stepped.  
     
      
    71 In daylight, the hole would have been obvious to any reasonable user of the footpath. 
     
      
    72 Whether the hole would have been equally obvious in the hours of darkness depended upon the state of the lighting in the vicinity of the hole. 
     
      
    73 The state of the lighting was crucial to the success or otherwise of Mr Parsons. The reason for this appears from the following remarks of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council; Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council (2001) 206 CLR 512 at 581: 
     
      
       
        
        “The formulation of the duty in terms which require that a road be safe not in all circumstances but for users exercising reasonable care for their own safety is even more important where, as in  
        Ghantous, 
         the plaintiff was a pedestrian. In general, such persons are more able to see and avoid imperfections in a road surface. It is the nature of walking in the outdoors that the ground may not be as even, flat or smooth as other surfaces. As Callinan J points out in his reasons in  
        Ghantous 
        , persons ordinarily will be expected to exercise sufficient care by looking where they are going and perceiving and avoiding obvious hazards, such as uneven paving stones, tree roots or holes. Of course, some allowance must be made for inadvertence. Certain dangers may not readily be perceived because of inadequate lighting … in such circumstances, there may be a foreseeable risk of harm even to persons taking reasonable care for their own safety”. 
        
       
      
    74 These remarks distinguish between “inadvertence” on the one hand and “taking reasonable care” on the other. On this authority, “highway authorities” owe no duty of care to persons who do not exercise reasonable care for their own safety, although they do owe reasonable care to those who may merely be inadvertent. 
     
      
    75 Callinan J (to whose reasons Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ referred at 581) said at 639: 
     
      
       
        
        “The world is not a level playing field. It is not unreasonable to expect that people will see in broad daylight what lies ahead of them in the ordinary course as they walk along. No special vigilance is required for this”. 
        
       
      
    76 How this approach sits with cases such as March v Stramare Pty Limited (1991) 171 CLR 506, is not clear.  
     
      
    77 In March v Stramare Pty Limited Deane J (with whom Gaudron J agreed) said (at 520) that the duty of care of road users was: 
     
      
       
        
        “not confined to persons who were careful and sober but extended to all foreseeable users of the road, including bad and inattentive drivers and those whose faculties were impaired either naturally or by reason of the effect of alcohol”. 
        
       
       
      Deane J went on to say (also at 520): 
       
       
        
        “[A]s was pointed out in  
        Bus v Sydney County Council 
         (1989) 167 CLR 78 at 90, ‘the law has progressed’ in recent years ‘by placing an increased emphasis upon the relevance of the possibility of negligence or inadvertence on the part of the person to whom a duty of care is owed’ … Thus, for example, an inattentive driver of a slowly travelling car has been held to be liable in damages, under apportionment legislation, for breach of a duty of care owed to a person who, dressed in a dark overcoat on a rainy night, sought to cross the road at a ‘high unlikely’ spot without any real lookout for oncoming traffic”. 
        
       
       
      Deane J accepted (at 521) that: 
       
       
        
        “[T]he relevant duty of care in the present case was to all users of the road, including the inattentive and those whose faculties were impaired by alcohol”. 
        
       
      
    78 McHugh J (at 536 to 537) also accepted that a duty of care was owed by a road user to careless and drunken drivers as well as careful drivers.  
     
      
    79 It may be that the remarks of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Brodie and Ghantous (at 581) are a manifestation of the trend described as follows (at 48) by Spigelman CJ in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL All Services Club Limited (2001) 53 NSWLR 43:  
     
      
       
        
        “There have been changes over recent decades in the expectations within Australian society about persons accepting responsibility for their own actions. Such changes in social attitudes must be reflected in the identification of duty of care for purposes of the law of negligence. The recent authoritative statements in  
        Perre v Apand Pty Limited 
         (1999) 198 CLR 180 and  
        Agar v Hyde 
         (2000) 201 CLR 552 give greater emphasis, in the development of the law of negligence, to the acceptance by individuals of a personal responsibility for their own conduct, than they have been given in the past”. 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Waverley Municipal Council v Swain

        “ 
        Bus v Sydney Council Council 
         (1989) 167 CLR 78 identified a change in the law, between  
        Sydney County Council v Dell’Oro 
         (1974) 132 CLR 97 and 1986, to the effect that the law has ‘progressed’ by giving greater weight to the possibility of inappropriate conduct on the part of others. It now appears possible to identify a change in the law in the other direction, ie greater weight is being given to the proposition that people will take reasonable care for their own safety”.

    80 Whatever the position may be in this respect, Brodie and Ghantous binds this Court to hold that the existence of a duty of care on the part of a highway authority such as the Council in this case must be assessed by reference to the position of users exercising reasonable care for their own safety. See Richmond Valley Council v Standing [2002] NSWCA 359 where Heydon JA (with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed) said that in the light of the observations of Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ in Brodie and Ghantous (at 581): 
     
      
       
        
        “The existence of a duty must be assessed in part by reference not to any requirement that the footpath ‘be safe … in all circumstances’, but by reference to the position of ‘users exercising reasonable care for their own safety’”. 
        
       
       
      
    81 Attributing liability on the grounds of negligence for Mr Parsons’ damages is a serious matter. It was for Mr Parsons to prove his case in accordance with the standards the law requires. The crucial piece of evidence is that of Mr Pritchard in the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What was the condition of the lighting in the street at that time? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Well, there was a light pole just in front of the car. It’s one of those light poles with the arm out that puts light onto the street itself. There were some reflected light on the area, but that was sort of east where Barry fell, so I imagine heading west as he was and he was on the southern side of the footpath where the pavement was missing, he probably wouldn’t have seen it in any case”. 
        
       
      
    82 The following comments can be made about this evidence: 
     
      
       
      (a) The fact that the light was “reflected” says nothing about the quality and extent of the illumination it cast. 
       
       
      (b) The reference to the reflected light being “sort of east” from where Mr Parsons fell, is extremely vague.  
       
       
      (c) From this evidence it is not possible to infer how far the light was from where Mr Parsons fell (if the light indeed did not fall directly on the specific accident area – which is by no means clear).  
       
       
      (d) It is also not possible to infer the extent, if any, to which the light illuminated the general accident area.  
       
       
      (e) Whether Mr Pritchard believed that Mr Parsons did not see the hole because of the lighting or because of some other reason is not clear. 
       
       
      (f) The statement by Mr Pritchard that “I imagine” that “in any case”, Mr Parsons “probably” would not have seen the hole, lacks the clarity, cogency and probative force required to discharge the onus of proof on Mr Parsons.  
       
      
    83 I disagree, with respect, with the observation of Beazley JA that “lighting is a matter of common experience”. It is true that the accident occurred midway between two streetlights. That fact, however, in my view, says nothing about the quality of the lighting at the accident point. That depended on the light cast by the streetlights in question. In my view no judicial notice can be taken of the quality of that lighting. 
     
      
    84 The strong impression gained from a reading of the transcript of the evidence led at the trial is that there was little appreciation of the need to prove the state of the lighting at the relevant time. The case does not appear to have been conducted, at least consciously, on the basis that the state of the lighting contributed to Mr Parsons’ inability to see the hole. Crucially, as Sheller JA observes, Mr Parsons did not call Mr Mansfield, who was able to avoid the hole immediately before Mr Parsons fell. Mr Mansfield must have been able to give evidence about the state of the lighting, yet the Court did not hear from him.  
     
      
    85 The evidence called on Mr Parsons’ behalf in connection with the lighting was skimpy indeed. It was also vague and ambiguous. Applying the ordinary rules as to onus of proof, the evidence led does not establish that the lighting at the place where Mr Pritchard fell was such that, exercising reasonable care for his own safety, he would not have seen the hole and taken steps to avoid it.  
     
      
    86 Accordingly, as I have said, I agree with the reasons and conclusions expressed by Sheller JA.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 BARR, J: I agree with Greg James, J. 
     
      
    2 GREG JAMES, J: Paul Christopher Bentley appeals against his conviction following a trial before Ducker, DCJ. and a jury in the District Court of New South Wales at Lismore. He also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. His conviction was for the offence provided for by s.25A of the Drug (Misuse & Trafficking Act) 1985 of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. The drug in question was heroin. It was alleged he had supplied a police undercover operative with 0.27 grams of the drug on 14 September 2000, 0.38 grams on 15 September 2000 and 0.25 on 16 September 2000, on each occasion receiving payment of $120.00. That is to say, it was alleged that he had supplied in a space of three days in a total of three sales an amount of 0.9 grams for the total sum of $360.00. 
     
      
    3 The first two supplies were said to have occurred inside premises at 42 Ballina Street, Lismore, the third supply immediately outside those premises. 
     
      
    4 It was the case for the appellant at the trial that no such supplies occurred, notwithstanding an attempt or attempts by the police undercover operative at those premises on at least one occasion, probably 16 September 2000 or 18 September 2000, to procure a supply to her. This was a case the jury obviously rejected. That case was supported by the assertion that the evidence of that operative and such evidence as supported her accounts of the supplies were fabricated. 
     
      
    5 The maximum penalty prescribed by that Act for that offence is 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both. The appellant was sentenced by his Honour to imprisonment for three years to commence on 20 March 2002 and to expire on 19 March 2005, with a non-parole period of 27 months, to commence on 20 March 2002 and to expiring on 19 June 2004. 
     
      
    6 Following his arrest, the applicant had been detained in custody from 21 September 2000 until 15 February 2001. On 26 November 2001, the appellant had pleaded guilty at the Lismore District Court and was apparently again remanded in custody, in which custody he remained until 27 February 2002 when leave was granted to him to withdraw his plea of guilty. Thereafter he remained on bail until 22 November 2002 when he was found guilty and remanded in custody. 
     
      
    7 The trial judge had fixed the commencement date for the sentences bearing in mind these broken periods of custody and had taken those periods of custody into account when fixing the length of the sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      The statute 
       
      
    8 Section 25A(1) of the Drug (Misuse & Trafficking) Act 1985 provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who supplies, on three or more separate occasions during any period of 30 consecutive days, supplies a prohibited drug (other than cannabis) for financial or material reward is guilty of an offence.”  
         
        
       
      
    9 By subsection (3) it is provided that the jury must be satisfied unanimously of each of the same three occasions of supply. Subsection (4) provides for an alternative verdict as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If, on the trial of a person for an offence under this section, the jury is not satisfied that the offence is proven but is satisfied that the person has, in respect of any of the occasions relied on as evidence of commission of the offence under this section, committed a relevant supply offence, the jury may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of the relevant supply offence, and the person is liable to punishment accordingly.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    10 At the hearing, only one of the originally asserted grounds of appeal was relied upon in respect of the appeal against conviction. That ground was:- 
     
      
       
        
        “4. His Honour erred in that the terms of his direction to the jury that they could not return alternative verdicts caused a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    11 The application for leave to appeal against sentence is based on a ground asserting that the penalty was too severe and some other sentence was warranted. 
     
      
       
      The written submissions 
       
      
    12 In the written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant, it was contended that the trial judge had erred in giving a direction to the jury explaining the basis upon which he had withdrawn from their consideration the alternative verdict. It was contended, in those submissions, that what was said to the jury “could only have been understood by the jury to mean that they could only reach a verdict by being satisfied that the appellant had carried out all supplies or not being satisfied that he had carried out any of them”. The vice, so it was submitted, of what was said by the trial judge lay in the jury in the context of what had been said concerning the alternative verdict gaining an understanding that they could not acquit the appellant of the charge of ongoing supply unless they were satisfied that he had not carried out any of the supplies. It was orally submitted that the vice included that the jury might have understood from the direction that the appellant could still be found guilty of the offence even if the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any one or more of the supplies. It was submitted that the evidence was significantly different in respect of one of the three supplies charged, probably that of 16 September. It was submitted that the defence position consistently embraced the defence counsel joining in the Crown Prosecutor’s application to have the alternative verdict withdrawn, but not thereby accepting that there was no rational basis to distinguish between the incidents. 
     
      
    13 On behalf of the Crown it was submitted that there was no reason to read into what the trial judge had said that any such understanding might have been communicated to the jury such as to cast any doubt upon the other directions the trial judge had given concerning the necessity for the jury to be satisfied of all three supplies. Further it was submitted, there was no basis of any rational kind upon which the jury would regard the evidence of the undercover operative on any of the three events to be any more or less reliable or unreliable than on the others. 
     
      
    14 On sentence, the written submissions contended that the trial judge had erred in imposing a sentence so severe having regard to the applicant having to serve part of his sentence in protection; that having regard to the total amount of drugs sold and the total amount paid for them, the sentence exceeded that which was appropriate and that his Honour had erred in failing to find the existence of special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      The oral submissions 
       
      
    15 In oral submissions on the conviction before us, it was contended for the first time that the trial judge had erred in withdrawing the alternative verdict from the jury. It was contended that the alternative verdict should have been left to the jury as a matter of law; it was contended that a miscarriage had arisen by reason of that verdict having been withdrawn from the jury. 
     
      
    16 As will be seen, both parties sought the withdrawal of the verdict and the defence had, at all times, opposed the alternative verdict being left. The submission now made on appeal by counsel, who did not appear at the trial or draw the written submissions or draw the grounds of appeal, is entirely inconsistent with the stance taken by counsel who had the responsibility for taking those steps. Had it been perceived that the alternative verdict had any practical basis and because of that practical basis should have been left, it would have been possible for that matter to have been drawn to the trial judge’s attention. It was not. Not even at the time of the jury’s question (to which I will later refer). The defence position was consistent that the alternative verdict should not be left. Consistently, the trial counsel sought to take advantage of the absence of the alternative verdict to achieve an acquittal for his client. It should be noted that prior to the hearing before this jury, an earlier listing of the matter had, by reason of various complaints made by defence counsel, resulted in the matter going over and a lengthy voir dire. Specific directions were given by the District Court judge then presiding requiring the defence to give notice of all issues. There was no suggestion notwithstanding this that the alternative verdict might be available. Indeed, even after the trial judge had determined to put it, counsel chose not to address on it. 
     
      
    17 I see no basis upon which new counsel in these circumstances should be permitted to raise this matter for the first time in oral submissions in this court, nor do I see, as will appear, any prospect of any prejudice, much less miscarriage, arising from the asserted failure to leave the verdict to the jury. 
     
      
    18 In my view, Rule 4 applies. This is a case unlike that to which reference was made by Ipp, JA. at paragraph 97 in his discussion in Regina v. Ita [2003] NSWCCA 174 of the application of Rule 4 and the principles underlying it, in that, there was here an explanation for the omission to `raise the perceived difficulties with the trial judge. That explanation lay in counsel not wanting the alternative verdict to be left. What explanation was raised with the trial judge concerning the terms of the direction withdrawing the alternative verdict, will appear. Other than in respect of that observation, I consider Ipp, JA.’s remarks at paragraph 97, “it is disturbing that so often no account is taken of the clear warnings that have been given by this court. It is not unusual for appellants, without making any application for leave under Rule 4, to proceed blithely to argue grounds that should have been raised by counsel at trial but were not”, entirely apposite to what has occurred. 
     
      
    19 I have regard to Ipp, JA.’s extensive analysis of the application of Rule 4 and its underlying principles to cases such as this and have concluded that the views of Gleeson, CJ. in Regina v. Sanderson (NSWCCA, unreported 18 July 1994) that, “It would ordinarily be quite inappropriate to permit appellants, in such circumstances, to come to the Court of Criminal Appeal and complain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred” are directly applicable to this argument. I see nothing that would take this matter outside the ordinary case. I would refuse leave under Rule 4 to put forward this submission. 
     
      
    20 The appeal against conviction necessitates I review closely the proceedings at trial since the ground asserted relies on some considerable history. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    21 It was the Crown case that the undercover police operative “Julie” had, on 14 September 2000, after attending a briefing with various police officers including Detective Manitta and Parmenter, attended 42 Ballina Street, Lismore taking with her the sum of $300. She went to those premises at 2.45 pm and was met by a woman KP. Following a brief conversation with her, KP left her and then returned later, taking the undercover operative with her into a bedroom in the premises. There, she met the appellant and was introduced to him by KP. At that point, she said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Hi, Paul. I hope you can help me out, I’m after a quarter, there’s the money to cover it.” 
        
       
      
    22 She placed $150 on the bed. The appellant got up, put on his boots and said, “it’s $120”. He provided here with a white coloured rock substance cut in her presence from a greater quantity of that substance and placed by him on a piece of white backed gold foil. He gave her some change and said, “you can come back any time, but just don’t tell anyone about me, don’t tell them you’ve seen me or anything about me”. He was wearing a black fitted t-shirt, black jeans and black boots. 
     
      
    23 The undercover operative went back to her car and handed over at another location in Lismore the foil package with the rock substance and the remaining $180 to various police including Detectives Manitta, Parmenter and others. Upon analysis, the white coloured rock substance was identified as .27 grams of heroin. 
     
      
    24 On 15 September 2000, she attended another briefing with those detectives and was handed $240. About midday, she went back to 42 Ballina Street, saw the woman KP, they had a brief conversation, KP said to the appellant, “Paul, Julie want to see you”. The appellant replied, “Yeah, come in Julie”. Julie saw he was lying on a mattress on the floor next to the main bed. He told her he was in pain due to some broken bones that he had received as a result of a car accident. She asked if she could buy another quarter. He removed a Rothmans cigarette packet and a Stanley type knife from the same dressing table on which he had cut the white coloured rock substance on the previous occasion, removed a foil package and chipped away at a small rock substance, placing a smaller rock on a piece of white backed gold foil and giving it to Julie. She paid him the $120 and put the foil package in her purse. They had a further conversation in which he told her he would soon be going to Sydney to get some more and that he wouldn’t be away for more than about 36 hours. She asked about the prospects of buying half a gram instead of a quarter and he handed her a business card from inside his mobile phone which had the words “0415 MUDSKA” written on it. He told her this was his phone number. She left and handed over the foil package with the rock substance and the balance of the money to the detectives. Upon analysis the rock material was shown to be heroin. 
     
      
    25 On 16 September 2000 she attended a meeting with the same police officers and was handed $300. About 11.00 am that day, she saw the appellant walking through an undercover carpark in the Lismore Square in Lismore. He was wearing a black t-shirt, a deep aqua-green coloured long sleeved shirt, black jeans and black boots. At about 12.30 that afternoon, Julie made a telephone call to the number on the card the appellant had given her. A male answered and said he was Paul. She asked if she could meet him and “get the same” off him. He asked if she wanted another quarter and she said yes. They agreed to meet at “Farmer Charlie’s” in about 10 to 15 minutes. She spoke with the detectives and walked toward Farmer Charlie’s fruit shop at about 12.53 pm. When about 40 to 50 metres away from Farmer Charlie’s fruit shop she saw the appellant. He was wearing the same clothes as he was wearing earlier that day and was standing out the front of the shop. He turned and walked quickly down a lane and out of sight. She spoke to the detectives again and at 1.25 pm rang again the phone number on the card that the appellant gave to her. She said, “Paul, it’s Julie, what happened, didn’t you see me?”. They had a conversation about missing each other. He told her to come over to the house. She asked for him to meet her outside as she was running late. At 1.36 pm, she drove to 42 Ballina Street and stopped outside. She phoned the number again and said, “Hello Paul”. She told him she was right out the front and he said he’d be out in a minute. He came out, walked down the driveway to the front of the premises and came over to her car. He sat in the seat on the front passenger side, took out a Rothman cigarette packet and placed it on the console of the car. She handed him $120. He was wearing a black fitted t-shirt, black jeans and black boots. 
     
      
    26 Julie drove to her briefing location and after looking and seeing the cigarette packet containing a foil wrapped piece of off-white rock substance, she handed it to Detective Parmenter. On analysis that material was later shown to be .25 grams of heroin. 
     
      
    27 On 18 September 2000, there was a further attempt by Julie to participate in a sale. When she attempted to call the appellant’s mobile phone was turned off. She went to 42 Ballina Street, was shown in by KP who said to Paul, “Paul, Julie’s here”. She saw the appellant playing a Sony Playstation and there were other young males in the room with him. They had a conversation and Julie said she was hoping to get a quarter. He told her that he didn’t have any at all but was going to Sydney that evening, being away for about 24 hours and would call her when he got back. She thereafter left the house. 
     
      
    28 On 20 September 2000, she phoned the mobile number and was told by him that he was still in Sydney. He said to just keep ringing him and he’d tell her where he was. 
     
      
    29 On 21 September 2000, she rang that number again. The appellant answered and Julie said, “Hello Paul, it’s Julie”. She sought to meet him at Farmer Charlie’s. She said she wanted to buy a quarter. This conversation was their last contact. 
     
      
    30 At about 12.25 on 21 September 2000, Detectives Temby and Ruskin arrested the appellant whom they had observed come from the rear of the carpark at Farmer Charlie’s Fruit Barn and walk along McLelland Lane. Detective Temby and other police searched the premises at 42 Ballina Street where they found an orange coloured handled Stanley type knife, purple Ruby Esq. business cards with 0415 MUDSKA written on the back and three pieces of gold foil paper with white backing in a green Cobra backpack. The search was videoed. 
     
      
    31 An analyst’s certificate identified traces of heroin on the blade of the Stanley knife. 
     
      
    32 Telstra records confirmed several calls made from Julie’s phone to the mobile number the appellant provided. The timing of those calls was consistent with Julie’s evidence. 
     
      
    33 KP gave evidence of the use of the premises 42 Ballina Street, Lismore by the appellant and his having brought with him to the premises a green backpack. He had said to her that he was going to Sydney to buy some heroin and he would be away one or two nights. She confirmed the evidence the undercover operative Julie had given of the first purchase and of Julie arriving at the house and going into it when the appellant was home either the next day or the day after. She further gave evidence that on the day of his arrest the appellant had arrived back from Sydney and while they were having a conversation his phone rang. He had said to her that Julie had just rung and he was going to meet her at Farmer Charlies. 
     
      
    34 Detective Colaco had given evidence of the money supplied to Julie and the money returned. He gave evidence corroborating Julie having walked up the stairs of the premises at 42 Ballina Street and being admitted to those premises at 2.45 pm on 14 September 2000. He gave evidence of her walking out at 2.55 pm and handing over the gold coloured piece of foil containing the rock substance at 3.00 pm at the briefing location. On 15 September 2000, he said he had handed Julie $240, again he saw her walk in the front door at 42 Ballina Street, saw her leave at about 12.09 pm. Again, he gave evidence confirming that she had handed over a gold coloured foil which contained the light rock substance together with a multi-coloured business card and had returned the balance of the money supplied. 
     
      
    35 On 16 September 2000, he gave evidence of his handing Julie $300 and of her walking west along Conway Street at Lismore, returning at about 1.45 pm to hand to Detective Parmenter a gold coloured foil with a rock like substance in it together with the balance of the money supplied of some $180. 
     
      
    36 Detectives Parmenter and Manitta gave evidence corroborating to a limited extent that of the undercover operative. Their evidence was of particular significance on the third supply, where each claimed to have observed the applicant entering the car occupied by the police undercover operative outside the premises at 42 Ballina Street and remaining there with her for a short time. Their evidence was the subject of some attack on the basis that it was not open to them to have observed from the positions in which they said they were, the applicant such as to enable a proper identification of him, or indeed in the case of one of the police officers, to have observed the events to which he had referred at all. 
     
      
    37 It was put to KP that she had fabricated her account of the dealing between the appellant and Julie and her credibility was attacked on the ground that she had received a letter of support or comfort from the police for use at her sentencing for the purpose of her receiving a more lenient penalty in respect of offences of malicious damage and assault. 
     
      
    38 It was put to the undercover operative that no such events as she had referred to by way of supplies had happened, although it was put that she had attempted to procure supplies from the appellant to her at least on an occasion on which he was playing a computer game at the house, but that he had refused. The matter was left with her on the basis that no supplies had been made by him to her, as she had alleged, and that her evidence was false and fabricated. 
     
      
       
       
      The appellant’s case 
       
      
    39 The appellant gave evidence at the trial denying supplying heroin or agreeing to supply heroin to Julie or anyone else on any occasion or at any time. He asserted he owned Stanley knives but did not own the orange handled one and had not had gold foil pieces in his backpack. He asserted he did not tell KP he was going to Sydney to buy heroin; did not tell Julie he was driving to Sydney because he was incapable of driving due to an injured right arm which had been severely broken in a motor accident and was very weak. He denied ever speaking in telephone calls to anyone about drugs and asserted he had only met Julie on one occasion, that being the day that Julie spoke to the appellant at 42 Ballina Street when he was playing the video game. He said that that day she sought to be supplied with drugs. He did not discuss that with her. He contended that he was set up by the police and the events as alleged by the Crown were fictitious, none of the supplies ever happened. He admitted the use of the phone number 0415 MUDSKA and having the business card, but this was in respect of a business he conducted selling vinyl record albums. 
     
      
       
      The addresses 
       
      
    40 In his address, defence counsel sought to cast doubt on the evidence of the operative, and, in particular, made reference to a number of matters which it was said showed that the police investigation had not merely been incompetent, but were missing important matters which one would have expected to be present if fabrication had not occurred. These included the lack of evidence confirming surveillance of the applicant by photograph or video, the loss of audio recordings, the lack of fingerprints, the lack of wire recording evidencing the conversations between the undercover operative and the appellant. Reference was made to inconsistencies between the evidence of Detectives Parmenter and Manitta as to the colour of the shirt it was said that the applicant was wearing on 16 September. It was submitted to the jury:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If there are things there that in the evidence as a totality create in you a sense of doubt or reasonable doubt, then I ask you to give the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt that is generated by these problems with the Crown’s evidence.” 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        “It didn’t happen they way those police officers are saying it happened.” 
        
       
      
    41 Later, he said, “something’s fishy in the State of Denmark”. 
     
      
    42 These submissions not only reflected the cross-examination by defence counsel of the Crown witnesses, but also questions raised by the jury during the evidence of the accused. Whilst the accused was under cross-examination, a note marked MFI 27 had been received by the trial judge from the jury requesting all evidence tendered be supplied to the jury during the lunch recess. In addition, the note referred to the jury’s intention to supply the trial judge with a list of questions “generated by the jury” after lunch. Following the luncheon adjournment, the following appears in the transcript as recording a discussion between his Honour and counsel:- 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: This is what the jury have to say. “As this seems a rather big case to bring undercover people from Sydney, you’d have thought they would have done everything by the book and used all means they could to catch the accused, wouldn’t you. So why didn’t Julie have a wire on, why the police didn’t take pictures each time when he got into the car. Why he wasn’t arrested there and then on the third occasion, there was plenty of police watching on the third occasion, there was plenty of police watching him. Why wasn’t the money taken to check the numbers. Why wasn’t the Stanley knife fingerprinted, you’d thought it would be more incriminating evidence as it had powder on it, than the cig packet. Why didn’t they keep the cig packet, really it was the only bit of visual evidence and definitely why the whole house wasn’t searched. I would have, wouldn’t you”. Well there’s really no comment I can make about those matters. It’s really a matter for address I would think. It’s a rather interesting question, the answer as to that first matter. Whether that’s a question of law or a question of fact.” 
        
       
      
    43 Thereafter, the appropriate response to the jury’s questions was discussed with counsel. After that discussion, his Honour concluded that the appropriate course to be taken was for a copy of the questions to be made for each counsel to permit them to address on those matters consistently with the evidence. His Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I don’t want to buy into this. Much of this is (sic) matters that the jury ought to discuss amongst themselves and work out.” 
        
       
      
    44 After some further discussion with counsel for the accused concerning his interpretation of a portion of the jury’s questions, his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Well you can make your address to the jury and the Crown can make theirs, it’s a question – you’ll have to be very careful as to make your address within the ambit of the evidence or does either counsel want me to respond to any of these matters now, and if so, what direction is it suggested ought to be given. I think it may be better to finish the cross-examination of the witness before we deal further with this matter and then consider the situation.” 
        
       
      
    45 On resumption before the jury, his Honour directed them as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, I have the note that has been sent. It seems to have been written by one juror. I don’t know who, but I don’t need to know who. A number of the matters that are discussed there, seem to me to be more matters for the jury to apply their own experience and commonsense about. Some of the matters may perhaps be such as I, in due course, may be able to give you some assistance, but I am very reluctant to enter into questions of disputed fact which are for you to decide. See my role here is to be the judge of the law. I can tell you what the law is, in due course, and I can perhaps refer you to what evidence there is or is not about some of the factual matters that you’ve raised. It may even be that I can give you some directions with regard to some of the things that are referred to in this note. But for the moment we’re going to go on with the evidence and we will give this a little bit more thought a little later on.” 
        
       
      
    46 Following the conclusion of the evidence of the accused, the Crown case was re-opened by leave. Detective Temby was called and gave evidence of the location of a wallet containing money on the accused when he was arrested at the intersection of Conway Street and McClelland Lane, Lismore. He gave evidence that the money found on the accused was not money which had been provided to the undercover operative and of which the serial numbers had been kept. A copy of the transcript of the video search was provided to the jury. Following some preliminary remarks by his Honour, both counsel then addressed without any further discussion of the matters raised in the jury’s question. 
     
      
    47 Early in the address of the defence counsel, the following passage is recorded as setting out what he had said to the jury concerning what he described as three discrete actual handings over of a prohibited drug:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, it is not your immediate role to look into these three incidents, as it were, separately. Your function in the context of this indictment is to ask yourselves, are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the three took place – three or more, but in the context of this case – the three took place to satisfy one of the essential elements in the indictment. If, for example, you were only satisfied that one or two incidents of supply took place and it fell short of the three, well the necessary elements of this indictment would not have been made out. And I would ask you not to speculate in relation to any criminal proceedings that might stand outside this trial. I am only addressing you on the evidence in this trial brought forward pursuant to the indictment in this trial and I do sincerely ask you not to venture outside those parameters. So if, for example, you thought there might be one or two supplies but not three – never mind for the purpose of this trial any legal consequences of being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of only one or only two. To find the accused guilty for this indictment it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt that he supplied at least three times. That’s what we have to focus on and that’s what I’m endeavouring to focus my submissions, my address to you on and that’s what I urge you to focus on in your deliberations. Were there three or more, but in the context of this trial, were there three and were they on the days specifically stated in the evidence by undercover operative Julie.” 
        
       
      
    48 Later, counsel put to the jury:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, is it possible – this is a theory that I advance for your consideration – if you have some reasonable doubt about whether there was a supply on 16 September, which is one of the element – it’s one of the necessary elements in the context of this case, is it possible that, having got in twice on the 14th and 15th, they failed to clinch the necessary evidence on the 16th, and that is why the undercover people set up the operation on the 18th. The 18th was to be the clincher. The 18th was to be the day that they had him on tape with the surveillance, with the video trained on the front door of 42 Ballina Street. And the whole purpose of the 18th was to get the third supply because the 16th hadn’t happened. And the whole purpose of going to the relatively elaborate procedure of setting up a surveillance camera was because that was going to be the big day. 
        
       
       
        
        Now, true it is, that if a person supplied three times they commit the offence that the accused is indicted with if they supply four times, but to what purpose …” 
        
       
      
    49 Counsel then turned to addressing matters which he contended showed a weakness in the evidence of the supply on 16 September, in particular, the absence of video evidence, supporting his assertion that that evidence was weak by an assertion that the purpose of the undercover operative attending the applicant’s premises on 18 September was to obtain the evidence she had not obtained on 16 September. He concluded this aspect of these submissions this way:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the accused isn’t saying this. I’m submitting it to you as an interpretation of the evidence. The accused is saying he didn’t supply on any occasion. And when you consider the evidence of a witness, be it the accused or anyone else, you may accept all or part of the evidence of that witness. You may find some parts reliable, reject other parts. And because I have no way of knowing the course of your deliberations, ladies and gentlemen, I make these submissions based on an interpretation of the evidence, not based on the evidence of the accused. But getting back to this fundamental principle. The Crown on the totality of the evidence must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    50 As matters stood at the close of the evidence and prior to counsels’ addresses, the only practical issue was whether Julie was to be believed as to all three sales to the extent that the jury accepted her evidence in the teeth of the accused’s denials as establishing the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    51 Counsel, at this point, appeared to be raising matters asserted to go to the witness’ credibility on the third supply, so that her account, at least as to that supply, would not be accepted beyond reasonable doubt. The submission is also capable as being understood as reflecting on the witness’ credit generally. 
     
      
    52 Defence counsel’s address was interrupted by the evening adjournment, but prior to the court adjourning, in the absence of the jury, his Honour ascertained from defence counsel that at no stage was it suggested that there was an alibi or partial alibi in respect of any of the meetings alleged to have taken place between the accused and Julie. 
     
      
    53 The following morning, the trial judge again sought from defence counsel a succinct statement of the nature of his client’s defence. He was informed that the assertions that his client had met with Julie on 14, 15 and 16 September were total fabrications. It was at that point, referring to the matter that defence counsel had raised in his address, that the possibility of an alternative verdict was first raised. Defence counsel submitted that it should not be put to the jury “it should be all or nothing”. His Honour enquired why “when you yourself have raised that issue”. His Honour referred to there being a “statutory defence” to cover exactly that situation where the jury are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that three supplies took place but are satisfied that one or two did. 
     
      
    54 The Crown sought that such a direction be given, since the matter had been raised by defence counsel and particularly when the defence case was that the appellant hadn’t supplied anything. His Honour made it clear that if the alternative verdict was put to the jury he would make it clear that it was not the Crown’s essential position and was not the accused’s position, that it was just something that was put to them and raised by the defence as a possibility, although contrary to the accused’s own evidence. His Honour appears to have understood the submissions as referring, at least, to the possibility the jury would not relate the challenge to the witness’ credibility to more then the third supply. 
     
      
    55 The defence address then continued. The submission was put to the jury that the accused was saying he was framed, not once but three times; that he did not supply heroin to Julie on 14, 15 or 16 September; that these events were fictitious, they didn’t happen and they had been created; that for whatever reason before Julie went up and went to that front door on 14 September, they (the police) had decided to pick on him. 
     
      
    56 It was submitted to the jury that the case against the accused in respect of the supply on 16 September was weaker than the case on the other occasions, but that as to each and every one of the supplies, they were denied and that the jury should find there was a reasonable doubt in respect of each particular matter. In summary, it was said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “What I am submitting to you is that in a combined way they’re all so eager to say it was the accused, they’re all so vigilant to say ‘yes it’s the accused’, to identify the accused, that they’re jumping to conclusions, at best, and making up evidence at worst, because you can see by looking at the photographs just what sort of obscured view Officer Parmenter would have had. 
        
       
       
        
        And then to make matters worse, if Office Manitta is telling the truth, unless Parmenter could see through a house, it’s all quite impossible for Officer Parmenter to see that car at all, because it’s parked 20 to 30 metres up the street, which puts the undercover operative’s car 70 to 80 metres away from where Manitta was parked in an easterly direction in Ballina Street. So there he is, supposedly out in the open and no pictures and it’s not as if there weren’t police around on that day.” 
        
       
      
    57 Toward the conclusion of his address, counsel put the following to the jury:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, as I’ve indicated to you, you can accept all of what the accused has said, you can accept part of it, you can accept all of what Julie has said, you can accept part of it, you can accept all of what Temby or Miss Puckeridge or any of the witnesses has said, all or part, but that’s all part of the process which I alluded to earlier. At the end of the day, once the process reaches its climax, the essential question is are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to three acts of supply, to find the accused guilty in respect of this indictment? 
        
       
       
        
        I say this with the greatest respect to you, ladies and gentlemen, I am not privy to the way you will approach your deliberations, and I don’t know how long your deliberations will take, and if anything I have said to you has struck a resonance with you, then please keep it with you in the course of discussion amongst yourselves. And if you think of something yourself that I haven’t even mentioned, in favour of the accused, please keep that with you in the course of your deliberations. I have no way of knowing whether you would find the incident of the 14th happened, or the 15th happened, or the 16th happened, but to be convicted on this indictment, subject to anything his Honour may say to you by way of directions of law, to be convicted of this indictment you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of 14, 15 and 16. For this indictment, as I’m holding up my copy to you, it has to be 14 and 15 and 16.” 
        
       
      
    58 He concluded his submissions referring to the questions raised in the note from the jury and expressing the hope that he had covered those things. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “But at the end of all your deliberations, subject to directions of law that his Honour will give you, are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were three supplies, 14, 15 and 16, the answer has to be ‘no’, and then the accused would be entitled to a verdict of not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    59 Other than as I have set out, at no point in his address did counsel make submissions as to the alternative verdict or seek any further ruling on it from the trial judge. He opposed the judge leaving it to the jury, but if it was to be left, at that point he was apparently content to have it put forward as a theoretical possibility, without particular elaboration, not advanced by either the prosecution or the defence. 
     
      
       
      The summing-up 
       
      
    60 Prior to commencing his summing up, the trial judge invited submissions on what directions should be given. Defence counsel submitted that no alibi direction should be given “because the accused, whilst he said he wasn’t there, he’s never asserted definitely where he [was]”. He made no further submission to the trial judge concerning the alternative verdict. 
     
      
    61 In his summing up, the trial judge directed the jury 
     
      
       
        
        “The real issue here is whether or not the crime, that is the three supplies of the drug heroin which are alleged did occur.” 
        
       
      
    62 That is, whether the accused, on all the three occasions charged, had supplied the drug. His Honour expressed it this way:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Put more simply, you have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on those dates the accused handed over heroin to the undercover operative using the pseudonym Julie and that he received money for doing so.” 
        
       
      
    63 He directed the jury that the three occasions charged and all three of them had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and that the accused’s defence is that there were no such occasions. In respect of the alternative count, his Honour directed the jury as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, there has been introduced into the case, by the submissions that have been made on behalf of the accused, the suggestion that if you were to accept for example that there was a supply on the 14th and another on the 15th, but not on the 16th, then the verdict you must return would be ‘not guilty’. That is not the entire story, because the fact is that if the jury were to come to that view, then there would be open to the jury an alternative, and that is a verdict that the accused was not guilty of the charge, but guilty of supplying the drug heroin for financial or material reward on each of 14 September 2000 and 15 September 2000. I will say a little bit more about that immediately before you retire to consider your verdict, indeed I will formulate a written direction which you can take into the jury room with you. 
        
       
       
        
        I must emphasis however that it is neither the case for the prosecution, nor is it the case for the accused, that on two only occasions did the accused supply the prohibited drug for payment. The prosecution case is quite clearly that ‘Julie’ obtained drugs from the accused on three separate occasions, 14, 15 an 16 September 2000. The case for the accused appears to be that not only did he not supply the drugs, he never even met the undercover agent ‘Julie’. His case is that these allegations are a complete and utter fabrication, that he did not meet her at the premises at 42 Ballina Street, Lismore on 14 and 15 September, nor did he go to her car when it was parked in front of the building in Ballina Street (the Bruxner Highway) on the 16th. That it is all totally untrue, what the prosecution alleges. The suggestion being that when he was interviewed he was not even shown the photograph of the undercover operative, but that, for some reason, he was shown a photograph of somebody else, somebody called ‘Dodi’ he thought. Those, as I understand it, are the positions taken by the respective sides. It is not a case where the accused is saying that he did have some association with ‘Julie’. It is not the case where he is saying that ‘Julie’ tried to get him to supply drugs and he would not. His defence is that nothing like that happened, that at no time, as I understand it, did he ever speak to ‘Julie’ or knowingly speak to ‘Julie’ over the telephone and that he simply had nothing to do with her. The accused has said that with regard to some of those occasions, that he does not remember those occasions, but if they did take place, then he certainly never discussed drugs with her.” 
        
       
      
    64 Later, in the summing up, his Honour particularly directed the jury’s attention to the evidence of the undercover operative having directed the jury that the evidence of KP should be scrutinised very carefully indeed by the jury and indicating to them that they might well think that her evidence was not such as they should accept unless it was corroborated by other evidence. In that regard, his Honour referred to the evidence of Julie and then turned to what he saw as the essence of the Crown case. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “But the prosecution case stands or falls on whether, at the end of the day, you are satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Julie told the truth and that what she said about the accused supplying that drug on those three days was true. If you accept that view beyond reasonable doubt, the appropriate verdict would be guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused, the appropriate verdict would be not guilty. I would suggest to you that since it is the same witness, the credibility of the same witness as regards each of the three alleged supplies, that you might find it very hard to come to a view that on some of these occasions heroin was supplied, but on others it was not. I have told you that there is an alternative verdict, only because it was raised by the defence. This scenario which is neither the case for the accused, nor the case for the Crown, that you could be satisfied that there were two supplies, but not three. 
        
       
       
        
        I cannot, to be frank with you, see any proper basis for you coming to that view of the facts, but it is a matter for you. I am not suggesting you cannot do it, but I would suggest that it is very, very hard to see any logical reason why you would. That you either believe ‘Julie’ absolutely as to what she said, that is, believe her beyond reasonable doubt, or you do not. If you do, then the appropriate verdict would be guilty. If you do not, the appropriate verdict would be not guilty. I would suggest to you that you will not fiddle around with the alternative verdict.” 
        
       
      
    65 His Honour also directed the jury;- 
     
      
       
        
        You must accept the directions of law which I have given you. The whole case you might think, gets down to a simple – more or less a simple proposition, although you may have to work your way through a fair bit of evidence – but at the end of the day, I simple terms, are you satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that ‘Julie’s’ version of how she was supplied with those drugs by the accused, is true. If the answer to that is ‘yes’, I suggest that the verdict must be guilty and if there is any reasonable doubt the verdict must be not guilty. The verdict must be the verdict of all 12 jurors.” 
        
       
      
    66 His Honour sought counsel’s assistance as to whether there should be any re-directions. Defence counsel said that he was concerned about the direction on the alternative verdict. The following passage occurred:- 
     
      
       
        
        “SEGAL: The directions in relation to the alternative verdicts. With respect your Honour, the jury is entitled to be given assistance as to how they might deal with alternate verdicts, because in effect it becomes consideration of three different counts and they would then need to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, in respect of each particular count and one couldn’t have a jury agreeing on two counts -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR; Why do you want that direction? 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: Unless they were the same two counts for example.” 
        
       
      
    67 It appears that here counsel was not referring to s.25A(3) which provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If, on the trial of a person for an offence under this section, more than three occasions of supplying a prohibited drug are relied on as evidence of commission of the offence, all the members of the jury must be satisfied as to the same three occasions in order to find the person guilty of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    68 He was referring to the necessity for the jury to be unanimous on each alternative verdict, as to each supply alleged, if the jury were minded to find any alternative verdict. 
     
      
    69 The trial judge then said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Why do you want the jury – why do you want that direction. Why would you want that direction when what I have suggested to the jury is a straight out contest between what are fact – the respective cases for the parties, that is, believe ‘Julie’ beyond reasonable doubt, guilty, don’t, not guilty. Why would you want a situation where the jury is not satisfied of one, but then your client gets convicted of the other two. Now why would you want that situation, I would think it would be totally adverse to your own client’s interests. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: A jury would be entitled, if they found a reasonable doubt as to one count, based on the credibility of ‘Julie’. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: And that’s all you need to have an acquittal, a straight out acquittal. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: They’d be entitled to take that doubt into account in considering either of the other two matters, in considering her credibility. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I virtually said that, that it is – her credibility is the critical thing and I can’t see any logical basis for them finding him guilty on two, but not on the third. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: If they thought he had set him up on the 16th, that adverse finding of credit should flow through to their deliberations in respect of the 14th and the 15th. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR; That is not – no, no, it’s totally academic anyway I think, on reflection about the whole thing. I mean it’s something – I frankly don’t know why you raised it in the first place. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: Well I saw it as a flaw in the sum of the prosecution evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well it was a flaw which would entitle your client – if they had any reasonable doubt about the whole three or at least about any one of the three, he would have been entitled to an outright acquittal. But in the present state of things what you are asking me to do is to give the jury a direction which is neither in accordance with the evidence of the witness ‘Julie’, nor in accordance with your own client’s case, with the result – the possible result that if the jury had a reasonable doubt about the third occasions on the 16th then on the direction that I have given them, he will get an outright acquittal. On the direction that you are asking me to give the jury, he is in danger of being convicted of two counts. Now why on earth would you want that. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: Well you Honour has not said that if they find a reasonable doubt as to her – in relation to one incident, that may be taken into account in their consideration of her credibility in the other incidents. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I told them that I can see no scenario in which they could logically come to that view. I have directed the jury that if the witness is found to be untruthful in one respect, then they are entitled to question the reliability of her evidence in other respects. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: Your Honour it’s a situation that’s arisen in -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What it – about all that it might do is introduce a compromise. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: Well subsection (4) of s.25A creates this possibility for alternate verdicts. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I am not going to change the direction that I gave and I cannot understand why you persist in trying to persuade me to do something which will lead to your client being convicted – or could lead to your client getting convicted of two offences of supplying a drug and that in a situation, where as things are, if the jury have a reasonable doubt about one, he gets acquitted, full stop. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: Your Honour, I don’t wish the accused to be convicted of anything, but if he’s convicted of 25A, carries a penalty of 20 years, if he is convicted of those other two, they’re less than the small amount, which prosecuted, otherwise would be done in the Local Court and there’s even Criminal Procedure Act, s.36 back-up charges of summary supply sitting in the Local Court as part of the earlier procedures in the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No, in my opinion all that it is likely to do is either have your client convicted of two offences, for which he would have to be sentenced and spend time in prison before the Court of Criminal Appeal could hear the matter, because the Court of Criminal Appeal does not grant pail (sic) pending appeal except in the most exceptional circumstances, when he can get a straight out acquittal. The other side of it is that the proposition that had been put up is, in effect, like – the only thing is, it could have the mischievous effect of having the jury seize upon a compromise in the jury room. No, I will not alter that.” 
        
       
      
    70 Defence counsel appeared to be seeking a direction or mounting an argument to be put to the jury that if the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of any one or more of the supplies they must acquit of the ongoing supply charge, must acquit of the alternative verdict on the supply on which they held a doubt and should carry that doubt forward to their consideration of the remaining alternative verdicts. The submission seemed to accept that a doubt as to one supply meant a doubt as to all, ie., “all or nothing”. 
     
      
    71 The Crown Prosecutor submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Thank you and your Honour in relation to the alternative verdict, if it is still the wish of the defence that that be – that the jury be reminded of that, I mean on reflection if I’d thought about this a bit more, I would not have suggested to your Honour that it was appropriate to give, indeed I think submit – the circumstances of this case, it’s not appropriate. For the reasons that your Honour has raised with my learned friend. I suggested that your Honour should give the jury the alternative, because it had been raised and therefore the Crown could be disadvantaged. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I have told the what the -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I appreciate that you have and --  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ll tell them what it is. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well there’s no need for in my submission, because your Honour has already told them that they have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to each of the supplies on the 14th, 15th and 16th and unless they are so satisfied, they cannot find him guilty of either one or two of those three. There’s no need for your Honour to say any more – indeed the less said about it, with great respect, the better. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But are you saying I should give them that direction. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: You Honour has given it already. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes and you are saying I should not say -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well I think the less said about the alternative verdict now the better, because your Honour was really forced into a corner to give it, given the submissions that were made to the jury and your Honour will recall that my learned friend was submitting to the jury, waving the indictment saying ‘you can’t find him guilty on this indictment of this charge, unless you’re satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt as to each and every one of them’ and then he put the theory. My theory is, there were two supplies then not one on 16th, the 18th came unstuck. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It could have been. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: And so that’s why it works a disadvantage to the Crown that if there’s somebody on the jury, for some reason that accepted that argument that they might have followed it. The problem is your Honour at the end of the day if the jury come back and say, ‘guilty of two actual supplies’, well the verdict’s not going to stand. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well, it’s no good for anybody. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No good for anybody, no good for the Crown it’s not good -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The accused, despite the fact that I regard it as an inconsistent verdict, I do not have the power to not sentence him. I have to sentence him, so he would be sentenced and supplying heroin on two occasions, that is prison material of course. They way I have put it, it is to his advantage. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Indeed your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Except if he wants a compromise verdict. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: In my submission your Honour should just withdraw it from the jury tomorrow, because this is creating a situation, the making of my friend that will possibly have the potential of creating a verdict that is unsustainable and which will result in a new trial and this is, as your Honour has correctly with respect, said to the jury, a case that either they accept the Crown case or they don’t and to accept the Crown case they need to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, as to the three supplies. Now if they’re not satisfied -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: And in turn that means they have got to believe ‘Julie’. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: And all – of course – all the other evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: As corroborated in other aspects. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: They have to accept the Crown case which is built around ‘Julie’. I don’t necessarily join with your Honour’s description that the case stands or falls on her evidence, obviously she’s a very important witness. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: If they do not accept her – but – all of the other evidence supports her. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Correct your Honour. I would ask your Honour to give it some thought overnight and perhaps hear us again in the morning. It’s a quarter past five your Honour and the mind is not working as clearly as it perhaps should or could.” 
        
       
      
    72 The following morning, Mr. Segal submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, the defence didn’t ask for the alternate verdicts to be left with the jury and I would apply to your Honour to withdraw that direction.”  
        
       
      
    73 Thus, at this point, a direction had been given by the trial judge, of his own motion, opposed by the defence but supported by the Crown, provoked by observations of defence counsel which were ambiguous, and which it was now sought by both parties should be withdrawn. Up to this point, the only prejudice to the accused was that to which his Honour had referred, ie., a possible liability to be convicted of other offences rather than acquitted outright of the offence charged. No-one suggested the alternative verdict was not legally available or could not be left as having been raised too late or that the accused might not have been able to deal with the issues raised by it without unfairness. 
     
      
    74 However, later, Mr. Segal submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        ‘It must be something we missed your Honour. Can I just, with earnest and respect for your Honour, that you protect the accused’s position with the withdrawal of the alternate verdict direction, seek that the trial be discontinued and the jury be discharged because of the -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: For what reasons.  
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: -- irredeemable prejudice by reason of such directions as your Honour’s having given, been given and withdrawn. Your Honour would appreciate I do this to protect the position of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I would have though it was to his advantage, but that will go down on the transcript.” 
        
       
      
    75 No particular reference was made to any particular prejudice said to be occasioned by the giving and withdrawal of the direction. 
     
      
    76 Following that exchange, his Honour gave the jury the following directions:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I have been asked to correct a couple of things, but before I do that I can tell you that and direct you that the only two verdicts open to you are ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’. Forget all about any question of alternative verdicts. There is no rational basis upon which an alternative verdict could be found, therefore I am withdrawing that possibility from you and the verdict simply has to be one of two: ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’.” 
        
       
       
      The application for re-directions 
       
      
    77 After the jury retired to consider its verdict, Mr. Segal raised the matter again, seeking a re-direction as to his Honour’s observation that “there is no rational basis” upon which the jury could have found an alternative verdict. He said, “That’s what I seek to be re-directed”. He submitted that there was a rational basis for an alternative verdict but the trial judge declined to give the jury any further direction. He said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “SEGAL: That there’s no rational basis upon which they could’ve found an alternative verdict. That’s what I seek to be re-directed. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I told you exactly that. 
        
       
       
        
        SEGAL: The defence is submitting that there is a rational basis for it. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well noted, but I don’t propose to give the jury any such direction. It is really something that in my view would’ve been much better not brought into the case at all, where the case is that he had no dealings – his case is he had no dealings whatever with the undercover police officer and you’re asking the jury to consider that other situation. The battle lines are clearly drawn in the case and the matter for decision is equally clear and that is, are the jury satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that on the three occasions specified, the accused supplied the undercover again, using the name Julie, with heroin, for financial reward. And that’s it, I don’t propose to change my directions Mr. Segal.” 
        
       
      
    78 Although it is difficult to be sure about this, it seems counsel’s complaint was about the terms of the direction withdrawing the alternative verdict from the jury, not that verdict being withdrawn from their consideration. The assertion was that the jury should be told that there was a rational basis for the alternative verdict and it does not appear that counsel also sought that the alternative verdict be left. Such a direction would have been illogical. Perhaps what was sought was that the jury be directed that they were to ignore the statement that there was no rational basis for the verdict. Such a direction would present its own problems. In any event, the prospect of the alternative verdict in his Honour’s view should the jury have acted in accordance with the directions given to them in the summing up, was nil. That is to say, the jury either accepted beyond reasonable doubt the whole of Julie’s evidence as to the three supplies, or acquitted the accused. 
     
      
    79 Prior to his Honour seeking re-directions, his Honour had reiterated to the jury that the defence suggestion was that the Crown case was completely fabricated from start to finish and that there was nothing, no dealing whatever, between Julie and the accused. No further application for discharge was made in consequence of the judge’s reference to the lack of a rational basis for the alternative verdict. Nor did counsel seek that the prospect of finding an alternative verdict be left to the jury merely that there be a re-direction on whether there was no “rational basis” Counsel was not seeking the alternative verdict be available. He was seeking that his argument that the evidence of one or more supplies might be seen as weaker than that of the others and hence if there was a reasonable doubt of one, that applied to all. 
     
      
    80 It was in that context that the appeal was brought. 
     
      
       
       
      Appeal arguments 
       
      
    81 Two submissions were put on appeal. The first concerned the reference to “no rational basis”. 
     
      
    82 The significance for the ground of appeal concerning alternative verdicts of what went on in totality is, so it is submitted now, on appeal, that the jury would have understood from the previous day’s direction as to the availability of alternative verdicts, that they could have returned alternative verdicts if they were satisfied of one or two supplies but not of all, so that a lack of credit on one or two supplies would not have produced a complete acquittal. It was submitted that the later direction that there was no rational basis to found such an alternative verdict in that context could have been understood by the jury as an indication from the judge that the jury should accept the whole of the evidence unless they were minded to wholly reject it, so that they could reach a verdict of guilty by being satisfied that the appellant had carried out some, though not necessarily all, of the supplies and could only acquit if not satisfied that he had carried out any of them. I do not accept that what was said would have been so understood by the jury. 
     
      
    83 In my view, the introduction of the possibility of the alternative verdict into the case is to be regretted and reference to the lack of a rational basis for it was unfortunate, but again and again throughout the summing up, his Honour clearly directs the jury that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt all three of the supples alleged by the Crown, and for that purpose the case was entirely dependent on the evidence of the undercover operative, albeit, she was in respect of some matters to some extent, corroborated, particularly in relation to the sale on 14 September. 
     
      
    84 Counsels’ addresses were, except as I have set out, to the same effect. In this context, the jury had also been told a number of times that they could accept or reject all or part of Julie’s evidence. Rejection of any supply necessarily meant outright acquittal. So far as I can see, defence counsel never sought or supported the availability of the alternative verdict.  
     
      
    85 Although, as I have said, I found the entire discussion between counsel and his Honour concerning the alternative direction confusing, when I consider what was put to the jury in the whole of the summing up and addresses, I am unable to detect any legal error or prejudice to the accused arising from the reference to it or from the terms of the judge’s withdrawal of it from the jury’s consideration. I do not consider that there should have been any further discussion or elaboration on what the trial judge had said to the jury when withdrawing the prospect of the alternative verdict as anything further said was liable to produce confusion. 
     
      
    86 Further, I do not see there was any practical necessity for the alternative verdict or to further discuss with the jury the terms that the judge had used in withdrawing it, since I do not accept that, as it was submitted, the evidence of the incident of 16 September or any one of the supplies was substantially weaker than that of the others. I see no reason why the jury might have considered the credibility of Julie differed from occasion to occasion, although I accept the corroborating evidence differed. But such evidence as the jury accepted of any particular supply would inevitably have bolstered Julie’s credit generally and thus reflected upon the strength of the evidence of any other supply just as any doubt they may have had as to the reliability and truthfulness of her account as to any one supply would have undermined the reliability of the whole of her evidence. 
     
      
    87 In conclusion, I do not see any risk of a miscarriage arising from the alternative verdict being left or withdrawn nor that the refusal of the application for discharge, made as and when it was, occasions any disquiet. 
     
      
    88 In my view, there was a powerful, if not overwhelming, Crown case. Even though I consider the alternative verdict would have been better not left and the choice of words used in withdrawing it was unfortunate, I consider that there was no fundamental flaw in the trial, that the appellant lost no chance of an acquittal and that there was no risk of miscarriage arising from the terms used by his Honour when referring to the basis for the alternative verdict being withdrawn. 
     
      
    89 I conclude that the appeal against conviction must be dismissed. 
     
      
    90 I turn now to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    91 His Honour, the learned trial judge, found in the appellant’s favour that he was himself addicted to the drug, being a single man, aged 35 with a limited prior criminal history with entries for minor dishonesty matters and possession of cannabis, who had not previously, except for a period of some 100 or so days been subjected to a substantial sentence of imprisonment for 118 in Queensland being subjected to a period of substantial imprisonment. 
     
      
    92 His Honour had regard to the applicant’s hospitalisation for serious medical conditions and, in particular, to the injury to his arm which had left him, in his view, vulnerable so that he had requested that he be confined on protection. 
     
      
    93 Trial counsel had specifically raised with his Honour that injury and his gaol regime contending “he doesn’t get into the sun or the library or the gym, has a limited access to education and can’t paint. He is an artist.”. 
     
      
    94 It was specifically put to the trial judge that special circumstances should be found in those circumstances and the non-parole period thereby shortened from that provided for by s.44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in the absence of finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    95 The ground of appeal in respect of the application for leave to appeal against sentence asserted that “the penalty is too severe and some other sentence is warranted”. Reference was made to the small amount of the drug and the limited value of the payment for it. In the context particularly of the applicant’s prior record, however, I am unable to see that the sentence is in error. The written submissions focused on the length of the non-parole period and his Honour’s asserted error in failing to find special circumstances. In particular, reference was made to the appellant serving part of his sentence in protection and to his Honour having failed to find special circumstances. 
     
      
    96 On the hearing of the appeal, by consent, the affidavit of Janet Elizabeth Bremner, solicitor, of 27 October 2003 was read as to the circumstances of the appellant’s confinement. That, because, there was before the trial judge a paucity of evidence as to the actual circumstances of that confinement but assertions made without evidentiary support as to it from the Bar table. 
     
      
    97 It was conceded by senior counsel for the appellant in the light of the whole of the material, and particularly a memorandum annexed to the affidavit of Janet Bremner that it could not be said that the applicant was significantly disadvantaged. The circumstances of his confinement included that he might associate with other inmates within a protected area, have access to services and programmes, had extended periods of time out of cells each day, have access to activities on a daily basis or as starting levels permit, and is not deprived of access to employment, educational courses, counselling or other facilities, albeit, there is some limited availability of appropriate employment. 
     
      
    98 The memorandum informed the court that his classification within the system would not be affected by his status. That information was not challenged before us. In regard to this submission, I should note that in a series of recent decisions referred to in Regina v. Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207, this court has emphasised the necessity for evidence to establish not only that a person might be confined in some specially designated custody, but to establish the circumstances of that custody and whether it really is or is not disadvantageous. Custody which is more onerous will be taken into account to determine the length of the sentence to be imposed and in determining whether there are special circumstances but that matter must be properly established. 
     
      
    99 In this case, it is clear that the trial judge had reference to that matter and to the other matters to which our attention has been drawn, both with reference to the length of the head sentence and also with reference to his considerations of whether or not he should find special circumstances. The categorising of those matters as special circumstances, however, was plainly a matter for him in the exercise of his discretion. Given that the submissions put below concerning disadvantageous circumstances could not be sustained on the evidence now before us and, having regard to the ambit of the discretion vested in the trial judge to decide whether a matter should in an individual case be categorised as special circumstances, a discretion which I am not persuaded here, miscarried. I see no basis upon which the appeal against sentence might succeed. 
     
      
    100 In my view, since there has been full argument, leave should be granted but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    101 HOWIE, J: I agree with the orders proposed by Greg James, J. and generally with his Honours reasons.

     REGINA v PETER WILLIAM SWAIN 
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: The appellant was convicted upon a single count of aggravated breaking entering and stealing after a trial at Sydney District Court before Dodd DCJ and a jury. The circumstance of aggravation was that the appellant was in company of Ashleigh C, a juvenile, when the offence occurred. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non parole period of two years. The latter will expire on 9 February 2005.  
     
      
    3 Five grounds of appeal against conviction are advanced, ground 4 originally containing two parts, the first of which is not now pressed.  
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      
    4 At 1.33 am on Saturday 2 March 2002 an intruder alarm was activated at Newtown Public School. It was a silent alarm activated by heat and motion. In response to the alarm a security officer, Mr Zylstra arrived to investigate at about 1.37 am. The school was surrounded by a 7 foot high wire mesh fence. All the gates were shut and padlocked and Mr Zylstra unlocked one and entered. 
     
      
    5 The exact sequence of events and observations thereafter was the subject of contest but Mr Zylstra positioned himself on the landing of a stairway and upon an observation of the appellant and Ashleigh, called upon them to halt. The appellant ran up the stairs and the security officer gave chase. The appellant jumped over a railing to the ground causing himself injury. He was unable to mobilise himself, and he was removed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital at Camperdown. 
     
      
    6 On arrival at the school police officers examined a black bag and an orange box on the stairs which were found to contain computer equipment, the property of the school. Inspection revealed an open door to a classroom above which was a window operated by a winding mechanism, part of which was a steel rod. The window was found open and the steel rod was damaged. 
     
      
    7 Two days later, the appellant who had discharged himself from hospital, attended Newtown Police Station where he was interviewed and he gave a version of events. He said that at about 1 am he received a call on his mobile phone from a distraught Ashleigh who asked him to come to her at the school. Past experience persuaded him to go to her for the purpose, in effect, of ensuring her safety. Among other things, he denied that he, at any time, picked up the box later found to contain the computer equipment and said that he had tripped over it when he ran because he believed the security guard was about to attack him with a torch. 
     
      
    8 I shall refer to these and other facts, and disputes concerning them, when dealing with the individual grounds.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
      GROUND 1 – REFUSAL TO DIRECT A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY 
       
      
    9 At the close of the Crown case counsel for the appellant applied for a directed verdict of acquittal on the ground that there was “no case” in relation to the necessary element of breaking pleaded in the indictment. The submission included  
     
      
       
        
        “taken at its highest, the Crown case is so weak in relation to the element of break that there is not sufficient evidence at this stage to satisfy a jury beyond reasonable doubt of the element of break”. 
        
       
       
      The question was, of course, whether the evidence even if inherently tenuous, weak or vague, was capable of supporting a verdict of guilty:  
      Doney v The Queen 
       1990 171 CLR 207. 
       
      
    10 There was evidence from the teacher concerned with the particular classroom that he had a daily routine of checking the locks and windows. Examination of the window found open showed the rod damaged by bending. The school was alarmed and a detective gave evidence that there would not have been access to the classroom between lockup and 1.33 am, otherwise obviously the alarm would have been triggered by the earlier entry. It is true that the school had staff or contracted cleaners but in the absence of any evidence of their presence during the relevant period it was not incumbent on the Crown to exclude the speculative possibility that they entered the room (either having disarmed the alarm or somehow entering without setting it off) and departed, leaving open access to the classroom and, if they had in fact disarmed the alarm, resetting it.  
     
      
    11 The Crown relied upon a joint enterprise between the appellant and Ashleigh and the jury were entitled to observe the evidence of the damaged window rod, the open door and window, the routine for securing the room and the circumstance that the appellant had said he had received the phone call at about 1 am and the alarm was triggered at 1.33 am and that in fact both the appellant and Ashleigh were on the premises at 1.37 am when the Mr Zylstra arrived. 
     
      
    12 The evidence would enable a jury to find the element of breaking had been proved by the Crown. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 3 – DIRECTIONS BY THE TRIAL JUDGE ABOUT LIES TOLD BY THE APPELLANT AND AN ASSOCIATED REFUSAL TO DISCHARGE THE JURY 
       
      
    13 The appellant gave evidence at trial. He admitted that he had told two lies when interviewed by police, they being that he did not pick up the box (later found to contain computer equipment) and that he had tripped over it. In his charge to the jury, the learned trial judge correctly identified these lies but directed them that telling police that he had tripped over the box was not of any material significance to the offence charged and that they should not concern themselves with it. 
     
      
    14 The explanation by the appellant for lying to the police about touching the box was that he thought, if police had information that he touched the box, he might be charged with something he had not done.  
     
      
    15 The submission is that the trial miscarried as a result of the basis upon which the question of the appellant’s lies had been put to the jury and, second, that the appellant lied because “he was caught red-handed and he knew that” was put to the jury for the first time by the judge after the evidence and addresses were concluded. 
     
      
    16 The transcript shows that there was considerable exchange between the bench and bar on the subject of directions about lies before the jury was charged. Discussion revolved around direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen 1997 178 CLR 193 and in accordance with that suggested in Zoneff v The Queen 2000 200 CLR 234. 
     
      
    17 In the event, his Honour gave an Edwards direction. It was not suggested that what the jury were told did not comply with that authority, however after the jury retired and while debate was continuing about aspects of his Honour’s charge, a note was received from them asking for repetition of directions concerning lies. The second part of the appellant’s argument relates to the response to this note. 
     
      
    18 The learned trial judge did raise the question of proposed direction and did ask counsel for the appellant whether he wanted the Edwards direction or not, but the enquiry followed some expressed inconclusiveness about what his Honour thought had been argued to the jury. The transcript shows that the Crown argument to the jury relied upon the lies told by the appellant as evidence of his guilt. Among other things the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “……. He told lies to the police that evening because he wanted to put his best foot forward so as not to incriminate himself any further …….” 
        
       
      
    19 Criticism of the basis of his Honour’s response to application to discharge the jury when he said “….. if the choice is between discharge and Edwards direction I will give the Edwards direction” becomes irrelevant when it is concluded that there was no error in electing to give the particular direction. 
     
      
    20 In further directing the jury after receiving the note, his Honour said in summarizing the prosecution contention: 
     
      
       
        
        “….. the Crown says, well, the situation was that he was caught red-handed taking the computer equipment away in the box and he knew that and that is why he told the lie.” 
        
       
      
    21 It is argued that the Crown made no such submission. Those words do not appear recorded but what was said is not an unfair summary of the Crown case on the issue. The passage earlier set out is to that effect and although “red-handed” may not appear in it, it is noteworthy that there was evidence from the appellant via his police interview that his mother had told him that one police officer had said he was “caught” with a box in his hand.  
     
      
    22 The final submission on this ground is that the trial miscarried as a result of the confusion which arose over the basis upon which the question of the appellant’s lies should be put to the jury. As mentioned in a written submission, counsel addressed as to what his Honour should say about lies at some length and a number of options were canvassed. However, the issue is whether the jury were, in the event, given wrong or confusing directions. In my view they were not. Ground 3 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 4(b) – PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT BY MR ZYLSTRA 
       
      
    23 The inconsistent statements relied upon are identified as a record in a policeman’s notebook that, at the scene, Mr Zylstra spoke of seeing two people inside the classroom and waiting for them to emerge in contrast with his testimony that he had no recollection by the time of trial of seeing a female in the classroom but he did have a clear recollection of seeing one man only in the room. 
     
      
    24 Counsel at trial advanced an argument inviting the jury in terms “do you reckon there’s only two” apparently based upon a statement by the appellant to police that he (unaided) could not “move all that gear”. His Honour remarked that he did not understand the argument. The presence of an offender in addition to the appellant and Ashleigh is entirely speculative. Counsel’s hypothesis was not supported by evidence from the appellant about the presence of a third person.  
     
      
    25 The credibility of Mr Zylstra was obviously important as he testified that he saw the appellant carrying a box. Reference is made to his inconsistent statement above described but the matter scarcely needed emphasis or special direction in the light of argument by counsel to the jury which included: 
     
      
       
        
        “and we know the point where he (Mr Zylstra) sees the male inside the classroom is apparently the point where he sees two people inside the classroom. Genuine but mistaken, things are what they appear to be, things are what the (sic) appear to be”. (T206). 
        
       
      
    26 What the jury accepted Mr Zylstra as having seen was a matter for them to determine in weighing all the evidence including evidence of lighting conditions, time during which observations could be made, tensions arising out of the mere fact that he was there in response to intruder alarms and the like. I detect no unfairness in the way the issue was left to the jury for determination nor am I persuaded that some further direction was required and certainly not, I am moved to comment, in terms suggested by counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour should finally – and this is my last submission - clearly indicate to the jury that if the jury comes to a view that you have taken a view in terms of certain facts, they’re entitled to reject that view as to the facts”. (SU 56). 
        
       
       
      GROUNDS 2 and 5 – DIRECTIONS ON BREAKING AND JOINT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE 
       
      
    27 These grounds were argued together and it is convenient so to deal with them. Early in his charge to the jury his Honour reminded them that the way the trial had been conducted did not involve dispute about the appellant being, for a time, physically in the presence of Ashleigh, but what was in dispute was whether he was with her for the purpose of gaining entry to the premises to steal property. There is no complaint about this direction nor of his Honour’s directions as to the concept of breaking. 
     
      
    28 During their deliberations a note was sent by the jury saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, we are having trouble coming to a unanimous decision. The issue of division involves doubt over the presence of the defendant in the classroom – that he committed a break and enter”. 
        
       
      
    29 The jury were brought back into court and his Honour expressed some doubt about his precise understanding of the difficulty being encountered and he invited further enquiry if need be, however he gave further instructions which included: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown does not rely ultimately upon a finding by you that the accused actually himself broke and entered the classroom. The Crown relies upon what is referred to as a joint criminal enterprise alleged to have been entered into between Ashleigh (surname) and the accused and the Crown says that if you find beyond reasonable doubt that either of them or, in particular for instance, Ashleigh (surname) broke and entered that classroom and that the presence of the accused at the school with her, was for the purpose of stealing the equipment referred to in the charge, then, having found those matters to be made out beyond reasonable doubt you would be entitled to find the accused guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand, if you were not so satisfied of any of those matters beyond reasonable doubt and otherwise were not satisfied of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, then you should find him not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    30 His Honour then proceeded to elaborate upon the concept of liability for participation in joint criminal enterprise. In the course of this he gave an illustration of three offenders in a motorcar, one of whom remains in it with the engine running to facilitate departure, one breaks a glass door panel and opens the door latch but does not enter and the third who enters the house and brings out the loot. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Only one of them broke into the house, that is the person who broke the glass panel and put his hand inside to unlock the latch”. 
        
       
       
      He referred to the participation of the others and concluded his illustration 
       
       
        
        “all three in that situation would be guilty of the offence of break, enter and steal.” 
        
       
      
    31 On resumption by the jury of their deliberation, counsel sought redirection concerning the instant case on the ground that his Honour had not directed the jury that the agreed crime was breaking entering and stealing as distinct from the crime of stealing.  
     
      
    32 His Honour’s statement that “the presence of the accused at the school with her was for the purpose of stealing the equipment” was incorrect in the light of the sole count of the indictment charging breaking entering and stealing. Counsel’s application for supplementary direction should have been acceded to. Although the point raised should be decided in favour of the appellant it is apt to consider whether the appeal should nevertheless be dismissed because no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
     
      
    33 As was acknowledged by counsel opening the argument on appeal, on one view it might be said that the appellant was caught red-handed in the commission of the offence. Objectively he attempted to flee from the scene and the security guard and his explanation was a matter for the jury to assess. Whilst attention must remain focussed on the onus of proof, there were significant matters concerning the appellant’s explanation for being at the scene. As noted, the alarm activated at 1.33 am and the appellant was on the scene at 1.37 am when Mr Zylstra arrived. The appellant claimed that he came to the scene in response to a phone call to his mobile phone some time after 1 am from Ashleigh. A witness from Telstra Corporation gave evidence that the records showed no call received on the appellant’s mobile service from any other mobile phone between midnight to 2 am. There was recorded a call to his mobile phone from a landline at Beecroft at 1.05 am. The appellant in evidence denied acquaintance with the subscriber to the Beecroft telephone service. It was for the jury to assess any possibility of faulty recording by the telephone service provider. It is true that a statement by the appellant’s mother (too ill to give evidence in person) deposed to hearing a mobile phone call being received and the appellant leaving shortly thereafter but there was no explanation as to why she would not have heard two phone calls if indeed Ashleigh had made a call as asserted by the appellant in addition to the call corroborated by Telstra records. 
     
      
    34 As was at least tacitly acknowledged, it was a strong Crown case and the question arises then how significant was his Honour’s error. Counsel appearing for the appellant had made it plain to the jury in his address that there were two “fundamental” issues on which he relied, which were described by him as first, technical and second, mental issues. The former challenged the Crown’s proof of the essential element of breaking whilst the latter raised the appellant’s alleged innocent purpose for being at the scene. In summing up the elements of the offence his Honour defined breaking and, inter alia, said: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown must satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused Peter William Swain broke and entered the premises, the school. Break means forcibly gained access.” 
        
       
       
      Later he made reference to the two issues raised on behalf of the appellant and reminded them of the submission “that you would not be satisfied there was a break in the sense of a break and enter”. 
       
      
    35 The omission of reference to breaking in the passage of the charge to the jury which has been determined erroneous was immediately followed by the illustration of breaking entering and stealing above described. There was no suggestion that his Honour indicated to the jury that any of his previous directions on the element of breaking were withdrawn or somehow had become inoperative. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion assessment of the strength of the Crown case, the weakness of the defence and the significance of the error (see Wilde v The Queen 1988 164 CLR 356) lead to a conclusion that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
    37 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against severity of sentence. A factor noted by his Honour in his remarks was the grave ill health of the appellant’s mother who was present in court on the day sentence was pronounced (28 March 2003). An affidavit tendered to this court shows that she died on the night of 30 September/1 October 2003. The appellant is a young man born on 13 July 1981 and was the only child of his mother.  
     
      
    38 There were obstacles to leniency being granted to the appellant, principal among which were entries on his antecedent sheets. In 1997 and 1998 the appellant had been dealt with in Children’s Courts on four separate occasions for six offences of robbery in company, one offence of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon and for other offences. In 2001 he was sentenced to imprisonment at Central Local Court for breaking entering and stealing, receiving and stealing from a person. The longest sentence imposed was eighteen months with a non parole period of nine months. His release to parole date was specified as 2 August 2001 and therefore he was at liberty for less than nine months at the time of this offence (2 March 2002) and still subject to unexpired parole. 
     
      
    39 His Honour found special circumstances and adjusted the non parole period in favour of the appellant. 
     
      
    40 No error in the sentencing proceedings is identified. The attention of the Court was directed to the circumstances of the appellant’s enforced separation from his mother at the closure of her life. The anguish of the appellant can be recognized, however the power of this Court to intervene and vary sentence is prescribed by statute and authority and no applicable ground for so doing is demonstrated. The imposition was well within the range of sound discretionary exercise. 
     
      
    41 I would dismiss the appeal against conviction, grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss that appeal also. 
     
      
    42 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Justice Grove and generally with his Honour’s reasons.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: Since delivering judgment in this matter on 21 July 2003, it has been brought to our attention that there is an error in our recitation of one of the charges against the respondent, CJP. The charge set out at par 3(e) of the judgment should relate to the complainant GS, rather than ELP. It is appropriate that the judgment be amended by the application of the slip rule.  
     
      
    2 Accordingly, paragraph 3 (e) is now as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        (e) that between 14 November and 15 November 2000 at Macquarie Fields he did have sexual intercourse with GS without his consent and knowing that he was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, in circumstances of aggravation, to wit, that at the time of the offence the said GS was a person aged under the age of sixteen years, being in fact aged thirteen years of age; in each case contrary to the provisions of s61J of the Act. The maximum penalty for each at the time of its commission was imprisonment for twenty years.

     v Natalis Andre LEBLER 
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MEAGHER JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: Natalis Andre Lebler (the appellant) stood trial before Acting Judge Ducker and a jury at Lismore. He was charged on three counts under s61(I) of the Crimes Act 1900, all expressed in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... that he on 15 December 1999 at Nimbin in the State of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with Sarah Jane Cassandra Hill without her consent and knowing she was not consenting."" 
        
       
      
    3 Each act of sexual intercourse was said to have taken place in the appellant's car which was then parked in a remote area outside Nimbin. The first and third counts involved penile penetration. The second count was penetration by the tongue, that is, cunnilingus. 
     
      
    4 The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the first count, but guilty on counts 2 and 3. When sentencing Mr Lebler, Ducker ADCJ said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have been shown some drafts of proposed appeal in this matter. I, with respect, would have thought that the first suggested ground should be that the jury's verdicts were inconsistent and possibly indicative of compromise with each other. I can envisage some scenarios which, to my mind, could have given rise to the jury's verdicts but I do not propose to trespass into an area which will become the responsibility of the Court of Criminal Appeal to determine."" 
        
       
      
    5 His Honour issued a certificate under s5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that the case was ""a fit case for an appeal"". 
     
      
       
      The Notice of Appeal 
       
      
    6 The notice of appeal identified six grounds, five of which were pressed. Paraphrasing those grounds, they were: 
     
      
       
      1. That the verdicts with respect to counts 2 and 3 were unreasonable. 
       
       
      2. That his Honour should have told the jury that any doubts they had in respect of one count should be taken into account in assessing the evidence in respect of the other counts (the Markuleski direction). 
       
       
      4. That the Judge failed to comply with  
      Black v The Queen 
       (1993) 179 CLR 44. He put pressure upon the jury to reach a verdict. 
       
       
      5. That the Judge failed adequately to direct on the issue of recklessness. 
       
       
      6. That the Judge ""failed to direct that the appellant's denials were admissible on the same basis as the complainant's complaint"". 
       
      
    7 I will deal with each ground in turn. Before I do so, I should briefly describe the evidence called at trial. 
     
      
       
      The incident 
       
      
    8 Sarah Hill (the complainant) was a young woman aged 19 years. She lived at Purga in Queensland with her boyfriend, Shane Williams, and his mother. She had two children, a girl aged two years and a son aged six months. In December 1999 the children were in the care of her mother, Ms Suzanne Wallace. Ms Wallace lived at Bolton Point near Newcastle. Her mother's husband was a heroin addict. Having been drug free for a number of years, he relapsed in December 1999. The complainant's mother, therefore, asked her daughter, as a matter of some urgency, to pick up the children. Ms Hill, however, had no money to make the trip. 
     
      
    9 The complainant met the appellant in October or November 1999 at the house of a friend. In early December 1999, Mr Lebler telephoned her. He said that he had to go to Nimbin. He asked her whether she would like to go. She said she would not. A short time later, Ms Hill's mother telephoned her daughter again. She demanded that she pick up her children. Indeed, she threatened to punch her in the face if she failed to do so. Meanwhile, Mr Lebler telephoned Ms Hill once more. According to Ms Hill, he agreed to drive her to Newcastle after he had been to Nimbin (T4). Mr Lebler denied that suggestion. It was never his intention to drive beyond Nimbin. He intended, and understood the complainant intended, to have a ""dirty weekend"" at Nimbin (Exhibit G, ERISP, p22 Q185).  
     
      
    10 The arrangements to leave were made hurriedly. Ms Hill was not able to contact her boyfriend, Shane Williams. She left without saying that she was with the appellant. She did, however, tell her boyfriend's mother. 
     
      
    11 Mr Lebler made arrangements to meet a friend, Lenny, at a park in Nimbin. Lenny (Leonard Thomas Johnson) lived at Barkers Vale which was 20 kms outside Nimbin. Mr Lebler had stayed at Lenny's home on a number of occasions. He was usually accompanied by a woman. Mr Lebler intended to stay at Lenny's home that night with the complainant. 
     
      
    12 On the way to the park, Mr Lebler stopped at a hotel. He bought a four pack of Wild Turkey mixes in bottles. Whilst he was at the hotel, the complainant rang her boyfriend, Shane, from a phone booth. She told him she was with the appellant. She said she was going to ""visit her kids"". According to Mr Williams she sounded normal. 
     
      
    13 Mr Lebler and the complainant arrived at the park shortly after 10.00 pm. Lenny and his friend were at the park drinking and smoking drugs, including heroin. According to the complainant, Mr Lebler consumed a significant quantity of alcohol. She had some alcohol, although she said not much. She acknowledged that she regularly drank to excess. However, on that evening, she said she had very little, first, because she did not want to be drunk when she picked up her children, and secondly, because she did not want to drink out of the same bottle as others. 
     
      
    14 The group remained at the park a number of hours. The complainant said that she ""whinged"" that it was late and that she was cold. Accounts differed as to the circumstances in which the group broke up and left the park.  
     
      
    15 The complainant said that the appellant was drunk. She said he should not drive. On her account, he then became upset. They argued. Whilst they were arguing, Lenny and the other males drove off. 
     
      
    16 Mr Lebler, on the other hand, said that Lenny was too drunk to drive home. Mr Lebler was therefore left without a guide. Although he had been to Lenny's place before, he was not able to find it in the dark, alone. He therefore had nowhere to stay. So he drove off with the complainant. She had asked to drive, but she was too drunk. 
     
      
    17 A third account was provided by Lenny. He said that the appellant ""hassled"" him to leave the park and drive home. However, he wanted to stay. He then heard the appellant and the complainant arguing about who was going to drive. He saw them leave by car. He was not certain who was driving. 
     
      
    18 The accounts given by the appellant and the complainant markedly diverge after they left the park. She said that she wanted to go home. She asked Mr Lebler to take her to a phone box. On her account, he ignored her request. He then drove out of town. Because it was dark, she did not know where he was driving. She said he then acted in a way calculated to scare her to the point where she felt that her life was in jeopardy. He drove at high speed. It was a country road which twisted and turned. There was no lighting. He switched the car headlights on and off. The complainant said this: (T11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I was shitting myself. I thought we were going to hit a tree or something, was worried we were going to have a crash."" 
        
       
      
    19 She told the appellant to put the car headlights on. He responded by driving faster. On her account, Mr Lebler then began saying strange things, rapidly changing his mood, and ultimately banging his head on the steering wheel. Ms Hill said this: (T12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. ... He was saying all this really weird stuff to me ... he was yelling at me and saying stuff you know about God and about I'd sinned and it's hard to explain because he was in different moods all the time. I can't explain how he went from being really angry to really calm to laughing and at the same time he was telling me it was all my fault, about taking me up there to conceive a child with me, some fucking waterfalls, and I was going to die tonight, but it wasn't going to be by his hands and told me how dumb - when he told me how dumb I was and how he planned it. I just - I didn't know what to do. I just started crying because I felt dumb, because I felt dumb and I blamed Maria, I blamed myself for thinking about my kids. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say he talked about God. Did he say anything particular about God? 
         
        A. He told me God told him to do it to me because I had sinned. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did he say what you had sinned or how you had sinned? 
         
        A. He didn't say, he just kept saying because I'd sinned I was going to die tonight, but not by his hands and I was really scared. I didn't understand if I was going to die, how could I die if he wasn't going to touch me and some - he was laughing at me and he was banging his head on the steering wheel and he was talking nice and he kept telling me that you know, 'You don't like me, I'm ugly, you don't', you know and was telling me all - he just - 
        
       
       
        
        Q. How did you feel at this time? 
         
        A. I was crying and I didn't know what to do. I was crying. I was crying and crying and crying and looking at him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you say anything to him? 
         
        A. I asked what's wrong with him - I don't know why he did it. I just asked him ""Why?"". I asked him ""Why, what have I done so wrong?"" And he was just saying, ""Because you sinned"" and I didn't understand. He kept telling me I was going to die and he kept saying, ""Ivan, two go in and one come out"", and I didn't understand what he was talking about. I didn't understand why he was doing this to me. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't, I didn't sin, I didn't do anything wrong. I was so scared. I was so scared then and I was just so scared now. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I thought, I thought he was my friend. I really thought he was my friend."" 
        
       
      
    20 Ms Hill, on her account, then determined that to survive she had to give herself to the appellant. She said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Why did you lift your top up? 
         
        A. That's what he want. I know it was silly, I know I was stupid, but I actually, it wasn't silly or it wasn't stupid to me. I think it was very smart because that's what he wanted and  
        I thought if I give it to him 
         maybe he would be happy and maybe he think I do like him and maybe he wouldn't hurt me any more."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    21 The complainant explained what she meant by the words, ""if I give it to him"", as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A ... If I give it to him, if I give him my body then maybe he will leave me alone. He takes what he wants and he will be satisfied with his own fucking pig feelings, and then he will leave me alone. I thought maybe if he was satisfied and got the multiple orgasms that he was fucking asking for, he would leave me alone. That's why I give it to him, hoping that he wouldn't want anything else from me after that. I know I done the right thing. I know that if I would have tried to fight him, if he didn't kill me he would have hurt me really bad. I know for a fact if I didn't do what I done. You may think I was wrong for telling him all that. I'm glad to tell youse I told him I loved him and I lied to him about all that stuff, because that saved me. I feel dirty and I feel disgusting every day that I done that. I feel ashamed of myself, I have done that, but I had to do that."" 
        
       
      
    22 Ms Hill described what she did to persuade the appellant: (T13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I stopped crying and I turned around to him and I started trying to talk to him nicely, because I thought maybe he was just drunk or maybe he was just upset and I thought, if I be nice to him he would stop and I talked to him and he kept going on about, telling me that he was ugly and I didn't want him and saying, ""Shane was better than him"", and I told him, ""No, you're not ugly"". I told him, ""Shane's not better than you"". I tried to make him happy so he wouldn't hurt me. I just ... do it so it wouldn't happen and I put my - I put my arm - my arm around him, I put my arm around him and I told him that I loved him and he pushed me away and he said -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he say? 
         
        A. He pushed me away and he called me a lying little manipulating bitch."" 
        
       
      
    23 The complainant described what then happened in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. He pushed me away from him, he pushed me away from him and then I got worried and I grabbed again and I grabbed him even harder, because I was worried if he thought I was lying to him he would hurt me. I thought he was going to kill me. I didn't know what to do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say that you held him and you held your arms across your chest like you hugged him? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did he do back? 
         
        A. He put his arm back around me."" 
        
       
      
    24 The car was parked by the side of the road in a remote bushland area. She did not believe that she could outrun the appellant. Ms Hill said that she moved to his side of the car, lying on top of him. She began to remove her clothing. He assisted her in doing so. On her account, the behaviour which she found threatening nonetheless continued. She said this: (T15) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Where did he put his hands? 
         
        A. On my neck and my shoulders. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was he doing with his hands? 
         
        A. He was touching me softly and he was telling me how he'd love to hear my neck break in his hands and I didn't know what to do. 
        
       
      
     ..... 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Sarah I'm going to remind you that you just said to the Court, your evidence, you said that he told you that he'd like to hear your neck break in his hands? 
         
        A. He told me that so many times. He told me that so many times and I couldn't, I couldn't move, I was so scared. You wouldn't know how scared I was."" 
        
       
      
    25 The appellant bit Ms Hill on the side of the neck, a wound which was still visible when she was examined in hospital the next day. It was common ground, however, that sexual intercourse proceeded without violence. The appellant inserted his penis in her vagina. As he was about to ejaculate, she moved away (count 1). There was later an act of cunnilingus, his tongue entering her vagina (count 2). Later still, he again inserted his penis in her vagina. On this occasion he ejaculated inside her (count 3). 
     
      
    26 Mr Lebler denied each aspect of her account, apart from the act of cunnilingus (count 2) and the act of penile penetration thereafter (count 3). He said that Ms Hill consented to intercourse. Indeed, she had initiated intimacy by physically approaching him. The appellant acknowledged that he had driven at 120 kph as they drove out of Nimbin. However, he did not regard that as speeding. He did not switch the lights off until the vehicle came to a standstill. 
     
      
       
      After the incident 
       
      
    27 After intercourse had taken place, the appellant fell asleep. The complainant dressed. She sat in the car for about an hour. As soon as it was light, she got out and left. As she did so, she took the car keys. She ran down the road, crying. A motorcyclist gave her a lift to Nimbin. He dropped her at the bakery, which was the only shop open. 
     
      
    28 The baker, Mr Stuart Shipley, gave evidence. He said that early on the morning of 15 December 1999 the complainant knocked on his shop window. She was holding a set of keys. She looked very agitated. He observed that she was looking up and down the street. She said that she was scared. He saw that she had a red mark on her neck. She was crying. 
     
      
    29 Mr Shipley contacted the police. Two police officers came to the shop. Sgt Berryman described Ms Hill as ""upset and distraught"". Her eyes were puffy. She complained of having been sexually assaulted. She described to Sgt Berryman and Snr Const Patrick Dempsey the road where the car had been located. The police then drove along that road in search of the vehicle. The vehicle was found approximately three kilometres out of town. The appellant was still in the car. He was asleep and naked from the waist down. 
     
      
    30 The police woke Mr Lebler. They told him that Ms Hill had complained that he had sexually assaulted her. Mr Lebler responded with these words: (T22) 
     
      
       
        
        ""What, she's my girlfriend. I couldn't have, Lenny and Sophie were here with me."" 
        
       
      
    31 Mr Lebler was arrested. He was taken to the police station. At 10.25 am, after legal advice, he agreed to be interviewed. He repeated his denial of the complainant's allegations. He had not threatened or terrorised the complainant. He acknowledged that cunnilingus and one act of penile intercourse had taken place. The complainant had consented. Mr Lebler agreed to provide a blood sample. 
     
      
    32 Meanwhile, Ms Hill was taken to the Lismore Base Hospital. She was seen by Dr Gillian Smith at 7.55 am. Dr Smith said that she looked extremely tired and anxious. The complainant found the process of being undressed and examined very distressing. 
     
      
    33 Dr Smith said that the complainant did not appear to be intoxicated. She had a bite/suck injury to her neck. She also had a number of bruises. An examination of the genital area revealed no abnormality. 
     
      
    34 The complainant gave Dr Smith a history of past drug use. She said that she had not used drugs since undergoing rehabilitation at a clinic at Newfarm, Queensland. She had, however, experienced auditory hallucinations following detoxification. 
     
      
    35 Dr Smith saw no evidence that the complainant was hallucinating at the time of her examination (T244). Indeed, there was no indication that she was effected by any drugs other than alcohol. Dr Smith said this: (T244) 
     
      
       
        
        ""She was able to give a lucid history and her thought processes seemed clear. She wasn't -- there weren't any bizarre or strange elements to the things that she was saying, she just was quite normal in her thought processes. In her logic she was able to focus on the task at hand, so there was no indication that there was anything else happening, nor did she report any hallucinations."" 
        
       
      
    36 Swabs were taken from the complainant's vagina and her underwear. Within the vagina and on the underwear there was semen, which was identified by means of DNA as that of the appellant. Semen was also found on the passenger's seat of the vehicle. 
     
      
    37 The complainant telephoned a friend, Mr Shoebridge. She asked that he drive her home from Lismore. He agreed to do so. Mr Shoebridge said that on the way home she was very quiet. She repeated a number of times: ""I got raped, I got raped."" 
     
      
    38 Once back in Queensland, Ms Hill returned to the family home of her boyfriend, Shane Williams. Mrs Lorna Williams, her boyfriend's mother, said that the complainant spoke of having been raped. Her son, Shane, said that he knew nothing of the assault except through his mother. The complainant's mother arrived with the children some weeks later. Soon after the complainant and Shane Williams separated. 
     
      
       
      The relationship between the complainant and the appellant 
       
      
    39 A number of witnesses gave evidence relevant to the relationship between the complainant and the appellant. The evidence was directed to two issues. The first concerned Ms Hill's purpose in accepting a lift from Mr Lebler. Ms Hill said that her purpose was to pick up her children, in view of the urgent request from her mother. When she left she packed a bag with her children's clothes. Mr Lebler, however, said that journeying to Newcastle was never part of their arrangement. He only ever intended to drive to Nimbin and return. It was, in his words, ""a dirty weekend"", as the complainant well knew. 
     
      
    40 The complainant spoke to Mrs Lorna Williams before she left with Mr Lebler. She told her that Mr Lebler was taking her to pick up her children. Shane Williams, her boyfriend, said that he had spoken to the complainant's mother. He was told that the complainant was supposed to get down there ""to see her kids"". He knew that the complainant wanted to go to Newcastle. However, he did not know when she intended to go. 
     
      
    41 The appellant's friend, Lenny, said that he vaguely remembered a discussion about going to Newcastle, but he was not sure. A statement of Maria Jane Dawson was tendered (Exhibit M). Ms Dawson was a friend of Mr Lebler. She had also known the complainant for about seven months. Indeed, it was Ms Dawson who introduced the complainant to the appellant. She recalled Mr Lebler saying that he was going to Nimbin. She later saw the complainant and another woman in the appellant's car when they began the journey. The other woman was later dropped off at her home. As the car left, Ms Dawson said that she had heard the appellant say that they were going to Nimbin. 
     
      
    42 The second issue concerned the nature of Mr Lebler's relationship with the complainant. Mr Lebler said he was attracted to Ms Hill. Mr Shoebridge said that the complainant had told him that she was having problems with her boyfriend Shane. She had, in this context, stayed at his house for two days. Mr Lebler said the complainant acknowledged that she was seeing other men when she was living with Shane, and she was commonly known as ""a slut"" (Exhibit G, Q163). Whilst at the park at Nimbin, the appellant's friend Lenny (Mr Johnson) got the impression that the complainant and Mr Lebler were ""friendly"". They sat next to each other. He saw them walking hand in hand. The complainant denied that suggestion. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The verdict was unreasonable 
       
      
    43 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, so far as presently relevant, provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The court on any appeal under section 5(1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal ..."" 
        
       
      
    44 The test to be applied was stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 as follows: (at 493) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
        
       
      
    45 That test has been recently reaffirmed by the High Court in MFA v R (2002) 193 ALR 184, per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ (at 190), and McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ (at 198). This Court, examining the evidence at the trial, must reach a view as to whether it was reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant in respect of counts 2 and 3 (cf MFA v R (supra) at 198 para 60-61). 
     
      
    46 At the end of the Crown case, an application was made for a directed verdict. His Honour declined that application. However, he gave what is generally referred to as a Prasad direction. That is, he gave the jury the opportunity of immediately acquitting Mr Lebler or, alternatively, indicating that it wished the trial to continue. The jury responded by saying that it wished the trial to continue. The appellant then gave sworn evidence. He denied wrongdoing. The complainant had consented to each act of intercourse. He reaffirmed the truth of what he had said to the police when interviewed, with one qualification. The qualification was that he had been driving, not the complainant. He had originally asserted that the complainant had been driving because he, at the time, was a disqualified driver. He was frightened that he may be charged with that offence. 
     
      
    47 Following the verdict, his Honour, as mentioned, issued a certificate under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, certifying that the case was ""a fit case for appeal"" upon the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. The abovenamed was acquitted on the first count in the indictment presented against him but found guilty on the second and third counts therein, in a case in which all three offences were allegedly committed by the same offender on the same occasion and where in each instance the evidence of the same complainant had to be accepted beyond reasonable doubt before a verdict of guilty could properly be returned. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The evidence as to the absence of consent relied upon by the prosecution was dependent upon the jury finding that, notwithstanding the complainant having told the accused that she loved him and having herself initiated the sexual intercourse, her freewill had been overborne by the behaviour of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The jury's finding negativing any belief by the accused that the complainant was consenting could only have been based upon the accused having known and appreciated that his own bizarre behaviour had caused the complainant to become so fearful of violence by him towards her that she was not freely consenting to sexual intercourse with him or that he had not even considered whether or not she was consenting."" 
        
       
      
    48 What, then, is the significance of the verdict of not guilty on count 1? The appellant acknowledged that count 1 could be distinguished from counts 2 and 3, such that the verdicts were not technically or factually inconsistent (cf MFA v R (supra), Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ at 192/193 para 34-36; McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 203/204 para 85). Nonetheless, it was said that there was no rational or reasonable explanation for the differing verdicts. That they were different suggested compromise, according to the appellant. As such they were an affront to logic and common sense (MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 368; MFA v R (supra) at 204 para 86). Indeed, it was argued that that impression was reinforced by two matters. The first was the following direction by the trial Judge during the summing up (which, itself, is the subject of a separate ground of appeal, ground 2): 
     
      
       
        
        ""There are three separate charges and you must consider each charge on its merits. However, the reality of the situation is that the prosecution depends upon your accepting the complainant Miss Hill, as a credible witness who when her evidence is compared and contrasted with the evidence of other witnesses in the case, you are in the final analysis prepared to accept beyond reasonable doubt, as an accurate and honest account, so far as the vital matters with which this trial is concerned. You might find it hard to find any logical basis as to why the same verdict, that is either guilty or not guilty, should (not) be returned in respect of each of the three charges. They all arose on the one occasion, within a very short time of each other. They all involved the same witnesses and they all depend in the final analysis, upon the credibility of the complainant."" 
        
       
      
    49 The second reason was the unseemly pressure by his Honour upon the jury to conclude their deliberations rapidly, which they duly did. After a six day trial the jury retired at 3.35 pm on a Friday. They were brought back for certain redirections at 3.49 pm. They returned to their deliberations at 3.51 pm. The verdicts were ultimately delivered after approximately two hours at 5.55 pm. This aspect is also the subject of a separate ground of appeal (ground 4). However, on the appellant's argument, that sequence, and his Honour's comments, provide further support for the suggestion of compromise (cf R v Crisologo (1997) 99 A Crim R 178, per Simpson J at 183). 
     
      
    50 However, I am not persuaded that there was compromise. There are rational explanations for the different verdicts. First, the obvious difference between count 1 and counts 2 and 3 was that the appellant denied the act of intercourse in count 1, but not counts 2 and 3. It was his case, on counts 2 and 3, that, although intercourse had taken place, the complainant had consented, or at least he believed at the time that she had consented. However, paraphrasing the words of Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ in MFA v R (supra) at 192 para 34, some members of the jury may have required some supporting evidence before being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, based upon the word of the complainant, as to the number of acts of penile intercourse. As Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said: (at 192 para 34) 
     
      
       
        
        "".... This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility."" 
        
       
      
    51 Secondly, the complainant certainly insisted, when she gave evidence, that there were three acts of intercourse (each the subject of separate counts). She said this: (T162) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A I told you just before, twice. Twice. He put his tongue in once; he put his penis in twice. If you think about it he put his penis in I don't know many how many times but he done it on two occasions."" 
        
       
      
    52 However, on the morning of 15 December 1999, when first seen by Sgt Berryman, the complainant had spoken of three acts of intercourse (implying three acts of penile intercourse). Based upon that inconsistency, some members of the jury may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on count 1. 
     
      
    53 Thirdly, the verdict may reflect a merciful view of the evidence; King CJ (with whom Olsson and O'Loughlin JJ agreed) said this in R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591: (at 593) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... juries cannot always be expected to act in accordance with strictly logical considerations and in accordance with the strict principles of the law which are explained to them, and courts, I think, must be very cautious about setting aside verdicts which are adequately supported by the evidence simply because a judge might find it difficult to reconcile them with the verdicts which had been reached by the jury with respect to other charges. Sometimes juries apply in favour of an accused what might be described as their innate sense of fairness and justice in place of the strict principles of law.  
        Sometimes it appears to a jury that although a number of counts have been alleged against an accused person, and have been technically proved, justice is sufficiently met by convicting him of less than the full number. 
         This may not be logically justifiable in the eyes of a judge, but I think it would be idle to close our eyes to the fact that it is part and parcel of the system of administration of justice by juries. Appellate courts therefore should not be too ready to jump to the conclusion that because a verdict of guilty cannot be reconciled as a matter of strict logic with a verdict of not guilty with respect to another count, the jury acted unreasonably in arriving at the verdict of guilty."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    54 These remarks were endorsed as practical and sensible by Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MacKenzie v The Queen (supra) at 368. In MFA v R (supra) Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ said this, having referred to the same case: (at 192 para 34) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only."" 
        
       
      
    55 Although the different verdicts can be rationally explained, the issue remains whether the guilty verdicts were unreasonable. The case was unusual. There was, moreover, a substantial attack upon the credit of the complainant. That attack, broadly, was directed at two matters. First, in the days following 15 December 1999, the complainant gave a number of accounts to friends and others which were inconsistent with the account that she gave to the police, and which she repeated when giving evidence. Mrs Lorna Williams, her boyfriend's mother, said that she was told by the complainant that the appellant had held her down, forcing himself upon her. She said that, when putting his penis inside her vagina, he was ripping her. Ms Maria Dawson said that the complainant told her the next day that the appellant had put his fist in her vagina, such that she required 14 stitches. She said, according to Ms Dawson, that she had been pregnant. She had lost the baby. The appellant had been raving on about God. 
     
      
    56 The Crown argued that such inconsistencies could be explained by the complainant's shame at having been forced into a situation where she felt obliged to initiate the intimacy and ""give herself"". 
     
      
    57 The second issue concerned the complainant's drug taking. The learned trial Judge described the complainant as living a chaotic life. With disarming frankness, she acknowledged excessive drinking and extensive drug taking. However, she insisted that much of her drug taking occurred after she had been raped. She had not, for instance, taken LSD or amphetamines before the incident. Hospital records, tendered on behalf of the appellant, suggested otherwise. More than that, there was evidence that, under the influence of drugs, she had hallucinated before this incident. Hence, there was an issue whether, by reason of drugs and alcohol consumed on this evening, she may have been hallucinating. 
     
      
    58 The Crown suggested a number of explanations for the differences between her account of her drug taking and the medical records. For some of the records, she was not necessarily the source of information. She had been taken to a hospital by her grandmother, who had plainly provided information. Even were the records accurate, it was possible that the complainant had simply forgotten details of her chaotic past or was confused, no doubt partly because of the drugs themselves. 
     
      
    59 Weighing these matters, I believe it was reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant on counts 2 and 3 (cf MFA v R (supra) p198, para 60). The incident took place in a remote location on a dead end road. The action of the complainant in escaping, taking with her the keys to the car, is consistent with her account that she was in fear. When seen by Mr Shipley, she was nervously looking up and down the road. Her appearance and the terms of her immediate complaint to Mr Shipley, to Sgt Berryman, and to Dr Smith (who examined her within a matter of hours), again were consistent with the account that she had given. 
     
      
    60 I would dismiss ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The Markuleski direction 
       
      
    61 Ground 2 was expressed in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The learned trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury that if it entertained a reasonable doubt in relation to the complainant's credibility in respect of one count that such doubt should be taken into account in assessing the evidence in respect of the other counts."" 
        
       
      
    62 The passage in the summing up, which is the subject of complaint, formed part of the argument of the appellant on ground 1 (supra: para 46). It is convenient to reproduce that passage in this context. His Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""There are three separate charges and you must consider each charge on its merits. However, the reality of the situation is that the prosecution depends upon your accepting the complainant Miss Hill, as a credible witness who when her evidence is compared and contrasted with the evidence of other witnesses in the case, you are in the final analysis prepared to accept beyond reasonable doubt, as an accurate and honest account, so far as the vital matters with which this trial is concerned. You might find it hard to find any logical basis as to why the same verdict, that is either guilty or not guilty, should (not) be returned in respect of each of the three charges. They all arose on the one occasion, within a very short time of each other. They all involved the same witnesses and they all depend in the final analysis, upon the credibility of the complainant."" 
        
       
      
    63 His Honour's direction was based, no doubt, upon R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82. In that case the appellant suggested that the trial Judge should have directed the jury that they should take into account the failure of the complainant's evidence to satisfy them beyond reasonable doubt on one count when assessing her evidence on the remaining counts (para 181). Spigelman CJ thought that such a direction should be given ""as a general rule"" (para 187). The Chief Justice said this: (at 122) 
     
      
       
        
        ""188. It is not necessary to specify any precise words for such a direction. That will depend on the circumstances of the case. It will often be appropriate to direct a jury that where they entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of a complainant's evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant's evidence generally. 
        
       
       
        
        189. On other occasions it may be appropriate for a judge to indicate to the jury, whilst making it clear that it remains a matter for the jury, that it might think that there was nothing to distinguish the evidence of the complainant on one count from his or her evidence on another count. 
        
       
       
        
        190. Or it may be appropriate to indicate that, if the jury has a reasonable doubt about the complainant's credibility in relation to one count, it might believe it difficult to see how the evidence of the complainant could be accepted in relation to other counts. 
        
       
       
        
        191. The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all the particular circumstances of the specific case. The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant's evidence, ought be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant's evidence with respect to other counts."" 
        
       
      
    64 Here, the appellant complains that the direction contemplated by para 189 was given, but not that in para 190. Further, the matter identified by the Chief Justice as ""crucial"" in para 191 did not form part of the direction which was given. The Crown responded by suggesting that the Chief Justice, in paragraphs 189 and 190, was speaking of alternatives. The direction said to be crucial was, according to the Crown, implied by the terms of the direction which was given. 
     
      
    65 Wood CJ at CL in Markuleski said this: (at 134/135) 
     
      
       
        
        ""257 On the other hand, there is merit, as a matter of common sense, in reminding the jury that the existence of a question mark in their minds concerning the credibility, or reliability of the evidence given by a complainant or central witness in relation to one count, may properly be taken into account, in conjunction with all the other circumstances of the case, when they consider the reliability or credibility of the evidence of that complainant or witness in relation to the other counts."" 
        
       
      
    66 Grove J, on the same issue, made the following comment: (at 138) 
     
      
       
        
        ""280 ... Whilst I consider that it would be prudent to give such a direction in some cases I am apprehensive that language incorporating the concept of cruciality will be interpreted as mandatory. For my part I would refrain from expression in any terms which might be so interpreted. There may be cases in which it could be necessary to assist a jury by way of an instruction such as is under discussion but in some way it may not. In my view it would suffice to commend the matter for consideration of trial judges."" 
        
       
      
    67 Simpson J dissented, whilst Carruthers AJ agreed with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    68 Here, I believe, for a number of reasons, that the trial Judge's direction was adequate. First, the Court emphasised in Markuleski that the precise direction must depend upon the circumstances. The trial Judge clearly had the Chief Justice's words in mind when fashioning the direction he gave. The circumstances in the present trial were quite different from those in Markuleski. In Markuleski there were a number of counts. They were based upon allegations made more than twenty years after the alleged sexual misconduct. This misconduct was said to have taken place on a number of specific occasions. They were spread over more than a year. What was alleged to have happened on one occasion differed from that which was said to have occurred on another. 
     
      
    69 Here, there was one occasion. There was a narrow issue. The common thread was the alleged absence of consent, as to which the complainant's credibility was vital. His Honour's direction was, I believe, adequate in that context. 
     
      
    70 Secondly, it will be noticed that the direction which was given went well beyond the matter identified by the Chief Justice in Markuleski in para 189 (i.e. that there was nothing to distinguish the evidence of the complainant on one count from her evidence on other counts). His Honour gave emphasis to the crucial issue of her credibility. Again, in this respect, it was quite different from the direction given by the trial Judge in Markuleski. The direction given in that case was in these terms: (at 118) 
     
      
       
        
        ""164 ... 'It is up to you how you deal with the evidence and how you find your verdicts, but you may consider that it would be very difficult to find him guilty on one and not guilty on others. You either might accept the complainant as a truthful, accurate, credible witness or you do not. ...'"" 
        
       
      
    71 The Judge had inverted the proper reasoning process by saying they would find it ""difficult to find him guilty on one and not guilty on others"". He should have said: ""You may consider that it would be very difficult to find him not guilty on one and guilty on others."" 
     
      
    72 Nonetheless, the Chief Justice (and other Judges) emphasised that even that direction may not have been fatal had it not been for other defects in the summing up (see especially Spigelman CJ, para 187, 194). The necessary implication of the direction given by his Honour in this trial was that, if the jury entertained doubt on one count, they may use that doubt in their evaluation of the complainant's evidence in respect of other counts. 
     
      
    73 Thirdly, no objection to his Honour's direction was made by counsel appearing for the appellant at the trial. Rule 4 applies. As the Court remarked in Regina v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174 at para 90, the absence of an objection from counsel is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the directions given. 
     
      
    74 I would dismiss ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Pressure on the jury 
       
      
    75 The appellant formulated ground 4 in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The trial miscarried as a result of the learned trial Judge failing to give the jury the option of commencing its deliberation the following week and in failing to comply with the High Court's decision in  
        Black v The Queen 
         (1993) 179 CLR 44."" 
        
       
      
    76 The trial began in Lismore on Thursday 21 November 2002. On Tuesday 26 November 2002, at the end of the day, the Crown suggested that it was a convenient time to adjourn. A discussion ensued, in the presence of the jury, about the likely length of the case. The case had exceeded the four day estimate. Counsel were mildly rebuked for straying outside the real issues. In the course of the discussion, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I indicated quite plainly that this case had to finish this week."" 
        
       
      
    77 The evidence concluded late on Thursday 28 November 2002. The trial Judge then told the jury that addresses would begin, after which he would sum up. His Honour then addressed the Crown Prosecutor in these terms: (T363) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have a note from the jury to say that the jury have to leave by 4.30 pm. That gives you three quarters of an hour - are you ready to address?"" 
        
       
      
    78 The Crown said that he could do so. However, he asked for a 15 minute break to organise his notes and his thoughts. The jury was then sent out. The discussion between his Honour and Counsel continued in their absence. One of the matters of concern to the trial Judge was that a strike involving certain court staff had been foreshadowed for the following Monday. 
     
      
    79 The jury, meanwhile, sent a note. The note stated that they would ""like to hear both summations tomorrow"". His Honour brought the jury back and addressed them in these terms: (T364/5) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Members of the jury I have your note. I will allow your request. I would suggest that you have a good early night because you are going to have a very hard day tomorrow. We will start at 9.30 am. But you should not make any arrangements for tomorrow evening because you may be sitting here for quite some time, and if another day is required it looks like Monday is not available so it will be a Saturday sittings. We seek to void them but if necessary they will have to be conducted. But let me, very quickly, this is a serious case and must not be decided in any atmosphere of haste, it must be looked at very carefully and you must take as long as it is necessary for it to be done properly. I will release you for the rest of the day with those sad tidings."" 
        
       
      
    80 The following morning, before the Crown Prosecutor began his address, the jury sent a further note. The note said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""What happens if we cannot reach a unanimous decision?"" 
        
       
      
    81 His Honour responded immediately (without consulting Counsel) in these terms: (T367) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: Members of the jury, in a moment the learned Crown Prosecutor will address you. I see there's a note here. Well we will wait and see. There are things that will be done, but we will deal with that problem if it arises. The question is, ""What happens if we cannot reach a unanimous decision?"" One thing I would say to you at this stage in the light of that is this, that you don't all have to agree upon the basis for the decision, provided your decision is made in accordance with the directions of law which you're given and upon the evidence which you have heard and seen in the case, each member of the jury is entitled to come to his or her view as to what the verdict should be, in his or her own way. It is only the actual verdict itself which has to be agreed upon by all members of the jury."" 
        
       
      
    82 The appellant complains that his Honour ""made no attempt to comply with the High Court decision in Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44"". In that case the jury had been deliberating for three hours. The Judge brought them back and said that he understood that they were having problems. Having reminded them that they were 12 individuals who had each taken an oath, his Honour said this: (at 47) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It makes for considerable public inconvenience and expense if a jury cannot agree and it is most unfortunate indeed if such a failure to agree is due to some unwillingness on the part of one or more members of the jury to listen to and consider the arguments of the rest of the jury. It is very desirable that you should come to a conclusion one way or the other, because if you don't, it will mean that some jury will have to later seek to do what you have been chosen to do. That would be a considerable hardship on all concerned with the case, including the accused and the various witnesses and if possible, should be avoided."" 
        
       
      
    83 The Court held unanimously that the reference to ""public inconvenience"" was apt to impose pressure upon individual jurors to join in the view taken by the majority. That was unacceptable. It violated a fundamental principle that the jury must be free to deliberate without any pressure being brought to bear upon them (at 50). The Court, helpfully, set out a direction which may be given where it appears that the jury is not able to reach a unanimous verdict (at 51/52). 
     
      
    84 However, the circumstances confronting his Honour were quite different to those in Black. The jury had not yet heard the addresses of Counsel. The trial Judge had not yet given his summing up. There was no occasion for a ""Black direction"". His Honour's ""wait and see"" approach was entirely appropriate. At the end of the summing up his Honour directed the jury as follows: (S/U 37) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Would the foreman please ensure that all members of the jury have adequate opportunity to express their views in relation to the trial. Please listen to each other's views, because they may help you individually to form your own views. You have no doubt had a lot of time already to think about this matter.  
        It must not be decided in haste. 
         If you feel that you will need a meal, then please - it does not matter, but if you feel that you are going to be there long enough that you will need a meal, please just knock on the door and talk to the Sheriff about it ..."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    85 As mentioned, the jury (after a short redirection) retired at 3.51 pm on Friday 29 November 2002. They returned a little over two hours later at 5.55 pm. 
     
      
    86 The appellant asserts that, in various ways, and at various stages, pressure was exerted upon the jury to conclude its deliberations without delay. The jury was given no explanation as to why the case could not proceed in the normal way on Monday. Nothing was said about how late the jury would be required on the Friday. No enquiry was directed to the jury to determine whether it was convenient to sit Friday evening, or Saturday, if required. 
     
      
    87 The Crown responded by pointing to a number of matters. First, Counsel for the appellant made no objection to the course proposed by his Honour, nor his comments. Rule 4 applies. Again, the failure of Counsel to object is a useful index of fairness in the atmosphere of the trial. Secondly, the Judge twice reminded the jury that the case was not to be decided in haste. Thirdly, whilst it may have been prudent and courteous to have enquired of the jury as to any problems individual members may have in respect of the proposed sitting hours (cf Sully J in R v Colville [2003] NSWCCA 23 at para 71), the jury in the course of the trial had already shown itself quite capable of drawing attention to its problems and preferences. 
     
      
    88 I accept the Crown arguments. I do not believe that there is substance in ground 4. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The direction on recklessness 
       
      
    89 His Honour in the summing up identified the elements of the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. He carefully, and at some length, explained the concept of consent and the need for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had no belief that the complainant was consenting. His Honour thereafter read from the complainant's evidence, including her acknowledgment that, for the reasons she gave, she initiated physical contact, removing her clothes, and sliding on top of the appellant. In that context his Honour said this: (S/U 31) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I have read the whole of that passage to you, because it touches upon both the question of consent or rather the lack of consent and it also touches upon this third ingredient as to whether the accused believed that he - that she was consenting to have sex with him."" 
        
       
      
    90 There followed these words, which were the subject of ground 5: (S/U 31) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In order to believe something of course, one has to think about it. If the accused did not give any thought to the question as to whether or not she was consenting, then of course he could not have had a belief that she was. You cannot have a belief about something without thinking about it. However, you might well think that it is a matter which inevitably would have crossed his mind, but that is a matter for you whether you agree with that comment."" 
        
       
      
    91 It was submitted by the appellant that this was a misdirection. His Honour introduced the concept of recklessness. Having introduced it, his Honour then failed adequately to instruct the jury on that concept as required by R v Kitchener (1993) 29 NSWLR 696 at 697 and 703; R v Tolmie (1995) 37 NSWLR 660 at 672. Recklessness, it was suggested, may have resonated with the jury because the accused had consumed a significant quantity of alcohol, and admitted to having smoked marijuana. 
     
      
    92 The words which are the subject of complaint would appear to be the beginning of a direction on recklessness, which his Honour then abandoned. Recklessness had not been raised by either party. There was no occasion to direct the jury on that concept. The Crown case, as his Honour put to the jury, was that the complainant did not consent of her own free will out of fear. The appellant, on the other hand, asserted that she had consented. The appellant had not suggested that the issue of consent was irrelevant, and for that reason he had failed to advert to it. 
     
      
    93 His Honour encapsulated the issue succinctly with the following summary of the Crown case: (S/U 32/33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Did the accused know that what he was doing had overridden her free will to such an extent that she was prepared to submit to sexual intercourse with him? Did he know she was not really consenting of her own free will? Despite her actions in taking the initiative, helping him undress, telling him she loved him and so forth, did he see through what she was doing and having done that, did he nonetheless go ahead and have sexual intercourse with her? In so doing, because he realised what the position was, the Crown's case is that he knew that she was not consenting of her own free will."" 
        
       
      
    94 The account given by the accused was identified in these words: (S/U 33) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The accused's version of things is very simple. There was no argument at the park. Things were good. They drove to a remote area. He never said anything like what she has claimed he said. She is either lying or it is a result of hallucination. He having been there, knows that she was consenting and he knew then that she was consenting and therefore he at all relevant times had a belief that she was consenting to the intercourse."" 
        
       
      
    95 So the issue of consent was quite narrow. Both the appellant and the complainant agreed that, by the time intercourse took place, she appeared to be willing and consenting. The question was whether the appellant had behaved so badly beforehand that he had robbed her of her free will to do other than consent. 
     
      
    96 That issue had nothing to do with recklessness. The introductory words, to which exception is now taken, did not introduce a false issue, and I believe that no harm was done. Counsel for the appellant did not object to his Honour's statement. No application was made for an enlargement upon that direction, as is now suggested by the appellant. Rule 4 applies. 
     
      
    97 I would dismiss ground 5. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6: Recent complaint 
       
      
    98 The appellant formulated ground 6 in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The learned trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury that evidence of the appellant's denials was admissible on the same basis as the evidence of complaint."" 
        
       
      
    99 His Honour told the jury that the evidence of complaint could be taken into account when assessing the credit of the complainant. It may be regarded as consistent with the allegations she made. He added: (S/U 35) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is not separate evidence by itself, it comes from the same source, the source of it is the complainant, but you are entitled to take into account the fact that an early complaint was made, and you might think that that is consistent with what you might have expected from somebody who had undergone the ordeal which she says she had. The existence of a recent complaint, an almost immediate complaint, does not of itself prove that these events did occur. It is evidence that can be taken into account when looking to see whether the complainant acted in a way that was consistent with what she said had happened to her."" 
        
       
      
    100 At the conclusion of the summing up, Counsel for the appellant sought a similar direction in respect of the denials of the accused, which were said to be ""in the same category"" as the evidence of complaint by the complainant. Reference was made to R v Crisologo (supra) in which Simpson J (with whom Hunt CJ at CL and James J agreed) said this: (at 189) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Statements made by an accused person at a relevant (that is, early) time are, in my view, a precise counterpart of complaint made by an alleged victim in sexual assault (and other) cases. The Act draws no distinction between the admissibility of out of court statements made by a complainant, and statements of a similar kind made by a person accused of crime. The principles applicable to the admission of evidence of complaint apply equally to the admission of evidence of relevant out of court statements by an accused person at a time when the events the subject of the statement are fresh in his/her memory and when he/she has been or is to be called to give evidence. Such evidence is, like evidence of complaint, now admitted as evidence of the truth of what was said:  
        R v Hall  
        (1997) 92 A Crim R 168;  
        D 
         (1997) 94 A Crim R 931."" 
        
       
      
    101 His Honour declined to give such a direction. 
     
      
    102 The submission by the appellant, in my view, confuses issues of admissibility with directions that may or should be given where complaint evidence is admitted in the context of allegations of sexual misconduct. 
     
      
    103 It is true that under the Evidence Act 1995, the admissibility of complaint evidence by a victim of an alleged assault is determined upon the same basis as the admissibility of the accused's assertions and denials, that is, under s66(2) of the Act. In each case the admissibility of such evidence turns on whether there was a representation made at a time when the asserted fact was fresh in the mind of the person making the representation (Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606). However, the admission of that evidence does not oblige the trial Judge to inform the jury as to the basis upon which the evidence has been admitted. Ordinarily juries are not informed about such matters, unless there is good reason for doing so. There may, for example, be good reason where previous consistent statements are admitted under s108(3)(b) because of a suggestion of fabrication or reconstruction. Where the evidence is hearsay or an admission, it may attract a warning under s165(1)(a) which may warrant some explanation of the basis of admissibility. Where, as here, the Judge chooses to limit the basis upon which the evidence may be used (s136 of the Act), there may also be an occasion for comment. There was no such limitation in respect of the evidence of the appellant, including his denials. It would have been to his disadvantage to have introduced such a limitation. There was, therefore, no occasion in the context of admissibility, to say anything to the jury about the appellant's evidence. 
     
      
    104 The real grievance of the appellant is not based upon admissibility, but rather the terms of the direction which his Honour gave about the use of early complaint. However, that direction was, in substance, the usual direction given where complaint evidence is admitted. Such a direction (and the companion direction when there is no evidence of complaint or delayed complaint (Kilby v The Queen (1973) 129 CLR 460; Crofts v The Queen (1996) 186 CLR 427)) derives not from the Evidence Act but the Common Law. There was, under the Common Law, no obligation to give the direction which was sought. Accordingly, there was no error in refusing it. Refusing it, in my view, did not even involve unfairness to the appellant. His position was clear. He immediately denied the allegations when confronted by the police that morning at the scene. He repeated his denials in sworn evidence the day before the summing up. I believe there is no substance in ground 6.  
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    105 I would therefore propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    106 SHAW J: In this matter Kirby J has helpfully set out the facts and I need not repeat them. I agree with his Honour, for the reasons he has given, that there is no substance in grounds 4, 5 and 6 of the notice of appeal. However, I have taken a different view with respect to grounds 1 and 2. 
     
      
    107 I think it would have been appropriate, and indeed necessary, in the context of this case, for the trial judge to have given a direction in accordance with what was said by the Chief Justice (Wood CJ at CL, Simpson J and Carutthers AJ agreeing; Grove J quaere) in R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82.  
     
      
    108 In Markuleski, Spigelman CJ identified three possible directions that could be given to a jury in a trial involving multiple counts of sexual assault with the issues for the jury coming down to an assessment of the strength of the Crown case relying on the version of events made by the complainant. Spigelman CJ said (at 122; [188] – [191]): 
     
      
       
        
        It is not necessary to specify any precise words for such a direction. That will depend on the circumstances of the case. It will often be appropriate to direct a jury that where they entertain a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of a complainant's evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant's evidence generally. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On other occasions it may be appropriate for a judge to indicate to the jury, whilst making it clear that it remains a matter for the jury, that it might think that there was nothing to distinguish the evidence of the complainant on one count from his or her evidence on another count. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Or it may be appropriate to indicate that, if the jury has a reasonable doubt about the complainant's credibility in relation to one count, it might believe it difficult to see how the evidence of the complainant could be accepted in relation to other counts. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all the particular circumstances of the specific case. The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant's evidence, ought be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant's evidence with respect to other counts. 
        
       
      
    109 Spigelman CJ also said (at 122): 
     
      
       
        
        The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all of the circumstances of the specific case. The  
        crucial matter 
         is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant’s evidence, ought to be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s evidence with respect to other counts. (Emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      The adjective ‘ 
      crucial 
      ’ is obviously powerful. 
       
      
    110 In MFA v The Queen (2002) 77 ALJR 139; 193 ALR 184 at 145;191 Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ rejected a submission that Markuleski was wrongly decided.  
     
      
    111 In Markuleski, Grove J did not agree with the Chief Justice that a direction to a jury in sexual assault cases that they should consider a doubt about a complainant’s credibility on one count in consideration of any other count was ‘crucial’ (see Spigelman CJ at 122; Grove J at 138). However, his Honour did express the view that such a direction would be required in some cases. Grove J said (at 138):  
     
      
       
        
        It is self evident that a trial judge must make a decision whether to give such an indication before it is known whether the jury will discriminate in its verdicts upon separate counts. Whilst I consider that it would be prudent to give such a direction in some cases I am apprehensive that language incorporating the concept of cruciality will be interpreted as mandatory. For my part I would refrain from expression in any terms which might be so interpreted. There may be cases in which it could be necessary to assist a jury by way of an instruction such is under discussion but in some way it may not. 
        
       
      
    112 Accordingly, five judges of this Court have expressed the view that such a direction should be given where it is obvious to a trial judge that the jury should return similar verdicts to all counts on an indictment or where it may be necessary to assist a jury in their deliberations where it may be necessary to discriminate between charges. Where that is necessary, a jury should be reminded, even if it is a matter of common sense, that: 
     
      
       
        
        …the existence of a question mark in their minds concerning the credibility, or reliability of the evidence given by a complainant or central witness in relation to one count, may properly be taken into account, in conjunction with all the other circumstances of the case, when they consider the reliability or credibility of the evidence of that complainant or witness in relation to the other counts ( 
        Markuleski 
         at 134-135 per Wood CJ at CL). 
        
       
      
    113 Wood CJ at CL identified several factors occurring in a trial that may indicate that an appeal court would conclude the jury looked with ‘real disfavour’ upon the credibility of the complainant, including (at 131): 
     
      
       
        
        (a) verdicts of not guilty were returned on a preponderance of the counts in an indictment; 
         
        (b) there was positive evidence in the defence case to establish that the version of events offered by the complainant or central witness was fabricated in relation to the counts upon which the accused was acquitted, 
         
        (c) where the evidence offered by the prosecution, in relation to the counts on which the accused was acquitted, appears to be fanciful or inherently improbable (R v W (1999) 109 A Crim R 51 provides a possible example); or 
         
        (d) where the complainant or central witness has given versions, in relation to the count or counts upon which the accused was acquitted, which were significantly inconsistent. 
         
        
       
      
    114 Though, in my opinion, this list should not be seen as exhaustive, if such events are observable at trial then I think that it would be crucial for a trial judge to give a direction of a kind described in Markuleski.  
     
      
    115 Wood CJ at CL also identified several factors in a trial that may indicate, though again I do not think this list is exhaustive, a possible basis for an appellate court to differentiate between mixed verdicts including (at 131): 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) the complainant or the central witness has conceded the possibility of faulty recollection, in relation to the details of the event the subject of the charge on which the accused was acquitted; 
         
        (b) there was a lack of particularity as to time or place in relation to such charge, and where fixing the event at a particular time or place is either of the essence or of central importance (R v AT [2000] NSWCCA 342 provides an example of a case where, (but for other circumstances concerning another count), the existence of uncertainty as to time would have provided an acceptable explanation; and see R v J (No 2) [1998] 3 VR 602); 
         
        (c) the accused has called positive evidence in relation to the charge or charges on which he was acquitted but not in relation to the others; 
         
        (d) there was corroboration in relation to the charge on which the accused was convicted, but not in relation to the others; 
         
        (e) it is fair to assume that, in relation to a count or counts in respect of which the accused was acquitted, there was room to suppose that the complainant or central witness resorted to a degree of exaggeration in order to reinforce his or her account; 
         
        (f) the acquittals were returned in relation to less serious events, particularly when they were not mentioned in the original complaint (R v JJT (Court of Criminal Appeal, 3 December 1997, unreported) provides an example of such a case) 
         
        (g) the history of wrongdoing is lengthy and involves very many incidents over a period of time, or conversely involves a large number of events within a very short time frame such that a faulty recollection as to one or other of them, or some telescoping of them, may be entirely understandable (see R v J (1994) 75 A Crim R 522 at 539-540); or where 
         
        (h) the jury were entitled to conclude, in relation to the event in respect of which the accused was acquitted, that the complainant misunderstood or misinterpreted what it was that had occurred (R v ACK [2000] NSWCCA 180 provides an example of such a case). 
        
       
      
    116 If any of these circumstances are foreseeable to a trial judge then, in my opinion, it is necessary for him or her to consider whether it would assist the jury’s deliberations to receive a direction in accordance with Markuleski. As Kirby J has pointed out, Markuleski was itself a case involving issues identified by Wood CJ at CL at sub-par (g) in the list of indicative considerations. In my opinion this case involved issues identified in sub-par (h), and more particularly sub-pars (c) and (d). Accordingly, I think the trial judge should have given the ‘full’ Markuleski direction to assist the jury. I do not think that it would always be an error to fail to give such a direction however, where issues such as those indicated by Wood CJ at CL appear at trial, this Court may find it easier to dispel a doubt, raised by an appellant, on the reasonableness of mixed verdicts if the direction is given. Its absence may mean that this Court would not be satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
     
      
    117 The trial judge had directed the jury that: 
     
      
       
        
        …you might find it hard to find any logical basis as to why the same verdict, that is either guilty or not guilty, should not be returned with respect of each of the three charges. 
        
       
      
    118 This was a part of, or one of, the suggested directions offered by Spigelman CJ in Markuleski. In the context of this particular case, the absence of a direction put in the terms of pars [190] –[191] of the judgment of the Chief Justice meant that the jury were not presented with a reason as to how this apparent difficulty in returning mixed verdicts would arise. Since the jury, instructed as to the apparent illogicality of mixed verdicts, returned mixed verdicts, it gives rise to some concern, on my part, that there may have been an element of compromise in the verdicts. This doubt would have been alleviated had a Markuleski direction been given. Its absence has given rise to an arguable case that there has been a miscarriage of justice. I am strengthened in this view by the fact that the trial judge himself adverted to the possibility of compromise in the verdicts in the grant of a certificate pursuant to s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The certificate notes: 
     
      
       
        
        …in each instance the evidence of the same complainant had to be accepted beyond reasonable doubt before a verdict of guilty could be properly returned. 
        
       
      
    119 In a case in which the credibility of the complainant was directly in issue, not only in relation to the incidents in question, but in general, it would have been part of the jury’s function to determine whether a doubt as to her reliability on one count on the indictment should be taken into account in assessing her reliability in their consideration of the evidence on the other counts. It may be that the jury considered this as a matter of common sense or that such an instruction was necessarily implied in the directions that were given. However I think that a direction to this effect would have eliminated a doubt as to the process by which the jury arrived at their verdicts.  
     
      
    120 In this context I think that there is a risk that the jury’s verdicts did not represent the kind of compromise envisaged by King CJ in R v Kirkman (1987) 44 SASR 591 at 583. Rather, I think that there is a possibility that the verdicts represent a compromise that is an affront to logic: MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 368. As I have said, I would have reason to be hesitant to arrive at this conclusion had a full Markuleski direction been given but in its absence I think that ground 2 in the notice of appeal has sufficient merit that leave should be granted to rely upon it pursuant to r 4.  
     
      
    121 I am strengthened in this view that the mixed verdicts represent an illogical process of reasoning in the determinations of the jury by my conclusions regarding ground 1 in the notice of appeal.  
     
      
    122 In Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 453 Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ noted in relation to that case involving several counts over a period of time: 
     
      
       
        
        The jury’s finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment. Implicit in the appellant’s acquittal on the second count was a rejection of the complainant’s account of events which were said to give rise to that count. The jury may have acquitted because the unshaken evidence of the appellant’s wife and daughter with respect to the absence of opportunity engendered a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt on the second count. They may possibly have acquitted because they were of the view that the complainant had fabricated the circumstances giving rise to the second count. Having regard to the convictions on the first and third counts, the latter alternative seems an unlikely explanation of the verdict on the second count. Whatever the explanation may be, however, the jury’s rejection of the complainant’s account of the second count diminished her overall credibility. 
        
       
      
    123 These observations are apt in this matter. The jury’s acquittal on the first count indicated that they rejected the complainant’s strong assertion that there were two incidents of penile penetration. The jury must have accepted the appellant as a witness of some reliability in respect of the number and nature of the acts of sexual intercourse and rejected the complainant in this respect. This diminished the overall credibility of the complainant. Whilst it cannot be said that the jury must have rejected the complainant’s evidence entirely, due to the convictions on the two other counts, her credibility was reduced. In Jones, the conclusion that the credibility of the complainant was reduced meant that the majority of the High Court felt that the jury should have examined the evidence of the complainant with ‘considerable care’. This, combined with delay and lack of corroboration, convinced a majority of the High Court that the convictions in that case were unsafe and unsatisfactory. In this case I think there are other factors that combine with the reduced credibility of the complainant so that I have come to an analogous conclusion. 
     
      
    124 The other factor that I think made it necessary for the jury to scrutinise the evidence of the complainant with ‘considerable care’ was her evidence regarding her past drug use. Kirby J has said that this evidence may have been used to put in issue whether the complainant was hallucinating on the night in question. However, I think that the inconsistency between the complainant’s evidence at trial (that she had only taken hallucinogenic drugs after the incident) and the medical records indicates that the credibility of the complainant was reduced in a general sense. Kirby J has noted that the complainant gave startlingly frank evidence regarding her drug use at the trial. I agree. However this evidence was regarding her drug use after the incidents the subject of the convictions and was, frankly, inconsistent with medical records. Further, the complainant’s prior inconsistent statements to other persons, Ms Dawson and Ms Williams, that the assaults were violent, were also relevant to the determination of the complainant’s overall credibility. 
     
      
    125 In other words, ‘when her evidence could be set against other reliable evidence, it failed to carry sufficient conviction to reach the criminal standard’, to adopt the language used in Jones at 455 per Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ.  
     
      
    126 The complainant gave evidence of the incident as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        He didn’t tell me to do anything straight away, we were still talking, still saying them things and I started, after I started crying I remember turning and looking out of the passenger window, because I was so scared, I remember asking, I remember felling, blaming Maria, I kept saying why Maria, why did you send me with him and I don’t know what happened, I stopped crying and I turned around to him and I started trying to talk to him nicely, because I thought maybe he was just drunk or maybe he was just upset and I thought, if I be nice to him he would stop and I talked to him and he kept going on about telling me that he was ugly and I didn’t want him and saying Shane was better than him and I told him, no you’re not ugly, I told him, Shane’s not better than you, I said to make him happy, so he wouldn’t hurt me, I just do it so it wouldn’t happen and I put my arm around him, I put my arm around him and I told him that I loved him and he pushed me away… 
        
       
      
    127 The appellant gave evidence denying that he had behaved erratically or that he spoke to the complainant in the way that she had testified. He said that he had wanted to have sexual intercourse with the complainant, but was not determined to have sexual intercourse with her. He said that he thought she was willing to have sexual intercourse because ‘she initiated things’ (T 344). 
     
      
    128 The jury were therefore presented with two totally divergent accounts of the incident. They must have accepted the complainant’s evidence regarding the behaviour of the appellant to convict him on counts 2 and 3 in the indictment; however they must have rejected that part of her recollection of the incident regarding the actual acts of sexual intercourse that had occurred. They must have rejected the evidence of the appellant regarding his behaviour on that night and rejected his belief that the complainant was consenting but accepted him in so far as he had told police that only one act of penile penetration had occurred. Kirby J has determined that the verdicts can be reconciled. I respectfully disagree. In my opinion, the observation of the trial judge that the jury would find it difficult to find a logical basis as to why the same verdict should not be returned for each of the three charges was correct. Having rejected the complainant’s version of the number of incidents of sexual assault the jury should have scrutinised the evidence of the complainant with ‘considerable care’ to determine if it carried ‘sufficient conviction’ to reach the criminal standard on the question of the appellant’s knowledge that she was not consenting. Since the Crown case was dependant entirely upon the evidence of the complainant to establish the appellant’s knowledge of the absence of her consent, in my opinion, once the jury rejected a crucial aspect of the complainant’s account of the incident, and accepted the appellant’s account, they should not have had sufficient confidence in the complainant’s account to convict the appellant on the other two counts.  
     
      
    129 I am satisfied that, on the whole of the evidence, I do not think it was reasonably open to the jury to convict the appellant on the two charges once they had acquitted the appellant of the first charge. The convictions are, in my opinion, unreasonable. I am also satisfied that the absence of a Markuleski direction meant that the appellant lost a fair chance of acquittal and that this resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    130 In these circumstances I would propose:  
     
      
    1) That the appeal be allowed; 
     
      
       
        
        2) That the convictions and sentences imposed upon the appellant be quashed; and 
        
       
       
        
        3) Enter verdicts of acquittal on counts 2 and 3 in the indictment.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BARR J: I agree with the judgement of Newman AJ.2 NEWMAN AJ: These are applications for leave to appeal brought by one Adrian Moshref and one Alan Dukino against sentences imposed upon them by His Honour Judge Nield in the District Court on the 4th of March 2003.3 Both pleaded guilty to offences arising from the same set of circumstances, however the form of indictments presented against them were different.4 In the case of Moshref he was charged with three counts of robbery in company. Two of those counts of robbery in company arose from events which occurred at Guildford Railway Station on the 22nd of February 2002 and the third count arose from events which occurred at the self same Railway Station on the 26th of February of the same year.5 In the case of Dukino the indictment presented against him contained but one count. That count of robbery in company related to the events which occurred on the 26th of February 2002 at Guildford Railway Station which constituted the 3rd count in the indictment presented against Moshref. The events which had occurred at Guildford Railway Station on the 22nd of February 2002 constituted the crimes contained in a Form 1 accompanying the indictment brought against him.6 In the event both men were sentenced to the self same terms of imprisonment. In the case of Moshref His Honour imposed in relation to the first two counts in the indictment a term of imprisonment for a fixed term of one year and nine months commencing on the 23rd of September 2002 and expiring on the 26th of June 2004. As to count 3 His Honour imposed a term of imprisonment for three years and three months commencing on the 23rd of June 2004 and expiring on the 22nd of September 2007 with a non-parole period of one year commencing on the 23rd of June 2004 and expiring on the 22nd of June 2005. In Moshref’s case this meant that His Honour in fact a total aggregate sentence of five years with a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on the 23rd of September 2002 and expiring on the 22nd of June 2005.7 In relation to Dukino his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of five years in relation to count 1 dating from the 6th of July 2002 and expiring on the 5th of July 2007. He set a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on the 6th of July 2002 and expiring on the 5th of April 2005. He imposed a parole period of two years and three months commencing on the 6th of February 2005 and expiring on the 5th of July 2007. In so sentencing His Honour stated that he had taken the matters contained in the Form 1 into account.8 The maximum penalty prescribed by section 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for the crime of a robbery in company is 20 years imprisonment.9 On the day when Dukino and Moshref were sentenced a third person who had taken part in the events of the 22nd and 26th of February 2002, one Haytham Youseff, was sentenced at the same time by His Honour. He had pleaded guilty to the self same counts on the indictment presented against him as were contained in the indictment which had been presented against Moshref. He received the self same sentence as Moshref and Dukino.10 No challenge was made to the facts found by His Honour as to what happened on the 22nd and 26th of February 2002 at Guildford Railway Station. Accordingly I set out His Honours finding: 
     
      
       
        
        “At about 6.30pm on 22 February 2002 Mr David O’Regan and Ms Mi Vi Do were sitting on a seat on one of the platforms at Guildford Railway Station when they were accosted by a group of young people. There were three young men and a young woman in the group. One of the young men crouched down in front of Mr O’Regan. The other two young men stood behind the young man crouched down in front of Mr O’Regan and the young woman stood in front of Ms Do. The three young men were Mr Youseff, Mr Moshref and Mr Dukino and the young woman was Ms Rebecca Bell. The young man crouching in front of Mr O’Regan demanded that Mr O’Regan hand over his mobile telephone and his wallet. When Mr O’Regan refused, the young man punched the left side of Mr O’Regan’s face with his closed right hand and took his mobile telephone. As this was happening, Ms Bell demanded that Ms Do hand over her bag. When Ms Do refused, Ms Bell threatened to hit her. In fear of what might happen to her, Ms Do opened her bag and removed her money from it, about $200, which she gave to Ms Bell. As this was happening, the man who had punched Mr O’Regan removed Mr O’Regan’s wallet from his pants pocket and, after going through it and removing a five dollar note from it, threw it back at Mr O’Regan. Then, Mr Youseff, Mr Moshref, Mr Dukino and Ms Bell ran off. As a result of the robbery, Mr O’Regan lost his mobile telephone, for which he had paid $170, and $5 cash money and Ms Do lost about $200 cash money.” 
        
       
       
      I should add that there was no issue that it was Moshref who struck Mr O’Regan. 
      
    11 His Honours findings continued as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “At about 6.50pm on 26 February 2002 Ms Tid Ang was performing her duties as a customer service attendant at Guildford Railway Station in the course of her employment with the State Rail Authority. After she had unlocked the locked door of the station-master’s office, in order to enter into the office, someone pushed her from behind and she turned around to see who had pushed her. She saw a young man. This young man hit her on her face with one of his hands, covered her mouth with the palm of one of his hands and pushed her into the office. Then she saw a second young man. This young man entered the office and, after putting his hands in the pockets of her uniform, removed a key from one of her pockets. Then the first young man pushed her onto the floor of the office and pushed her head against the floor. From where she was on the floor, she saw another two young men enter the office. On entering, one of these two young men kicked her left thigh and stood on her left foot. After taking about $480 from a drawer under the counter in the office, the four young men left the office. On their leaving, one of them kicked her left foot. Three of the four young men were Mr Youseff, Mr Moshref and Mr Dukino. As a result of the robbery, the State Rail Authority lost $480 cash money. As a result of being assaulted during the robbery, Ms Tid Ang suffered contusions to her lips, chin, right side of her face and left foot.” 
        
       
      
    12 As I have already noted the form of the indictments presented against Dukino and Moshref were different in form. However, when Dukino was first arraigned before His Honour Judge Nield on the 26th of September 2002 he in fact had an indictment presented against him containing the self same 3 counts as ultimately were contained in the indictment presented against Moshref. At that stage Dukino pleaded not-guilty to the 3 counts on the indictment. After discussion ensued between the Crown authorities and the solicitors for Dukino he was re-arraigned before Her Honour Judge Tupman on the 4th of November when he pleaded guilty to the indictment which by that stage had taken the form of the indictment before His Honour Judge Nield. Plainly enough it was a fact that when the matter was first before His Honour Judge Nield on the 26th of September when the applicant Dukino pleaded not-guilty which caused His Honour to find that his plea of guilty was not made at the first available instance. I shall return to this matter when dealing with the grounds of appeal raised on Dukino’s behalf.13 Moshref, Dukino and Youseff are all young men. When His Honour sentenced them on the 4th of March this year Moshref was aged 19 years and 5 months, Youseff 19 years and 4 months, and Dukino 21 years and 2 months. All three had, for young men of their age, appalling criminal records. Youseff had no less than 18 convictions including 3 for robbery in company, 2 for break, enter and steal, 1 for stealing from a person, 1 of larceny and 1 of possessing stolen property. In Dukino’s 17 convictions there were no less than 2 convictions for aggravated robbery, 1 for robbery in company, 1 for break, enter and steal, three for stealing from a person and 1 for possessing stolen property. Moshref had 9 convictions including 1 for robbery in company, 2 for break, enter and steal, 1 for stealing from a person and 1 for possessing stolen property.14 At the time of the commission of these offences Youssef was on bail on charges of stealing and possessing stolen property. Moshref was the subject of two good behaviour bonds at time of the commission of the offences, namely one for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a second good behaviour bond for the offences of stealing from a person, maliciously destroying property and two offences of breaking, entering and stealing. His Honour rightly conceded that the commission of the subject offences at the time when both were on conditional liberty was an aggravating feature.15 As no challenge was mounted to His Honour’s treatment of other subjective features relating to the two applicants, I do not believe that it necessary for me to detail them here. Accordingly, I shall now turn to the matters raised on behalf of the two applicants before this court. 
     
      
    Application of Dukino 
     
      
    16 The first ground of appeal raised on Mr Dukino’s behalf was that His Honour erred in allowing a discount of fifteen percent in relation to his plea of guilty, whereas he made an allowance of twenty-five percent in relation to the pleas of guilty to the three counts contained in the indictments presented against Moshref and Youseff.17 The discretion vested in a sentencing Judge to impose a lesser sentence because an accused person has pleaded guilty is to be found in section 22(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That section clearly states that in circumstances where an accused person has pleaded guilty the court “may” impose a lessor penalty. In the guideline judgement of R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ at 160 stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “(iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.” 
        
       
      
     His Honour had earlier said: 
     
      
       
        
        152. “In my opinion, the appropriate range for a discount is from 10-25 percent. 
         
         
        153. The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge.  
         
         
        154. There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          i. The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
          
          
          ii. The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        155. The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, eg. On the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial.” 
        
       
      
    18 Here the offence of robbery in company to which the applicant pleaded guilty on the 4th of November 2002 was the self same count to which he had entered a plea of not-guilty on the 26th of September 2002. While, as the Crown submits, he may have been persuaded to plead guilty to the 1 count on the indictment finally presented against him because the two charges arising from the events of the 22nd of February 2002 were placed on a Form 1, the fact remains that he did not plead guilty to the charge of robbery in company arising from the events of the 26th of February 2002 at the first opportunity. Accordingly I am of the view that His Honour did not fall into error in finding as he did. Accordingly I am of the view that this ground must fail.19 The second ground of appeal urged upon this court on behalf of Dukino was that he had a legitimate sense of grievance. His sentence was compared with that imposed upon Youssef and Moshref on the basis when the principles of parity are applied.20 The concept of parity in sentencing was clearly stated by Gibb CJ in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 where he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is obviously desirable that personas who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour did consider the concept of parity in sentencing in his remarks on sentence involving all three of the accused before him. He took into account the ages of the three offenders, the parts they played in the relevant offences, the fact that Youssef and Moshref were on conditional liberty at the time, and all other matters of relevance in sentencing the trio. His Honour appreciated that Dukino was somewhat older than the other two offenders and took this matter into account. In essence what His Honour did was to carry out a balancing exercise in which he considered all matters relevant to the three offenders. He concluded that having carried out that balancing exercise all three offenders should suffer the safe fate. In my view no error has been demonstrated in His Honours approach. Accordingly this ground of appeal must also fail.22 Finally it was submitted albeit without much conviction that the sentence in any event was manifestly excessive. As I have already noted the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of robbery in company is 20 years imprisonment. The statistics here before this court from the Judicial Commission indicated that the sentence imposed upon the applicant fell squarely within the range of sentences imposed for this offence. It also fell squarely within the framework of the guideline judgement in The Queen v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. It follows that I am of the view that this ground of appeal must also fail. I shall return to the orders which I propose at the completion of these reasons. 
     
      
    Application of Moshref 
     
      
    23 Essentially the first ground of appeal argued on behalf of this applicant was that because he had but 9 previous convictions at the time when His Honour sentenced him and Youseff had 18 and Dukino had 17 he should have received a lessor sentence, again in so arguing the principles of parity adumbrated in Lowe’s Case were urged upon the court.24 The use of criminal antecedents in the sentencing process involves a qualitative and not a quantitative process of reasoning. A person convicted of an offence who has no prior antecedents whatsoever may well expect, all other things being equal, to receive greater leniency from a court than a person who has a number of convictions for not only the self same offence but other offences. When I say all other things being equal it is obvious that a person with no prior criminal record who engages on a number of serial killings cannot expect to receive any leniency from the court even though he has an impeccable record prior to the commencement of his rampage. In the instant case the importance of the criminal antecedents in relation to all three of the persons who were sentenced by Judge Nield on the 4th of March this year was that their criminal histories indicated that the sentence imposed must contain a very powerful element of personal deterrence for each of them. In these circumstances the fact that Moshref had but 9 previous convictions whereas his co-offender had 17 and 18 convictions is not a matter which meant that His Honour had failed to properly apply the principles of parity in sentencing. This ground must fail.25 The second ground urged on behalf of the applicant Moshref was that His Honour failed to take into account the principles of totality. It is true that His Honour did not specifically refer to the concept of totality as such in his reasons. However, His Honour did state that the sentence (in relation to all three) should not exceed 5 years. His Honour did in Moshref’s case order that the sentences for the events of the 22nd of February, where there were two victims, should be served concurrently and the offence eof the 26th of February should be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively. In structuring the sentence against the applicant in the way he did His Honour in fact applied the principle of totality although he did not, as I have said, expressly say so. It follows that I am of the view that this ground must fail.26 Alternatively it was submitted that His Honour erred in finding that the applicant Moshref had only gone into custody on the 23rd of September 2002 whereas he had been in custody from the 3rd of July 2002 for breaching the terms of the good behaviour bonds to which I made reference earlier in this reasons. The matter was, as the transcript reveals, clearly raised before His Honour during submissions on sentence. The fact that His Honour did not mention this aspect in his reasons does not mean that in fact he had disregarded them. Indeed it is doubtful if a Judge of His Honour’s experience would overlook such a matter. Accordingly I am of a view that this ground must also fail.27 In relation to both appeals principles of parity loomed large. In determining the question of responsibility for what was a joint enterprise in which all participants were willing to assist the judgement of Carruthers in R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 at paragraphs [18]-[19] are instructive. His Honour there said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Insofar as the factual matters are concerned, it is, in my view, sufficient to notice the fact that the criminal law has always looked with great disfavour upon robbery in company. If two persons agree to perform a joint criminal enterprise, such as in the instant case of robbery of an unarmed, innocent bystander, then it is inappropriate to attempt to assess with any degree of precision the role which each played in the consummation of the criminal enterprise. 
         
         
        As English trial judges tend to say; the question is ‘Were they in it together?’ In this case the answer must be a resounding ‘yes’, and viewed from an objective point of view, the participants should bear equal responsibility for the commission of the offence. Each was there to assist the other.” 
        
       
      
    28 Even if His Honour had been found to be in error I am of the view that this court would in any event find that the sentence passed on both the applicants here was in the terms of section 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to be sentences “warranted in law”. As Lee AJ put it in R v Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fundamental function of the Court in an appeal under s 5(1) [of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912] id to determine whether some other sentence is “warranted at law”. It is not I mention the practice of the Court to increase sentences. A proper sentence is one which takes into account the objective seriousness of the crime and any aggravating features and then the circumstances subjective to the applicant or extraneous to the crime itself which permit leniency. It is that mix of circumstances which the sentencing judge must evaluate and there is usually considerable scope for disagreement as to the weight or significance to be given to the factors, which make up the total mix. 
         
         
        When an appeal is brought to the court under s 5(1) it may well be that the court will consider the sentence passed to be “warranted in law” even though the court may not be in agreement with the weight assigned by the sentencing judge to particular features, or his selection of the substantial matters which guide him to him conclusion. In such a case the appeal fails. Even where the court concludes that the judge has made a mistake of law, the court may still hold that the sentence is not excessive and should stand. A good illustration of such a case is  
        Oastler 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 7 October 1992).” 
        
       
      
    29 In both applications because of the importance of the matter to both applicants I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeals.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BARR J: I agree with the judgement of Newman AJ.2 NEWMAN AJ: These are applications for leave to appeal brought by one Adrian Moshref and one Alan Dukino against sentences imposed upon them by His Honour Judge Nield in the District Court on the 4th of March 2003.3 Both pleaded guilty to offences arising from the same set of circumstances, however the form of indictments presented against them were different.4 In the case of Moshref he was charged with three counts of robbery in company. Two of those counts of robbery in company arose from events which occurred at Guildford Railway Station on the 22nd of February 2002 and the third count arose from events which occurred at the self same Railway Station on the 26th of February of the same year.5 In the case of Dukino the indictment presented against him contained but one count. That count of robbery in company related to the events which occurred on the 26th of February 2002 at Guildford Railway Station which constituted the 3rd count in the indictment presented against Moshref. The events which had occurred at Guildford Railway Station on the 22nd of February 2002 constituted the crimes contained in a Form 1 accompanying the indictment brought against him.6 In the event both men were sentenced to the self same terms of imprisonment. In the case of Moshref His Honour imposed in relation to the first two counts in the indictment a term of imprisonment for a fixed term of one year and nine months commencing on the 23rd of September 2002 and expiring on the 26th of June 2004. As to count 3 His Honour imposed a term of imprisonment for three years and three months commencing on the 23rd of June 2004 and expiring on the 22nd of September 2007 with a non-parole period of one year commencing on the 23rd of June 2004 and expiring on the 22nd of June 2005. In Moshref’s case this meant that His Honour in fact a total aggregate sentence of five years with a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on the 23rd of September 2002 and expiring on the 22nd of June 2005.7 In relation to Dukino his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of five years in relation to count 1 dating from the 6th of July 2002 and expiring on the 5th of July 2007. He set a non-parole period of two years and nine months commencing on the 6th of July 2002 and expiring on the 5th of April 2005. He imposed a parole period of two years and three months commencing on the 6th of February 2005 and expiring on the 5th of July 2007. In so sentencing His Honour stated that he had taken the matters contained in the Form 1 into account.8 The maximum penalty prescribed by section 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for the crime of a robbery in company is 20 years imprisonment.9 On the day when Dukino and Moshref were sentenced a third person who had taken part in the events of the 22nd and 26th of February 2002, one Haytham Youseff, was sentenced at the same time by His Honour. He had pleaded guilty to the self same counts on the indictment presented against him as were contained in the indictment which had been presented against Moshref. He received the self same sentence as Moshref and Dukino.10 No challenge was made to the facts found by His Honour as to what happened on the 22nd and 26th of February 2002 at Guildford Railway Station. Accordingly I set out His Honours finding: 
     
      
       
        
        “At about 6.30pm on 22 February 2002 Mr David O’Regan and Ms Mi Vi Do were sitting on a seat on one of the platforms at Guildford Railway Station when they were accosted by a group of young people. There were three young men and a young woman in the group. One of the young men crouched down in front of Mr O’Regan. The other two young men stood behind the young man crouched down in front of Mr O’Regan and the young woman stood in front of Ms Do. The three young men were Mr Youseff, Mr Moshref and Mr Dukino and the young woman was Ms Rebecca Bell. The young man crouching in front of Mr O’Regan demanded that Mr O’Regan hand over his mobile telephone and his wallet. When Mr O’Regan refused, the young man punched the left side of Mr O’Regan’s face with his closed right hand and took his mobile telephone. As this was happening, Ms Bell demanded that Ms Do hand over her bag. When Ms Do refused, Ms Bell threatened to hit her. In fear of what might happen to her, Ms Do opened her bag and removed her money from it, about $200, which she gave to Ms Bell. As this was happening, the man who had punched Mr O’Regan removed Mr O’Regan’s wallet from his pants pocket and, after going through it and removing a five dollar note from it, threw it back at Mr O’Regan. Then, Mr Youseff, Mr Moshref, Mr Dukino and Ms Bell ran off. As a result of the robbery, Mr O’Regan lost his mobile telephone, for which he had paid $170, and $5 cash money and Ms Do lost about $200 cash money.” 
        
       
       
      I should add that there was no issue that it was Moshref who struck Mr O’Regan. 
      
    11 His Honours findings continued as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “At about 6.50pm on 26 February 2002 Ms Tid Ang was performing her duties as a customer service attendant at Guildford Railway Station in the course of her employment with the State Rail Authority. After she had unlocked the locked door of the station-master’s office, in order to enter into the office, someone pushed her from behind and she turned around to see who had pushed her. She saw a young man. This young man hit her on her face with one of his hands, covered her mouth with the palm of one of his hands and pushed her into the office. Then she saw a second young man. This young man entered the office and, after putting his hands in the pockets of her uniform, removed a key from one of her pockets. Then the first young man pushed her onto the floor of the office and pushed her head against the floor. From where she was on the floor, she saw another two young men enter the office. On entering, one of these two young men kicked her left thigh and stood on her left foot. After taking about $480 from a drawer under the counter in the office, the four young men left the office. On their leaving, one of them kicked her left foot. Three of the four young men were Mr Youseff, Mr Moshref and Mr Dukino. As a result of the robbery, the State Rail Authority lost $480 cash money. As a result of being assaulted during the robbery, Ms Tid Ang suffered contusions to her lips, chin, right side of her face and left foot.” 
        
       
      
    12 As I have already noted the form of the indictments presented against Dukino and Moshref were different in form. However, when Dukino was first arraigned before His Honour Judge Nield on the 26th of September 2002 he in fact had an indictment presented against him containing the self same 3 counts as ultimately were contained in the indictment presented against Moshref. At that stage Dukino pleaded not-guilty to the 3 counts on the indictment. After discussion ensued between the Crown authorities and the solicitors for Dukino he was re-arraigned before Her Honour Judge Tupman on the 4th of November when he pleaded guilty to the indictment which by that stage had taken the form of the indictment before His Honour Judge Nield. Plainly enough it was a fact that when the matter was first before His Honour Judge Nield on the 26th of September when the applicant Dukino pleaded not-guilty which caused His Honour to find that his plea of guilty was not made at the first available instance. I shall return to this matter when dealing with the grounds of appeal raised on Dukino’s behalf.13 Moshref, Dukino and Youseff are all young men. When His Honour sentenced them on the 4th of March this year Moshref was aged 19 years and 5 months, Youseff 19 years and 4 months, and Dukino 21 years and 2 months. All three had, for young men of their age, appalling criminal records. Youseff had no less than 18 convictions including 3 for robbery in company, 2 for break, enter and steal, 1 for stealing from a person, 1 of larceny and 1 of possessing stolen property. In Dukino’s 17 convictions there were no less than 2 convictions for aggravated robbery, 1 for robbery in company, 1 for break, enter and steal, three for stealing from a person and 1 for possessing stolen property. Moshref had 9 convictions including 1 for robbery in company, 2 for break, enter and steal, 1 for stealing from a person and 1 for possessing stolen property.14 At the time of the commission of these offences Youssef was on bail on charges of stealing and possessing stolen property. Moshref was the subject of two good behaviour bonds at time of the commission of the offences, namely one for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a second good behaviour bond for the offences of stealing from a person, maliciously destroying property and two offences of breaking, entering and stealing. His Honour rightly conceded that the commission of the subject offences at the time when both were on conditional liberty was an aggravating feature.15 As no challenge was mounted to His Honour’s treatment of other subjective features relating to the two applicants, I do not believe that it necessary for me to detail them here. Accordingly, I shall now turn to the matters raised on behalf of the two applicants before this court. 
     
      
    Application of Dukino 
     
      
    16 The first ground of appeal raised on Mr Dukino’s behalf was that His Honour erred in allowing a discount of fifteen percent in relation to his plea of guilty, whereas he made an allowance of twenty-five percent in relation to the pleas of guilty to the three counts contained in the indictments presented against Moshref and Youseff.17 The discretion vested in a sentencing Judge to impose a lesser sentence because an accused person has pleaded guilty is to be found in section 22(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That section clearly states that in circumstances where an accused person has pleaded guilty the court “may” impose a lessor penalty. In the guideline judgement of R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, Spigelman CJ at 160 stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “(iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.” 
        
       
      
     His Honour had earlier said: 
     
      
       
        
        152. “In my opinion, the appropriate range for a discount is from 10-25 percent. 
         
         
        153. The determination of where, within such a range, the discount should fall in a particular case is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge.  
         
         
        154. There are however two circumstances which will generally affect the appropriate level of discount in a particular case: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          i. The time at which a plea is entered. A plea entered at committal has a more significant utilitarian benefit than a plea entered at first listing, which in turn has the greater benefit than a plea entered at the beginning of trial. 
          
          
          ii. The complexity of the issues about which evidence will have to be gathered and adduced affects the value of the plea. The greater the difficulty of assembling the relevant evidence and the greater the length and complexity of the trial, the greater the utilitarian value of a plea. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        155. The top of the range would be expected to be restricted to pleas at the earliest possible opportunity and should not be given, save in an exceptional case, after a matter has been set down for trial. A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas, eg. On the date fixed for trial, unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial.” 
        
       
      
    18 Here the offence of robbery in company to which the applicant pleaded guilty on the 4th of November 2002 was the self same count to which he had entered a plea of not-guilty on the 26th of September 2002. While, as the Crown submits, he may have been persuaded to plead guilty to the 1 count on the indictment finally presented against him because the two charges arising from the events of the 22nd of February 2002 were placed on a Form 1, the fact remains that he did not plead guilty to the charge of robbery in company arising from the events of the 26th of February 2002 at the first opportunity. Accordingly I am of the view that His Honour did not fall into error in finding as he did. Accordingly I am of the view that this ground must fail.19 The second ground of appeal urged upon this court on behalf of Dukino was that he had a legitimate sense of grievance. His sentence was compared with that imposed upon Youssef and Moshref on the basis when the principles of parity are applied.20 The concept of parity in sentencing was clearly stated by Gibb CJ in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 where he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is obviously desirable that personas who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour did consider the concept of parity in sentencing in his remarks on sentence involving all three of the accused before him. He took into account the ages of the three offenders, the parts they played in the relevant offences, the fact that Youssef and Moshref were on conditional liberty at the time, and all other matters of relevance in sentencing the trio. His Honour appreciated that Dukino was somewhat older than the other two offenders and took this matter into account. In essence what His Honour did was to carry out a balancing exercise in which he considered all matters relevant to the three offenders. He concluded that having carried out that balancing exercise all three offenders should suffer the safe fate. In my view no error has been demonstrated in His Honours approach. Accordingly this ground of appeal must also fail.22 Finally it was submitted albeit without much conviction that the sentence in any event was manifestly excessive. As I have already noted the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of robbery in company is 20 years imprisonment. The statistics here before this court from the Judicial Commission indicated that the sentence imposed upon the applicant fell squarely within the range of sentences imposed for this offence. It also fell squarely within the framework of the guideline judgement in The Queen v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. It follows that I am of the view that this ground of appeal must also fail. I shall return to the orders which I propose at the completion of these reasons. 
     
      
    Application of Moshref 
     
      
    23 Essentially the first ground of appeal argued on behalf of this applicant was that because he had but 9 previous convictions at the time when His Honour sentenced him and Youseff had 18 and Dukino had 17 he should have received a lessor sentence, again in so arguing the principles of parity adumbrated in Lowe’s Case were urged upon the court.24 The use of criminal antecedents in the sentencing process involves a qualitative and not a quantitative process of reasoning. A person convicted of an offence who has no prior antecedents whatsoever may well expect, all other things being equal, to receive greater leniency from a court than a person who has a number of convictions for not only the self same offence but other offences. When I say all other things being equal it is obvious that a person with no prior criminal record who engages on a number of serial killings cannot expect to receive any leniency from the court even though he has an impeccable record prior to the commencement of his rampage. In the instant case the importance of the criminal antecedents in relation to all three of the persons who were sentenced by Judge Nield on the 4th of March this year was that their criminal histories indicated that the sentence imposed must contain a very powerful element of personal deterrence for each of them. In these circumstances the fact that Moshref had but 9 previous convictions whereas his co-offender had 17 and 18 convictions is not a matter which meant that His Honour had failed to properly apply the principles of parity in sentencing. This ground must fail.25 The second ground urged on behalf of the applicant Moshref was that His Honour failed to take into account the principles of totality. It is true that His Honour did not specifically refer to the concept of totality as such in his reasons. However, His Honour did state that the sentence (in relation to all three) should not exceed 5 years. His Honour did in Moshref’s case order that the sentences for the events of the 22nd of February, where there were two victims, should be served concurrently and the offence eof the 26th of February should be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively. In structuring the sentence against the applicant in the way he did His Honour in fact applied the principle of totality although he did not, as I have said, expressly say so. It follows that I am of the view that this ground must fail.26 Alternatively it was submitted that His Honour erred in finding that the applicant Moshref had only gone into custody on the 23rd of September 2002 whereas he had been in custody from the 3rd of July 2002 for breaching the terms of the good behaviour bonds to which I made reference earlier in this reasons. The matter was, as the transcript reveals, clearly raised before His Honour during submissions on sentence. The fact that His Honour did not mention this aspect in his reasons does not mean that in fact he had disregarded them. Indeed it is doubtful if a Judge of His Honour’s experience would overlook such a matter. Accordingly I am of a view that this ground must also fail.27 In relation to both appeals principles of parity loomed large. In determining the question of responsibility for what was a joint enterprise in which all participants were willing to assist the judgement of Carruthers in R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 at paragraphs [18]-[19] are instructive. His Honour there said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Insofar as the factual matters are concerned, it is, in my view, sufficient to notice the fact that the criminal law has always looked with great disfavour upon robbery in company. If two persons agree to perform a joint criminal enterprise, such as in the instant case of robbery of an unarmed, innocent bystander, then it is inappropriate to attempt to assess with any degree of precision the role which each played in the consummation of the criminal enterprise. 
         
         
        As English trial judges tend to say; the question is ‘Were they in it together?’ In this case the answer must be a resounding ‘yes’, and viewed from an objective point of view, the participants should bear equal responsibility for the commission of the offence. Each was there to assist the other.” 
        
       
      
    28 Even if His Honour had been found to be in error I am of the view that this court would in any event find that the sentence passed on both the applicants here was in the terms of section 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to be sentences “warranted in law”. As Lee AJ put it in R v Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289: 
     
      
       
        
        “The fundamental function of the Court in an appeal under s 5(1) [of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912] id to determine whether some other sentence is “warranted at law”. It is not I mention the practice of the Court to increase sentences. A proper sentence is one which takes into account the objective seriousness of the crime and any aggravating features and then the circumstances subjective to the applicant or extraneous to the crime itself which permit leniency. It is that mix of circumstances which the sentencing judge must evaluate and there is usually considerable scope for disagreement as to the weight or significance to be given to the factors, which make up the total mix. 
         
         
        When an appeal is brought to the court under s 5(1) it may well be that the court will consider the sentence passed to be “warranted in law” even though the court may not be in agreement with the weight assigned by the sentencing judge to particular features, or his selection of the substantial matters which guide him to him conclusion. In such a case the appeal fails. Even where the court concludes that the judge has made a mistake of law, the court may still hold that the sentence is not excessive and should stand. A good illustration of such a case is  
        Oastler 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 7 October 1992).” 
        
       
      
    29 In both applications because of the importance of the matter to both applicants I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeals.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: In the matter of Christou the Court is in a position to give judgment. I will call upon Howie J to give the first judgment.  
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on the application by his Honour Judge Shadbolt on 22 May 2003. There is a single ground of appeal being the asserted disparity with the sentence imposed upon a co-offender, Anthony Vinton. 
     
      
    3 The applicant pleaded guilty on arraignment to an indictment containing a single count of receiving contrary to s 188 of the Crimes Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for ten years. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year. The sentence commenced on 13 May 2003 and the applicant is to be released to parole on 12 May 2004. 
     
      
       
      His Honour imposed upon the co-offender, Vinton, a sentence of the same length as that imposed upon the applicant. However, Vinton had pleaded guilty to two offences, being a break, enter and steal of a dwelling house and stealing a motor vehicle, those offences being committed on 8 July 2002. In addition he was also sentenced for an offence of break, enter and steal committed on 1 March 2000. The applicant complains that having regard to the more serious criminality for which the co-offender was to be punished, she has a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the fact that she received a sentence of the same severity as that imposed upon him. 
       
      
    4 Little time needs to be taken in reciting the facts of the offence for which the applicant was to be sentenced. The applicant and her co-offender were arrested by police on 8 July 2002 attempting to pawn property that had been stolen earlier that day from a private house in Woronora. A large amount of property had been stolen from that home by Vinton. The applicant had initially been charged with breaking, entering and stealing but on the day of her trial for that offence pleaded guilty to receiving.  
     
      
    5 Judge Shadbolt sentenced Vinton before he sentenced the applicant. In sentencing the co-offender his Honour was confronted with the task of sentencing a person who was then serving a sentence and had been in custody since the date of his arrest, 8 July 2002. His Honour made the sentences for the offences, with which he was concerned, cumulative to the sentence then being served and found special circumstances for reducing the otherwise appropriate non-parole period. The result was that Vinton was to serve a total period in custody of three years and two months from 8 July 2002 with an effective non-parole period of two years and two months. 
     
      
    6 In support of the ground of appeal the applicant points to the fact that, not only was Vinton sentenced for more offences than she was, but also that he was on parole at the time that those offences were committed. On the other hand Vinton had given evidence before Judge Shadbolt, he had expressed remorse, he had undertaken some courses in prison to address his drug addiction and he had arranged accommodation and employment upon his release. When sentencing Vinton, his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “There comes a time when a man of twenty-six really ought to come to terms with his background and that time is fast approaching. There is also a time when the courts, in despair of a prisoner ever actually rehabilitating himself, look to the community requirements for some safety for their property and use ever heavier sentences. I am not persuaded that that time has arrived on this occasion but it certainly would arrive on the next. 
        
       
       
        
        I have got a problem in sentencing this prisoner because he has been serving [a] sentence since July last year, and will have been in prison approximately fourteen months before this sentence commences. In the light of that I have to see that there is an adequate period of supervision so that he is not left entirely to his own resources and might well fall back into drug use again.” 
        
       
      
    7 At the end of his sentencing remarks the following exchange occurred between the sentencing judge and Vinton: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is the last time that you are going to get what are regarded as short sentences. The next time you come in you really have to look forward to 4 or 5 years in prison. Do you understand that? 
        
       
       
        
        OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You must seize this opportunity in that year. You will be under supervision, in that year, of the Probation and Parole Service and you must use that period to finally rid yourself of drug use, of all drugs, do you understand that? 
        
       
       
        
        OFFENDER: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Just do not replace one with another.” 
        
       
      
    8 It should be said that the sentences imposed upon Vinton were lenient in light of the nature of the offences, his record, and the fact that he was on parole at the time he committed the offences. However, one of the offences was a stale matter his involvement in which was discovered while he was in custody and would have attracted little extra punishment. It is clear that Judge Shadbolt, one of the most experienced judges on the District Court, formed the view that Vinton was worthy of an attempt to stimulate his efforts to reform on one further, but final, occasion. 
     
      
    9 The applicant presented his Honour with a different sentencing problem. Like her co-offender the applicant was also aged twenty-six years at the date of sentence. She was also a drug addict with a record for offences of dishonesty. The similarity continues in that the applicant was also subject to conditional liberty when she committed the offence for which she was to be sentenced. At the time of the offence the applicant was subject to good behaviour bonds imposed in the District Court and the Local Court in relation to offences of dishonesty. However, unlike the co-offender her prospects for rehabilitation were poor. 
     
      
    10 There were two pre-sentence reports in evidence. The first stated that a full report could not be prepared because the applicant had failed to make herself available for the preparation of the report. It noted that in 1998 the applicant received a supervised recognisance and a community service order for 150 hours. However, the order was revoked because of the applicant’s unsuitability due to her drug dependency and a further good behaviour bond was substituted for it. In the year 2000 the applicant was placed on two good behaviour bonds in the Local Court and, despite the fact that she subsequently breached those bonds, no action was taken by the Court. In October 2001 the applicant received a prison sentence but on appeal to the District Court, the sentence was quashed and a further good behaviour bond was substituted. That bond expired in May 2003. In July 2002 the applicant received yet another good behaviour bond for eighteen months. 
     
      
    11 The report concluded with the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender’s long-standing drug dependency appears to be an ongoing factor in [the applicant’s] offending behaviour. Since 1998 this Service has made repeated attempts to assist [the applicant] to address her drug issues, however she has demonstrated little motivation towards cooperating with these initiatives. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst on supervision for her current orders [the applicant] has been directed on a number of occasions to attend counselling in relation to her drug issues, and abuse issues, the offender has made short lived attempts to address these issues, and has not shown a genuine commitment to a more responsible lifestyle. More recently [the applicant’s] progress has diminished as she has failed to report to this Service in relation to supervision and preparation of this report, she has not been available for home visits that were made, she has failed to contact a number of Services in relation to her issues and has discontinued in the Methadone Program. Subsequently this Service has recommended that [the applicant] is not suitable for any community based sentencing options and Periodic Detention.” 
        
       
      
    12 The second report disclosed more information in relation to the applicant but was no more encouraging. It noted that inquiries with the applicant’s mother indicated that she believed the applicant had developed her abuse of drugs as a result of two sexual assaults committed upon the applicant when she was a teenager. The applicant has a four year old son who resides with her mother. The report indicated that the applicant had resisted all attempts to assist her in overcoming her drug abuse. It stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The applicant] began collecting Methadone from a new clinic on 3 January 2003. Discussion with that clinic revealed that [the applicant] was removed from the program on 10 March 2003 due to her poor attendance to collect her dosage and because she was aggressive towards staff. Three urinalysis tests conducted [by] the clinic revealed she continued to use illicit drugs. Counselling was offered by the clinic but [the applicant] refused to attend. Since 10 March 2003 [the applicant] has not been prescribed any pharmacotherapeutic treatment and her drug problem remains unresolved.” 
        
       
      
    13 The officer preparing the report was of the view that the applicant remained at risk of re-offending by reason of her failure to accept counselling in relation to the sexual assaults or her drug abuse. 
     
      
    14 There was in evidence a psychological report which contained the following statement: 
     
      
       
        
        “The applicant is convincing in her assertions that she would like to lead a drug free, law-abiding lifestyle and ultimately resume full-time care and custody of her son.” 
        
       
       
      In light of the material contained in the pre-sentence reports, little regard could be given to such an opinion even if it were reliable. 
       
      
    15 It is clear, in my view, beyond argument that his Honour had no alternative but to impose a full-time gaol sentence upon the applicant. She was found to be unsuitable for any of the other sentencing options. She had been repeatedly given opportunities to reform when various courts had extended to her what appears to be unjustified and ultimately undeserved leniency. In my view the only arguable error in the sentence imposed upon the applicant was that his Honour found that there were special circumstances.  
     
      
    16 However, the applicant’s argument in this Court in relation to parity must be founded on the premise that the sentence imposed by his Honour on the applicant was otherwise an appropriate one. I am prepared to accept, for present purposes, that the majority decision in Postiglione v The Queen (1996) 189 CLR 295 should be taken to hold that apparent disparity cannot be justified on the basis of the application of the principle of totality. However, it has been held that there was no ratio decidendi in the High Court to that effect. In Regina v Rutter [2003] NSWCCA 306 this Court made it be clear that the issue of parity cannot be addressed on any superficial basis of simply having regard to the sentence and the relevant facts and circumstances relating to the two offenders. 
     
      
    17 The Court may have to go further and look at each of the sentencing discretions exercised to see whether the apparent disparity is in fact justified. That is especially so where the two sentences were imposed by the same judge or where the allegedly disparate sentence was imposed by a judge who was fully aware of the other sentence and the reasons for it. 
     
      
    18 In the present case, the same judge sentenced both offenders and the sentence imposed upon the applicant was imposed secondly. It can, therefore, be assumed that his Honour imposed the sentence on the applicant fully conscious of what he had done in respect of the co-offender. It is not a case of his Honour simply overlooking some aspect of the facts or circumstances involving Vinton when he sentenced the applicant. In such a case the person asserting disparity may have a difficult field to plough to show that this Court should intervene, notwithstanding that the second sentence was otherwise an appropriate one. 
     
      
    19 But in the present case, and not withstanding the undoubted experience of the sentencing judge, it seems to me that apparent disparity between the sentence imposed upon Vinton and that imposed upon the applicant cannot be justified by the reasons given by his Honour for imposing the same sentence on the applicant as that imposed upon Vinton, even though the objective and subjective circumstances called for a heavier overall sentence than that imposed upon the applicant. The criminality for which the applicant was to be sentenced was on any assessment less than that for which Vinton was to be sentenced, even making allowances for the fact that one of the offences was stale and the other two were related. Generally speaking, an offence of break, enter and steal is more serious than an offence of receiving. The consideration of the respective maximum sentences for the two offences and the objective criminality involved in each is enough to make good that proposition.  
     
      
    20 There will be cases where a particular act of receiving may be more serious than a particular act of break, enter and stealing and call for a heavier sentence, notwithstanding the different maximum penalties. There was no reason for such a result in the present case, nor is there any reason to treat the criminality in the particular circumstances of the offences as being equal. Unfortunately, there are remarks made by his Honour in the course of sentencing submissions made on behalf of the applicant which tend to suggest that his Honour was in the present case treating the criminality in the applicant’s act of receiving as indistinguishable from the criminality in Vinton’s act in breaking into the house and stealing the property.  
     
      
    21 The Crown had resiled from its assertion that the applicant was a party to the breaking and entering and his Honour was not entitled to consider that she was. Further, from other remarks his Honour made he seemed to be placing too much weight on the old adage that a receiver was twice as bad as a thief. That might be so when one is contrasting the penalty for simple larceny which is five years and the penalty for receiving which is ten years. It might be so if one comparing a professional fence with a person who has committed an isolated burglary in order to receive money from the receiver of the goods. But that was not this case. 
     
      
    22 I appreciate this Court should not place too much weight upon what is said in argument as compared with what is said in a judgment or considered remarks on sentence, but the exchange does indicate why, other than for reasons of totality, his Honour may have imposed the same sentences on the applicant and Vinton. 
     
      
    23 Current sentencing practice arising after the decision in Pearce (1998) 194 CLR 610 requires that considerations of totality be reflected in the structure of the sentences rather than in the length of any particular sentence. Therefore his Honour should be taken as having viewed the criminality of the offences for which he was sentencing Vinton as being reflected in the sentences that he actually imposed. If totality was an issue it was to be addressed by determining when those sentences were to commence in relation to the sentence then being served by Vinton. 
     
      
    24 There is, in my respectful opinion, no basis upon which his Honour could have legitimately determined that the criminality of Vinton was identical with the criminality of the applicant such that the same sentence should be imposed. Any consideration that his Honour formed about the prospects of rehabilitation of Vinton and which he sought to encourage could not permit him to impose a sentence which was not commensurate with his criminality. Such a consideration, as is evidenced by both the sentence and his Honour’s remarks, was principally to be reflected in the specification of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    25 The applicant could not expect any great leniency from his Honour and did not deserve any. She was to some degree fortunate to have a finding of special circumstances made in her favour but there was nothing that could justify, either in her eyes or to a reasonable observer, the same sentence being imposed upon her as was imposed upon Vinton in view of the markedly different criminality for which they were being sentenced.  
     
      
    26 The applicant is entitled to retain the finding in her favour of special circumstances notwithstanding that it is difficult to find any justification for it. Although her counsel on this appeal suggested that it was a case of her now having heard the prison door shut, she had heard that sound once before with no consequential change to her behaviour. Still she is at a stage in her life where, like Vinton, if any change is to occur to the pattern of her behaviour, it might occur now. 
     
      
    27 Once again the sentence which I believe should now be imposed is a considerable act of leniency to which the applicant is not entitled and has only arisen because of the sentence imposed upon her co-offender.  
     
      
    28 I propose that the application for leave be granted, the appeal allowed and the sentence imposed by Judge Shadbolt be quashed. In lieu the applicant should be sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen months to date from 22 May 2003. There is to be a non-parole period of seven months to expire on 22 December 2003, the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole. It is to be a condition of her parole that she place herself under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    29 JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Howie J and that the orders proposed by his Honour. The orders of the Court will be as proposed by his Honour. Is there any further matter? 
     
      
    30 HAMILL: There is one further matter and that is your Honours will see from the particulars of trial that a sentence imposed in the Penrith District Court as a consequence of a breach of recognisance was ordered to commence on 12 May 2004.  
     
      
       
      HOWIE J: 
       Yes but that can be taken up in that court can’t it? 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       My understanding of s 59 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       is that a court that quashes or varies a sentence may vary the date of commencement of any other sentence. 
       
       
      HOWIE J: 
       What section is this? 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       S 59(1). 
       
       
      HOWIE J: 
       We could do it or it could go back to the magistrate could it not? 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       It’s possible it could go back. I’d invite the Court to - certainly the Court has the power and it will save ultimately resources if such an order is made.  
       
       
      HOWIE J: 
       When was the-- 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       15 August ’03 in the Penrith District Court there was a two month sentence to date from 12 May to 11 July 2004.  
       
       
      JAMES J: 
       The sentence that we’ve quashed was a sentence of two years from 22 May ’03.  
       
       
      HOWIE J: 
       It was from 12 May, I made it from 22 May. 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       The application is that the commencement date of the sentence which is the fourth one of the particular trial at post is that that commencement date would now be 23 December 2003.  
       
       
      HOWIE J: 
       Our attempts to have her released for Christmas have been proved futile have they? 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       That’s correct. She might be there for her son’s first day of school. I’m told she won’t be. 
       
       
      HOWIE J: 
       Tell us the order that you would have us make? 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       That there be a variation under s 59 of the commencement date of the sentence imposed at the Penrith District Court on 15 August 2003 so that the commencement date becomes 24 December 2003 and the expiry date 22 February 2004 
       
       
      JAMES J: 
       It’s only two months is it? 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       It’s a two months sentence yes.  
       
       
      JAMES J: 
       Do you want to say anything about this Mr Crown? 
       
       
      FREARSON: 
       It should commence at the expiration of the non-parole period, the sentence just imposed would make it in December 2003. 
       
       
      JAMES J: 
       That’s what’s proposed isn’t it? 
       
       
      HAMILL: 
       I don’t object. 
       
      
    31 JAMES J: Pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the Court varies the date of commencement of the sentence imposed on the applicant in the Penrith District Court on 15 August 2003, being a sentence of a fixed term of two months, so that that sentence will commence on 23 December 2003.

     R v SAMUEL MASON 
      
      
     Judgment 
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 3 May 2002, Samuel Mason (the appellant) was convicted by a jury of the charge of robbery with an offensive weapon. On 7 November 2002, Judge O'Reilly sentenced the appellant to 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months. This appeal concerns only the appellant's conviction.  
     
      
       
      The facts 
      
    2 The offence charged related to an armed robbery at a Video Ezy outlet in Woodcroft, a suburb west of Sydney, at approximately 3.00 pm on 3 August 1999. The manager of that store at all material times was Joseph McGrath (Mr McGrath). On the date and time in question, he was serving a customer, Mr Azzopardi. A man entered, approached Mr McGrath and said, 'open the till'. He refused at first. The man then produced a screwdriver and said 'don't be silly'. A second man said, 'hurry up, open the safe'. The first man grabbed some Nintendo games, put them in a bag and ran out of the store. The second man said, 'don't move or you're dead'. The second man then left the store. 
     
      
    3 According to Mr McGrath, the first robber (on the Crown case, the appellant) was slightly taller than himself (178 cm), stocky, an Islander with dark skin, flattish nose, dark eyes and short sideburns. He was wearing a large, dark-coloured jacket, a beanie and light coloured jeans. He was unable to recognise the first man from the photographs shown to him by police.  
     
      
    4 The second robber had blonde hair and a lot of acne on his face. He was wearing an American 'baseball, football, windcheater type thing', which had red, white and blue colouring, although the predominant colour was white. 
     
      
    5 The customer described the first robber as being an Islander with staring, bulging eyes, chubby cheeks, a flattish nose, dark skin, about 5'10"", of solid build and clean-shaven. He was wearing a black tracksuit with a maroon-coloured beanie.  
     
      
    6 The customer described the second robber as being shorter and younger, white-skinned with blonde/brown hair. He said that after the robbery, the two men rushed out of the store and got into a grey/silver Holden Commodore. The Islander got into the passenger seat whilst the younger white male got into the driver's seat. The customer was unable to see the registration number of the vehicle. 
     
      
    7 On 10 October 1999, the customer was asked to attend the police station to see if he could identify a photograph of the men he saw in the store. From a group of ten photographs he recognised the appellant. 
     
      
    8 On 5 August 1999, Detective Senior Constable Keating (Detective Keating) arrested the appellant in the vicinity of Dell Street, Woodpark. At the time of his arrest, the appellant was in the front of a silver Holden Commodore, registration number KHI 443. Next to the appellant were some clothes, comprising a blue Puma sweatshirt, grey tracksuit pants and a pair of white sandshoes. Keating took possession of the clothing and established that they belonged to the appellant.  
     
      
       
      The statutory provisions 
      
    9 The major issue at the trial was one of identification. To this end, the Crown had given notice pursuant to ss 97(1)(a) and 98(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 that it intended to adduce at the trial both tendency and coincidence evidence. Relevantly, those provisions are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""97(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person's character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence; or 
           
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
          
         
        
       
      
    (2) Paragraph (1)(a) does not apply if: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100; or 
           
          (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party. 
          
         
        … 
         
        98(1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if: 
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party's intention to adduce the evidence; or 
           
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
          
         
        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if: 
         
          
          (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar; and 
           
          (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. 
          
         
        …"" 
        
       
      
    10 Relevant also is s 101(2) of the Evidence Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant."" 
        
       
       
      The tendency and coincidence evidence relied upon by the Crown 
       
      
    11 For the purposes of determining the admissibility of the evidence in respect of which the Crown had given notice pursuant to ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act, a number of statements were tendered on the voir dire as evidence of other offences allegedly committed by the appellant. Exhibit D on the voir dire was a statement of Catherine Joy Orth, the owner of a silver-coloured 1990 Holden Commodore sedan registration number KHI 443. Her statement was that she had parked her vehicle at approximately 8.50am on Tuesday 3 August 1999 on the third level in the Metro Car Park of Liverpool Hospital. At about 2.10pm, a security officer informed her that he had seen two young persons drive her car away. 
     
      
    12 Exhibit E on the voir dire was a statement of Peter Cheng, the part owner of the Minchinbury Newsagency. Mr Cheng gave evidence that at 3.30 pm on 3 August 1999, at which time he was working at the store, a dark-skinned man, at least 6' tall walked into the shop. The man said something to Mr Cheng that he was unable to understand. The cash register drawer was open and Mr Cheng saw the man run around the counter and take money from drawer. He then saw him run to a silver Holden Commodore registration number KHI 443. There was someone in the driver's seat of the vehicle but he was unable to see what he looked like. Mr Cheng described the robber as being very tall, around 6', with a big build and dark skin. He was wearing blue coloured clothing (the shirt and trousers being almost identical in colour). Mr Cheng did not see him holding any weapon. 
     
      
    13 Exhibit F on the voir dire was a statement of Ian Zaknich. He was the owner of the St Johns Park Pharmacy. At approximately 1.30pm on Thursday 5 August 1999, he was serving a customer at the counter when a man of Maori appearance entered the store. He left when a deliveryman entered, but then re-entered the store. Mr Zaknich then asked him, 'Can I help you?' The man said, 'Have you got a bandaid for my cut?' Mr Zaknich gave him a packet of bandaids then turned his back. He then heard the man say, 'You know the drill, open the till'. He was holding in his right hand a screwdriver which was about 10cm long. He was pointing the screwdriver at him but he could not see the handle. The robber took money from the cash register and then ran out of the store, getting into the front passenger side of a silver Holden Commodore Sedan registration number KHI 443. Mr Zaknich did not see the driver of the car.  
     
      
    14 Mr Zaknich later described the robber to police as 'looking like a Maori in his 20's, about 6' or 6'1"", solid build, dark complexion, dark brown eyes. He was wearing a dark-coloured beanie, dark blue jumper and dark coloured pants. He spoke with what sounded like a Maori accent.' 
     
      
    15 I have already related the evidence of Detective Keating, who arrested the appellant at about 2.00pm on 5 August 1999.  
     
      
       
      The determination of the trial judge as to the admissibility of the tendency or coincidence evidence 
       
      
    16 The trial judge noted in his judgment of 1 May 2002 that in order for the evidence to be admissible, it was necessary for the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        ""to establish if there is the necessary degree of striking similarity between the Woodcroft incident and the three incidents upon which the Crown wishes to rely under ss 97 and 98"". 
        
       
      
    17 The trial judge then outlined the evidence relating to the theft of the Holden Commodore and to the armed robberies at the St Johns Park Pharmacy and the Minchinbury newsagency. In respect of these three events, his Honour noted that the appellant had pleaded guilty to offences arising out of each of them. He further observed that there would have been plenty of time for the appellant to travel from Woodcroft to Minchinbury by 3.30pm (being the time at which the appellant robbed the Minchinbury newsagency). Although the trial judge did not make his conclusion in this regard explicit, it is clear that he considered that the evidence sought to be admitted possessed the necessary degree of striking similarity. 18 Having so found, the trial judge sought to address the threshold test contained in s 101(2) namely, that the probative value of the evidence sought to be adduced must outweigh any prejudice to the accused. In this regard, his Honour stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “…it appears to be common ground at the bar table that the  
        Evidence Act 
         has not really changed the substance of the test proposed in  
        Pfennig 
        …and that, of course, related to the common law doctrine of similar fact evidence.”  
        
       
       
      In  
      Hoch v The Queen 
       (1998) 165 CLR 292, Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ, in a passage adopted in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in  
      Pfennig v the Queen 
       (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 481, formulated the common law test for the admissibility of similar fact evidence thus (at 294):  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “…for propensity or similar fact evidence to be admissible, the objective improbability of its having some innocent explanation is such that there is no reasonable view of it other than as supporting an inference that the accused is guilty of the offence charged."" 
        
       
      
    19 Hence the trial judge noted that the issue before him was whether:  
     
      
       
        
        “…the only rational view available in light of the evidence to be tendered is that the accused is guilty of this particular charge.” 
        
       
      
    20 The trial judge then referred to the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Lock (1997) 91 A Crim R 356 at 363, where his Honour noted that tendency and/or coincidence evidence is inadmissible unless it has 'significant probative value' (according to the requirements of ss 97 and 98) and that such evidence, having passed the tests in ss 97 and 98, must also pass the test posed by s 101(2) of the Act. Hunt CJ at CL then said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""This is the exercise discussed by the High Court in  
        Pfennig 
        . It was said in that case that the prejudicial effect of similar fact evidence (or  
        coincidence 
         evidence, as the  
        Evidence Act 
         now calls it) is the possibility that the jury will treat the evidence as establishing an inference of guilt when neither logic nor experience would necessitate the conclusion that it clearly points to the guilt of the accused, and that, in considering the admissibility evidence (and not just in the exercise of the discretion to exclude it), the trial judge must apply the same test as the jury does in dealing with circumstantial evidence and ask whether there is available a rational (or reasonable) view of the similar fact evidence which is consistent with the innocence of the accused; it is only if there is no such view available that a conclusion can safely be reached that the probative force of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect."" 
        
       
      
    21 The trial judge then said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It really seems to get to the position that a commonsense view can only be that he is guilty. That is the commonsense view arising from this tendency and coincidence evidence and I suppose from one viewpoint one could say readily that it seems just a little bit beyond mere coincidence that the same silver/grey Commodore rather features largely in all three matters relied on by the Crown and a silver Commodore is used in the event charged against this accused although the registration number was not obtained. 
        
       
       
        
        One could say 'How many silver/grey Commodores are being driven around a fairly small radius area in the south and south-west and the west where the passenger is a big man, perhaps of Maori appearance, on occasion armed with a screwdriver and who preys on small business, small businesses, in the middle of the afternoon?' Perhaps a little earlier than that, 'Between 1.30pm and 3.30pm in the afternoon'."" 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour then referred to the Crown's argument in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown submits that the proximity in time is significant here. For example, about 2pm from Liverpool Hospital car park; 3pm the same day at Woodcourt (as said). That is the event that is currently listed for trial then 3.30pm at Minchinbury which is only a short distance away, that is the newsagency and then a slight break for a day or so and then the 5 August is the last event at St Johns Park which is just down to the south of the Prospect Reservoir and of course the same silver/grey Commodore is acknowledged to be used in the other three events which are not the subject of the present charge whereas at Woodcourt (as said) the vehicle used was described simply as a 'silver Commodore'. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown relies on the physical descriptions offered by the Video-Ezy witnesses at Woodcourt. The fact that the robber always was a passenger in the vehicle together with numerous other similarities such as the time of the events, the way in which the till was directed to be opened and so on. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown says 'Anyone with commonsense would say there's only one rational explanation and that is the same man was the robber on all four occasions'.""  
        
       
      
    23 After referring to the defence submissions (that there was nothing exceptional about the alleged similar facts; that there was nothing exceptional about Islander people being involved in armed robberies; and that the evidence didn't establish some form of trademark of the appellants), the trial judge referred to some older cases and said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""We have really got to make a decision on this particular factual scenario."" 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour's conclusion as to the question of admissibility was framed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The conclusion that I have come to is that it is a matter for the jury. In my view a jury would be entitled to look at these other three events and then it is a matter for them of course. If they wish to say 'This evidence convinces us without a shadow of a doubt that the accused was the perpetrator of the Woodcourt robbery' and of course in considering that matter they will need to consider the substantive evidence in support of the charge. I have not seen that yet apart from the statements of the two witnesses so therefore – I will grant leave to the Crown then to adduce evidence as to tendency/coincidence in respect of the three events which I have endeavoured to articulate, that is to say, the larceny motor vehicle on 3 August 1999; the robbery at Minchinbury on 3 August 1999 and the robbery at St Johns Park on 5 August 1999."" 
        
       
       
      The appellant's submissions 
       
      
    25 The sole ground of appeal was that the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence referred to. 
     
      
    26 The appellant did not seek to contest that the evidence in question did not have ""significant probative value"" within the meaning of s 97(1)(b) and/or s 98(1)(b) of the Evidence Act. Rather, it was submitted that: firstly, the trial judge did not make the determination required by s 101(2) that there was no rational explanation for the tendency evidence consistent with the innocence of the appellant; and secondly, that there were insufficient similarities between the relevant events to come to the above conclusion.  
     
      
    27 The appellant did not contest the trial judge's finding (of which evidence was ultimately given at the trial) that the distance between Woodcroft and Minchinbury was approximately 10km and that there would have been sufficient time for the appellant to travel from Woodcroft (after committing the robbery) to Minchinbury by 3.30pm. It was submitted that the only similarities (upon which the Crown relied as coincidence evidence) between the Video Ezy robbery and the other two robberies were firstly, that in each case the perpetrator was tall, solidly built and appeared to be an Islander, and secondly, that in each case the perpetrator escaped in a silver or grey Holden Commodore. 
     
      
    28 On the other hand, the following differences were demonstrated: 
     
      
       
      (a) At the Video Ezy robbery, there was a second robber with blonde hair and noticeable acne pockmarks. In the other two robberies, the appellant entered the stores alone. There appears to have been an accomplice waiting in the stolen car, but there was no description of that person.  
       
       
      (b) Although a screwdriver was used in the Video Ezy robbery and in the St Johns Park robbery, there was no evidence of any weapon being used in the Minchinbury Newsagency robbery. 
       
       
      (c) It could not be said that the person, alleged to be the appellant, was wearing the same clothing during each of the three robberies. According to Mr McGrath, the first robber was wearing a "" 
      big dark jacket and jeans or light coloured pants 
      "". According to Mr Azzopardi he was wearing "" 
      a black tracksuit 
      "". They both said the robber was wearing a beanie. At the Minchinbury Newsagency robbery, Mr Cheng described the robber's clothes as being "" 
      blue in colour and the shirt and trousers were nearly the same colour 
      "". There was no mention of a beanie. With respect to the St Johns Park Pharmacy robbery, the robber was described as wearing a "" 
      dark blue jumper and dark coloured pants and a beanie 
      "".  
       
       
      (d) It could not be said that the premises robbed were close to each other. It was asserted that Woodcroft was about 15km away from St Johns Park. I have already referred to the fact that it was not suggested that the trial judge erred when he said that "" 
      there would have been plenty of time to travel from Woodcroft to Minchinbury by 3.30pm 
      "". The St John's Park robbery occurred two days after the other two. 
       
       
      (e) Although there was evidence of the registration number of the Commodore at the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies, there was no evidence of the registration number of the Commodore used at the Video Ezy robbery. This submission was made notwithstanding that the Commodore registration number KHI 443 was silver/grey in colour, as was the vehicle used in the Video Ezy robbery. 
       
      
    29 It was submitted that it could not therefore be said that the only rational explanation for the evidence of the robberies was that the same person had committed them all. 
     
      
       
      The Crown's submissions  
       
      
    30 It was submitted by the Crown that there were a number of distinct similarities in relation to the description of the perpetrator in each of the three robberies. Firstly, the robber was of Islander appearance, had dark skin, was around 6', was about 20 years old, with a solid build and dark eyes. Secondly, there were similarities in the description of the robber's clothing. In particular, the robber at the Video Ezy and St Johns Park Pharmacy robberies was wearing a dark coloured beanie. When the appellant was arrested by Detective Keating, he had beside him clothing which was similar to that described by the witnesses to the three robberies both in description and colour. Thirdly, a grey/silver Holden Commodore sedan was used in each of the three robberies. In relation to the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies, the registration number of the vehicle was ascertained and was the same in each case. Fourthly, in the Video Ezy and St Johns Pharmacy robberies, the robber was armed with a screwdriver. Fifthly, in the Video Ezy and St Johns Park robberies, the robber used the words ""open the till"". Sixthly, in each of the three robberies, the robber had an accomplice who drove the getaway vehicle. In each case, the robber got into the front passenger seat of the vehicle. Finally, the timing of the theft of the Commodore on 3 August 1999 at 2.00pm, the Video Ezy robbery at about 3.00pm and the Minchinbury robbery at about 3.30pm (all on the same day) revealed a pattern of events closely related in terms of both location and timing.  
     
      
    31 In the foregoing circumstances, the Crown submitted that the coincidence of the timing of the robberies on 3 August 1999, together with the other similar features to which reference has been made, and with the fact that the appellant pleaded guilty with respect to the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies, inevitably lead to the conclusion that there was no reasonable view of that evidence consistent with the innocence of the appellant. This is particularly so given the identification evidence of Mr Azzopardi. Based upon the test adopted by Hodgson JA in [29] of his judgment in Folbigg (to which I have referred at [36] below), the Crown submitted that the coincidence evidence relied upon was such that when added to the other evidence including the identification evidence of Mr Azzopardi, it would eliminate any reasonable doubt which might otherwise be left by that other evidence. 
     
      
       
      Determination of the issues 
       
      
    32 It is clear from the preceding paragraphs that the parties conducted their respective cases on the basis that the test articulated in Pfennig for the admissibility of ‘similar fact evidence’ at common law (to which I have referred in [18] above) is imported into the s 101(2) threshold. This is consistent with the approach taken by this Court in numerous cases dealing with this question: R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 at 709; R v Lock at 363; R v WRC (2002) 130 A Crim R 89 at [25]-[29]; R v Folbigg [2003] NSWCCA 17 at [24].  
     
      
    33 However, very recent authority on this question has indicated a shift in the Court’s approach to the interpretation of s 101(2). In R v Ellis [2003] NSWCCA 319, this Court (constituted by Spigelman CJ, Sully, O’Keefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ) held that the statutory regime for the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence was intended to cover the field to the exclusion of the common law principles previously applicable. In particular, the threshold test in s 101(2) constitutes a new formulation which is not derived from prior case law. Spigelman CJ (with whom Sully, O’Keefe, Hidden and Buddin JJ agreed) stated at [88]:  
     
      
       
        
        “The continued application of a “no rational view” test is not, in my opinion, consistent with a statutory test which expressly requires a balancing process…” 
        
       
       
      The Chief Justice (at [91]) then referred to the following passage in the dissenting judgment of McHugh J in  
      Pfennig 
       (at 516), which he said he found compelling: 
       
       
        
        ""If evidence revealing criminal propensity is not admissible unless the evidence is consistent only with the guilt of the accused, the requirement that the probative value 'outweigh' or 'transcend' the prejudicial effect is superfluous. The evidence either meets the no rational explanation test or it does not. There is nothing to be weighted – at all events by the trial judge. The law has already done the weighing. This means that, even in cases where the risk of prejudice is very small, the prosecution cannot use the evidence unless it satisfies the stringent no rational explanation test. It cannot use the evidence even though in a practical sense its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect."" 
        
       
       
      He then said: 
       
       
        
        ""94.The words ""substantially outweigh"" in a statute cannot, in my opinion, be construed to have the meaning which the majority in  
        Pfennig 
         determined was the way in which the common law balancing exercise should be conducted. The ""no rational explanation"" test may result in a trial judge failing to give adequate consideration to the actual prejudice in the specific case which the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh. 
        
       
       
        
        95. Section 101(2) calls for a balancing exercise which can only be conducted on the facts of each case. It requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion. (See  
        R v Blick  
        (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at [20] per Sheller JA; F Bennion ""Distinguishing Judgment and Discretion"" [2000]  
        Public Law 
         368). The ""no rational explanation"" test focuses on one only of the two matters to be balanced – by requiring a high test of probative value – thereby averting any balancing process. I am unable to construe s 101(2) to that effect. 
        
       
       
        
        Section 101(2) calls for a balancing exercise which can only be conducted on the facts of each case. It requires the Court to make a judgment, rather than to exercise a discretion…The “no rational explanation” test focuses on one only of the two matters to be balanced – by requiring a high test of probative value – thereby averting any balancing process.” 
        
       
       
      Accordingly, it was held that the common law "" 
      no rational explanation 
      "" test, which culminated in Pfennig, 
        
      was no longer the test to be applied by way of explication of the statutory formulation in s 101(2). To the extent to which previous authorities in this Court held to the contrary, they were incorrect and were no longer to be followed. 
       
      
    34 Given that this recent shift in authority occurred shortly after the conclusion of the hearing in the present appeal, this Court is placed in a most unusual position. As I have said, the parties conducted their respective cases before the trial judge and before this Court on the basis of the common law position. Nonetheless, I consider myself bound to deal with the issues presently before us on the basis of the construction of the relevant statutory provisions articulated in Ellis.  
     
      
    35 Prior to addressing the question of whether the subject evidence passed the threshold tests contained in the statutory provisions, it is appropriate to deal with the appellant’s submission that the trial judge erred in concluding that the question of whether the evidence satisfied the “no rational explanation test” was one for determination by the jury.  
     
      
    36 In a recent judgment of this Court, R v Folbigg (2003) NSWCCA 17, Hodgson JA (Sully and Buddin JJ agreeing) stated:  
     
      
       
        
        ""28. I set out in  
        WRC 
         in the passages quoted how I understand the  
        Pfennig  
        test to operate. I would add that the test certainly does not require the judge to reach the view that the jury acting reasonably must convict:  
        the judge must form his or her own view as to whether there is no rational view of the evidence, as it then appears to the judge, which is consistent with innocence 
        , and the judge does not need to speculate as to how precisely that evidence may be affected by the way it is presented at the trial or by cross-examination, or how other minds might view it. Furthermore if, as the trial progresses, there are grounds for contending that the evidence as presented turns out to be substantially different from how it appeared at the time of the determination of admissibility or the joinder of counts, there may be a ground to apply for those questions to be re-considered."" (my emphasis) 
        
       
      
    37 With respect, I agree with the appellant’s submission that the trial judge did not, at least in express terms, form the view required of him if he was to admit the contested evidence. The paragraph of his judgment, which I have recorded in [24], compels such a conclusion. As Hodgson JA makes clear in that part of [28] of his judgment cited above which I have emphasised, the decision was one for his Honour to make as a matter of law, and not a question to be determined by the jury. Nonetheless, having admitted the evidence, the only question is whether his Honour was correct in doing so. No doubt it is implicit in the fact he admitted the evidence that he considered that the Pfennig requirement had been satisfied. It is appropriate to proceed on this basis, for even it if was a matter for the jury (notwithstanding his Honour’s “conclusion”), this Court is in as good a position as the trial judge to determine whether the evidence should have been admitted. This is particularly so as the evidence was not in dispute. 38 In my opinion, the evidence in question was coincidence evidence rather than tendency evidence. The coincidence rule embodied in s 98 of the Evidence Act requires that in order to be admissible evidence of related events must be: substantially similar; show that the events occurred in substantially similar circumstances; and have significant probative value in relation to proving that the accused did in fact do the particular act alleged. Only if these threshold requirements are satisfied does the evidence proceed to the additional threshold test contained in s 101(2).  
     
      
    39 It was accepted by the appellant that the evidence did have significant probative value, as required by s 98(1). This concession was clearly correct. Although it was not directly argued by the appellant that the evidence did not satisfy the further threshold tests contained in s 98(2), I feel that it is necessary to address this question given that there was dispute between the parties as to the degree of similarity between the relevant events.  
     
      
    40 In my opinion, the evidence does satisfy the threshold tests in s 98(2). To suggest, as does the appellant, that the only common features were the colour/make of the getaway vehicle and the description of the robber does little justice to the other features of that evidence. In particular, the following facts demonstrate the requisite similarity: the location and timing of the theft of the vehicle and the two robberies on 3 August 1999; the robber fitted a common description on all four occasions; on two occasions the same phrase “open the till” was used; on two occasions the robber was wearing a beanie as well as consistent clothing; on each occasion the robber got into the passenger seat of a silver/grey Holden Commodore sedan.  
     
      
    41 It may be, as the appellant submitted, that many people of Islander descent are tall and solidly built, and that there are many silver or silver/grey Holden Commodore sedans. However, when these features are taken together with the other features mentioned, having particular regard to the fact that there was no dispute (because he pleaded guilty) that the appellant was involved in the stealing of the getaway vehicle and in the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies, it is clear, in my opinion, that the events relied on were substantially and relevantly similar and that the circumstances which they occurred were also substantially similar. 
     
      
    42 Finally, this Court must determine whether the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect that the evidence might have upon the defendant: s 101(2).  
     
      
    43 As stated by Spigelman CJ in Ellis, the degree of probative value required in order to satisfy the s 101(2) test will vary according to the facts of each individual case. His Honour held at [96] that this construction of s 101(2):  
     
      
       
        
        “…should not be understood to suggest that the stringency of the approach, culminating in the  
        Pfennig 
         test, is never appropriate when the judgment for which the section calls has to be made. There may well be cases where, on the facts, it would not be open to conclude that the probative value of particular evidence substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect, unless the “no rational explanation” test were satisfied.”  
        
       
      
    44 However, in my opinion the present case is not one in which the more stringent “no rational explanation” requirement need be satisfied. This is so particularly given that the evidence is not in dispute as the appellant pleaded guilty to the theft of the vehicle and the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies. But even if that requirement was appropriate, it would in my opinion, be satisfied. 
     
      
       
      In my opinion, the probative value of the subject evidence substantially outweighed any prejudicial effect it may have had on the appellant. There is no doubt, of course, that admission of the evidence of the theft of the Commodore and the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies to which the appellant pleaded guilty would have a prejudicial effect on him in the mind of the jury. Such is the very nature of coincidence evidence. Unless it pointed to the guilt of the accused with respect to the offence charged, it would be of no probative value. But here its probative value in the circumstances that I have related was not only significant but was extremely high. Although there were some differences in some of the details of the event, their significance was, in my opinion, relatively minor compared to their similarities which were substantial. Those similarities are set out in [30] above as part of the Crown's submission with which I agree. 
       
      
    45 Accordingly, when the balancing exercise called for by s 101(2) is undertaken, the scales are substantially weighted in favour of the probative value of the evidence. It follows that the trial judge was correct in holding that the evidence was admissible.  
     
      
      The trial judge's subsequent comments 
       
      
    46 The trial judge admitted the subject evidence on the first day of the trial (1 May 2002). The appellant was convicted on 3 May 2002. Proceedings on sentence commenced on 19 June 2002, at which time the following exchange took place between the trial judge and counsel for the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        ""His Honour: One thing I notice on looking at the brief again was that the statement of the detective as to this incident on which he was convicted says that the registration number was taken and that's not true. It was only identified as a silver grey Holden. 
         
        Leary: That's so your Honour. 
         
        His Honour: The thing that really stood out was that the young blond, the fellow with the pock marked face was seen only one occasion, this occasion. 
         
        Leary: That's so. 
         
        His Honour: So really that material just shouldn't have gone to the jury in my view. …"" 
        
       
      
    47 When the sentencing proceedings continued on 7 November 2002, the trial judge said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""His Honour: Something I noticed was when Keating gave his evidence about the final matter on 5 August he said nothing about the other man Errington. There's nothing on the transcript at all about Errington. If I'd known that I think there is no way in the world I would have given leave to call that section 97…(not transcribable)…I just mention that for the record."" 
        
       
      
    48 In his remarks on sentence delivered on 7 November 2002, the trial judge referred to the issue of identification and to the fact that he had given leave to the Crown to introduce evidence of ""other similar matters"". After referring to the stealing of the motor vehicle and the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies, his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I gave leave, and I will not go into it now, it will be a matter, as I say, for the Court of Criminal Appeal, one of the chief factors was that the was said to be accompanied at all times by a young blond headed man with acne. I bear in mind that the accused is a big man, a big Samoan young man, twenty-one years of age. In fact, on the last event when the prisoner was arrested on 3 August 1999 I discovered later when the police officer Mr Keating was giving his evidence that a man named Errington had been arrested at the time but the statement was utterly silent as to his appearance. I mention just for the record that had I been aware of that fact at an earlier point in time I simply wouldn't have given the leave under sections 97 and 98. But I cannot correct that situation."" 
        
       
      
    49 On 8 October 2002, the trial judge gave a ""judge's Certificate"" in which he certified the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I hereby certify that this case, in which the abovenamed Samuel Mason was convicted before me on the third day of May, 2002 of the offence of armed robbery, is a fit case for an appeal by the Samuel Mason against his conviction on the following grounds: 
        
       
       
        
        The  
        s 97 
         and  
        98 
         evidence should not have gone to the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        The younger blonde haired co-offender was described only on the event charged. An offender name Aaron Errington was referred to at the time of the Accused's arrest, but no description of him was given. 
        
       
       
        
        The registration number of the silver grey Holden was not obtained on the event charged."" 
        
       
      
    50 Finally, in a letter to the Registrar of this Court dated 2 July 2003, his Honour wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Would you please inform the Court that in my opinion there has been a miscarriage of justice for the reasons which I have set out early on in the Sentencing Remarks"". 
        
       
      
    51 The trial judge would not have admitted the subject evidence: had he not been under the incorrect impression that there would be evidence that the registration number of the vehicle used in the Video Ezy was the same as that of the car used in the other robberies; and had he realised that Detective Keating's statement was silent as to the appearance of the man named Errington (who was arrested at the same time as he arrested the appellant), so that there was no description fitting that of the second robber at the Video Ezy robbery. 
     
      
    52 It is not clear whether the trial judge, when he made the remarks referred to, had been given the opportunity to reread the judgment he delivered on the admission of this evidence on 1 May 2002. That judgment makes two things clear. Firstly, although there was a detailed description of the second robber at the Video Ezy robbery, there was only one robber involved in the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies (although there was a second person in the driver's seat of the getaway vehicle, in respect of whom there was no physical description). Thus, with respect to the Minchinbury robbery, the trial judge observed in his judgment of 1 May 2002: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now it is of significance that having done that he entered the passenger's side of the vehicle. There was another man in the driver's seat but he was unable to provide identification."" 
        
       
       
      With respect to the St Johns Park robbery, his Honour said this: 
       
       
        
        ""The pharmacist followed him out into the street and saw him open the door and get into the front passenger's side of a silver Commodore sedan. The registration number was obtained. It was registration number KHI 443. He did not see the driver."" 
        
       
      
    53 It is also apparent that his Honour appreciated that although witnesses at the Minchinbury and St Johns Park robberies identified the registration number of the silver grey Commodore, this was not the case with respect to the Video Ezy robbery. I refer to the passages of his Honour's judgment, which I have recorded in [22] above. 
     
      
    54 Although in the references set out in [46] and [47] above the trial judge refers to the fact Detective Keating did not in his evidence describe the appearance of the man (Errington) who was arrested at the same time as the appellant, there was no reference to Keating's evidence in his Honour's judgment of 1 May 2002, although he had it before him on the voir dire.  
     
      
    55 It is difficult in the foregoing circumstances to appreciate why the lack of any description of Errington by Detective Keating was regarded by the trial judge as being critical to the admission of the subject evidence. No doubt, if there had been a description of Errington fitting the description of the second robber in the Video Ezy robbery, that would have strengthened the Crown's case as to the admission of the coincidence evidence.  
     
      
    56 For the reasons I have advanced above, I do not consider that the absence of evidence regarding the description of Errington weakens the evidence upon which the Crown relied to the point that it would not pass the test set forth in s 101(2) of the Evidence Act. If the trial judge thought otherwise, he was, with respect, being overly conservative. 57 Accordingly, with respect, I do not think that the trial judge was under any erroneous impression on 1 May 2002 regarding the nature of the coincidence evidence tendered before him. Even if he was in error in the respects identified by him and notwithstanding that he indicated some six months later that had he been aware of those matters, he would have refused to admit the evidence, nonetheless in my opinion the coincidence evidence relied upon by the Crown was, in law, properly admitted. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    58 For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.59 HOWIE J: I agree with Tobias JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY, J: Justice Greg James will give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GREG JAMES, J: This is an appeal against his convictions brought by an appellant who stood trial in the District Court of New South Wales before Judge Moore and a jury in late May and early June 2000. The appellant was convicted on six counts alleging sexual offences against the same complainant. Those counts alleged the commission of those sexual offences during several years in the early 1960s. 
     
      
    3 There is also an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Puckeridge DCJ. following pleas of guilty to two further offences, which sentences were made cumulative on those imposed by Moore, DCJ. In both cases leave to appeal out of time is necessary. 
     
      
    4 The complainant came forward to the police in respect of those matters after his marriage had broken up and he had remarried. He first spoke to police officers and provided them with a statement in March 1997. This was over 30 years after the events. When he came forward he was recalling events which had taken place when he was between the ages of 13 and 17, he at that time was about 52 years of age. The appellant was said to have been between 25 and 29 at the time at which these events occurred and was 65 at the time of the trial. 
     
      
    5 Thirty seven years had elapsed between the time of the first alleged offence and the time of the making of the statement to the police about it. At the trial it is common ground that the directions the learned trial judge gave to the jury did not accord with the requirements this court and the High Court of Australia had enunciated in many decisions as necessary to ensure a fair trial where such a delay has occurred. 
     
      
    6 It was conceded in the Crown's submissions that the first of the grounds of appeal put forward on this appeal should be made out. That ground reads as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""The trial miscarried as a result of the failure of the trial judge adequately to direct the jury in relation to the significance of substantial delay in complaint.” 
        
       
      
    7 The Crown's submissions set out the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The matter came to trial 36 to 39 years after the alleged dates of the offences. The case depended solely upon the word of the appellant, there being no witnesses to the events and no admissions by the appellant. No direction of the type referred to in 
         Longman v. the Queen 
         (1979) 168CLR 79 at 91 was given in this case. This was a case that required a Longman warning.” 
        
       
      
    8 The Crown had referred to the necessary aspects of the Longman warning but concluded its submission conceding this ground on the first aspect of the Longman warning in saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""This fell short of the required direction that because of the delay, it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant's evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of its truth and accuracy.” 
        
       
      
    9 The Crown concedes that no direction was given in this case as to the significance of delay in terms of its effect upon the appellant's ability to test the allegations made by the complainant and to obtain evidence to meet them. 
     
      
    10 It was in those circumstances that the Crown conceded that what comments were made by his Honour as to delay fell short of a warning sufficient to satisfy either aspect of the Longman direction or the requirements of those directions as confirmed by the High Court in Crampton v. The Queen (2000) 206 CLR 161 at 207-8, paragraphs 125 and 126. 
     
      
    11 The Crown conceded this was a matter to which the proviso to s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 could not go but did submit that a retrial should be ordered on all counts. There should be further reference of a short kind time to certain of the matters to which the Crown has already drawn attention. Although the case did depend upon the evidence of the complainant and the appellant and there were no independent witnesses to the events nor admissions, there was some evidence concerning some complaint said to have been made to a Mrs. Abernathy at the time of an offence which was charged as count five. 
     
      
    12 It appears that on any version of the events some altercation had occurred and the complainant had asserted an attempt to assault him in some way. 
     
      
    13 Due to the lapse of time such evidence of this complaint, as there might have been, to the police is now unavailable. There was some conflict as to the nature of the complaint and the detail of what it was said in that complaint might have occurred between the complainant and the appellant on other occasions arising as and between the evidence of the complainant and Mrs. Abernathy, the person to whom it was said the complaint was made. 
     
      
    14 On Mrs. Abernathy's version the complainant denied there having been any previous sexual offences committed upon him by the appellant. On the appellant's version he had complained concerning other sexual offences. It is the Crown's submission that in relation to all these offences there should be a retrial arising from the miscarriage occasioned by the lack of the appropriate direction. 
     
      
    15 Section 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides for a power not originally granted to the United Kingdom criminal appellate courts to award a new trial. It provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.” 
        
       
      
    16 Section 6 which provides the legislative guide to what the court might do in determining appeals provides by subsection (2):- 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under s.5(1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.” 
        
       
      
    17 The words “subject to the special provisions of this Act” refer inter alia to s.8. It is apparent then that in the event of the court finding a miscarriage has occurred it is necessary to ascertain whether such miscarriage can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial. In this respect, the common form criminal appeal provisions throughout Australia of which s.8 of the New South Wales Act is an example have been considered by the High Court of Australia in a number of decisions including in a decision on appeal to that Court from Nauru. 
     
      
    18 DPP (Nauru) v. Fowler (1984) 154 CLR 627 was a decision in which the High Court emphasised the necessity for a court considering whether to grant a new trial or not to have regard to ""all the circumstances"" as s.8 provides. 
     
      
    19 A correct approach has been held to be that each case has to be considered on all the facts and all the relevant considerations that apply to it, regard being had to the personal considerations of the appellant and to the overall justice of the case and in particular to the fair and impartial administration of justice: see King v. the Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423. 
     
      
    20 Where there is sufficient evidence that the matter might at trial be left to the jury the discretion is enlivened. Where as here the alleged events are so old and the opportunity of the appellant at a new trial to test the evidence as to them, is inevitably affected by the delay such that having proper regard to the impact of a direction to be given under Longman (supra) and Crampton (supra) it is not possible to say that the jury is highly likely to convict the Court is confronted with a difficult question. 
     
      
    21 This appellant has been in custody in respect of these matters for the bulk of the non-parole period imposed on the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge. There is no Crown appeal against sentence. There are a number of criticisms raised of the evidence of the complainant going, in my view, to matters of detail but matters that could be regarded as matters of seriousness as to the complainant's credibility on each count. 
     
      
    22 As far as the count on which the corroboration or early complaint to which I have referred is concerned, nonetheless the complaint was in such vague terms as not clearly to indicate just what had occurred such as to support the charge brought. 
     
      
    23 Putting it all together, and having regard to all relevant circumstances, I have not been persuaded by what the Crown has put that there should be a new trial on all of these counts or on any one of them. In my view, the appropriate course to take is that the appeal against the convictions following the trial before Moore, DCJ. should be allowed and the verdict of acquittal referred to in s.6 be entered. These are the orders I would propose. 
     
      
    24 SULLY J: I agree and I'll have something to say in a moment. Could I just raise, both for my brothers’ consideration and indeed for the assistance of counsel, it would be appropriate, would it not, to deal with both of the matters together since we've effectively heard them, in which event would we not do this: Grant leave to appeal out of time in both of the matters CCA60371 and CCA60372; in matter CCA60371 order that the appeal be allowed, that the convictions and sentences be quashed and on each count there be a directed judgment of acquittal, and that in matter CCA60372 grant leave to appeal against the sentence, appeal allowed to the extent of varying the commencing date of the sentences and non-parole periods from 3 December 2004 to 13 July 2000? Does that cover everything, Miss Burgess? 
     
      
       
      BURGESS: Yes, it does. 
       
       
      SULLY J: Madam Crown, is that adequate? Allow the appeal to the extent of varying the commencing date of the sentences and the non-parole periods from 3 December 2004 to 13 July 2000? 
       
       
      WILKINS: Yes, your Honour. I had understood my friend was going to technically abandon those appeals and your Honour would make an order under s.58 of the Crime Sentencing Procedure Act but I don't have a difficulty whichever way -- 
       
       
      GREG JAMES J: It's exactly the same effect. 
       
       
      BURGESS: I don't have a problem with that course. 
       
      
    25 GREG JAMES J: I agree with the orders proposed by the learned presiding judge for the reasons that I have given. 
     
      
    26 SULLY J: I agree that such orders should be made. I agree generally with the reasons given by Justice Greg James. Because of the circumstances of this case I wish myself to add three observations as follows: One, the decision of this court in these particular matters ought not to be regarded in any quarter as in any way detracting from the seriousness of the types of conduct charged against the appellant; two, the particular decision in these matters does not in any way weaken the proposition that a miscarriage of justice deriving from the failure to give a proper Longman direction will more often than not be sufficiently corrected by an order for a new trial; three, the directed acquittals in the present case are justified in my view by a concatenation of very unusual circumstances of which it is sufficient to say that they are adequately described, as I respectfully think, in what has fallen from Justice Greg James. Subject to those additional matters I concur in the making of the orders. 
     
      
    27 ADAMS J: I agree with the orders proposed and what has fallen from both Justice Greg James and Sully, J. 
     
      
    28 SULLY J: Those will be the orders, accordingly.

     R v Fernando FERRADA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BARR J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. On 25 march 2002 the applicant, Fernando Ferrada, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to three offences, namely that on 21 March 2002 he broke and entered a building and committed a serious indictable offence, that on 24 April 2002 he robbed a certain credit union of the sum of $5012 and that on 29 April 2002 he robbed another credit union of the sum of $39,000 while armed with an offensive weapon, namely a kitchen knife. He was committed to the District Court for sentence and on 21 February 2003 Solomon DCJ sentenced him on the first count to a fixed term of imprisonment of four years, on the second to a fixed term of six years and on the third to a term of imprisonment of eleven years with a non-parole period of seven years. All sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The total effective sentence was therefore one of eleven years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years.  
     
      
    2 In imposing sentence his Honour took into account under the provisions of s32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the malicious destruction of a motor vehicle by fire and obtaining meals and drinks by false representation.  
     
      
    3 On 21 March 2002 the applicant reversed a station wagon into the front doors of a produce store in South Grafton and stole cattle drench worth more than twenty thousand dollars. Possibly accompanied by a woman, he drove to another part of the town and tried to unload the stolen goods. He was seen and realised that he had been seen. He drove off a second time and set fire to the station wagon in an attempt to distance himself from the offence. When spoken to by the police he denied any knowledge of it and said that he had hitch hiked to Grafton. Not all the stolen goods were recovered. The owner of the stock lost more than $12,000.  
     
      
    4 The deliberate destruction by fire of the motor vehicle was one of the matters taken into account by his Honour.  
     
      
    5 The applicant was charged with the offence but allowed bail. The remaining offences were committed during the currency of bail.  
     
      
    6 On 24 April 2002 the applicant entered the offices of Big River Credit Union in Coffs Harbour. He was wearing a jacket and had a black stocking over his head. He was unarmed. He asked for cash and warned staff not to press the alarm. He took some money and insisted on being handed more. He got away with $4050. Police were given a description of the robber and spoke to the applicant because he matched it. He made no admissions and was not charged.  
     
      
    7 On 29 April 2002 the applicant entered the offices of Banana Coast Credit Union in Coffs Harbour. Again he had a black stocking over his head but this time he had armed himself with a kitchen knife. He told everybody to get onto the floor, jumped onto the counter and threatened the staff. He opened a number of cash drawers and demanded money. Altogether he took more than $39,000. A client of the Credit Union followed him and the applicant threatened to kill him if he did not leave him alone. The client told two security guards and the three chased the applicant. Police arrived and recognised him. He was found in possession of the money. He showed police where he had hidden the knife.  
     
      
    8 He told the police that he had carried out the robbery because people to whom he owed money had put pressure on him. He said that he had a heavy drug habit and needed about two to four thousand dollars for himself and his girlfriend. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was caught red-handed and could scarcely deny his commission of the offence. However, he volunteered to the police that a week earlier he had robbed the Big River Credit Union. That was a matter of some consequence because without that voluntary statement the police would not have had a case against him.  
     
      
    10 The second matter taken into account by the sentencing judge concerned an occasion when the applicant and his girlfriend obtained meals and drinks by false representation. They went to a restaurant, ordered and ate dinner and drank beverages. When they had finished they ran away without paying.  
     
      
    11 The applicant was born on 9 March 1963 and is now forty years of age. He immigrated to Australia from Chile with his family early in the 1970s. He began using illicit drugs in his early teenage years and seems to have been seriously concerned with them ever since. Between 1980 and 1988 he was regularly before the courts, principally for offences of dishonesty and dealing in and using illegal drugs. In 1988 he was sentenced in the Supreme Court of Western Australia to cumulative terms of six years and one year for robbery while armed and breaking and entering a dwelling with intent, together with a concurrent sentence of nine months for false pretences. The non-parole period was not recorded on the documents put before this Court. However, by October 1991 the applicant was in the Magistrate’s Court in Cairns, Queensland to be dealt with for offences of obscene language, resisting police and two counts of wilfully and unlawfully destroying property. He was before the courts in the same city on three occasions during the following year for a number of drug offences as well as three counts of false pretences and three of stealing. 
     
      
    12 In June 1993, still in Cairns, he was sentenced for stealing with actual violence while armed with a dangerous weapon as well as for drug offences. He was imprisoned for nine years. There were intervening offences during the same and the following year and in 1996 he was imprisoned for four months for escaping from lawful custody. Thus a combination of convictions, principally the one of stealing with actual violence whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, seem to have produced the result that the applicant was in custody continuously, apart from the period of escape, between January 1993 and 22 September 2000.  
     
      
    13 A report was before his Honour from an officer of the Probation and Parole Service. It stated that following his release from prison in 2000 the applicant had moved into a house next to his parents’ house. His continuing drug use and misbehaviour, some of which resulted in damage to the house, and possibly involving an illicit business endeavour, led to his and his partner’s being thrown out. The applicant had no employment prospects, being on a disability pension because of hepatitis C, bone fractures in the hand and a bad back. His major problem related to his use of heroin. His girlfriend appeared to be addicted to the use of heroin.  
     
      
    14 Counsel for the applicant put before the Court statistics published by the Judicial Commission of sentences imposed by the higher courts for robbery armed with an offensive weapon, robbery and breaking, entering and stealing. The third count was the most serious and attracted a maximum sentence of twenty-five years’ imprisonment. Statistics show that between May 1999 and September 2002 nine hundred and thirty four offenders dealt with in the higher courts received head sentences of up to twelve years, but only one percent had head sentences so long and only three percent had head sentences of eight years or longer. Sixty-two percent had head sentences of four years or less. Non-parole periods were correspondingly less. The statistics for the other two offences, which were less serious, show correspondingly lower sentences.  
     
      
    15 The Court has warned on a number of occasions about the caution with which such statistical figures ought to be approached. One of the difficulties with them is that it is impossible to tell from them what the criminal histories of the offenders were, whether and to what extent offences were committed on bail, as these were, and whether offences were multiple, as these were. More importantly, what is here attacked is the total effective sentence, a head sentence of eleven years with a non-parole period of seven years. The two internal concurrent fixed terms cannot be ignored for these purposes. His Honour stated that he intended to impose an effective sentence to reflect the totality of the applicant’s criminality, that is the criminality contemplated by all three offences and the two matters taken into account.  
     
      
    16 In my opinion the statistical figures do not demonstrate error on part of the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    17 The next ground pf appeal complained that his Honour erred in failing to identify the length of sentences taken as a starting point or the proportionate discount allowed. Reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in R v PPB [1999] NSWCCA 360. Whatever may be said about the desirability of nominating discounts in any particular case, there is no rule that a sentencing judge must do so or that the failure to do so will be held erroneous. See the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at para 160. There is no substance in this ground. 18 The next submission was that his Honour erred in failing adequately to discount the sentences. It was pointed out first that the pleas of guilty had been entered in the Local Court at the earliest opportunity, entitling the applicant to a substantial discount for their utilitarian value. That submission may be accepted. In addition, as his Honour found, the pleas were evidence of contrition. While that conclusion might have been surprising in the case of a forty year old well-experienced robber, the facts of this case were unusual. His volunteering that he had committed the robbery at Big River Credit Union was extraordinary. The police had no case against him and he had no reason to believe that they had. He told the police that he was sorry for what he had done. The sentencing judge accepted that he was. 19 There was evidence before the sentencing judge that the applicant had given assistance to the authorities. This Court has been made privy to details of what the applicant did and what resulted. He gave police information about somebody he had encountered in custody. The police took the information seriously but the Director of Public Prosecutions declined to register the applicant as a witness. That could not have surprised anybody in view of the applicant’s demonstrated constitutional dishonesty. However, as a result of his actions the applicant was kept on protection. His Honour held, contrary to a submission by the Crown, that the applicant was entitled to an allowance in the circumstances, though his Honour did not quantify it. The Crown did not submit in this Court that his Honour was wrong.  
     
      
    20 The author of the Probation and Parole report stated that the applicant’s alcohol and other drug worker had commented that he “was taking the first steps in relation to addressing issues surrounding his drug use”. The meaning of that statement is not plain but was, I take it, slight indication that there were prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    21 The thrust of the applicant’s complaint in this Court was that the head sentence and the non-parole period on the third count, and consequently the total effective head sentence and non-parole period, were excessive. It was submitted that given the substantial discount his Honour had undertaken to afford the applicant for pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity, for his accepted remorse and for the consequences of his offer to assist the authorities his Honour must, in order to arrive at a head sentence of eleven years, have commenced with a head sentence very close to the top of the twenty-five year range. Without wishing to play down the seriousness of the robbery, it was not of a kind that ought to attract a sentence of that magnitude. 
     
      
    22 I think that there may be substance in the submission. Although his Honour had to fashion a series of sentences which gave effect to the totality of criminality he was obliged also to impose for each count a sentence appropriate to that count and no other. The sentencing process required that to be done first and for totality then to be taken into account by whatever degrees of concurrency of accumulation were appropriate: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610.  
     
      
    23 It seems to me, however, that the practical question for this Court is, whether or not the individual sentences complied with the requirement of Pearce v The Queen, the overall sentence was appropriate to reflect the objective and subjective features of the totality of the applicant’s criminality. To put it another way, would a conclusion of error on the third count produce at once the need to reduce the sentence on that count but, in order to reflect the totality of criminality, to make partly cumulative sentences previously made wholly concurrent? 
     
      
    24 It seems to me that notwithstanding the substantial discounts which the applicant had earned for the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty, his contrition, his assistance and the special discount he was entitled to by making the Crown case on the second count, the total effective sentence was not outside the range of his Honour’s proper sentencing discretion. The applicant was a mature man, seriously concerned with drugs for many years, still a heroin addict and still in need of personal deterrence from repeating these serious crimes. The sentences carried a strong need for general deterrence. The fact that the offences were carried out to fund a drug habit was not a mitigating feature. The fact, if true, that they were carried out to satisfy the urgent demands of others was not a mitigating feature. His Honour was not sentencing the applicant again for the serious offences of like kind carried out in Western Australia and Queensland, but he was bound to take them into account as seriously aggravating his criminality.  
     
      
    25 I do not think that the attack on the overall sentence has been made good. I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    26 KIRBY J: I agree with Barr J.27 BARR J: The orders therefore are as I have proposed.
