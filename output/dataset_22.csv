Background
 
 
1
          The plaintiff, Yao Zhong Ping is a Chinese National who was employed by the defendants, Teambuild Construction Pte Ltd as a construction carpenter.  The defendants were at the material time, the main contractor involved in the upgrading of Radin Mas Primary School situated at No 1 Bukit Purmei Avenue (hereinafter referred to as “the work site”).  He claimed that he was injured, when he fell off a scaffold structure that was erected by the defendants or their agents, while he was carrying out his work at the work site, on 10 April 2002 at about 4.15pm.  The scaffold was made up of metal frames, I-shaped aluminium-alloy beams that were installed parallel and secured along the scaffold frames.  The plaintiff was instructed to nail timber runners at intervals across the aluminium beams at the time.  He alleged that in the midst of working, one of the beams suddenly gave way and he fell 4 m to the staircase landing below.  He suffered injuries to his face and back.  The plaintiff claimed that the defendants and/or their employees, servants or agents for whom the defendants are vicariously liable, were in breach of their statutory duty of care under the Factories Act (Cap 104), as occupiers and/or common law duty of care to the plaintiff.  The particulars of negligence were as pleaded in the statement of claim at BP3 to 5.  He also sought to rely on the doctrine of 
res ipsa loquitur
.  He claimed that he suffered injuries and disabilities as particularised and claimed general damages, special damages, pre-trial loss of earnings, interest and costs from the defendants.
2          The defendants denied that the scaffold, was erected by them or their servants or agents and also that the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the doctrine of 
res ipsa loquitur
.  In fact, the structure from which the plaintiff fell was not a scaffold, but a formwork. They claimed that the accident was caused solely or contributed to by the negligence of the plaintiff in failing to follow instructions or safety regulations and failing to take reasonable precaution for his own safety.  They also put the plaintiff to proof of the pain, injuries, disability, losses and damages that he claimed.
3          At the end of the three-day trial, I took time to consider the written submissions of counsel.  I found the defendants 75 percent liable for the accident with the plaintiff contributorily liable for 25 percent. 
4          As regards the issue of quantum, I assessed the general damages for the plaintiff’s pain and suffering on a 100 percent basis at $28,500.  I also awarded the plaintiff pre-trial loss of earnings at $13,767.40 and loss of future earnings at $51,600.  The parties had agreed to a sum of $10,000 for future medical expenses, $165 for medical expenses incurred and $200 for transport.  The plaintiff has appealed against the apportionment of liability of 25 percent and the award of $51,600 for loss of future earnings.  The defendants have appealed against the whole of the decision.
The plaintiff’s case
The evidence of Ding Cui Ping, PW1
5          Ding Cui Ping, PW1, was the plaintiff’s co-worker who was carrying out the job of nailing timber runners onto the aluminium I-beams on the scaffold structure together with the plaintiff, at the time the plaintiff fell.  He arrived in Singapore from China and started work at the work site on 5 March 2002.  According to PW1, he was instructed by the defendants’ formworks supervisor, Low Ah Hing, DW1 to nail timber runners along a scaffold structure at the work site on 10 April 2002.  The scaffold comprised 1.9 m high metal frames, with I-shaped aluminium beams installed parallel on two sides of the frame, and were secured by jack-screws.  The beams were supposed to be overlapping and resting on the jack-screws along the scaffold frames.  There were two scaffolds that were about 1.5 m apart and the plaintiff was on the scaffold that was erected over the staircase landing.  Both the plaintiff and PW1 were on the scaffold to nail the timber runners, which were about 4 m long at the time.  PW1 claimed that in the midst of working, he noticed that one of the beams that the plaintiff was working on, was not overlapped at the jack-screw.  Before he could warn the plaintiff, the beam became dislodged and the plaintiff fell about 4 m to the staircase below.  Photographs of structures that were similar to the one on which the plaintiff and PW1 were working at the time of the accident, which were taken by the plaintiff, were exhibited in the plaintiff’s supplementary affidavit of evidence-in-chief at BA131 to 133.  PW1 claimed that after the accident, the formworks supervisor, DW1 asked the rest of the workers to get back to work.  Not long after he had gone back to work, he saw an Indian supervisor from the defendants, taking photographs of the scene of the accident.  He was clearly mistaken, when he stated that the photographs at BA131 to 133 were taken by the defendants’ Indian supervisor.
6          Under cross-examination, his evidence was that he and the plaintiff were the only carpenters who were assigned the job of nailing the timber runners on the scaffold, on 10 April 2002.  The structure, comprising the aluminium beams and jack-screws, was already completed when they were assigned the job.  They started nailing the timber runners in the morning and continued after the lunch break.  Both he and the plaintiff were standing on the aluminium beams when they were nailing the timber runners onto the aluminium beams.  It was his evidence that they would be looking down while they were working.  However, he looked up and noticed that the aluminium beam that the plaintiff was working on was not overlapped, that is, the end of the beam was very near to the metal clamp.  Before he could warn the plaintiff, the beam became dislodged and the plaintiff fell.  PW1 was unable to say whether there were one or two beams at the said metal clamp.  According to PW1, although the beam was dislodged, the structure did not collapse.  He estimated that the height of the structure, which was on the third level, was about 3 m, but the plaintiff had fallen onto the landing between the first and the second level.
7          PW1 and two other workers went to help the plaintiff after the accident.   After DW1 was informed of the accident and had arrived at the scene, the two workers brought the plaintiff to the clinic located opposite the work site and they were subsequently referred to the hospital.  His evidence in re-examination by the plaintiff’s counsel was that after the accident he was told to return to work, when he saw the defendants’ Indian supervisor taking photographs of the scene of the accident.   
The evidence of Yao Zhong Ping,  PW2
8          The plaintiff Yao Zhong Ping, PW2 is a 33 year old Chinese National who arrived in Singapore and commenced work as a construction carpenter with the defendants on 22 August 2001.  His evidence was that on 10 April 2002, he was nailing timber runners at intervals across the aluminium beams on the scaffold at the work site.  As he was moving forward on the scaffold in order to nail the timber runners, one of the beams suddenly gave way and he fell 4 m to the staircase below.  He could not remember what happened after the accident until 9.00 pm the following day. 
9          It was his evidence that he did not know what was stated in the description of accident in the notice of accident (Form A) filed with the Ministry of Manpower by the defendants at PBD 5 to 8, when it was filed.  He alleged in his supplementary affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the defendants’ safety officer, Alexis Eng Jee Inn, DW2, had approached him and asked him to state the account that was stated in the notice of accident, but he did not agree to do so.  It was stated in the notice of accident at PBD8, that he was carrying a bundle of steel bars for fixing the reinforcement for a staircase.  He was walking up the timber formwork, which was wet from the rain, when he slipped and fell forward.  He hit the left side of his face and slipped down the formwork.  He alleged that what was stated in the notice of accident was untrue. 
10        Subsequently, sometime in December 2003 before the interview with the representative from the defendants’ insurers, he was again asked to tell the version that was stated in the notice of accident.  However, he claimed that he gave an account of what had happened on the day of the accident and the statement at DBD5 to 6 was recorded on 13 December 2002.  Under cross-examination, he claimed that although part of the statement was translated to him, it was not translated to him in its entirety and that the part, which stated that “the timber support gave way”, was inaccurate.  He maintained that he and PW1 were standing on the aluminium beams when they were nailing the timber runners and not on the timber runners that have not been nailed yet when he fell.  It was also his evidence under cross-examination that they had started nailing the timber runners since the morning and they had continued with the work after lunch at about 1.00 pm to 1.15 pm.  By the time he fell, the two of them had almost completed the work and there were only about ten or more remaining timber runners to be nailed.
11        After he fell, he was brought to a clinic and subsequently to the Singapore General Hospital (hereinafter referred to as SGH) for treatment.  His external injuries that were noted on 10 April 2002 were: abrasions over right ring finger; and 3 cm laceration lateral to his left eye.  He was discharged on 11 April 2002 after a period of observation and given outpatient medical leave from 11 April 2002 to 13 April 2002.  The medical report from SGH is at PBD 18 to 19.  He returned to work at the work site after the medical leave.  He was assigned to work at another work site at Pasir Ris from 18 May 2002, until he met with a second accident on 26 May 2002.  A metal formwork fell from above and hit his right elbow.  He was treated at Changi General Hospital (hereinafter referred to as CGH) and given medical leave from 27 May 2002 to 3 August 2002.  A copy of the referral for continuation of treatment from CGH is at PBD9.
12        He sought treatment at SGH on 31 May 2002 as he felt some pain in his back, numbness in his lower right leg and experienced bouts of giddiness.  He was discharged with some medication and medical leave for two days.  On 2 July 2002, he went back to SGH and again complained of pain in his back and right knee and numbness of his right lower limb, which had worsened.  The examination showed that there was mild effusion of the right knee and there was some decreased sensation over the L4/L5 nerve root distribution.  He was given oral analgesics and medical leave till 3 July 2002.  An appointment was fixed for him to see a specialist at the Department of Neurology.  He went back to SGH on 12 August 2002 with complaints of right knee and back pain associated with numbness over his right leg.  He was given medical leave till 16 August 2002, his appointment at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery. 
13        He underwent physiotherapy for three months, but there was no improvement.  He was admitted at SGH on 7 October 2002 for a prolapsed inter-vertebral disc at the L5/S1 level with a right S1 nerve root compression.  He underwent surgery and was discharged ambulating with crutches on 13 October 2002.  On 5 November 2002, he was admitted again to SGH for back pain and sciatica with an inability to walk without support.  He received conservative treatment with analgesics and physiotherapy and was discharge ambulating with crutches on 12 November 2002.  He has produced medical certificates for the following periods: 11 to 13 April 2002, 2 to 3 July 02, 30 July 2002 to 13 August 2002, 12 to 16 August 2002, 16 August 2002 to 27 September 2002 (light duty), 27 August 2002 to 27 October 2002, 23 October 2002 to 4 December 2002, 26 November 2002 to 14 December 2002, 5 December 2002 to 8 January 2003, 11 January 2003 to 23 February 2003, 25 February 2003 to 17 March 2003, 31 March 2003 to 29 April 2003, which are at PBD20 to 36.
14        His evidence was that he was working as a construction carpenter in China for about seven years prior to coming to Singapore on 21 August 2001.  His average income was RMB1,800, which was equivalent to $400, per month.  He has education up to the equivalent of upper secondary level and was only qualified to take on blue-collar jobs.  He claimed that he would be unable to return to work in the construction industry.  He claimed that but for the injury, his income in Singapore should amount to $1,419 per month.  He had only been paid a total sum of $4,970 by the defendants, since April 2002. He claimed that he had incurred $165 for medical expenses and $200 for transport expenses.
The defendants’ case
The evidence of Low Ah Hing, DW1
15        Low Ah Hing, DW1 was the formworks supervisor at the defendants’ work site and the plaintiff’s supervisor at the material time.  His evidence was that the formwork that the plaintiff was building was a platform formwork for the carpenters to stand on top of the platform to carry out their work on the ceiling.  He had asked the plaintiff and PW1 to nail the timer runners onto the aluminium beams on 10 April 2002.  The timber board was to be placed on top of the timber runners and the aluminium beams thereafter.
16        Under cross-examination, he confirmed that the metal frame, jack-screws and aluminium beams had already been installed by another group of workers, before he assigned the job of nailing the timber runners onto the aluminium beams to the plaintiff and PW1.  He was not present when the plaintiff fell.  He claimed that he had inspected the scaffold and found that there was no problem with it, after it was erected.  He did not check the scaffold after the accident, as he was not informed that the scaffold had collapsed.  No one had informed him of any problem with the formwork and the workers continued working there after the accident.  His evidence was that if the aluminium beam was dislodged, the timber runners would have had to be removed and the aluminium beam dismantled and re-installed.  This was not done after the accident, as he was not informed of any problem with the aluminium beams.  However, he admitted that if the jack-screw was not properly secured, it was possible that the aluminium beam could be dislodged. 
17        His evidence was that the workers would have to stand at the beam area at the side of the scaffold while they were nailing the timber runners.  He claimed that there were beams and slabs at the side of the structure, where the timber and plywood had already been done up and the workers could work there.  He also claimed that there were timber barricades at the side so that they would not fall off.  However, he did not notice where the plaintiff and PW1 were standing while they were carrying out their work, when he walked past the area several times that morning.  While his evidence was that the plaintiff could not fall below level two as the landing had been cemented, he confirmed that after the accident, he had found the plaintiff injured at the staircase landing from level one to level two.  According to DW1, the distance between level two and level three was 2.5 m and that between level one and level two, 3m.
The evidence of Alexis Eng Jee Inn, DW2
18        Alexis Eng Jee Inn, DW2 was formerly employed as a safety officer with the defendants.  He was not present at the site at the time of the accident.  He stated in paragraph 3 of his affidavit that he arrived at the scene of the accident after he was informed of the accident on 10 April 2002.  However, under cross-examination, he admitted that he did not go to the scene on 10 April 2002, after the accident.  He also stated in paragraph 5 of his affidavit that he was informed by the plaintiff, that the plaintiff was standing on the timber runner, and was nailing some other timber runner onto the aluminium I-beam, when the timber runner he was standing on slipped and he fell through the gap. 
19        He stated at paragraph 9 of his affidavit that sometime later, the plaintiff had told him that the accident took place as he was carrying a small bundle of steel bars and he had slipped and fallen forward.  He then informed the defendants, who put up the notice of accident dated 3 May 2002 at PBD5 to 8 to the Ministry of Manpower.  He claimed that he subsequently found out that the version stated in the notice of accident was untrue.  The insurers took another statement from the plaintiff on the accident on 13 December 2002.  While he claimed that he believed that what was stated in the notice of accident was the true version at the time, he could not explain his reason for doing so, other than that the plaintiff had told him so.  He also denied that he had asked the plaintiff to lie about the cause of the accident when he was preparing the notice of accident and when the representative from the defendants’ insurers wanted to take a further statement on the accident from the plaintiff.
20        Under cross-examination, he stated that he had investigated the accident by interviewing the witnesses and put up a report in the form of the 9
th
 schedule, which was filed together with the notice of accident.  However, he did not know the reason why his investigation report was not disclosed by the defendants, and he could not remember what the contents of the report.  He claimed that he had spoken with DW1 and one or two of the workers but he could not remember if he had interviewed PW1 about the accident. 
21        Upon being referred to the definition of “scaffold” under the Factories (Building Operations and Works of Engineering Construction) Regulations (Regulation 8, Cap 104), he conceded that the structure that the plaintiff was working on, which was a working platform, would fall within the definition.  He admitted that he did not inspect the structure from which the plaintiff had fallen, either before or after the accident.  According to him, the structure was still in the course of erection when the accident happened.  Although all workers had been issued with safety belts, he was of the view that it was not very practical for the plaintiff to use a safety belt where he was working on the scaffold.  It was also not practical to use a life line or safety netting.  He did not mention any platform or barricades put up at the side of the scaffold for the safety of the workers who were erecting the platform.  He claimed that he had advised the workers to put the timber runners on the aluminium beams randomly, place a plywood board on top of the timber runners and then stand on the plywood.  However, he admitted that the workers could not place a plywood board on top of the timber runners and would have to stand on the aluminium beams, when they were nailing the timber runners onto the aluminium beams.  In any event, it would have been rather dangerous, if the workers had stood on a plywood board that had been placed over timber runners that were placed randomly and not nailed onto the aluminium beams. 
The medical evidence
The evidence of Dr Mark Leong, PW3
22        Dr Mark Leong, PW3, a Consultant with the Department of Emergency Medicine, SGH, confirmed the contents of his report at PBD18 and 19.   Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the report were prepared, based on the records of attendance by other doctors at the Accident and Emergency Department, SGH.  He examined the plaintiff when he was first admitted on 10 April 2002.  PW3 said that, either the plaintiff, or the colleague or the supervisor who had accompanied the plaintiff to the hospital, had informed him that the plaintiff had fallen from a height of 2 m.  PW3’s evidence was that the plaintiff had no recollection of how he was injured at the time.  The plaintiff was conscious “but reported some retrograde amnesia.  He complained of pain over the left side of his head and face.  He did not complain of any pain over his chest, abdomen, pelvis or spine.”  He went on to state, “His neck and spine was non tender.”  Both limbs exhibited full range of movements and external injuries noted were: abrasions over right ring finger and 3-centimetre laceration lateral to left eye.  X-ray showed no fractures of skull and face.  His laceration was sutured and he was admitted for head injury observation.  He was discharged the following morning at 7.23 am to the polyclinic for removal of sutures and given medical leave from 11 to 13 April 2002. 
23        His evidence was that the plaintiff did not have back pain or other symptom at that point of time to indicate that he was suffering a prolapsed disc.  It was his opinion, that it was possible, but unlikely that the plaintiff had suffered a prolapsed disc from the fall, as he did not complain of back pain until some three months later.  He stated that most significant injuries, should surface very early after injury, within hours or a day and symptoms of an acute prolapse of intervertebral disc generally manifest acutely.  However, he stated that it was possible that the bilateral knee pain that the plaintiff complained of on 31 May 2002, may have been related to the L5/S1 prolapsed disc, but rather improbable because there was no back pain.  On 2 July 2002, the plaintiff had complained of right lower leg numbness and right knee pain and there was an indication that the plaintiff had an abnormality in his 4
th
 lumbar and 5
th
 lumbar nerve root distribution.  He was treated with oral analgesics, given medical leave from 2 to 3 July 2002, and a specialist appointment at the Neurology Department.  However, PW3 did not have the records from the Neurology Department with him.  The plaintiff returned on 12 August 2002 with complaints of right knee and back pains, when he was then under the care of the Orthopaedic Surgery Department.
The evidence of Dr John Chen Li Tat, PW4
24        John Chen Li Tat, PW4, the Registrar of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, SGH first saw the plaintiff on 15 July 2002 and the plaintiff’s main complaint at the time was chronic back pain.  His specialist report on the plaintiff is at PBD53 to 54.  His evidence was that a fall from a height is a significant injury and is likely to result in injury of prolapsed disc.  He confirmed that the bilateral knee pain complained of on 31 May 2002 could have been the result of a fall and could be related to the prolapsed disc.  The complaints of knee pain and lower limb numbness on 2 July 2002 were also indicative of a prolapsed disc. 
25        He then referred to the report of the MRI of the lumbar spine performed on 20 August 2002, which was admitted and marked exhibit P1.  It stated the following comments: “There are two levels of disc degeneration and herniation present.  At the L5/S1 level, there is strong suspicion of compression on the right S1 nerve root.  There is bilateral nerve root canal stenosis seen by no compression on the exiting L5 nerve roots.  At the L4/5 level, the disc herniation is to the right of the midline with possible indentation on the left L5 nerve root…”.  Basically, the plaintiff had two conditions existing: degenerative discs and disc herniation.  Disc herniation is usually related to wear and tear, but is also seen in conditions which involve injury to the back.  PW4 stated initially, that because of the plaintiff’s pre-existing degenerative condition, it would be difficult to prove whether the prolapsed disc was the direct result of injury.  He also stated that symptoms of back pain would present itself immediately or less commonly, within a week or several weeks after the injury.  Subsequently, in answer to questions by the court, he clarified that a prolapsed disc usually presents itself as leg pain, sciatica, rather than back pain.  He went further to state that it is not unusual for a patient with prolapsed disc to have only leg pain without back pain.  A common cause of back pain is due to degenerative disc, which the plaintiff also had.  So when the plaintiff did not present with back pain but presented with leg numbness or weakness, it was quite likely that he had a prolapsed disc following his injury.  He also stated that going by the history and presentation of knee pain six to seven weeks later, it was possible that the injury, that is the fall, had precipitated the prolapsed due to his underlying degenerative disc condition.  He then went on to state that it was probable, based on the presentation of symptoms within six to seven weeks of persistent leg pain lasting several weeks that the fall had precipitated the prolapsed disc.
26        He stated in examination-in-chief that with treatment, he was confident that the plaintiff would be able to recover to perform most of the activities of daily living as well as undertake some form of employment.  He could not state the time required for the plaintiff to recover, but considering his condition at the time, he did not believe that the plaintiff could return to his previous employment in construction.  However, under cross-examination, he stated that given proper treatment, it was possible that the plaintiff would be able to recover to return to being a construction worker within a year or two.  He would recommend that the plaintiff underwent further surgery and physiotherapy.  The costs for the surgery could range from $15,000 to $25,000, based on class B1 rates at SGH.  The plaintiff would also require 6 sessions of physiotherapy, costing about $30 to $50 per session.
The evidence of Dr V Kanda Pillay, PW5
27        Dr V Kanda Pillay, PW5, a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon reviewed the plaintiff on 6 January 2003.  His specialist report on the plaintiff is at PBD46 to 48.  The plaintiff informed him that he had fallen from a height of 4 m and lost consciousness.  He still had severe pain in his lower back and right lower limb and had to use 2 axillary crutches.  He could not stand erect and stood in about 20 degree flexion at the hips.  There was hardly any spinal movement and it was not possible to extend his back.  Straight leg raising was 50 degrees on the right and 70 degrees on the left.  He had slight sensory loss in the sole of the right foot and he was acutely tender over the lumbar region.  MRI showed that a L5/S1 laminotomy was done.  The disc was degenerated with marked reduction in the disc space.  There was bulging of the disc and evidence of infection in the disc space and in the adjacent L5/S1 vertebral bodies.  There was also degeneration and protrusion of the L4/5 disc.  The protrusion on the left side, caused a displacement of the thecal sac and a mild left foraminal stenosis.  There was evidence of facet degeneration at the L4/5, as well as the L5/S1 levels. 
28        His opinion was that given the age of the plaintiff, his work history as a construction worker, there was probably early degeneration of the two lumbar discs, the L4/5 and L5/S1 discs.  A fall from 4 m would have caused the L4/5 disc bulge, L5/S1 disc prolapsed and precipitated the acute symptoms.   However, if there had not been a fall, the plaintiff could have carried on working as a manual worker for another 15 to 20 years.  Subsequent to the surgery for the removal of the prolapsed L5/S1 disc, the plaintiff developed a disc space infection as well as osteomyelitis of his lumbar spine at the L4/5 level. 
29        PW5 was of the view that with successful treatment the plaintiff may be able to do some light work, but it was unlikely that he would be able to return to his job as a construction carpenter.  With successful surgery and treatment, the plaintiff would be relieved of the pain, but there would be restriction of movement.  He would only have three discs left and the lower two discs, which are the more mobile ones, would have been fused.  He was also of the view that the prolapsed disc was unlikely to have been caused by the accident on 26 May 2000, when the plaintiff’s elbow was injured.  He stated that even if the plaintiff had fallen while he was standing and taking evasive action to avoid the object that fell on him, it was more likely to have been caused by a fall from height.  The injury to the elbow was also most unlikely to have affected the spine.
The evidence of Dr Anuj Gupta, PW6
30        Dr Anuj Gupta, PW6 was the Medical Officer who attended to the plaintiff on 28 May 2002, one day after he attended at the Accident and Emergency Department, SGH on 27 May 2002.  He prepared the referral for continuation of treatment at PBD9.  His evidence was that x-rays of the injury to the plaintiff’s right elbow did not show any fracture. It was possible that there was soft tissue injury or a very small fracture.  Upon review of the x-rays, Dr Tan HH, saw a small anterior fat pad sign, which could indicate a very small radial head fracture, which was treated conservatively.  He was of the view that the plaintiff’s complaints of vertiginious giddiness and bilateral knee pain on 31 May 2002, did not have any relation to the injury to the right elbow.
Issue of liability of the defendants
31        The plaintiff claimed that the defendants were in breach of their statutory and/or common law duty of care to the plaintiff and pleaded in the particulars of negligence of the defendants, that the defendants had failed:
a)         to ensure that the scaffold was of sound construction and was properly maintained;
b)         to provide a secure foothold and handhold at the place where the plaintiff was working from which he was liable to fall a distance of more than 3 m;
c)         to ensure that suitable means of anchorage for the use of safety belt was provided;
d)         to ensure that a life line was provided;
e)         to ensure that the scaffold was of sound material, good construction and adequate strength;
f)          to ensure that the scaffold was suitable and safe for the purpose for which it was intended;
g)         to ensure that the scaffold was erected by scaffold erectors who have undergone proper training;
h)         to ensure that the scaffold was erected with proper equipment and/or competent workmen;
i)          to ensure that the work site was a safe place of work in ensuring that the scaffold was of sound construction.
32        The plaintiff also relied on the doctrine 
res ipsa loquitur.
  It was noted that although the plaintiff did not specifically plead that the defendants had failed to provide a safe and system of work generally, some of the particulars pleaded related to the system of work.  However, the failure to provide proper supervision was not specifically pleaded.
33        The two main issues of fact that had to be determined were:
a)         Whether the plaintiff was standing on the I-shaped aluminium-alloy beam or on the timber runner when he fell and whether the aluminium beam had given way suddenly or did the plaintiff fall when he slipped while standing on the timber runner;
b)
                 
 
What were the injuries that the plaintiff suffered as a result of the accident and what was the quantum of damages the plaintiff was entitled to if the defendants were in breach of their duty to the plaintiff.
a)         Whether the plaintiff was standing on the I-shaped aluminium-alloy beam or on the timber runner when he fell and whether the aluminium beam had given way suddenly or did the plaintiff fall when he slipped while standing on the timber runner 
34        Whether the structure was a formwork or a scaffold, the defendants had a duty to ensure that the structure was safe for the plaintiff to work on and that there was a safe system of work.  There was no direct evidence as to who were the workers who had erected the structure and whether they were qualified scaffold erectors.  Both PW1 and the plaintiff confirmed that the metal structure, which comprised the metal frames, aluminium beams and jack-screws, was completed before they were instructed to nail the timber runners onto the aluminium beams.  But they were not aware of the identity of the workers who had erected the structure.  The defendants did not dispute that the plaintiff and PW1 were not qualified scaffold erectors.  The plaintiff’s counsel submitted that the defendants were in breach of Regulation 75 of the Factories (Building Operations and Works of Engineering Construction) Regulations.   Regulation 75 provided that scaffolds shall be erected, added to, altered or dismantled by scaffold erectors who have undergone a course of training approved by the Chief Inspector.  In this regard, I would refer to the judgment of the Honourable Chief Justice in the case of 
Mohd bin Sapri v Soil-Build (Pte) Ltd and anor

, in relation to a breach of section 33(7) of the Factories Act at page 519:
“It would be wrong in principle to treat any breach of the Act as if it engendered strict liability for the purpose of claiming compensation in tort.  The issue of causation must be addressed….”
35        The defendants’ formworks supervisor, Low Ah Hing, DW1 alleged under cross-examination, that the plaintiff and PW1 would have been able to stand at the beam area at the side of the structure while they were nailing the timber runners.  He further claimed that there were beams and slabs at the side, where the timber and plywood had already been done up and that there were barricades at the side to ensure that the workers would not fall off.  However, this was not referred to in the defence filed or his affidavit of evidence-in-chief.  The defendants have also not adduced any photographs of the structure where the plaintiff was working on.  The defendants’ safety officer, Alexis Eng Jee Inn, DW2 on the other hand, did not make any reference to this area at the side of the structure where the plaintiff and PW1 could have stood.  In fact, he admitted that while the workmen were nailing the timber runners, they would have to stand on the aluminium beams.  He also admitted that it would not have been practicable for them to use a safety belt, safety line or safety net.
36        Ding Cui Ping, PW1 and the plaintiff claimed that they were standing on the aluminium beam when it gave way and the plaintiff fell.  PW1’s evidence was that the beam that the plaintiff was standing was not overlapped at the joint and that it had dislodged suddenly.  The plaintiff fell before he could warn the plaintiff.  It was his evidence that both workers would be looking down while they were going about their work of nailing the timber runners.  It seemed too much of a coincidence that PW1 would, at the point of time when the beam was about to be dislodged, look in the direction of the beam that the plaintiff was standing on.  He was supposed to have been concentrating on keeping his foot-hold on the aluminium beam and nailing the timber runners onto the beam at the same time.  He had also stated that he went back to work, after the plaintiff was sent to seek medical attention.  He made no mention of having told DW1, about the dislodged aluminium beam or that anything was done to rectify the structure with regard to the dislodged beam.  DW1’s evidence was that there was no report that there was anything that was wrong with the structure.  His evidence was that if the aluminium beam had in fact been dislodged, the timber runners and the aluminium beams would have had to be dismantled and re-installed.  His evidence was that this was not done and that the workers continued working on the structure after the accident without further mishap. 
37        The defendants on the other hand, alleged that the plaintiff had fallen while he was standing on one of the timber runners that have not been nailed and that he fell through the gap.  It should be noted firstly, both DW1 and DW2 were not present when the plaintiff fell.  The defendants did not call their safety supervisor, one Veerasamy, who was allegedly present at the work site at the time and had taken photographs of the scene of the accident thereafter, to give evidence.  DW2 could not offer any reason why Veerasamy was not called as a witness, and an adverse inference could be drawn against the defendants under section 116(g) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97), for their failure to do so. 
38        DW2 alleged that the plaintiff had told him after the accident that he had fallen while he was standing on the timber runner.  However, this was not the description that was stated in the notice of the accident that he had put on behalf of the defendants and was signed by the defendants’ director at PBD8.  He claimed that the plaintiff had told him another version before he filed the notice of accident.  He also claimed that he had put up an investigation report and that the report should have been submitted together with the notice of accident, but he could not remember its contents.  This document was also not adduced by the defendants.  In any event, if it was submitted together with the notice of accident, the account of the accident in the report would have been consistent with the description in the notice of accident.  The defendants did not dispute that the account given in the notice of accident filed by them was not true.  DW2 claimed that he believed that the version in the notice of accident was true at that point of time, but could not offer any reason for his alleged belief.  The plaintiff’s statement at DBD5 that was recorded by the defendants’ insurer’s representative on the other hand, did not state that the plaintiff was standing on the timber runner and that it had slipped, thereby causing him to fall.  It merely stated, “the timber support gave way”.  The plaintiff claimed that there could have been a mistake in the recording of the statement, as the person who recorded the statement did not translate its entire contents to him.  As the defendants did not call the person who recorded the statement to give evidence in rebuttal, the plaintiff’s version would have to be accepted.   There could have been some confusion as to whether the plaintiff had referred to an aluminium support or a timber support.
39        Basically the plaintiff’s evidence was that he was standing on the aluminium beam when it gave way and he fell.  Although PW1’s evidence that he noticed that the aluminium beam was not overlapped at the jack-screw was not credible, and I was not satisfied that the beam had dislodged, I accepted the plaintiff’s and PW1’s evidence that they were standing on the aluminium beams when the plaintiff fell.  For some reason, the plaintiff had lost his balance, slipped and fallen while he was nailing the timber runners to the aluminium beam.  In fact, it would appear that the plaintiff was actually not sure as to how he had fallen from the structure.  PW3’s evidence was that he had no recollection of how he was injured when he was attended to at the SGH. 
40        Having considered the evidence of the four witnesses of fact, I was satisfied that the defendants had failed to provide a safe system of work by requiring the plaintiff to stand on the aluminium beams while nailing the timber runners.  It was also not practicable for the plaintiff to use a safety belt, a safety line or a safety net.  However, although the work may have been dangerous, without a secure foothold and handhold and suitable means to use the safety belt, life line or safety net while working from height, the plaintiff also had to duty to watch out and protect himself from injuries.  In the circumstances, I found that the defendants were 75percent liable and the plaintiff 25 percent contributorily liable for the accident.
b)         What were the injuries that the plaintiff suffered as a result of the accident and what was the quantum of damages the plaintiff was entitled to if the defendants were in breach of their duty to the plaintiff
41        When the plaintiff was examined at the Accident and Emergency Department, SGH on 10 April 2002, he was noted to have sustained abrasions over his right ring finger and 3cm laceration lateral to his left eye.  According to the report by Dr Mark Leong, PW3 at PBD17 to 18, the plaintiff went back to SGH on the following dates: on 31 May 2002 with complaints of vertiginous giddiness and bilateral knee pain; on 2 July 2002 with complaints of right lower limb numbness and right knee pain; and on 12 August 2002 with complaints of right knee pain and back pain.  The plaintiff went to see Dr John Chen Li Tat, PW4 at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery on 15 July 2002 with symptoms of back pain and numbness in the right limb.  According to the specialist report at PBD53 to 54, there were signs of nerve root tension in the right lower limb and weakness in the big toe and he was diagnosed with a prolapsed disc at L5/S1.  An MRI was done on 20 August 2002 and the report is at exhibit P1.  The plaintiff was admitted at SGH on 7 to 13 October 2002 for surgery, a right sided discectomy at the L5/S1.  On 5 to 12 November 2002, he was re-admitted for recurrence of back pain with left sided sciatica and was unable to walk without support.  He was re-admitted on 11 to 24 January 2003, as his back pain did not improve.  He was examined by Dr V Kanda Pillay, PW5 on 6 January 2003 and the specialist report is at PBD47 to 48.
42        The issue that arose was whether the back injury or prolapsed disc, was caused by the accident.  Although PW3 was of the view that the injury was not likely to have been caused by the fall since that there was no complaint of acute back pain after the fall, he went on to state that the plaintiff’s complaints on 31 May 2002, could have been related to the prolapsed disc.  There was no evidence of any other incident involving the plaintiff, other than the elbow injury caused by a metal formwork that fell on his arm on 26 May 2002.  Both PW5 and PW5 were clear in their view that the prolapsed disc was unrelated to the elbow injury. 
43        PW4 stated initially, that the plaintiff might have had a pre-existing condition of degenerative disc that was aggravated by the fall.  He also stated that although it was possible that the symptoms of back pain may have been delayed, it is well known that patients with acute symptoms from an injury to the back usually present with symptoms of back pain at the earliest onset.  However, under cross-examination, he pointed out that the plaintiff’s complaints of lower leg numbness and right knee pain on 2 July 2002, referred to in paragraph 5 at PBD 19, were related to the prolapsed disc.  In fact, these were subtle signs and symptoms that could have been missed, but were not in this case.  The plaintiff was given a specialist appointment with Neurology.  PW4’s evidence upon clarification by the court as to whether back pain would present immediately, if the disc herniation were caused by injury or trauma was as follows:
“I would say that prolapsed disc usually presents itself as leg pain rather than back pain alone.  Prolapsed disc usually relate to sciatica, leg pain.  It is not unusual for a patient with prolapsed disc to have only leg pain without back pain.  A common cause of back pain is due to degenerative disc, which this patient also has.  So when the patient did not present with back pain, but presented leg numbness and weakness, it is quite likely that he had a prolapsed disc following his injury.”
He finally concluded that it was probable, going by the history and presentation of knee pain six to seven weeks later on 31 May 2002, that the fall on 10 April 2002 had precipitated the prolapsed disc due to his underlying degenerative disc condition.  He went on to state in answer to the defendants’ counsel’s question in clarification the following:
“…I would venture to add that symptoms of prolapsed disc at initial stage does not present with back pain but present with persistent leg pain lasting several weeks.”
44        PW5 also agreed that the plaintiff had a degenerative disc condition and was of the view that the prolapsed L5/S1 disc was more likely to have been caused by a fall from height.  Similarly, for the protrusion at the L4/5 level.
45        Although the views of PW3, PW4 and PW5 as to whether the fall had caused the prolapsed disc at L5/S1 and the protrusion of L4/5, ranged from possible but not probable by PW3, to probable by PW4 and more likely by PW5, all three doctors had linked the plaintiff’s complaints of bilateral knee pain on 31 May 2002, some seven weeks after the fall, to the prolapsed disc.  Both PW4 and PW5 were of the view that presentation of symptom of sciatica within the said period after the fall was not uncommon.  It should be noted that both PW4 and PW5 were Specialist Orthopaedic Surgeons, while PW3 was a Consultant in the Department of Emergency Medicine.  In view of the evidence of PW4 and PW5, I was satisfied on a balance of probability that the prolapsed disc at the L5/S1 level and the protrusion at the L4/5 level of the plaintiff, were caused by the fall from the accident on 10 April 2002.
46        The plaintiff’s counsel submitted that general damages and future medical expenses should be awarded to the plaintiff as follows:
a)         prolapsed inter-vertebral disc at L5/S1 level, infection, aggravation of disc degeneration at L4/5 and facet  degeneration                                                                       $30,000
b)         retrograde amnesia                                                  $ 2,000
c)         3cm laceration lateral to his left eye and abrasions to right ring finger                                                                                                                                         $2,000
d)         7cm incisional scar in lumbar region                           $2,000
e)         future medical expenses (surgery and physiotherapy)  $15,240
47        The defendants’ counsel submitted the following quantum in respect of general damages and future medical expenses:
a)         prolapsed inter-vertebral disc at L5/S1 level, infection, aggravation of disc degeneration at L4/5 and facet degeneration                                                                         $20,000
b)         retrograde amnesia                                                    nil
c)         3cm laceration lateral to his left eye and abrasions to right ring finger                                                                                                                                        $2,000
d)         7cm incisional scar in lumbar region                           nil
e)         future medical expenses (surgery and physiotherapy)  $10,000
The defendants’ counsel confirmed that transport expenses were agreed between the parties at $200 and pre-trial loss of earnings for the period from 10 April 2002 to 10 January 2003 at $7,767.40.  He also confirmed prior to judgment being given that future medical expenses were agreed at $10,000.
48        The plaintiff suffered a prolapsed disc at the L5/S1 level and disc herniation at the L4/5 level.  He underwent a right sided L5/S1 discectomy but experienced recurrence of low back pain following the surgery due to an infection.  As a result, he would have to undergo further surgery to deal with the infection and the protrusion at the L4/5 level.  According to PW5, this would relieve the pain tremendously but there would be restriction of movement of his back, as three of his vertebrae would be fused and immobile.  It was a serious injury to the back, for which the plaintiff would have to undergo in total, two operations.  An award of $25,000 was made by the District Court in the case of 
Zhao Chuan Wang v Straits Construction Company (Private) Limited
 in DC Suit No 3309 of 2001.  I was of the view that a similar award of $25,000, would be appropriate for the pain and suffering and loss of amenities in the present case.
49        The plaintiff also suffered a 3 cm laceration lateral to his left eye and abrasions to his right ring finger and retrograde amnesia for which I awarded the sums of $2,000 and $500 respectively.  An award of $1,000 was also made for the surgical scar.
Loss of earning capacity or loss of future earnings
50        The remaining issue as regards quantum was whether plaintiff should be awarded damages for loss of future earnings or loss of earning capacity.  Dr John Chen Li Tat, PW4 stated in examination-in-chief initially, that in his condition at the time, the plaintiff was unlikely to be able to return to his previous occupation as a construction worker.  However, under cross-examination by the defendants’ counsel, he opined that with further surgery, the plaintiff would be able to return to his job as a construction carpenter within one to two years, although he could not say exactly how long it would take.  PW4 also did not elaborate on the nature of the surgery that would have to be done and the extent of its effect on the plaintiff’s disabilities.  Dr V Kanda Pillay, PW5 on the other hand, was of the view that the plaintiff would not be able to return to work as a construction worker, even after surgery.  He pointed out that although the plaintiff may be relieved of much of the pain, he would still have a stiff back as he would only have three discs instead of five.  As PW4 was not asked to elaborate on the basis for his opinion, PW5’s opinion was preferred and accepted.  Given the circumstances, it would be unlikely that the plaintiff would be able to find useful employment as a construction carpenter either in Singapore or China in the future, even after further surgery and treatment.  He would however, be able to do some light work.
51        The plaintiff’s counsel submitted that the plaintiff was 33 years old and that a multiplier of 15 should be applied.  The plaintiff’s salary in Singapore was $1,000 and his expenses, $250 per month.  His salary in China was about $360 and expenses about $50.  The multiplicand should therefore, be $750 and $310, less $100 for some light work that he would be able to do in China, and the multiplier to be used should be 6 and 9 respectively.  The defendants’ counsel submitted that an award of $25,000 for loss of earning capacity or loss of future earnings would be appropriate in this case.  He was of the view that there was no available evidence on the plaintiff’s earnings and it was uncertain whether his work permit would be renewed.  Further, PW4’s evidence was that the plaintiff would be able to return to normal work after one to two years.
52        Based on PW5’s evidence on the plaintiff’s eventual residual disabilities, I was satisfied that the plaintiff would not be able to return to return to work as construction worker.  With his education and disabilities it was unlikely that he would be able to find a similar job in China.  He may be able to do some low paying light work after surgery and a period of rehabilitation.  As the plaintiff was 33 years old, an award of loss of future earnings using a multiplier of 15 would be appropriate.  I awarded the plaintiff pre-trial loss of earnings at $750 per month from February 2003 to September 2003, a period of eight months, ($750 x 8) amounting to $6,000.  As the loss of earnings from April 2002 to January 2003 had been agreed at $7,767.40, the award for pre-trial loss of earnings amounted in total to $13,767.40.
53        The plaintiff’s work permit expired in August 2003.  Being a skilled worker, he may have been able to obtain a work permit to work in Singapore up to a maximum of ten years.  He may however, not want to stay for such an extended period, because his parents, wife and daughter are in China.  As it was speculative whether his work permit would be renewed and he would want to remain in Singapore to work for the entire balance period, I awarded him loss of future earnings based on his earnings in Singapore for four years from the date of expiry of his work permit.  I would distinguish the case of 
Xu Jing Long v Nian Chuan Construction Pte Ltd
 
[2001] 4 SLR 624
, where the plaintiff was awarded loss of future earnings based on his earnings in Singapore for seven years and his earnings in China for eight years, on the assumption that he would resume working upon his return to China.  In that case, there was evidence that the plaintiff was a good worker with high performance, within the top twenty per cent of the defendants’ workers and that his work permit was likely to have been renewed.  In the present case, there was no evidence as regards the plaintiff’s performance.  The defendants’ counsel submitted that the case 
of Wu Liang Zhu v Chan Yue Ming and Anor
 [unreported, Suit No 291 of 2001 and RA 57 of 2002], where on appeal the award was reduced to 30 percent of the plaintiff’s future earnings, should be applied.  However, the Assistant Registrar had found that the plaintiff would recover fully in about a year’s time in the case.  The final award was made on the basis that the plaintiff would suffer some reduced earning capacity on average over a 17-year period.  In view of my findings based on PW5’s evidence that the plaintiff would not be able to return to work as a construction carpenter even after surgery, I awarded the plaintiff full loss of future earnings for a period of two years.  This was the period that he would require to undergo the operation and rehabilitate to a stage whereby he would be able to do some light work, that is, at $750 per month for 24 months ($750 x 24), amounting to $18,000.  I also awarded him loss of future earnings for another 23 months based on his earnings in Singapore, after taking into consideration an estimated income of  $150 per month for light work that he may be able to do in China ($600 x 23).  This would amount to $13,800.  The award for the remaining period of 11 years for which he would be entitled to loss of future earnings was based on the pay he would have been able to earn in China at $360, after deducting his personal needs at $60, and what he may be able to earn doing light work, at $150 ($150 x 11 x 12), amounting to $19,800.  The award for loss of future earnings therefore, amounted in total to $51,600.
54        In the circumstances, I awarded the plaintiff damages on a 100 percent basis as follows:
General Damages
Pain and suffering                                 $28,500
Loss of future earnings                          $31,800
(Multipler of 4 for Singapore less $150 for light work for 23 months)
Loss of future earnings in China             $19,800
(Multiplier of 11 for China less $150 for light work)
Future medical expenses                        $10,000 (agreed)
Special Damages
Transport                                                $200 (agreed)
Medical expenses                                    $165 (agreed)
Loss of pre-trial earnings                       $13,767.40
$7,767.40 (agreed for April 2002 to January 2003) plus $750 x 6 from February to September 2003
Total:                                                    $104,232.40
At 75%:                                                $ 78,174.80      
In the circumstances, I entered judgment for the plaintiff against the defendants in the sum of $78,174.80; interest at 6% per annum on the sum of  $31,974.30, from the date of issue of writ to judgment and costs. 
Costs
55        The trial which proceeded on both liability and quantum was heard over three days.  One of the main issues was whether the plaintiff’s back injury was caused by the accident on 10 April 2002.  Both counsel tendered written submissions and replies.  I was of the view that a sum of $16,000 plus reasonable disbursements to be taxed, if not agreed would be appropriate, and fixed costs to be awarded to the plaintiff accordingly.

Introduction
 
 
1          The accused Teo Yeow Chuah was charged with various offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185.  The prosecution proceeded on the first charge which read:
That you, Teo Yeow Chuah, on or about the 29
th
 day of January 2003, at about 7.30 p.m., at the rooftop outside unit #04-01 Fragrance Court, No. 12 Yew Siang Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class ‘A’ of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, 2 big packets and 89 small packets of substance containing not less than 55.29 grams of diamorphine at the said place, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Chapter 185, and punishable under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
Evidence for the prosecution regarding the arrest of the accused
2          The evidence for the prosecution was that on 29 January 2003, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) were instructed to conduct a surveillance on the accused who was known to be driving a gold-coloured BMW bearing registration number SBR 4X. The accused did not own this car and I will refer to it as ""SBR 4X"". The CNB had received information that the accused and one Lee Siong Lim knew each other and drugs were stored at Fragrance Court (NE  312 to 314). Fragrance Court is a low-rise four-storey apartment block.
3          The accused’s address was Block 515 West Coast Road #12-527. On the way to Block 515, the CNB officers spotted SBR 4X at an Esso petrol kiosk along West Coast Road at about 3.30 pm. 
4          At about 5.20 pm, the accused got into SBR 4X and drove off.  The CNB officers tailed him to a multi-storey carpark at Block 10 Everton Road/Cantonment Close. The accused parked at deck 2B and proceeded to Block 16 and took a lift upstairs.  A while later, he came down with another person (later ascertained to be one Lim Beng Wah) and they walked towards the multi-storey carpark.  At a staircase of the multi-storey carpark, the CNB officers arrested the accused and Lim.
5          The accused was searched and the CNB officers recovered, inter alia, the following items:
(a)        Cash of $2,115
(b)        One red packet containing cash of $12
(c)        One “Nokia” 8250 handphone
(d)        One “Nokia” 8850 handphone
(e)        One bunch of six keys with a “Secura” type key
(f)         One “Louis Vuitton” wallet containing, inter alia, cash of $152
(g)        One plastic bag containing jeans and cargo pants
(h)        One car key with remote control
(i)         A “Marlboro” cigarette box which contained:
(i) a sachet of heroin
(ii) a straw of heroin
(iii) a rolled-up piece of paper, and
(iv) a piece of tin foil
(see Photo P31).
6          Station Inspector (“SI”) Ang Oon Tho, also known as Jimmy Ang, then questioned the accused in Hokkien as to whether he had any drugs in SBR 4X.  The accused admitted he had drugs which were at the driver’s door.  The accused was then brought to SBR 4X and ten sachets of heroin wrapped in paper were recovered from the side pocket of the driver’s door.  An “Elsema” remote control was also recovered from the car.  The accused said this was for opening the main gate to Fragrance Court.
7          The CNB officers then escorted the accused to Fragrance Court.  They arrived there at about 7.30 pm.  The accused led the CNB officers to the unit at #04-01. On entering the unit, SI Ang asked the accused whether there was any drug inside his bedroom and he replied “No”.  The accused led the CNB officers to his bedroom which was on the second level of #04-01. I will refer to his bedroom as ""the Bedroom"". The door to the Bedroom was not locked.
8          SI Ang then conducted a search of the Bedroom and found the following:
Inside, but at the top, of the wardrobe (see the location marked B in Photo 7)
(a)            A white plastic bag containing some empty sachets
(b)        A red plastic bag containing some rubber gloves
(c)        an empty sealer box
Inside a drawer beneath the platform bed
(d)        a plastic container and spoon believed to be stained with heroin
On the floor
(e)        A “Ghostbusters” magazine with several pages missing.
9            Thereafter SI Ang climbed out of the Bedroom through a window which had no lock and which led to the rooftop of Fragrance Court.  He searched the rooftop and found a knotted black plastic bag (which is sometimes referred to as  a trash bag). This plastic bag was found almost at one end of the rooftop behind a pillar.  It was below the eves of a tiled roof.  It was found at a location marked ‘A’ (see Photo P3 and P4 and the sketch plan, P33, drawn by Staff Sergeant Chua Yue Meng).
10        Inside the plastic bag was a black Oakley sports bag (see Photo P14 and P15).  The zip of the Oakley bag was secured with a padlock.
11        SI Ang then brought the plastic bag with the Oakley bag into the Bedroom and showed these items to the accused.  When questioned, the accused admitted that the Oakley bag belonged to him. 
12        SI Ang's conditioned statement (paragraph 15) stated that he had asked the accused for the key to the padlock securing the zip of the Oakley bag and the accused informed him that the key was among the bunch of six keys recovered from him earlier. SI Ang then recollected and brought out the bunch of six keys seized from the accused earlier and he then tried the keys in turn until one of them opened the padlock. 
13        After the padlock was opened, the contents of the Oakley bag were checked in the presence of the accused.  They were:
Main compartment
(a)        A bundle of substance wrapped in paper. The substance was believed to be heroin.
(b)        A “Soda” brand plastic bag containing two bundles of substance wrapped in paper. The substance was believed to contain heroin.
(c)        An “M1” brand paper bag containing:
(i) Eight packets, each containing ten sachets of substance wrapped in paper. The substance was believed to be heroin.
(ii) One packet containing nine sachets of substance wrapped in paper. The substance was believed to be heroin.
(d)        A white plastic bag containing:
(i) A brown envelope containing a weighing scale
(ii) A black plastic bag containing a second weighing scale
(iii) A blue-colour bag containing a third weighing scale
(e)        A sealer
Side pocket
(f)         A metal spoon
(g)        A pincer
(h)        A cutter
(i)         Some empty sachets
(j)         Some empty plastic bags
(k)        A roll of scotch tape
(l)         A plastic container
(m)       A pair of pliers
(n)        A blade
(o)        A white envelope containing three yellow-colour and one blue-colour tablet believed to be “Ecstasy”.
14        SI Ang said he questioned the accused about the ownership of the drugs and items found in the Oakley bag. The accused admitted that the drugs and items all belonged to him. 
15        Then, at about 8 pm, SI Ang asked the accused a few questions. At this time, Mandarin was used. The questions and answers were recorded in SI Ang’s pocket book in Chinese with an English translation.  The English translation read:
Q1: All the “Peh Hoon” found in your body belong to whom
A1: Mine

A2: Mine
Q3: The 10 sachets of “Peh Hoon” is for what purpose

A5: About 4 bundle
Q6: All the “Peh Hoon” is for what purpose

A11: Yesterday
Q12: How many sachets
A12: Twenty
Q13: How much
A13: Five hundred per sachet
16        The accused denied that his answers to Questions 4 and 6 were made voluntarily and so a voir dire or trial within a trial was conducted to determine the admissibility of these answers.
The Voir Dire (Trial within a trial)
17        The accused claimed that his answers to Questions 4 and 6 were the result of a threat or inducement.
18        Prior to the recording of the accused’s statement, he was brought to the door of the Bedroom and asked to identify a person who had been arrested.  This was his friend Lee Siong Lim, also known as Ah Siong. From the accused's long statements, which I will come to subsequently, Ah Siong is also known as Roger. I will refer to this person as ""Ah Siong"" or ""Roger"". Ah Siong was at the first floor of the unit in the living room and he was handcuffed, as was the accused.
19        Also, prior to the recording of the accused’s statement, SI Ang had asked one of the officers, Sgt Jack Foo, to leave the Bedroom leaving only S/Sgt Tony Ng, SI Ang and the accused in the Bedroom.
20        When SI Ang was giving evidence for the voir dire, the accused’s position was as follows. When Question 4 was asked, the accused had hesitated and looked at SI Ang because Question 4 was “All the “Peh Hoon” found inside the bedroom belong to whom” whereas in fact no drugs were found inside the Bedroom.  Then, SI Ang said to the accused “All the ""Peh Hoon” in the bedroom is yours right?” in a threatening manner.  The accused again looked at SI Ang and had a confused expression.  SI Ang then told him that he had already admitted to the drugs in the first three questions and if he did not admit to those in the Bedroom, SI Ang would also charge everybody who had been to the Bedroom.  SI Ang also told the accused that the accused had earlier seen Ah Siong handcuffed and threatened to charge Ah Siong, Ah Siong’s wife, the accused’s girlfriend and the accused’s entire family if the accused did not admit that the heroin in the Oakley bag belonged to him.  The accused then responded, “OK, it’s mine” (NE 261 to 264).
21        SI Ang denied:
(a)        that the accused had hesitated or showed any confused expression,
(b)        that he (SI Ang) had said that all the “Peh Hoon” in the Bedroom was the accused’s,
(c)        that he had told the accused that he had already admitted to the drugs in the first three questions and if the accused did not admit to the drugs in the Bedroom, he would charge everyone who had been to the Bedroom,
(d)        he had told the accused he had earlier seen Ah Siong handcuffed and threatened to charge Ah Siong, Ah Siong’s wife, the accused’s girlfriend and the accused’s entire family if the accused did not admit that the heroin in the Oakley bag belonged to him, and
(e)        that, in response to SI Ang’s threat, the accused said, “OK, it’s mine”
(NE 261 to 264).
22            However, SI Ang accepted that in fact no drugs were found in the Bedroom.  He explained that he meant to refer to the drugs found on the rooftop which had since been brought into the Bedroom and he had pointed to the Oakley bag when he asked Question 4 (NE 264 to 265). Accordingly, the accused knew that SI Ang was referring to the drugs in the Oakley bag.
23        As for the answer to Question 6, the accused’s position was that when the question was posed to him, he again hesitated.  SI Ang then said, “So much of ‘Peh Hoon’, must be for selling.  Don’t tell me it is not for selling”.  The accused then replied, “OK, for selling”.
24        Again, SI Ang denied:
(a)        that the accused had hesitated before answering Question 6,
(b)        that he (SI Ang) had suggested that the ‘Peh Hoon’ must be for selling, and
(c)        that the accused had responded “OK, for selling”
(NE 275).
25        SI Ang had also said that it was his superior ASP Xavier Lek who had called him to instruct him to see if the accused could identify Ah Siong and this instruction was received before he recorded the statement of the accused.  Accordingly, he did as he was instructed (NE 256 and 257).  On this point, ASP Xavier Lek gave evidence which corroborated SI Ang’s evidence that it was ASP Xavier Lek who had instructed SI Ang to see if the accused could identify Ah Siong and it was he who instructed SI Ang to record a statement from the accused after Ah Siong had been identified (NE 307 to 308, 315 to 316).
26        In addition, SI Ang said he did not know whether the accused’s parents were still living or whether the accused had siblings or a girlfriend although he knew that Ah Siong had a wife (NE 279 to 280). 
27        Staff Sergeant Tony Ng Tze Chiang also gave evidence.  He was in the Bedroom guarding the accused when the accused’s statement was recorded by SI Ang.  S/Sgt Tony Ng confirmed that the questions and answers were in Mandarin which he (S/Sgt Tony Ng) understood.  He could not recall the exact questions and answers nor each and every detail of the recording session but the accused was acting normally and SI Ang’s tone of voice was normal as well (NE 291 to 292, 298 and 302).  He said that SI Ang did not threaten the accused during the session nor tell the accused that his girlfriend, Ah Siong's wife and the accused’s entire family would be charged if he did not admit to a particular question (NE 291 to 292).  He accepted that he was not observing the accused throughout the recording (NE 303).
28        The accused was the only witness for the defence in respect of the voir dire.  He left school when he was ten years old and had fended for himself since (NE 350).   He referred to Ah Siong as a friend (NE 323) and then a good friend, (NE 324) and also, a close friend (NE 372).  They had known each other for a couple of years (NE 324).  He confirmed that when he was brought to the Bedroom, a search was conducted of the Bedroom.  Thereafter, SI Ang climbed out of the window of the Bedroom and subsequently returned with the Oakley bag inside the plastic bag.  SI Ang asked him some questions and he had said that the Oakley bag was his. He denied that he had told SI Ang that the key to the padlock was among the six keys seized. SI Ang then opened the Oakley bag and took out its contents and showed them to the accused, as wrapped (NE 327 to 329).  Then SI Ang brought him to the entrance of  the Bedroom to identify Ah Siong who was downstairs in the living room and was handcuffed.  He said he did not know why Ah Siong was shown to him for identification (NE 346, 347 and 363).  The accused was then brought back into the Bedroom.  Previously there were two other officers in the Bedroom, besides SI Ang and S/Sgt Tony Ng.  One had left the Bedroom earlier and the other, Sgt Jack Foo, was asked by SI Ang to leave before the recording of the accused’s statement.  SI Ang then began recording the accused’s statement and the remaining officer S/Sgt Tony Ng took no part in this exercise (NE 333).
29        The accused said that when Question 4 was posed to him, he stared at SI Ang blankly because no drugs were found in his Bedroom (NE 335).  He did not initially realise that SI Ang was asking about the drugs in the Oakley bag (NE 365).  SI Ang then told him that since he had already admitted to the first three questions, it was better for him to admit to Question 4 as well.  SI Ang added that if the accused did not admit to Question 4, he would charge Ah Siong, Ah Siong's wife, the accused’s girlfriend, his family as well as those who had come to the unit at Fragrance Court (NE 337).  The accused then replied, “All right, OK, it’s mine”.
30        The accused claimed that when SI Ang posed Question 4 to him and told him he might as well admit to it and threatened him about charging others, he (the accused) was very confused and afraid because he did not know what SI Ang was referring to as no drugs were found in his Bedroom.  SI Ang was fierce and he was very frightened (NE 337).  However, he also said that when he gave his response, he knew that SI Ang was referring to the drugs in the Oakley bag (NE 375, 383 and 385).  He also said that when he gave his response, he did so as he was the one who consumes drugs and he did not want the drugs to implicate his family and friends.  He said he believed SI Ang would charge others as SI Ang was a policeman (NE 337 to 338).
31        As for Question 6, the accused said that when this question was asked, he just stared blankly and SI Ang then told him that as so much heroin was found, it must definitely be for sale.  SI Ang told him not to tell SI Ang otherwise and the accused replied by saying that they were for sale.  He said he was still very confused and frightened that his family would be implicated.  SI Ang was still very fierce (NE 343). After the statement was recorded, the accused was lying on the bed but was not asleep as he was craving for drugs (NE  379, see also 704).
32        In submission, the defence sought to make much out of the fact that the accused was shown Ah Siong before his statement was recorded.  The suggestion was that this was done so that the sight of Ah Siong being handcuffed would remain in the accused’s mind to intimidate him into giving such answers as SI Ang wanted from him. Accordingly, the accused did feel threatened when SI Ang subsequently uttered the threat to charge everyone and in particular Ah Siong, Ah Siong’s wife, the accused’s girlfriend and his entire family and all else who had been to #04-01 at Fragrance Court.
33        I was mindful that certain aspects of SI Ang's evidence were not satisfactory. He had said he could remember every question and answer for the arrests he was involved in between January 2003 to July 2003. He could also remember the questions he had posed for the last 23 years he had been with CNB (NE  224). It seemed to me that that was a gross exaggeration. However, the accuracy of his notes was not in question and also I considered his evidence in totality. I also considered the evidence of ASP Xavier Lek, S/Sgt Tony Ng and the accused, as well as the background circumstances leading to the accused's responses to Questions 4 and 6.
34        It was clear to me that when SI Ang posed Question 4, the accused knew that SI Ang was referring to the drugs in the Oakley bag which had since been brought into the Bedroom from the rooftop outside.  I did not believe that the accused did not know what SI Ang was referring to initially or that the accused stared blankly at SI Ang when Question 4 was posed to him. It was clear to me that the accused was seeking to take undue advantage of the manner in which Question 4 was framed.
35        I also did not accept that SI Ang even uttered the threat suggested or that the accused had been frightened by it. There was no reason for SI Ang to utter the threat because the accused had not yet denied that the drugs in the Oakley bag belonged to him.  Up to the time just before Question 4 was asked, the accused had been co-operative, a point which the defence itself had stressed.  He had already admitted readily that the drugs found in one of his trouser pockets and in SBR 4X  were his.
36            Secondly, SI Ang did not even know that the accused had a girlfriend or whether the accused’s family was still alive and who comprised the family.  How then could he have mentioned the accused’s girlfriend and family in the threat? 
37            Besides, unlike the case of 
Poh Kay Keong v PP
   
[1996] 1 SLR 209
, the drugs in the Oakley bag were not found in premises occupied by any member of the accused’s family, or occupied by Ah Siong for that matter.  Indeed, no drugs were found at the accused's mother’s residence at West Coast Road and to the best of the accused’s knowledge, no one else in his family consumed drugs (NE 368).  So he would not have expected drugs to be found in any of the homes of his siblings. Taking this into account, and the accused's demeanour in court, I was of the view that the accused would not have been intimidated even if the threat had been made.
38        As for the accused’s identification of Ah Siong, it was clear to me that the defence had been trying to make too much out of it.  In the first place, SI Ang undertook the identification exercise on the instructions of ASP Xavier Lek.  Unless the defence was suggesting that ASP Xavier Lek had planned or conspired with SI Ang to put pressure on the accused, the exercise of identifying Ah Siong before the accused’s statement was taken was quite innocent.  On this point, I noted that while Mr S S Dhillon, Counsel for the defence, sought to question ASP Lek as to why he had given such an instruction, Mr Dhillon stopped short of making the suggestion I have mentioned.  Besides, even the accused said he did not know why he was asked to identify Ah Siong (NE 346, 347 and 363). The accused did not suggest that Ah Siong was shown to him in order to intimidate him. There was also no suggestion by Mr Dhillon to SI Ang or S/Sgt Tony Ng that the accused had become intimidated after he was shown Ah Siong in handcuffs.
39            Although the defence also sought to make something out of the fact that SI Ang asked Sgt Jack Foo to leave the Bedroom before the statement was recorded, the fact of the matter was that there was still one other officer present i.e. S/Sgt Tony Ng who was guarding the accused. Indeed, I was impressed by the honest answers from S/Sgt Tony Ng. Initially, some changes in his evidence made him appear an unreliable witness but it gradually became apparent that he was changing his evidence to be as accurate as he could when he realised his earlier evidence might have given the wrong impression. As I have said, he admitted candidly that he could not remember every question and answer exactly nor was he observing the accused all the time throughout the recording of his responses to SI Ang's questions. However, he maintained that SI Ang did not make the alleged threat to the accused about charging the accused's girlfriend and others. I also accepted his evidence that SI Ang's tone of voice was normal instead of the accused's evidence that SI Ang was fierce.
40        Lastly, although the accused said that he subsequently realised the drugs in the Oakley bag caused him to face a capital charge, he did not complain about the alleged threat to any other police officer. The accused's reason for this omission was that he felt that he would not be believed.  He said he told his cell-mate and his lawyer about it but no evidence was given to establish that he did do so at the earliest opportunity.
41        In all the circumstances, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s answers to Questions 4 and 6 had been given voluntarily and I ruled accordingly.
Other evidence for the Prosecution
42        It was not disputed that the Oakley bag contained, inter alia, the following:
(a)        One plastic wrapper marked A2a containing one big packet (or bundle) of white powdery substance marked A2ad. The white powdery substance did not contain diamorphine, as was initially thought before the results of an analysis was known. It turned out to be caffeine.
(b)        A black or dark grey SODA bag marked A2b which contained 2 big packets (or bundles) of substance believed to be and later ascertained to contain diamorphine.
(c)        An M1 bag marked A2c which contained nine small packets wrapped with magazine paper. Eight of these packets contained 10 sachets, each, of substance and the 9
th
 contained nine sachets. The total number of sachets was 89. The substance was later ascertained to contain diamorphine.
(d)        A white plastic bag marked A2e containing one brown paper bag, one digital weighing scale bag and one plastic bag. Three digital weighing scales were found in these bags.
(e)        A sealer marked A2f.
43        As I have mentioned, an empty sealer box was found at the top of the wardrobe in the Bedroom (see para 8(c) above). The sealer box was of the Impulse brand. It was not disputed that the sealer found in the Oakley bag could fit into this sealer box and was also of the Impulse brand.
44        The prosecution adduced an analyst's evidence of the diamorphine content and weight of the substance found in the 2 big packets and 89 sachets mentioned in paragraphs 42(b) and (c) above. The weight and content were 55.9 grams of diamorphine, which was the subject of the charge. This aspect of the charge was not disputed.
45        I would add that after the voir dire, SI Ang accepted that one part of paragraph 15 of his conditioned statement was not correct. He had not tried the six keys in turn to find out which would open the padlock to the Oakley bag because the accused had told him the three identical small keys would do so (NE 478 to 482). Also, S/Sgt Tony Ng added that while he thought the accused had been sleeping while lying on the bed with his eyes closed, the accused might not have been in fact sleeping (NE  515 to 516).
46        The Investigating Officer (""IO"") was Inspector Abdul Halim Bin Abdul Rahman. His evidence was that at about 1.45 am on 30 January 2003 at CNB's office, he weighed all the drugs seized from the accused's body, from SBR 4X and from the Oakley bag in the presence of the accused. He then did the following together with the help of an interpreter Tan Chee Leong. At about 5.16 am of 30 January 2003, he read and explained a typed-written charge of trafficking in diamorphine to the accused. He then wrote out the charge by hand, read and explained it to the accused. I will refer to each of these charges as ""the s 122(6) charge"". Each time the accused acknowledged that he understood the charge and appended his signature below the charge. The IO then proceeded to read out the Notice of Warning under s 122(6) to the accused and the accused again said he understood the Notice and appended his signature below it. A copy of the Notice of Warning was then served on the accused who acknowledged receipt by signing on the original.
47        The s 122(6) charge read:
               
 
You,
                        TEO YEOW CHUAH, MALE/30 YEARS
                        NRIC NO : S7237580-G
are charged that you, on or about the 29
th
 day of January 2003 at about 7.30 pm, at the rooftop outside unit no : #04-01, No : 12, Fragrance Court, Yew Siang Road, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in 
Class A
 to the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking, a black bag containing 
3 big packets and 89 small packets believed to be diamorphine weighing about 1973.42 grams
, at the aforesaid place, Singapore, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under 
Section 5(1)(a) read with Section 5(2)
 of the said Act and punishable under Section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185.
48        The accused's s 122(6) statement was ""I have nothing to say in relation to the charge.""
49        The IO said he could not remember the accused telling him that he was feeling cold (NE 615). The IO denied that the accused was shocked when the s 122(6) charge was read to him or that he had told the accused he should know what to do before the accused's s 122(6) statement was given (NE 580 and 615).
50        The IO also said that although the s 122(6) charge he had read out did not specifically state that the offence was punishable with or attracted the death penalty he had informed the accused that if, upon analysis, the drugs were found to contain more than 15 grams of diamorphine and if the court found him guilty, he would face the death penalty (NE  581 and 582). The IO could not remember if he had told the accused categorically that he was facing the death penalty but he disagreed that the accused was never informed of the consequence of the charge, namely, the death penalty.
51        I would add that below the typed charge the IO had written the following:
The nature and consequence of the charge was explained to the accused in Hokkien by Mr Bennett Tan. The accused affirmed he understood it.
The accused and the interpreter, who is also known as ""Bennett"", had signed below this hand-written statement.
52        The accused gave three long statements which were recorded in a narrative form. Two were given on 5 February 2003 and a third was given on 8 February 2003. The IO said that the recording sessions were in question and answer form and the narration of the accused was in answer to the IO's questions. The IO also said that while asking questions he might or might not have put forward certain facts to the accused.
53        The IO did not agree that the accused was in a daze when his first long statement was read to him (NE 605).
54        The interpreter Tan Chee Leong, also known as Bennett Tan, gave evidence too.  Although he could not remember specifically what was said by the IO to the accused, given the lapse of some 8 or 9 months between the date of each statement of the accused and the date he (Mr Tan) was giving evidence, he said it was normal or standard practice for an IO to make known the prescribed punishment to an accused person after a capital charge was read out (NE 644 and 645).
55        When the hand-written words, stating that the nature and consequence of the charge was explained to the accused in Hokkien by Mr Tan, were drawn to Mr Tan's attention, Mr Tan said that he told the accused that he was facing a capital charge and would possibly face the death penalty if the purity of the drugs was analysed to be 15 grams or above (NE 667).
56        Mr Tan also said that the long statements of the accused were in a question and answer format before they were recorded down in a narrative form.
57        Mr Tan could not remember the accused telling the IO that he was feeling cold or not well (NE 661). He also said that the accused appeared normal to him and was not feeling any discomfort. If the accused had been unwell, this would definitely have caught his attention (NE 665). He did not agree that the accused was not paying attention when the first long statement was read back to him (NE 666).
58        In the first two long statements, the accused gave details, inter alia, as to:
(a) how he had picked up the drugs which were the subject of the charge before me and transferred the drugs into the Oakley bag which he referred to as his black sports bag;
(b) how he had packed the sachets (which he referred to as ""packets"") with magazine paper.
59        The two long statements confirmed that he was the one who put the drugs inside the Oakley bag and used a small padlock to lock it. He was also the one who placed the Oakley bag at the rooftop after gaining access to the rooftop through the window of the Bedroom. They also elaborated as to how he came to rent the  Bedroom and why i.e. the Bedroom offered him more privacy since he was involved in illegal drug activities.
60        The third long statement said, at paragraph 34, that he seldom stayed at the Bedroom. He only went there to pack or store drugs (heroin) and he never brought any friend there except on one occasion when Roger (i.e. Ah Siong) came to visit him on the eve of his arrest. I would add that heroin is the street name for diamorphine.
61        There was also evidence from the main tenant of the unit at #04-01 Fragrance Court, one Wang Shu Zhen. She had initially rented a room to the accused at the lower level and subsequently the Bedroom. She said she had given him a key to the Bedroom. She was puzzled when cross-examined on this point as in her mind when she rented out a room, a key to the room would be given (NE  80). She said she was sure she had given the accused a key to the Bedroom (NE  81), as well as a key to the iron grille gate of the unit. However, when it was stressed to her during cross-examination that neither a key to the Bedroom nor the key to the iron grille gate was found on the accused, she said she could not recall clearly (NE  88).
62        There was also evidence from one of the occupants of the unit that he had seen Ah Siong and a girl and also the accused and a girl at the unit (NE 39 and 40).
Evidence of the Accused
63        The accused was the only witness for the Defence.
64        He said that he initially rented a room on the first level of #04-01  Fragrance Court and subsequently the one on the second level i.e. the Bedroom. The Bedroom was rented by him when his landlady, who was the main tenant of #04-01, offered it to him at a rent lower than what he had been offered previously as she wanted to rent out the room he had been occupying on the first level to someone else. So, he agreed to rent the Bedroom after discussion with his girlfriend Jessie Lim. He had rented a room at Fragrance Court to spend time alone with his girlfriend who could not get along with his mother with whom he was residing at Block 515 West Coast Road #12-527. They would spend three to four days a week at the Bedroom. However, he claimed that he was not given a key to the Bedroom although he had been given one for the room on the first level, nor a key to the iron grille gate of the unit. However, if he wanted to, he could lock the Bedroom from the inside by pressing a button on the Bedroom door (NE 781).
65        The accused admitted that the drugs found on his body and in SBR 4X were his. He said they were for his own consumption but if his friends required some, he would sell them some (NE 683 and 684).
66        After the accused's arrest at Everton Close, he brought the CNB officers to the unit and  to the Bedroom which was not locked.
67            Thereafter the Bedroom was searched and no drugs were found therein. However SI Ang Oon Tho then went to the rooftop and recovered the black plastic bag which contained the Oakley bag which in turn contained the drugs I have mentioned.
68        As the parties had agreed that the evidence for the voir dire be part of the evidence at the main trial, I need not reiterate the accused's evidence as to what he had told SI Ang about the Oakley bag and the drugs inside, or the reason or reasons for what he had said.
69        It was not disputed that the magazine paper which was used to wrap the 9 packets which contained the 89 sachets came from a ""Ghostbusters"" magazine lying on the floor in the Bedroom. However, the accused said that that magazine was not his and it was already there when he moved up to the Bedroom.
70        The accused also said that he did not use the top cupboards as they were quite high. It will be recalled that the sealer box, some empty sachets and rubber gloves were found in one of the top cupboards.
71        After the search at Fragrance Court, the accused was brought to his residence at West Coast Road and another search was conducted there. However, no drugs or drug paraphernalia were found there.
72        The accused was then brought back to CNB office at Police Cantonment Complex where the drugs were weighed in his presence one packet at a time. He said that the IO did not say the weight of the drugs aloud nor was he told the gross weight of all the drugs (NE 705).
73            However, the accused accepted that when the s 122(6) charge was read to him, he was informed that it referred to 1973.42 grams of diamorphine. Nevertheless, he asserted that neither the IO nor the interpreter had told him he was facing the death penalty then. Neither was he informed of this before, during or after the first long statement was recorded (NE 707, 708 and 728). Likewise in respect of the second and third long statements (NE 744).
74        The accused explained that when he said he had nothing to say to the charge, this was because he was shocked by the weight of the drugs as stated in the charge. He did not admit to the charge (NE 708). The accused also said he had been suffering from withdrawal symptoms (NE  824) and he did tell this to the doctor who had examined him for the purpose of his s 122 (6) statement  (NE 825  and 868).
75        The accused said that before the first of his long statements was recorded, he was wondering how the drugs came to be inside the Oakley bag and why he had been asked to admit to them at Fragrance Court (NE  710). The accused also said that he had still not fully recovered from withdrawal symptoms and the CNB office was extremely cold. He asked for and was given another T-shirt to wear. When he told the IO that the office was very cold, the IO said he could not control the temperature and told him to give him a good statement quickly and then the IO would send him to Queenstown Remand Prison which was not so cold (NE 712).
76        The accused then went on to say that most of the first and second long statements and part of the third long statement were untrue. I should therefore set out each of these statements and his evidence thereon.
77        The first long statement, recorded from 10.05 am to 1.20 pm of 5 February 2003, states:
I am also known as Ah Tee to my family members and as Ricky among my friends.
            2            I would like to give an account of my drug activities.
            3 About one week before I was arrested on 29 Jan 2003, I made an order for 5 ""liap"" of heroin from a Malaysian supplier known as ""Moh Eh"". One ""liap"" refers to one pound of heroin. The price for one ""liap"" of heroin is S$20,000. Therefore, the total price for 5 ""liap"" of heroin will be S$100,000. I made the order when the Malaysian supplier called me on my handphone number 98129928. During the conversation, no date for delivery was fixed but he told me that one of the ""liaps"" was of inferior quality. He added that the one that was of inferior quality was in powdery form while the rest were in granular forms. ""Moh Eh"" then suggested that I mixed the inferior type of heroin with the good ones when I do the repacking. Before hanging up the phone, ""Moh Eh"" told me that he would contact me again on my handphone when he arrived in Singapore.
4 On 24 Jan 2003 at about 12 plus in the afternoon, the Malaysian supplier called me on my handphone and told me that he had arrived in Singapore. He told me to pick up the heroin at a Shell Petrol kiosk in Mandai Road. He asked me how long I took to arrive at the petrol kiosk. I told him I could be there in half an hour's time and he told me to wait for another call from him when I arrived at the petrol kiosk. After I hanged up the call, I immediately took a taxi and proceeded to the arranged place. On that day, I brought along a black sport bag with me. The black bag was meant to be used for keeping the heroin. This was the same black bag that was recovered by CNB officer at Fragrance Court.
5 When I arrived at the Shell Petrol kiosk in Mandai Road, ""Moh Eh"" was no where to be sighted. I waited and took a puff of cigarette. About ten minutes later, at about one plus in the afternoon, ""Moh Eh"" called me again on my same handphone and told me that he had placed the 5 ""liap"" of heroin in a small brown carton box. He told me that the carton box was placed outside a toilet at the petrol kiosk and asked me to pick it up from there.
6 I was still on the phone with ""Moh Eh"" when I went to search for the said brown carton box. When I eventually found the brown carton box outside the toilet, I opened up to inspect. I confirmed that the quantity was correct with ""Moh Eh"" before terminating my phone conversation with him. I took out a grey plastic bag containing the 5 ""liap"" of heroin from the brown carton box and transferred them into my black sport bag. I then left the brown carton box outside the toilet at the petrol kiosk. There was no one around near the toilet when I took out the heroin from the brown carton box and transferred them into my black sport bag.
7 After collecting the 5 ""liap"" of heroin, I took a cab to Fragrance Court and stored it in a rented room at the said place. I had rented a room in Apartment unit #04-01, Fragrance Court.
8 In total, I had obtained heroin from ""Moh Eh"" on 3 occasions. On the first and second occasions, the order was only for one ""liap"" of heroin. It was only on the last occasion that I ordered 5 ""liap"" of heroin. There was no specific reason for the increase in the order of quantity. ""Moh Eh"" simply told me he had more stock in hand and asked me if I was interested in buying more from him. I acceded to his request. There was an undertaking between ""Moh Eh"" and I that payment will only be made after I had sold the drugs to my customers. My drug dealings with ""Moh Eh"" was absolutely based on trust. ""Moh Eh"" would call me on every 2 to 3 days to check if I had money for payment. If I had the money, he would send someone to Singapore to collect the payment from me.
9 I got to know ""Moh Eh"" through a Malaysian friend of mine known as ""Ah Loh"" who worked in Singapore previously. I have never met ""Moh Eh"" before. We only corresponded with each other with phone calls. He was the one who usually called me on my handphone as I do not have his contact number.
10 On the same day, 24 Jan 2003, I immediately opened up two ""liap"" of heroin for repacking after returning to my rented room in Fragrance Court. The drug paraphernalia such as weighing scales and sealer were supplied to me by ""Moh Eh"" on my first transaction with him. As for the rest of the items, I bought it myself.
11 On 24 Jan 2003, I cut the big packets containing the ""liap"" of heroin, one at each time, and poured them into a small plastic container with a snoopy label printed on it. I then used a small plastic spoon to scoop the heroin and poured them into small plastic packets. After that, I used a sealer to seal the opening of the small packets of heroin. I repacked about 120 small packets from the two ""liap"" of heroin. The small packets were in different quantities weighing from between 3 to 8 grams. Those weighing between 3 to 5 grams were considered as half a packet, while a full packet would weigh around 8 grams.
12 After I repacked about 120 small packets, I wrapped them with magazine papers. Each of the wrappings contained 10 small packets of heroin but there was one which contained only 9 small packets of heroin. I could not recall how many wrappings I had done altogether. After I had finished the wrappings, I put aside 3 of them and dumped the rest into a ""M1"" paper bag. I then placed this ""M1"" paper bag inside my black coloured sports bag. I put the 3 wrappings of heroin inside a drawer under my bed so that it was easily within reach.
13 On the same day, I also placed the black coloured sports bag on the rooftop outside my bedroom window. I left the black coloured sports bag at the far right end corner of the rooftop to avoid detection. I put the black sports bag standing against the wall so that it could not be seen easily. Besides heroin, in the bag itself were also 3 digital weighing scales, one sealer and a few long empty straws and 4 Ecstasy tablets in an envelope. There were also other paraphernalia like penknives, pincer, a bundle of small empty plastic packets and other items in the side pocket of the black coloured sports bag. I was the one who put all those mentioned items there. After placing all those items in the black coloured sports bag, I used a small padlock to lock it.
14 I also placed a few bundles of empty plastic packets and a plastic bag of gloves on top of a cupboard in my bedroom.
78        The accused said that he did not say what was actually stated in paragraph 2 of the first long statement.
79        As for paragraph 3, he said he had fabricated the contents thereof. He did not know any person by the name of ""Moh Eh"". He had never bought one ""liap"" or one pound of heroin before. He did not have $100,000. ""Moh Eh"" did not suggest to him to mix up the inferior heroin in powdery form with the good ones in granular form. The accused claimed he had said this because the IO had asked him what he was going to do with the powdery heroin (NE  714 and 715).
80        As it turned out, the powdery substance did not contain heroin. As I have mentioned, it was caffeine. The accused said he did not know this at the time the first long statement was recorded.
81        The accused said that the first five sentences of paragraph 4, ending "" After I hanged up the call, I immediately took a taxi and proceeded to the arranged place"", had also been fabricated by him. He had given these explanations in response to the IO's questions. In court, the accused argued that as he had had the use of SBR 4X, there was no reason for him to take a taxi to the alleged Shell petrol kiosk in Mandai Road, the existence of which he did not know (NE  717).
82        As for the last three sentences of paragraph 4 in which the accused had said that he had brought the Oakley bag with him to keep the heroin, the accused denied he had brought the Oakley bag with him. He said the IO had asked him  what he had used to contain the heroin and whether he had used the Oakley bag found at Fragrance Court, and he said ""Yes"" (NE  717 and 718).
83        The accused said paragraph 5 was fabricated by him. In court, he presented his argument that no one would place heroin at a public place (NE  718).
84        As for paragraph 6, the accused said that this too was fabricated by him. As for the grey plastic bag, he had mentioned it only because the IO had asked him about it (NE  718 and 719). Paragraphs 7 and 8 were also fabricated by him.
85        The accused also said that paragraph 9 was a fabrication. He also did not know a person by the name of Ah Loh. Paragraphs 10 to 12 were also fabricated (NE 721 to 724) although in cross-examination he accepted the weight of the small packets mentioned in paragraph 11.
86        As for paragraph 13,  the accused alleged that he was asked whether he had put the Oakley bag at the rooftop and he responded ""Yes"". Also, he alleged that he did not say that he had left the Oakley bag  at  the far right end corner of the rooftop to avoid detection (NE  725).
87        The accused further alleged that he knew nothing about the Oakley bag such as the digital weighing scales, sealer, penknives and empty plastic packets. He presented his argument that even if he did put the items in the Oakley bag, he would not have been able to remember them so as to itemise them for the purpose of his statement (NE  726).
88            Although the accused accepted that the first long statement was read back to him after it was recorded, he said he did not suggest the amendments found thereon. I would add that the amendments were not significant but the Defence's point was that it was not the accused who initiated the amendments.
89        The accused also said that he was not paying attention when the first long statement was read back to him because of three reasons.
90        First, he had not fully recovered from his withdrawal symptoms. Secondly, he was feeling very cold. Thirdly, in his mind, he had already admitted to the drugs when he was at Fragrance Court and he believed he would be expected to admit again.
91        As he thought that this was an ordinary trafficking case only, he was prepared to admit to the drugs found in the Oakley bag. Otherwise he believed his family and girlfriend would be charged (NE 727 and 728).
92        The accused also said that it took more than three hours to record the first long statement because he needed time to fabricate his story (NE 730).
93        The accused accepted that when the recording of the second long statement began at 3 pm of 5 February 2003, his first long statement was again read back to him. The written notes state that the accused was invited to make any correction, deletion or amendment but he declined to do so.
94        The second long statement states:
15 I wore the hand gloves when I was doing the packing of heroin. The reason for wearing the hand gloves was to avoid leaving behind fingerprints marks on the plastic packets. However, I do not always use the hand gloves as I found it troublesome after sometime.
16 After opening up 2 ""liaps"" of heroin for repacking into smaller packets, I have 3 more ""liaps"" of heroin left in the black coloured sports bag. I could identify the ""liap"" of heroin that was of inferior quality by pressing on it. It was much softer than the rest as it was in powdery form. I took this ""liap"" of inferior heroin out from the grey plastic bag and placed it inside the black sports bag as I wanted to separate the inferior heroin from the good ones.
17 Before I was arrested on 29 Jan 2003, I had already sold 20 small plastic packets of heroin to my drug customer named Roger on the eve of my arrest. I sold Roger at $500 for each small packets of heroin on that day when I asked him to come over to my rented room in Fragrance Court. He had earlier told me that he was interested in buying 20 small packets of heroin from me. Roger is also known as Ah Siong. In total, I charged him $10,000 for the 20 small packets of heroin. He paid me $1000 first and told me that he would pay the balance amount after the Chinese New Year. These 20 small packets were from the 2 wrappings of heroin which was kept in a drawer under my bed initially. The other wrapping with ten small packets of heroin was also in the drawer initially. I later transferred them to my car on 28 January 2003. I put the 10 small packets of heroin in the side compartment on the driver's side of the car so that I could retrieve it easily when customers want it. If no one place any order with me, I would use those heroin for my own consumption.
18 When I was arrested on 29 January 03, I was found with a cigarette box containing one small packet and a straw of heroin, one rolled-up paper meant for smoking heroin and one aluminium foil. The heroin were meant for  my consumption. The other items that were also seized from my possession include keys to my rented Apartment at Fragrance Court, to my personal residential home at West Coast, a remote sensor key for accessing a small gate meant for residents of the Apartment and the padlock keys for my black sports bag. There are 3 padlock keys altogether.
19 Besides the above-mentioned, I also had inside my car, a remote control meant for access to the main gate of the Apartment at Fragrance Court. I was issued with the remote control and the remote sensor key to the small gate when I rented a room from the owner of unit #04-01, Fragrance Court. All these items were also seized from me.
20 Slightly more than 2 months before my arrest, I browsed the Classified Ads on the newspaper and contacted the owner of unit number #04-01, Fragrance Court at Yew Siang Road. I roughly know where the location was as I lived nearby in West Coast area. The Ads specified that there was rooms available for renting. I called the telephone number that was stated in the Classified Ads and a China women[sic] picked up the call. She claimed that she was the co-owner of the unit and agreed to sublet one room to me at a rental fee of $550 per month.
21 After making the call, I went down immediately to meet the co-owner of the unit. I could not recall her name now but I used to address her as ""Da Jie"" which means elder sister in English. She is in her mid forties. She told me that there were 2 rooms available in the unit for renting, one on the lower and the other on the upper floor. I inspected both the rooms and decided on renting the 3
rd
 room on the lower floor from her. This room is located next to the common toilet. I paid her 1 month rental fee of $550 and a deposit of another $550 on the spot. The owner raised the option of signing the rental agreement with me but I told her that it was [not] necessary to do so. She has no objection. The co-owner gave me a remote control for access via the main gate, the sensor key for the residence gate and a key for the rented room. I moved into the room 2 to 3 days later. However, I normally do not lock the door of my rented room because I do not think that anyone would go into my room. Furthermore, whatever heroin that I have with me were safely kept inside the black sport bag and padlocked.
22 I did not want to sign a formal rental agreement with the co-owner because I can easily be traced if I run foul of the law. The reason why I wanted to rent a room at Fragrance Court was because the place was at a secluded location. Therefore, it would not be easily discovered by the authorities. My purpose of renting a room at Fragrance Court was to have a place for storage and packing of heroin.
23 A month later, the co-owner asked me if I wished to move to the empty room on the upper floor. She mentioned that someone else was interested in renting the room that I was occupying at that point in time. I agreed to her proposal and moved to the room at the upper floor. She told me that I had to pay a higher rental fee of $680 per month. I did not mind paying a higher rental fee for the upper room as it offered me more privacy since I was involved in illegal drug activities. With other tenants around in 2 other rooms on the lower floor, there was a lack of privacy.
24 Sometimes in mid December 2002, I shifted to the upper room in the Apartment unit. There is only one room on the upper floor. Upon moving over to the room on the upper floor, I paid a rental fee of $680 to the co-owner. I checked the room to ensure that everything was in order. The room was totally empty when I moved in. I checked the drawers, the cupboards, the wardrobe and nothing was in it. The co-owner did not give me the key to the upper room and I did not ask from her as I do not have the habit of locking my room door.
25 After I moved into the room on the upper floor, I discovered a good spot to place my sports bag containing the heroin. This spot was at the far right corner of the rooftop outside the window. The only access to the spot which I placed the sports bag was via the window in my rented room. One cannot get access to the rooftop without climbing out from the window in my rented room. I felt that the spot would be a better place to hid the sports bag with heroin in it as no one would discover them.
26 I believed the co-owner has no knowledge of my drug activities. I hardly speak to the tenants and I believed they also have no knowledge of what I was doing. The other occupants in unit #04-01, Fragrance Court were the co-owner herself, 2 male Chinese Nationals and the co-owner's nephew and son which I used to see them around. I do not know and have never seen the main owner of the unit at all.
27 I sell heroin because I was in need of money to meet daily expenses for food and clothing. Furthermore, during the Chinese New Year festive season, I intended to give some money to my mother. The odd-job which I was doing was not on a regular basis. Normally I worked only 1 to 2 days in a week. Hence, my income was low. My daily wage was about $50 to $60 a day. I did only simple painting work as I was not trained in other forms of odd-jobs.
95        The accused said paragraphs 15 and 16 were fabricated by him. Paragraphs 17 to 21 were true except for the last sentence, ""Furthermore, whatever heroin that I have with me were safely kept inside the black sports bag and padlocked"" (NE  730 to 736).
96        As for paragraph 22, the accused said he did not say that he did not want to sign a formal rental agreement because he could be easily traced if he ran foul of the law. As for the last sentence of paragraph 22, when he said his purpose of using a room at Fragrance Court was to store and pack heroin, he said he had meant putting heroin into a straw for his own consumption (NE  736 and 737).
97        As for paragraph 23, the accused denied saying that he had paid a higher rent for the Bedroom as it offered him more privacy since he was involved in illegal drug activities. What he had said was that he found it more convenient as he consumed drugs as well (NE 738).
98            Paragraph 24 was true but he disputed that paragraph 25 accurately recorded  what he said. As regards the sentence ""The only access to the spot which I placed the sports bag was via the window in my rented room"", the accused said that he was asked whether that was the only access to the rooftop and he nodded his head (NE 738 and 739). As regards the next sentence ""I felt that the spot would be a better place to hide the sports bag with heroin in it as no one would discover them"", the accused alleged that he did not say this. He alleged  that he was asked whether the spot would be a good place to hide the drugs and he had said, ""OK, yes"" (NE 739).
99        As for paragraph 26, he said that part of it did not reflect what he had said accurately. He had not mentioned his drug activities but rather that the owners did not know that he consumed drugs (NE 740).
100      The accused admitted that paragraph 27 was accurate (NE 740).
101      The accused did not dispute that the second long statement was also read back to him after it was recorded and that it was read to him again when the third statement was recorded on 8 February 2003. His third long statement states:
Accused's statement consisting of paragraphs 15 to 27 were read back to him in Hokkien dialect by Mr Bennett Tan. Accused was invited to make any correction, deletion or amendment. He declined the offer.
28 I sell heroin in both packets and in the form of sets. A set consisted of 10 packets each. I sold one packet of heroin to my customers at $500 and one set at the price of $5000. At times, I also sold heroin in half packet form and I charged customers a price of $250. A half packet of heroin weighs slightly over 3 grams.
29 I do not have any fixed customers. As long as there are buyers, I would sell the heroin to them. I do not operate in a fixed place. My customers were from all over the places in Singapore. Usually my customers would come to me to pick up the heroin. Depending where I was, I do not have a fixed place for drug transaction. But they were all carried out in public places. Except for the one occasion which I sold 20 packets of heroin to Roger at my rented room in Fragrance Court on the eve of my arrest, I have never dealt with any other customers at my rented room.
30 I am shown a photograph of a male person. I identified him as Roger or 'Ah Siong'. (Recorder's note : Accused is shown a polaroid photograph of a male Chinese in red tee-shirt).
31 Roger is my main drug customer. He runs a Rojak stall at Aljunied Crescent. I do not have any share in his Rojak business.
32 Roger is not an associate or partner in my drug activities. He is only a customer to me.
33 I am shown a photograph of a male person. (Recorder's note : I showed accused the polaroid photograph of Lim Beng Wah, IC : 1573149-D). I identified this person as 'Ah Wah'.  'Ah Wah' was also arrested on the same day as me when I went to look for him to collect jeans from him. 'Ah Wah' is helping someone else to sell jeans. I bought 4 to 5 pairs of jeans from 'Ah Wah' at $200 over dollars. 'Ah Wah' has no connection with my drug activities.
34 I seldom stay at the rented room at Fragrance Court. I only went there to pack or store drugs (heroin). Most of the times, I stay at my own house at Blk 515, West Coast Road, #12-527. I have never brought any friends to my rented room in Fragrance Court except for that one occasion where Roger came to visit me on the eve of my arrest.
35 The car that was seized during my arrest belonged to my friend named 'Ah Soon'. He is the registered owner of the car. The car is still currently under hire purchase financing. 'Ah Soon' was unable to support the hire purchase car instalments. Hence he allowed me to use the car on condition that I helped him to pay for the car instalment on a monthly basis of $1020. I have been in possession Ah Soon's car for about a month.
36 I only have one main door key to the rented Apartment at Fragrance Court. I have never given the key to anyone else before.
37 I am the second child in a family of 3 siblings. I have an elder brother and a younger sister. They all have their own families and are staying separately. My father has already passed away. I am the only child staying together with my mother at my West Coast home.
38 I am educated up to primary eight level in the Chinese stream at Sian Meng Primary School at Bukit Ho Swee.  The school has since closed down. The school is a Chinese medium one.
39 At the time of my arrest, over $2000 cash money were seized from me. $500 were from friends of mine who had asked me to buy jeans for them. Another $400 were my money from the economic restructuring shares. The rest were proceeds obtained from drug sales.
40 I consumed about 1 small packet of heroin each day. I used the 'chase the dragon' method to consume heroin. Normally I consumed heroin at my own house at West Coast Road. I also consumed heroin at my rented room in Fragrance Court occasionally. The last time I consumed heroin was on the morning prior to my arrest. I also consumed cough mixture on that same day because I was suffering from persistent cough.
102      The accused sought to explain paragraph 34 away. He alleged that although he had stated that he seldom stayed at the Bedroom, he had actually stayed there three to four days a week. Also, when he had mentioned ""packing"" he meant that he had used a straw to pack drugs. Furthermore, he did bring friends to the Bedroom. He asserted that the other tenants had verified this (NE 742). He claimed that he did not want to say that he had brought friends to the Bedroom because SI Ang had threatened to charge his girlfriend, friends and family (NE 742).
103      The accused said that he had implicated himself in the three long statements because at Fragrance Court he had already admitted to the drugs in the Oakley bag and also because SI Ang had threatened to charge his girlfriend, friends and family (NE 744). As I have said, he alleged he was not told that he would be facing the death penalty.
104      As regards  the Oakley bag, the accused said that he had used it to pack his clothing when he moved to Fragrance Court. He last used it when he moved from the room on the first floor to the Bedroom (on the second floor).
105      The accused said that on 27 Jan 2003, a Malaysian friend of his by the name of Eric, also known as Ah Tua, had telephoned him at night. They went out together for a meal and Eric had spent the night with him at the Bedroom. In the morning of 28 Jan 2003 he had told Eric he was going out for a while. This was between 10 am and 11 am. Eric said he wanted to sleep longer. The accused left the Bedroom.
106      At between 4 pm to 5 pm, Eric called the accused who said he was at his mother's flat at Block 515, West Coast Road. Eric then arranged to meet the accused at a coffeeshop at Block 516. At the coffeeshop at past 5 pm, Eric handed the accused three packets and told him that inside were 10 small packets (or sachets). Eric then told the accused that he had left behind three keys at Fragrance Court and asked the accused to keep them for him. The accused then went back to his mother's flat. At about 8 pm or 9 pm, the accused met Roger at Fragrance Court to hand him two of the packets he had received from Eric. The remaining packets were found in SBR 4X.
107      The three keys left in the Bedroom were the keys to the padlock of the Oakley bag. Eric did not tell the accused what the three keys were for (NE 758). The accused attached the three keys to his key chain when he returned to Fragrance Court. He did not notice the Oakley bag was missing from the wardrobe. The accused argued that if the three keys were his, there was no need for him to carry all three with him (NE  767). He believed that Eric had schemed and used the Bedroom  and the Oakley bag to pack his drugs and asked the accused to keep the three keys for him (NE  767 to 771). Eric must have brought and left the drugs in his car initially when Eric drove to Fragrance Court on 27 January 2003 and spent the night there (NE  747 and 795). Eric had also used the magazine in the Bedroom to wrap the drugs (NE  773 and 777).
108      The accused said that after his arrest, he did ask his elder brother to telephone Eric but the elder brother was not able to contact Eric. The accused did not know Eric's address in Malaysia although the accused had known Eric for some years. He had known Eric as they were in the same industry. The accused was a painter and Eric was a mosaic layer (NE 776, 755 and 788).
109      The accused accepted that although he was angry with Eric he did not tell the IO about Eric or ask his elder brother to mention Eric to the IO. The accused also alleged that he did not tell his elder brother why he wanted Eric to be contacted (NE  789).
110      The accused said he did not mention Eric's name to the IO because even if Eric was found, Eric would not admit to the drugs in the Oakley bag (NE  776). The accused was also afraid of SI Ang's threat and the accused felt he could not prove that the items in the Oakley bag belonged to Eric (NE  803).
111      As regards why he did not mention his girlfriend in any of his statements to the IO, the accused said that when the IO had asked him whether his girlfriend also smoked heroin, he had said ""No"". When asked, the accused had also said she did not have any previous conviction. The accused alleged that the IO then said that if that was the case, there was no need to mention her (NE  806).
Rebuttal evidence by the prosecution
112      The prosecution called Dr Andrew Y H Tang as a rebuttal witness. He examined the accused on 30 Jan 2003 at 3.42 am, i.e. before the accused's s 122(6) statement was given, and at 6.03 am, i.e. after the accused's s 122(6) statement was given.
113      Dr Tang's evidence was that the police request form had stated that the accused had requested examination as he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms (NE  869, 877 and 878).
114      Dr Tang also said that from his observation of a lot of accused persons, they would initially feel cold because of air-conditioning and being nervous (NE  874).
115      In the context of the accused, Dr Tang did not observe him to be feeling cold (NE  875) nor did the accused show signs of withdrawal symptoms (NE  871). However he accepted that it was possible that the accused might have mild pain and was feeling cold without any symptom (NE  877).
116            Significantly, Dr Tang said that although he did not specifically ask the accused whether he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms, he did ask the accused whether he had any complaint and the accused said he had none (NE  870). Dr Tang explained that he did not specifically ask about withdrawal symptoms as he did not want to put any suggestion in his question (NE  870 also). In addition, the accused did not tell Dr Tang that he was having bodily pains or drug withdrawal symptoms (NE 869 and 879). I would add that the report dated 24 April 2003 PRO 1396/2003 prepared by Dr Tang in respect of the pre-statement examination, said, inter alia, ""The patient denied having any neither[sic] medical or surgical problems"". Also, ""There were no complaints or signs and symptoms of withdrawal noted on examination"".
117      In the next report also dated 24 April 2003 but numbered PRO 1397/2003 in respect of the post-statement examination, Dr Tang said, inter alia, ""He denied having any significant medical problems"".
The submissions, my conclusion and reasons
118      Section 18(1)(b) of the Misuse of Drugs Act states:
18. - (1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control -
…
            (b)   the keys of anything containing a controlled drug;
            …
shall until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.
119      It was not disputed that the accused was in possession of the keys that could open the padlock of the Oakley bag and the drugs were found in the Oakley bag. Accordingly, I was of the view that s 18(1)(b) applied and that unless the accused could rebut that presumption, then the presumption under s 17(c)  would also apply. Section 17(c) states:
17.  Any  person  who is proved to have had in his possession more than -
…
(c)  2 grammes of diamorphine;
…
whether or not contained in any substance, extract, preparation or mixture shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose.
120      Mr Dhillon submitted that the accused's conduct on the day of his arrest demonstrated that he knew nothing about the Oakley bag being on the rooftop of Fragrance Court and its contents. He stressed that the accused had on his own accord informed the CNB officers about the Bedroom and led them to Fragrance Court and then to the Bedroom. The CNB officers had no idea about the Bedroom at the time of the arrest.
121            However, according to ASP Xavier Lek, they had already received information, prior to the arrest, that drugs could be found at Fragrance Court although they did not know who had access to the unit involved (NE  312 to 314), and probably also did not know which unit was involved. Their main targets were the accused and Ah Siong (NE 309). Furthermore, it was not as though the accused had initiated the disclosure of information about #04-01 Fragrance Court. It was upon questioning that the accused disclosed that the Elsema remote control found in SBR 4X and one of the keys, out of the six keys recovered, were for access to Fragrance Court and #04-01 Fragrance Court (see paragraph 10 of SI Ang's conditioned statement and NE 215). In any event, the fact that the accused did not lie about the Elsema remote control or one of the keys being for access to #04-01 was only one of the factors to be considered.
122      Mr Dhillon submitted that the accused did not show any reaction when SI Ang had climbed out of the window to search the rooftop. This demonstrated that the accused knew nothing about the Oakley bag. I was of the view that the absence of anxiety on the accused's part was equivocal. It could equally mean that he was hoping that SI Ang would not find the Oakley bag which was tucked away at almost one end of the rooftop behind a pillar. Also, it was out of sight if one only stands outside the window of the Bedroom, without turning round a bend and  looking further. The absence of anxiety could also equally mean that the accused knew that any sign of anxiety would give him away or he was prepared to face the consequence even if the Oakley bag was found.
123      What was significant was the absence of any surprise by the accused when SI Ang returned from the rooftop with the plastic bag and opened it to reveal the Oakley bag. In my view, the accused did not express any surprise in seeing his Oakley bag because he knew all along that the Oakley bag was in the plastic bag. Furthermore, even if the accused did not tell SI Ang that the three small keys  could open the padlock to the Oakley bag, it was surprising that he did not mention that the keys belonged to Eric immediately after one of the three keys was used to open the padlock and the contents in the Oakley bag were taken out and shown to him. At that time, the accused had not yet been asked to identify Ah Siong and the alleged threat by SI Ang had not yet been made.
124      If the accused's evidence about Eric was true, it must have immediately dawned on him that Eric had used his Oakley bag to keep the drugs and that he was going to take the blame for Eric as the three keys were found on him, unless he quickly disclosed that the keys were not his.  There was no reason for the accused to remain silent about Eric then unless Eric was a fabrication or he was in cahoots with Eric.
125      Mr Dhillon submitted that the accused had been forthright in his evidence. The accused had admitted that he had sold drugs and had admitted that the Oakley bag was his. In my view, the accused admitted that he had sold drugs because there were ten sachets found in SBR 4X. He admitted the Oakley bag was his only in response to a question by SI Ang and because he knew the three keys found on him could open the padlock. Besides, the accused did not have time to come up with a fabrication at the time of his arrest.
126      Mr Dhillon also submitted that the accused also gave a consistent, believable and reasonable explanation as to how the Oakley bag came to be placed at the rooftop of Fragrance Court. He added that the accused had said that if he wanted to hide the drugs, he could have easily hidden the drugs in the Bedroom. Also the rooftop was not the safest place to hide the drugs as other persons in neighbouring high-rise flats could see the accused and there was always the possibility that someone else might come onto the rooftop. Also, if the three keys had belonged to the accused, the accused had said he would not need to carry all three identical keys with him.
127            However, the accused's evidence at trial about Eric and why he rented the Bedroom and the use thereof were all contradicted by his long statements and his statement to SI Ang. In addition, he did not mention such points when he gave his s 122(6) statement, when he should have done so.
128      From the evidence about the accused lying on the bed in the Bedroom after he had given a statement to SI Ang and the information in the police request form to Dr Tang, I was prepared to accept that the accused was suffering from withdrawal symptoms at the time his s 122(6) statement was given. However, they must have been mild as Dr Tang did not notice any such symptoms, nor, as I found, did the accused tell Dr Tang about them. In the circumstances, the withdrawal symptoms were not such as to interfere with the accused's understanding of the s 122(6) charge and its consequences. Indeed, the accused did not specifically assert that he could not understand the same or his long statements because of his condition.
129      As regards the question as to whether the accused was told that he was facing a capital charge at the time the s 122(6) charge was read to him, I preferred the evidence of the IO and the interpreter to that of the accused. The IO maintained steadfastly at trial that he had told the accused that if the heroin was more than 15 grams, and if the court was to find him guilty, he would face the death penalty. The interpreter said that while he could not remember exactly what the IO said, it was standard practice for investigation officers to inform accused persons that they were facing the death penalty, when this was the case. The interpreter did not suggest that anything extraordinary had happened in respect of the present accused person. Furthermore, the IO had specifically written down that the nature and consequence of the charge had been  explained to the accused by the interpreter, although there was no specific mention of words like ""death penalty"".
130      As for Mr Dhillon's closing submission that the omission by the IO  to specifically state the capital punishment in the s 122(6) charge was contrary to practice (see paragraph 72 of that submission), I would say that there was no evidence of this. The evidence from the IO was only that for lesser charges, the minimum and maximum sentences were  stipulated in the charge. Indeed his evidence was that it was not his practice to specifically state the capital punishment in the charge. He also added that he was not informed that he should do so for capital cases (NE 583 to 587). The interpreter corroborated the IO's evidence that it was not the practice to specifically state the death penalty in the charge (NE 645). I would add that whether the practice should be changed is another matter.
131      The accused himself admitted at trial that he knew that trafficking above a certain weight of diamorphine would carry the death penalty, although he said he did not know what the threshold was (NE  827). He said he was aware that the s 122(6) charge pertained to 1973.42 grams of diamorphine and he was shocked. Yet he thought it was an ordinary trafficking case (NE  707, 708 and 728). Although he wondered what the penalty was, he did not ask how long a jail sentence he would serve as he was not feeling well (NE  829). It seemed to me that if the accused did not know what the threshold was, he had no basis for thinking that this was an ordinary trafficking case especially given that he had repeatedly asserted he had been shocked at the heavy weight of 1973.42 grams. I did not accept that the accused was the simpleton that he had portrayed himself to be. True, he did not have a high formal education but he was street-smart, having had to fend for himself from a young age. As I have elaborated, he was even able to present arguments for himself while he was on the witness stand. Accordingly, I found that the accused knew that he was facing a capital charge at the time when his s 122(6) statement was given, and also when his long statements were given.
132      As for the long statements, the accused's position at trial was that most of his long statements were untrue. I have set out at length his position, but, in summary, they were untrue in the following respects:
 (a)            He had fabricated some parts.
(b) As regards other parts, they did not represent accurately what he had said.
(c) Thirdly, he  denied outright what was attributed to him.
As the accused did not deny that the statements had accurately recorded what he had said in respect of category (a), I will deal with categories (b) and (c).
133      As regards category (b), the accused's position was that he did not use the words attributed to him but that he merely agreed with what the IO had suggested to him. In my view, even if he had merely agreed with what the IO had suggested to him, the substance of what had been recorded would still be correct. It was not as though he was tricked into agreeing. The long statements did not pretend to be a verbatim record of what the accused had said. It seemed to me that the Defence had sought to take undue advantage of the fact that the statements were not a verbatim record. Thus, for example, Mr Dhillon sought to make much out of the fact that paragraph 2 of the long statement was not a verbatim record because no witness would give a sentence like that. Paragraph 2 states, and I reiterate: ""I would like to give an account of my drug activities"". I was of the view that what probably happened was that the accused was told that the IO wanted him to give an account of his drug activities and he agreed. However, this was set out in paragraph 2 in the terms I have stated. The substance of the accused's response remained the same, although one could argue that the flavour was slightly different.
134      More importantly, I noted that paragraph 2 was the only paragraph which Mr Dhillon questioned the IO and the interpreter specifically on. Mr Dhillon carefully steered away from the important paragraphs of the long statements. He left it to the accused to state which of the important paragraphs fell into categories (a), (b) or (c).  Accordingly, as regards both categories (b) and (c), Mr Dhillon did not challenge the IO or the interpreter on specific and important parts of the statements. He only put or suggested the accused's case generally.
135            Furthermore, I did not accept that the accused could remember after so many months exactly which parts of his statements were merely his responses to the IO's questions and which were those which he did not even say or respond to. I also reiterate that the long statements had been read back to the accused after each had been recorded and he did not object to the same.
136            Accordingly, I was of the view that the long statements did accurately record what the accused had said to the IO and the interpreter. It bears repeating that on the accused's own evidence, he took some time to give his long statements not because of withdrawal symptoms or cold or because the IO was trying to wear him down (as belatedly suggested in paragraph 248 of Mr Dhillon's closing submission) but because the accused was trying to fabricate his statements (NE  730). Paragraph 247 of Mr Dhillon's closing submission also submitted that the accused was denied extra clothing but I did not accept that he had told the IO or interpreter that he was cold. If the accused had fabricated the statements, it was for him to demonstrate that they were fabrications and why he had come up with such fabrications.
137      For example, the accused said that as he had had the use of SBR 4X, it was unnecessary for him to have taken a taxi to collect the drugs. That may be so, but that did not necessarily make this part of his statement untrue. It is not so illogical for a person to take a taxi even though he owns a car. As another example, Mr Dhillon submitted that it was shocking for the IO to record statements to the effect that the accused had opened up drugs when they were recovered unopened (see paragraph 246 of his closing submissions). In my view, this depended on one's interpretation of the facts. It was undisputed that some of the drugs in the Oakley bag were found in the 89 sachets. Someone must have opened up the drugs before packing the drugs into these sachets. Besides, the IO had said he was simply recording the accused's statements and not challenging them.
138            Furthermore, even if some of the details as to how the accused had come into possession of the drugs found in the Oakley bag had been fabricated, the fact of the matter was that the accused had admitted to being in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.
139      As the accused had believed that Eric was responsible for the predicament he was facing, it would only be natural for the accused to mention to the IO Eric's role as soon as possible. Yet the accused took responsibility for the drugs in his long statements and mentioned Eric for the very first time only when he was giving evidence at trial.
140      I also noted the following points against the accused. First, he did not call Ah Siong or Roger to corroborate the existence of Eric or to corroborate his evidence as to how Eric came to supply him with drugs one or two days before the arrest and for which Roger came to owe Eric, not the accused, $9,000 for the drugs Roger received.
141            Secondly, the accused did not mention his girlfriend in his long statements. I did not accept his evidence that the omission was because the IO had said that there was no need to mention her. This point was not suggested or put to the IO or the interpreter. Furthermore, the accused did not call his girlfriend to corroborate his evidence as to why he had rented the Bedroom. I would add that the photograph of the Bedroom did not reveal any female clothing or toiletries for females only. Two bottles in the bathroom, seen in photo P12, could have been used by the accused himself or the previous occupant. The accused's assertion of the existence of a toothbrush and toothpaste which could not be seen in P12 did not advance his allegation regarding his girlfriend any further.
142      Thirdly, the accused did not call his elder brother to corroborate his evidence that he had asked the brother to contact Eric. Neither did he provide the court with the telephone number of Eric. I also found the accused's evidence contradictory when he said he had asked his elder brother to contact Eric but yet he did not believe Eric would own up.
143      I would add that the line of questions posed by Mr Dhillon to prosecution witnesses as to how the rooftop was accessible from other units at the top floor of Fragrance Court and whether the rooftop was accessible from either of two ladders at the top floor leading to openings at the rooftop was irrelevant given the accused's implied position that it was Eric who must have gone to the rooftop through the window of the Bedroom.
144      In the circumstances, I was also of the view that the accused knew the consequences of his long statements and had fabricated his evidence at  trial about Eric. As I was of the view that the alleged threat by SI Ang did not exist, it could not continue to operate on the mind of the accused when he was giving his long statements.
145      As an aside, I would add that Mr Dhillon should have challenged the admissibility of the long statements if he was going to take the position that the alleged threat continued to operate on the mind of the accused then.
146      In the circumstances, the accused's assertions that he could have hidden the drugs elsewhere in the Bedroom and need not have carried all three keys to the padlock with him, if the drugs really belonged to him, were neither here nor there.
147      As for the suggestion by Mr Dhillon that the rooftop was not the safest place to hide the drugs as persons in neighbouring high-rise buildings could have seen the accused if he had been on the rooftop and someone else might have come onto the rooftop, the fact of the matter was that the drugs were found there. Furthermore, the argument about visibility also suggested that the accused's version about Eric was unlikely to be true. If the rooftop was visible from neighbouring high-rise buildings, it would be likely that the person who placed the Oakley bag there would have done so in the night. Yet, according to the accused's version, Eric would have placed the Oakley bag at the rooftop between about 11 am  and about 5 pm of 28 January 2003.
148      The point about one other tenant seeing Ah Siong and a girl and the accused and a girl was also neither here nor there as the girls were not identified and, as I have said, the accused's girlfriend did not give evidence.
149      Mr Dhillon had also raised the point about the omission by the IO to try and obtain fingerprint evidence. The IO had assumed that the rubber gloves found had been used and did not try to obtain fingerprint evidence. He had agreed that fingerprint evidence would have been a great help for the trial (NE 569). In any event, as there was no fingerprint evidence before me, I had to reach my conclusion without such evidence.
150      I should also cover the point about the accused's ignorance that one of the big packets contained caffeine instead of heroin. I was of the view that this did not mean that he was unaware of the existence of the heroin in the Oakley bag . He had believed that all the three big packets and the 89 sachets contained heroin.
151      As for the question as to whether the accused had been given a key to the Bedroom, this became irrelevant. Even if he did not have the key, it did not advance his case any further since it was no longer his position that some unknown person had gained access to the Bedroom without his knowledge and thereafter to the rooftop. According to him, it was Eric who had done so after he had let Eric stay in the Bedroom.
Summary
152      In the circumstances, I found that the accused had failed to discharge the presumption under s 18, and the consequent presumption under s 17 applied. I add that, in my view, the prosecution would have proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt even without the aid of the presumptions in the light of the overwhelming evidence against the accused.
153            Accordingly, I convicted the accused on the charge and sentenced him according to the law.",2003-12-06 00:00:00,SG High Court

1          The accused is 37 years old.  He was tried on the following charge:
 
‘That you, Ismail Bin Abdul Rahman, on the 7
th
 day of March 2003, sometime between 5.30 am and 6.00 am, at Bukit Panjang Telecoms Exchange, located at 40 Woodlands Road, Singapore, did use an arm, namely, a .38 inch Calibre Special Smith & Wesson revolver, by discharging three rounds from the said revolver, with intent to cause physical injury to one Rahim Bin Othman and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 4(1) of the Arms Offences Act, Chapter 14.’
 
Rahim died subsequently in hospital.
 
2          Section 4 of the Arms Offences Act provides:
 
‘4(1)     Subject to any exception referred to in Chapter IV of the Penal Code (Cap. 224) which may be applicable (other than section 95), any person who uses or attempts to use any arm shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be punished with death.
 
(2)        In any proceedings for an offence under this section, any person who uses or attempts to use any arm shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have used or attempted to use the arm with the intention to cause physical injury to any person or property.’
 
3          Section 2 of the same Act defines ‘use’ as follows:
 
‘….. ‘use’, with its grammatical variations, means –
 
(a)        in relation to a firearm, air-gun, air-pistol, automatic pistol and any other kind of gun or pistol from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged or noxious fluid, flame or fumes can be emitted – to cause such shot, bullet or other missile to be discharged or such noxious liquid, flame or fumes to be emitted with intent to cause physical injury to any person; …..’.
 
4          Chapter IV of the Penal Code (referred to in section 4(1) of the Arms Offences Act) deals with the general exceptions available as defences to a charge.  Section 95 of the Penal Code, excluded by the said section 4(1) from applying, is the provision embodying the 
de minimis non curat lex
 maxim. Section 80, which appears in Chapter IV of the Penal Code and is therefore an applicable defence, provides that:
‘Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune and without any criminal intention or knowledge, in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner, by lawful means, and with proper care and caution’.
Relying on this exception, the accused claimed trial, testifying that the whole shooting incident that early morning was an accident. At the conclusion of the trial, I found him guilty and convicted him on the charge.
THE PROSECUTION’S CASE
5          On 6 March 2003, Rahim, a CISCO officer, reported for duty at CISCO’s Jurong Base Headquarters and was issued a .38 calibre Special Smith and Wesson revolver and ten rounds of ammunition. At about 9.15 pm, Rahim left for his official duties at Bukit Panjang Telecoms Exchange (‘the exchange’). He brought with him his revolver and the ammunition.  He was the sole guard at the exchange.
6          At about 6 am on 7 March 2003, his superior, SGT Chandrasaharan, stationed at the above headquarters, received a telephone call from Rahim saying he had been shot twice by ‘Mail’ and asked the SGT to call for an ambulance.  The SGT drove immediately to the exchange, informing the police and the ambulance services about the shooting along the way. He knew that ‘Mail’ was a nickname for the accused, a former CISCO officer known to him for about ten years. The accused’s services were terminated in early 2003 after he was found to have been absent from official duty.
7          At about the same time, Rahim’s wife, who was in bed at home, also received a telephone call from Rahim informing her that he had been shot. She woke their 19 year old son up and asked him to call his father using his mobile phone. When the son spoke to his father, Rahim sounded breathless and kept uttering some prayers. Rahim’s wife then called the police. The son telephoned Rahim again but the latter still uttered prayers without telling him what had happened. The son then called the ambulance services to say that a CISCO guard had been shot at the exchange.
8          When SGT Chandrasaharan arrived at the exchange about ten minutes later, the electronically controlled main gate was opened. He found Rahim lying in a supine position on the floor in the guardhouse. Rahim asked him to call for an ambulance. He told the SGT that the accused had wanted to use the toilet in the exchange and that the accused shot him twice and then ran away with the revolver. He pointed to his thighs as the part of his body that had been shot at.
9          Shortly thereafter, police officers arrived at the exchange. The SGT related to them what Rahim had told him. He also told them the accused was a male Malay aged thirty plus, was bald and had a stout build. The information was relayed by the police officers to their Division Operations Room.
10        The ambulance then arrived at the exchange and the female paramedic attended to Rahim who was still conscious. She removed the Nokia mobile phone that was on Rahim’s chest. She noted three gaping wounds at the front of Rahim’s body and another one at his rear right waist area. Rahim was then placed on a stretcher and brought into the ambulance. Along the way to the National University Hospital, he became unconscious. The ambulance arrived at the hospital at close to 7 am and Rahim was brought immediately into the emergency room.
11        Emergency surgery was performed on Rahim but he went into cardiac arrest and passed away at about 12.30 pm.
12        The accused’s wife, a canteen helper, testified that the accused returned to their Bukit Batok housing estate flat on 7 March 2003 at about 6.30 am. He was perspiring and removed his shirt while at the main door. He helped their youngest son, aged nine, to prepare for school and then left with him, returning to the flat at around 7 am. He sat in the kitchen, smoked and had his breakfast. He appeared to his wife to be disturbed about something.  She found out from him that he took a ferry at 10.30 pm the night before from Batam and arrived in Singapore at about 1 am on 7 March 2003. After breakfast, the accused went to lie down on their bed.
13        At about 8.15 am, he put on a dark-coloured long sleeve sweater and a pair of jeans. Fifteen minutes later, he left the flat with a white helmet and a helmet bag.
14        When she was getting ready to leave home for work, she received a telephone call from the accused saying he was at the opposite block of flats waiting for a friend. He had a mobile phone but the line had been terminated. Nothing much was said between them. After that call ended, her sister called to tell her there was something in the news about the accused.
15        At around 9 am, the accused called her at home again.  She asked him about what her sister had said. He told her he was in a police post opposite the Bukit Gombak MRT station and asked her not to go there. Nevertheless, she left their flat for the said police post. When she arrived there, the accused had already been placed under arrest.
16        She added that they did not have any financial problems during the earlier years of their marriage. The accused used to give her $1,000 each month for their household expenses. However, in the middle of 2002 or so, he owed banks money because of his spending using credit cards. He did not own a car or a motorcycle.
17        ASP Abdul Halim bin Osman from the Criminal Investigation Department testified that at about 8.50 am, he received information that the accused had been spotted at the 7-Eleven store at Bukit Batok Central. ASP Halim and his team of officers arrived at the vicinity and observed the accused leaving the men’s toilet at the bus interchange there. When the accused boarded a bus, the officers followed. He alighted near Bukit Gombak and walked towards the Hong Kah North Neighbourhood Police Post (‘NPP’).
18        The accused entered the police post. He was carrying a bag in one hand and was perspiring and panting.  He paced up and down in front of the counter, looking out of the glass door. The officer on duty asked him what had happened but he merely continued his pacing. When asked again, he told the officer that someone was chasing him. The officer realised then that he fit the description of the person wanted in connection with the shooting earlier that day.
19        With the permission of the officer, the accused made a call to his wife from the telephone there. After the short conversation with his wife, he sat down and told the officer, ‘I confess to what happened earlier at Panjang.  Here are all the things’. He then raised the bag towards the officer who noticed the butt of a revolver sticking out. The officer took the bag away from the accused and was about to continue the conversation when ASP Halim and his officers entered and arrested the accused.
20        ASP Halim opened the accused’s helmet bag in his presence and recovered the revolver, seven rounds of ammunition and three cartridges. He then contacted the investigating officer in charge of the case, SI Roy Lim. The accused was brought into a room.
21        While waiting for the investigating officer to arrive, ASP Halim interviewed the accused who agreed to write out a statement for him. This statement was not used by the Prosecution at the trial.
22        After the investigating officer arrived and had been briefed, the police officers went with the accused to the men’s toilet at the Bukit Batok bus interchange, arriving there at about 10.55 am. The investigating officer interviewed the accused in the toilet and wrote down what he said in his field book. This statement was admitted after a trial within a trial. The accused’s sweater, which was left in one of the cubicles in the toilet by him, was seized.
23        At about 12.15 pm, the officers brought the accused to his flat. There the accused led the investigating officer to the storeroom of the flat and showed him a plastic bag, telling him that the CCTV videotapes which he had taken from the guardhouse at the Bukit Panjang Telecoms Exchange were in the bag. He also told the officer that the clothes he wore during the shooting incident had been washed by his wife and were hanging on the bamboo poles outside the flat to dry. On the way back to the police vehicle, the accused also said he had removed a cup and an ashtray from the said guardhouse and had discarded the items in the rubbish chute. The cup and the ashtray were recovered from the rubbish chute.
24        Three slugs were recovered from Rahim’s body. The autopsy report by Dr Paul Chui stated that Rahim’s death was due to multiple gunshot wounds to the abdomen. There were three gunshot wounds and one exit wound. Each gunshot wound was sufficient by itself to cause death in the ordinary course of nature but it was not possible to determine the chronological order in which they had been inflicted. One of the wounds entered Rahim’s anterior abdominal wall at an angle of about 45 degrees. The consultant forensic pathologist did not notice any gunpowder or soot near the wounds. He could not examine Rahim’s clothing as it had already been removed when the body was sent for autopsy.
25        Dr Tay Ming Kiong, an analyst with the Centre for Forensic Science, examined the clothes worn by the accused and by Rahim at the time of the shooting incident and found gunshot residue on them. Gunshot residue would normally be found if the object in question was within one to two metres of the firearm when it was discharged. His findings meant that the clothes examined were within one to two metres of the firearm at the time of discharge or were in close contact with things with gunshot residue particles.
26        Another analyst, Vicky Chow Yuen San, examined the revolver, the slugs and the cartridges in question and Rahim’s shirt worn during the shooting incident. She found that the gunpowder pattern around the hole nearer to the front placket of the shirt was consistent with that of a shot fired from a distance of between 50 and 100 cm and that the gunpowder pattern around the hole further from the front placket was consistent with that of a shot fired from a distance of less than 30 cm. Similarly, the gunpowder pattern around the hole on the back of the shirt was consistent with that of a shot fired from a distance of less than 30 cm. She was of the opinion that the slugs and the cartridges were fired from the revolver in question.
27        SGT Kwek Tze Wei of the Armament and Ops Equipment Division examined the revolver in question and found nothing faulty with the trigger and the safety mechanism. Test firing of the weapon indicated it was in a fully serviceable condition. A finger pressure of 5.91 kg or 13 pounds was required to pull the trigger at double action. Only 1.38 kg or 3.5 pounds of finger pressure was required at single action where the hammer was in a fully cocked position. There would be a recoil diagonally upwards and backwards every time the weapon was fired. He was of the opinion it would be very unlikely for the weapon to be discharged accidentally more than once due to the recoil and the fact that the trigger finger has to be released in order to pull the trigger again. The revolver was not able to discharge two rounds one after the other, even with the hammer cocked, when the trigger was pulled only once
28        Dr Tommy Tan, a consultant with the Woodbridge Hospital, examined the accused on 25 March 2003 and on 4 April 2003 and interviewed his wife once. He was of the opinion that the accused had been suffering from a prolonged depressive reaction for at least a few months. Such a disorder was caused by his debts and was characterised by a low mood, decreased appetite and poor sleep. However, the accused was not of unsound mind at the time of the shooting incident.
THE TRIAL WITHIN A TRIAL
29        The prosecution sought to admit the following four statements made by the accused and recorded by the investigating officer:
(1)        in his field book on 7 March 2003 at about 11 am at the Bukit Batok bus interchange;
(2)        in his field book on 9 March 2003 at about 6.20 pm at the CID;
(3)        in his computer on 13 March 2003 at about 2.30 pm at the CID; and
(4)        in his computer on 20 March 2003 at about 3.55 pm at the CID.
As their admissibility as evidence was challenged by the defence on the ground that they had been made involuntarily, a trial within a trial was conducted.
30        On 7 March 2003, after the accused had completed a self-written statement at the NPP, he was brought by a team of police officers to the bus interchange. The investigating officer and ASP Halim went there in a different vehicle. The investigating officer testified that he recorded a statement from the accused in the men’s toilet outside one of the cubicles used by the accused earlier that morning. The escorting officers were standing near the entrance to the toilet while the recording was going on. That was the first time the investigating officer spoke to the accused.
31        He asked the accused to relate to him what had happened in the toilet earlier that morning. The accused spoke in English and everything that he said was recorded. The recorded statement was then read back to the accused and he was invited to alter or to add to it. He declined to do so. He was then asked by the investigating officer to sign on the statement and he complied.
32        The investigating officer was the only one who asked the accused questions. He denied that one of the police officers offered the accused a cigarette and allowed him to smoke in the men’s toilet. He asked the accused why the revolver was loaded with five rounds. He denied that the accused said he did not reload the revolver or that they disbelieved him and accused him of lying. He did not say to the accused, ‘You better tell me everything’. He also denied that one of the police officers threatened the accused by adding that the government was spending thousands of dollars to train the police in the detection of lies. While the police may inform witnesses that they did not need to say things which incriminate themselves, it was not the practice to similarly inform accused persons.
33        For the 9 March 2003 statement, the investigating officer began by saying to the accused, ‘Tell me what actually happened’. The statement was recorded in the field book as his computer could not function that day and he was not able to access the other computers in the office as they were password-protected. The accused spoke in English. He did not request that an interpreter be present. When the recording was completed, the accused signed the statement.
34        The investigating officer testified under cross-examination that he did not bring the accused to the pantry before proceeding to his office. He did not offer the accused a drink or a cigarette. He denied that the accused told him in the pantry, while sipping his drink, that there had been a misfire. He did not ask for the accused’s co-operation or promise that he would speak to the judge to get the accused a lighter sentence.
35        On 13 March 2003, the investigating officer brought the accused out of the lockup and informed him that he was going to record another statement and that whatever he wanted to say would be recorded in the computer. Although the accused chose to speak in English again, the investigating officer called for an interpreter to be present but none was available then. He proceeded to record the things said by the accused. He then printed out the statement recorded. The interpreter arrived at that moment and was asked to interpret the statement to the accused.  He did so in Malay. The interpreter and the accused then signed on the statement.
36        On 20 March 2003, the investigating officer brought the accused to his office. A Malay interpreter was present. The investigating officer informed the accused he would be posing questions to him to clarify certain matters. His earlier statement made on 19 March 2003 (which was not adduced in evidence) was read back to him by the interpreter.
37        The accused spoke in English assisted by the interpreter whenever necessary.  At the end of the recording, the statement was printed out from the computer and read back to the accused. The interpreter and the accused then signed on the statement.
38        The accused did not complain to the investigating officer at any time about any threats made by any police officer against him. He was co-operative during the investigations. The investigating officer maintained that all the statements were made by the accused voluntarily.
39        ASP Christopher Jacobs was one of the officers in the vehicle who escorted the accused from the NPP to the bus interchange on 7 March 2003. SSG Simon Lee was the driver and ASP Ng Poh Lai was the front seat passenger. At the rear, the accused, who was handcuffed, sat in the middle between SSSG Lee Yok Joo on his right and ASP Jacobs on his left. During the journey to the bus interchange, ASP Ng asked the accused for directions. No one in the vehicle made any threats, inducement or promise to the accused. In particular, ASP Ng did not tell the accused that he had better not lie as he (ASP Ng) had attended courses on interrogation.
40        At the bus interchange, ASP Jacobs walked in and out of the men’s toilet and did not hear the conversation between the investigating officer and the accused inside the toilet. He did not communicate with the accused.
41        ASP Ng Poh Lai denied that he had, at the NPP, dismissed the accused’s statement to ASP Halim that the shooting was an accident. He also denied having told the accused along the way to the bus interchange that he had attended courses on interrogation and that the accused had better not lie to him. He was standing guard outside the said toilet most of the time and did not know what was said inside. The questioning was left to the investigating officer and ASP Halim. The accused was not given a cigarette to smoke in the toilet. He denied having asked the accused why the revolver was loaded with five rounds or accusing him of lying when he said he did not reload the revolver.
42        SSSG Lee Yok Joo testified that no one in the vehicle threatened the accused on the way to the bus interchange. When the accused was being interviewed inside the toilet, he did not listen to the conversation as his role was merely to escort the accused. No one said the accused was lying. ASP Ng did not tell the accused the government had spent thousands of dollars sending him for courses to detect lies. The accused was not offered a cigarette and did not smoke in the toilet.
43        ASP Halim and the driver of the vehicle were not called in the trial within a trial as the accused confirmed they had nothing to do with the threats.
44        In his testimony, the accused said while he was in the vehicle heading for the bus interchange, ASP Ng told him not to tell lies as the government had spent thousands of dollars to send him for courses and he was able to determine if a person was lying. The accused felt very demoralised as he had told them the truth about what happened earlier that day but no one believed him.
45        Inside the toilet at the bus interchange, ASP Ng kept asking him to tell the truth although the accused had told him it was a misfire. ASP Ng and SSSG Lee Yok Joo took turns to question him. SSSG Lee then offered him a few cigarettes and he smoked them with SSSG Lee placing one cigarette at a time inside his mouth as his hands were handcuffed behind him. ASP Ng asked him what he was doing in the toilet earlier that morning. He replied he went there to urinate and to wash his face. As he was feeling very hot, he removed his sweater and left it inside one of the cubicles as he did not want it anymore. He showed the officer where he hung the sweater.
46        When ASP Ng asked him who loaded the revolver with five rounds, he replied he did not load it. ASP Ng accused him of lying again and he felt very disappointed and hopeless as no one wanted to believe him. As he was feeling like ‘zero’, he made up a story for the investigating officer and put his signature to the false story.
47        Later that day, he was charged with having committed murder and he made a cautioned statement under section 122 (6) Criminal Procedure Code.
48        On 9 March 2003, the investigating officer brought him out of the lockup. They went to the pantry before proceeding to the investigating officer’s office. No one else was in the pantry. He was offered a cup of coffee and some cigarettes to smoke. The investigating officer removed the handcuffs. They had a casual conversation. The investigating officer asked him to co-operate with him and tell the truth. The accused asked him for his handwritten statement made at the NPP on 7 March 2003 but was not given a copy of it. His story was as written in that first statement but the investigating officer did not believe him. The investigating officer told him if he co-operated and told him everything, he would speak to the judge and try to get a lesser sentence for him. He therefore had no choice and made up a story for the investigating officer.
49        The other statements recorded on 13, 19 (which was not adduced in evidence) and 20 March 2003 were also made up and untrue because of the promise made to him by the investigating officer on 9 March 2003. He simply carried on with the false story.
50        In cross-examination, the accused said the investigating officer also questioned him about what he was doing inside the toilet earlier that morning and told him to tell the truth. He said he did not believe the story that it had been an accident.
THE DECISION OF THE COURT IN THE TRIAL WITHIN A TRIAL
51        It was the prosecution’s duty to prove beyond reasonable doubt that all the statements of the accused were made voluntarily. I accepted the evidence of the prosecution’s witnesses that there was never any need to threaten or to induce the accused into making any of the statements as he was co-operative throughout. After all, it was he who walked into the NPP himself and subsequently volunteered to write out a statement for ASP Halim. They did not even have to use force to arrest him.
52        Even if the alleged words had been uttered by ASP Ng or anyone else, I did not think the accused would have abandoned hope and his senses so completely that he would concoct a story for the investigating officer. It was not his case that the so-called made-up story was suggested to him by any of the officers or that they told him what they wanted to hear from him.
53        Similarly, at the CID on 9 March 2003, there was no need to offer any inducement to him before asking him to make a further statement as he remained co-operative. I believed the investigating officer’s testimony that he did not bring the accused to the pantry before proceeding to his office.
54        Since there were no threats or inducement on 7 and 9 March 2003, it followed that the accused could not have been under such influence on 13 and 20 March 2003. Accordingly, I found that all his statements were made voluntarily and admitted them as evidence.
THE PROSECUTION’S CASE (CONTINUED)
55        In his statement of 7 March 2003, the accused explained that when he was in the 7-Eleven store earlier that morning, he noticed a few men chasing him. Knowing that there would be a ‘big shoot out’, he went into the men’s toilet at the bus interchange and reloaded the revolver with five rounds of bullets from the strip loader. He then put the extra two rounds and the three spent ones back into the strip loader. After placing the revolver in his helmet, he walked out of the toilet and then boarded a bus. He noticed a man followed him and boarded the bus too. When the bus reached the Bukit Gombak MRT station, he knew that there was a NPP in the vicinity and decided to proceed there to surrender himself ‘so things won’t get worst’.
56        In the 9 March 2003 statement, the accused told the investigating officer his intention was merely to obtain a firearm and not to kill anyone. He had some financial difficulties. On 6 March 2003 at about 11 pm, he decided to go to the exchange ‘as that was a(n) easy place to get a gun’. He knew there was only one CISCO guard on duty there.
57        Rahim let him in and they had a casual conversation. He was thinking of a way of getting the revolver without hurting Rahim. The opportunity arrived when they were talking about marksmanship.  Rahim asked him to teach him the correct way to shoot and took out his revolver. The accused demonstrated the proper technique with the revolver.
58        At about 5.35 am, Rahim, seated in a chair, was falling asleep. Time was running out for the accused as his intention was to rob the DBS bank at Bukit Batok Central at about 8.50 am because that was the best time to do so. He could not afford to wait any longer. He used the revolver to fire two shots at the left side of Rahim’s body. Rahim thought the accused had misfired and asked him to help lower him down to the floor. He asked the accused to leave. He then changed his mind and told the accused they should answer to CISCO together. The accused helped Rahim to remove his belt as requested. Rahim then asked him to telephone his (Rahim’s) wife. The accused could not allow him to do so because that would foil his plan to rob the bank. While standing up, the accused discharged one more bullet at Rahim’s stomach. Rahim turned pale and did not move anymore.
59        The accused then took the revolver, the cup he was drinking out of, the ashtray and the videotapes from the exchange’s CCTV system and left for home after hailing a taxi.
60        Later that morning, he headed for the bank which he intended to rob but noticed people following him. After thinking the matter through, he knew things would get worse and therefore decided to surrender himself at the NPP.
61        The statement made on 13 March 2003 elaborated on the events that occurred on 6 and 7 March 2003. The accused stated that he went to the exchange at Bukit Panjang at about 11 pm on 6 March 2003 and told Rahim he needed to use the toilet. After that, Rahim asked him whom he was waiting for at the main road and the accused replied that he was waiting for a friend to go to Johor Baru with. He made up that story in order to remain in the guardhouse of the exchange a bit longer.
62        Rahim made him some coffee and they had a long conversation about the way to achieve marksmanship during which Rahim handed his revolver to the accused so that he could demonstrate the finer points to Rahim. At about 2.30 am on 7 March 2003, the accused returned the revolver to Rahim as he had to patrol the grounds.
63        About ten minutes later, Rahim returned to the guardhouse and they resumed their conversation about marksmanship. Rahim made the accused another drink and handed him his revolver again as he did not understand the correct shooting technique.
64        By about 5.30 am, Rahim was dozing off with the left side of his body facing the accused. Intending to gain possession of the weapon, the accused fired two shots at the left side of Rahim’s body. Rahim leant to the right and shouted to the accused to turn off the circuit breaker as he thought there was an electrical short circuit. When Rahim realised there was blood on his body, he said ‘Eh… misfire apa’. The accused replied, ‘Ya … misfire’.
65        Rahim asked him to help him down to the floor and to get him some water. The accused complied with the requests. Rahim then asked the accused to leave the premises and he would be responsible for the misfire. He changed his mind almost immediately and said they should both answer to CISCO. The accused helped Rahim to unbuckle his belt and his holster and to untie his shoelaces. Rahim then asked for the telephone in order to call his wife and to call for an ambulance. The accused could not let him call because it would spoil his plans. He then fired one more shot at the stomach region of Rahim’s body.
66        Thinking Rahim was dead, the accused took his bullet pouch containing five bullets and tucked the revolver into the waist of his jeans. He packed up all the videotapes of the CCTV, the ashtray and the cup. He then took seven dollars from Rahim’s wallet and used the money for his taxi fare home.
67        He returned home at about 6.15 am. He did not respond when his wife asked him why he was so late. He kept his helmet outside the flat in a cupboard and kept the CCTV videotapes in the storeroom. He placed the revolver and the bullets in a drawer in the master bedroom. He took a shower, had breakfast, walked his son to school and then returned home.
68        At about 8.25 am, wearing a long sleeved sweater over a short sleeved T-shirt, he left the flat with the revolver and the bullets inside his white helmet which he carried in a helmet bag. He arrived in Bukit Batok Central and stopped by at a mini-mart to buy some cigarettes. He then proceeded to the DBS bank there. He had only one and a half hours to leave Singapore after the intended robbery.
69        He was surprised to see no CISCO officer patrolling near the bank, contrary to the normal routine. He looked around and saw the CISCO officers at the 4-D outlet, apparently looking for someone. He also noticed several persons watching him. He therefore decided not to rob the bank.
70        At the bus interchange, he made a telephone call home and asked his wife whether anyone had called him. After she replied that no one had called him, he went to the men’s toilet and removed his long sleeved sweater in order to change his appearance. He unloaded the bullets and the cartridges in the revolver and reloaded it with five rounds because he felt the situation would be very bad as he had realised there were a number of police officers waiting for him outside.
71        The accused walked out of the toilet and seeing a bus about to leave the interchange quickly got on board. A man in a yellow T-shirt followed him. He recognised that man as the one observing him earlier at the interchange. He then took the revolver out of the helmet and slipped it into the waist of his jeans. He contemplated firing one shot at that man and taking a passenger hostage. Upon further reflection about his family and what he had already done, he decided not to do so. He decided to alight near the Bukit Gombak MRT station in order to take a train and to change his plans.
72        As he was crossing the road towards the MRT station, he still wanted to rob any bank. However, three men were walking closer and closer to him. He thought about shooting them before they could shoot him. Seeing he was being tailed by policemen, he knew he could no longer rob a bank. Recalling a NPP nearby, he slipped away from them and walked towards the NPP while placing the revolver back into the helmet.
73        He told the police officer on duty at the NPP that he was the one involved  in the shooting of the CISCO officer. He surrendered the weapon and the bullets to him. He did this ‘in order not to injure anyone and also my plan to rob the bank had failed and I could not leave the country’.
74        In the statement of 20 March 2003, the accused answered various questions posed to him by the investigating officer. He explained he boarded the bus at the interchange to see if anyone was following him and also to slip away from anyone following him. He finally surrendered because all his plans had failed. He had intended to have a shoot-out with the police officers, confident he could take down six of them, leaving the last bullet for himself. As there were members of the public in the vicinity, he decided not to do so because there could be loss of innocent lives. He confirmed he achieved the status of marksman annually between 1998 and 2002 when he was employed by CISCO. He was a CISCO officer from 1991 to 2002. He also said the barrel of the revolver was about one foot away from Rahim when he fired the first two shots at him. There was no pause between the two shots. He fired the third shot when Rahim was lying on the floor and he was standing near Rahim’s feet and extending his arms to shoot. He was right-handed. He was aware the revolver was loaded with live rounds when he pulled the trigger and was conscious that discharging a firearm at someone could have fatal consequences. He concluded by saying he did not deny the murder charge (which he faced originally) and he was sorry for Rahim and family. He said he had no intention to kill but was not able to think clearly at the material time.
THE ACCUSED’S CASE
75        The 37 year old accused testified in his own defence. He said he was also known as ‘Mail’ or ‘Is’. He worked as a CISCO officer between March 1991 and December 2002. He stopped working in CISCO after he was disciplined for being absent without leave. His salary in December 2002 was about $2,000.
76        He was also working as a commercial diver in Batam, Bintang and elsewhere in Indonesia while he was still employed by CISCO. That brought him extra income. He continued working as a diver after he left CISCO. For his last assignment in February 2003, he was supposed to have been paid $35,000 but was not. For the assignment in March 2003, he received $35,000 but lost the money to robbers in Batam.
77        On 4 March 2003, he returned to Batam to collect another $35,000 as his share of profits from a friend but was unable to meet him despite waiting until 6 March 2003. As a result, he missed an appointment he had made with Rahim to meet between 4 and 5 pm on 6 March 2003 at Bukit Batok Central. He returned to Singapore at about 9.30 pm that day. He would usually carry the helmet to and from Batam because his neighbour sometimes gave him a lift on his motorcycle.
78        Upon his arrival here, he immediately went by bus to the exchange where Rahim was on duty. He had been there on supervisory rounds while in CISCO but had not performed guard duties there. The main gates were closed when he arrived there. He did not telephone Rahim to say he was going there to meet him as he had misplaced Rahim’s mobile phone number. He had to wait about twenty minutes before Rahim realised he was at the gates and let him in. He told Rahim he needed to use the toilet.
79        Later, they sat in the guardhouse and talked. Rahim said he was waiting for his call and the accused apologised for not calling earlier and for missing the appointment. Rahim was supposed to lend the accused $2,000 at that appointment so that he could go and look for the friend in Batam to collect the $35,000 and to pay his debts. Rahim said he could not bring so much money to the exchange as he was not allowed to do so while on duty. He said he would go and withdraw the money in the morning. The accused therefore remained in the guardhouse.
80        Rahim made the accused a drink.  They then talked about shooting with Rahim asking the accused for advice on how to achieve marksmanship. Rahim handed his revolver to the accused with the cylinder opened and with no bullets inside the chambers. The accused showed Rahim how to grip the revolver and to pull the trigger properly. At about 2.30 am, Rahim took his revolver and went out to patrol the grounds of the exchange. The accused did not see him loading the weapon.
81        Rahim returned to the guardhouse about ten minutes later. They continued their casual conversation until about 5.30 am when Rahim asked the accused to teach him shooting techniques again. The accused was feeling somewhat sleepy but Rahim was not. Rahim handed him the revolver, this time with the cylinder closed. The accused thought it was not loaded. He pointed the revolver at Rahim and told him to observe the fast clicking action. The accused then pulled the trigger twice.
82        Rahim looked up and exclaimed, ‘Mail, short circuit’. The accused also looked up. He did not realise his finger was still inside the trigger guard. Rahim wanted to get up from the chair. The accused’s hand holding the revolver was lowered. Somehow, he accidentally pulled the trigger and another shot hit Rahim. Rahim asked the accused whether it was a misfire and the accused then realised it was. Rahim asked for the revolver and the accused handed it back to him. He helped Rahim down to the floor as requested. Rahim told him to run away, saying he would answer for the shooting. However, he immediately changed his mind and said they would answer for it together.
83        Rahim asked for some water but the accused told him, ‘Later’.  He helped him to remove his belt and holster. The accused was panicky and took whatever he could find to cover Rahim’s wounds. From his bag, he took his gloves,  used for diving, to cover the wounds. He helped Rahim to remove his shoes and then saw that the revolver was loaded with five rounds placed in a disorderly manner. He went to get water for Rahim, bringing the revolver with him as he was afraid that someone might enter the guardhouse in the meantime.
84        When he returned with the water, he was shocked to see Rahim’s pale face. He tried to wake him up but Rahim remained motionless. The accused thought Rahim was dead. He did not know what to do. He then took the cup, the ashtray, his gloves, the CCTV videotapes and $7 from Rahim’s wallet. His mind was confused and he took whatever came into his  mind. He did not call for the police or an ambulance because he thought that Rahim was dead. He merely wanted to get away from the exchange and return home to see his family. He left in a confused state of mind with all those items.
85        At his flat in Bukit Batok, he kept the helmet in a cupboard outside the main door and placed the videotapes in the storeroom. He kept the revolver and the bullets in a drawer in the master bedroom. He then woke his son up and prepared him for school. When he returned home after walking his son to school, he had breakfast with his wife. He was still worried. After that, he threw the ashtray and the cup into the rubbish chute without knowing why. His intention at that time was to return the revolver. He then went to rest in bed.
86        At about 8 am, he left his flat, intending to go to the NPP at Bukit Batok Central to return the revolver and to surrender himself as he had seen his family already. He did not tell them about the shooting incident. His mind was still muddled and he was perspiring profusely. He bought cigarettes along the way and smoked while walking. He passed by a 7-Eleven store and went in to cool himself. He then went to use the men’s toilet at the bus interchange. As he was still feeling very hot, he removed the long sleeved sweater he was wearing and hung it up in one of the cubicles as he did not want it anymore. He smoked another one or two cigarettes while in the toilet. He did not reload the revolver at all since leaving the guardhouse at the exchange. He also did not remove it from the helmet at any time since he left his flat.
87        It then occurred to him that there was no NPP there. He recalled there was one at Bukit Gombak. He made a call to his wife from a public telephone, intending to tell her the truth. However, he did not do so when she answered the call. He then took a bus to go to Bukit Gombak NPP to surrender the revolver and himself.
88        At the said NPP, he was still in a confused state of mind. He wondered whether to call his wife from there or outside the NPP. That was why he kept looking outside the glass door. He asked the duty officer for permission to use the telephone and made a call to his wife. He told her where he was and instructed her not to go there. He then surrendered the revolver to the duty officer.
89        When the team of police officers went into the NPP to arrest him, he did not put up any struggle. He co-operated with them during the arrest. ASP Halim brought him into a room, handed him a piece of paper and told him to think and to state what had happened in the shooting incident. ASP Halim merely kept watch while he was writing. The statement, admitted in evidence by the defence, stated in essence that the shooting, involving two bullets on the first occasion and one bullet on the next, was accidental.
90        However, as there were police officers walking in and out of the room asking him questions now and then, he became confused and wrote certain things which were not accurate.  The version he gave in Court was the correct one.
91        The statement of 7 March 2003 made under section 122 (6) Criminal Procedure Code was also adduced in evidence by the defence. There, in reply to the original charge of murder, the accused said to INSP David Ang:
‘I did not mean to kill my colleague. I am surprised that he has passed away, when the charge was read to me. That’s all’.
92        In cross-examination, the accused said the last time he met Rahim before 6 March 2003 was on 2 March 2003 at Bukit Batok Central. They met by chance. The accused brought up the topic of a loan of $2,000. Rahim said he would try to lend the money to him on 6 March 2003. Rahim told the accused to call him to ascertain whether he could get the money for him and to meet him between 4 and 5 pm on 6 March 2003. Rahim also told him he would be on the night shift that night at the exchange, which was his permanent post. The accused did not call him that day as he was waiting for his friend to bring him the $35,000. He had also misplaced Rahim’s telephone number. He went to the exchange after returning from Batam with the hope of obtaining the loan from Rahim.
93        The accused was aware that a CISCO guard on duty would be carrying a loaded weapon. When Rahim handed him the revolver the second time, the accused was feeling sleepy and the lighting was dim. He did not notice that there were live rounds in the cylinder. The first two shots were fired one immediately after the other as he pulled the trigger twice rapidly using double-action firing. When Rahim stood up, the revolver was still in the accused’s hand. The third round was fired when Rahim stood up and the accused’s hand holding the weapon also went up in shock and his finger pulled the trigger accidentally. The accused was seated then. The accused had never misfired a revolver during the decade he was working in CISCO.
94        After he helped Rahim remove his shoes, he turned around and saw five rounds in the cylinder of the revolver. They were not arranged properly, with some jutting out. He also saw three empty cartridges on the floor and two rounds in the strip loader. He did not have the chance to ask Rahim why he reloaded the weapon. The accused picked up the cartridges and placed them into the strip loader. He took the $7 from Rahim’s wallet as he needed money for the taxi fare home.
THE DECISION OF THE COURT
95        I found the accused’s version of the shooting incident totally illogical and incredible. Rahim was on official duty at a guard post and the revolver could not have been unloaded. If Rahim decided later to load the weapon, he would surely have informed the accused about it when handing it to him. He could not have been so foolish as to allow the accused to point a loaded weapon at him, knowing that the accused was going to demonstrate by pulling the trigger.
96        The accused was a CISCO officer for about ten years and a marksman. He was adept at handling revolvers. The noise and the recoil from firing one shot in that confined guardhouse would have awakened the most sleepy of persons. However, the accused fired two shots in rapid succession at Rahim and still claimed he did not realise what he had done. Anyone in his position would have been so horrified that he would have put the revolver down immediately or perhaps even dropped it in utter shock and horror. The accused not only held onto the revolver firmly, he pulled the trigger a third time soon thereafter. His actions showed clearly he intended to fire at Rahim in cold blood. When Rahim remained conscious and wanted to call his wife, the accused had to fire the third shot to silence him.
97        His evidence about wanting a loan from Rahim was mentioned for the first time during his testimony in Court.  None of his statements alluded to that. It was obviously concocted to give the impression that he had a legitimate reason for wanting to visit Rahim so late at night at a guard post located far from the ferry terminal and immediately after arriving from Batam. Waiting till the next morning would not have made one bit of difference.
98        His evidence about Rahim having reloaded the revolver with five rounds after the shooting was nothing short of bizarre. Rahim had absolutely no reason to do so even if he could and it requires no great intellect to know that a person with three gunshot wounds in his body would not be able to do that.
99        The accused claimed many times in his testimony that he was confused after the ‘accidental’ shooting. However, the things he removed from the guardhouse were all things that could point to his presence there. Quite clearly, he was removing all incriminating evidence in a cool-headed and calculated way.
100      If the shooting was indeed an accident, the accused would have called for medical help from the guardhouse using the telephone there or Rahim’s mobile phone. Instead, he left the poor man on the floor to die. Even if he believed Rahim was dead, he would surely have called for the police since there was a weapon and live bullets to take care of. Instead, he took the dying man’s money for his taxi fare home.
101      Further, if it was such a horrific accident, he would have told his wife so immediately upon arriving home or soon thereafter. Instead, he behaved as if nothing had happened and even had the presence of mind to keep the CCTV videotapes in the storeroom and to get rid of the cup and the ashtray.
102      I had no doubt that the truth was in his statements and not in his oral testimony in Court. There was no accident at all that fateful morning. He went to see Rahim at a quiet guard post late at night with the clear intention of taking possession of the revolver to solve his financial problems by robbing a bank.
103      The shooting incident could only be explained in the way he had described in his various voluntary statements to the investigating officer. He was not going out to surrender himself that morning. He was headed for the bank to commit robbery. He gave himself up only when he realised he had been found out and was cornered. Fortunately, he retained the good sense not to have a shoot out with the police. The statements were consistent and coherent and could not have been made up.
104      The facts of this case did not even require the application of the presumption in section 4 (2) Arms Offences Act. The facts showed clearly that the accused fired the first two shots at Rahim with intent to cause physical injury to him at the very least. The third shot was undoubtedly fired not only to cause physical injury but death as well. As testified by the forensic pathologist, each of the three shots was capable of causing death in the ordinary course of nature. I had no doubt that the accused was guilty as charged and convicted him accordingly. The mandatory death sentence was passed on him.

The statement of facts
2          The accused understood the consequences of his plea and admitted the statement of facts without qualification.  The facts incorporated all three charges.  At about 1.30 am on 4 August 2003, the accused boarded a taxi bearing registration number SH8712J driven by one Seow Lai Huat (‘Mr Seow’).  The accused directed Mr Seow to send him to Sembawang.  Mr Seow noticed at that juncture that the accused was holding a knife in his left hand.  He complied with the accused’s instructions.
3          At about 2.00 am, the accused alighted from Mr Seow’s taxi at Sembawang MRT Station.  Mr Seow immediately proceeded to make a police report stating that he had seen the accused in possession of a knife.  The police located the accused shortly after, based on the description given by Mr Seow.  A 17-cm long knife was found in his possession.  He did not have any lawful authority to be in possession of the knife and he was placed under arrest.  
4          Later at about 10.10 am on 4 August 2003, the accused was arrested at Ang Mo Kio Police Divisional HQ on suspicion of having consumed a controlled drug.  Having tested positive for opiates in an instant urine test, two urine samples were obtained from him.  According to two certificates subsequently issued by the Health Sciences Authority, his urine samples were analysed and found to contain morphine, a specified drug listed in the Fourth Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)(‘MDA’).
5          The accused admitted in his statement to the Central Narcotics Bureau that he had consumed heroin three days prior to his arrest.  As he had previously been admitted twice to a Drug Rehabilitation Centre (‘DRC’) for consumption of a specified drug (morphine), he was liable to face enhanced punishment under s 33A of the MDA. 
6          It was further disclosed that on 16 June 2003, he had been placed on compulsory supervision for 24 months by virtue of Regulation 15 of the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions and Treatment and rehabilitation) Regulations 1976.  In contravention of Regulation 15(3)(f), he had failed to present himself for a urine test to the Duty Officer of Clementi Police Divisional HQ on 28 July 2003 without any valid reason.
7          Two similar charges of failing to report for urine tests on 30 July 2003 and 1 August 2003 (DAC 39678 and 39679 of 2003) were admitted by the accused and taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.  A third charge of criminal intimidation (DAC 52101 of 2003) was also admitted and taken into consideration.  The accused had pointed the knife, with a blade measuring 5 cm, at Mr Seow with intent to cause him alarm.
Antecedents
8          The accused was clearly not a newcomer to the criminal justice system.
According to his antecedent report (CRO60), he had seven previous convictions.  In addition, as disclosed in DAC 39680/03, he had previously been admitted twice to DRCs for consumption of specified drugs.  His previous convictions were for dissimilar offences, but they remained relevant in assessing his criminal predisposition and in determining the appropriate sentence. 
9          The six convictions under the Penal Code (Cap 224) involved one count each of theft (s 379), attempted theft of motor vehicle or component parts (s 379A r/w s 511), theft in dwelling (s 380), mischief (s 427), robbery (s 392), and voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons or means (s 324).  He also had one previous conviction for fraudulent possession of property under s 37(1) (now s 35(1)) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184).  For the robbery charge, he was sentenced to 39 months’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in 1993.
10        The accused’s previous convictions related largely to property offences.  He had no previous convictions for drug offences.  It was pertinent to note however that he had been previously convicted under s 324 of the Penal Code for an offence of voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons or means.  This time, he was caught in possession of a knife which he had used to intimidate Mr Seow.
Reasons for sentence
11        When invited to mitigate his sentence, the accused declined.   From a perusal of the CRO60, the accused could be considered for corrective training.  Nevertheless, as he would be facing a long-term sentence for his offence of morphine consumption, and mandatory caning for that offence as well as for being in possession of an offensive weapon, I felt that the aggregated imprisonment terms and caning would serve as sufficient deterrence.
12        I sentenced the accused to the mandatory minimum sentence of five years’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane in respect of DAC 39680/03. In respect of DAC 39677/03, I sentenced him to 6 months’ imprisonment for failing to report for the urine test.  These were his first convictions for any drug-related offence, and the sentences were in line with the general sentencing norms for such offenders.  He qualified for the enhanced punishment under s 33A MDA purely because he met the prerequisite of having two DRC admissions for consumption of specified drugs.
13        In respect of DAC 39681/03, I sentenced him to the benchmark sentence of six months’ imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.  As indicated in the Subordinate Courts’ Practitioners’ Library volume on 
Sentencing Practice
 (2
nd
 Ed, 2003 at p 263), this is the ‘entry point’ sentence generally adopted for an offence involving possession of offensive weapons.  In any event, six strokes is the mandatory minimum sentence of caning prescribed by law for this offence.  I ordered this sentence to run consecutively with the sentence in DAC 39680/03, resulting in a total sentence of five years and six months’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane.  The remaining sentence in DAC 39677/03 would run concurrently.
14        I noted from the record of proceedings that the accused had in fact maintained at one point that he would claim trial to all the charges.  After three pre-trial conferences, he eventually decided to plead guilty to the charges.  Other than his plea of guilt, there were no relevant mitigating factors.  He mentioned in passing during the pre-trial conference on 22 November 2003 that he was a former patient at the Institute of Mental Health (‘IMH’).  However, from what I observed of him and from the DPP’s perusal of the investigation papers, there were no signs indicating that his mental state was in issue.  As such, I did not see any necessity to refer him to IMH for a psychiatric evaluation.
15        Despite his previous convictions, the sentences I imposed were pegged at either the mandatory minimum sentence or the ‘entry point’ sentence.  The aggregate sentence was also backdated to take into account the time he had spent in remand.  The aggregate sentence could not be considered manifestly excessive by any stretch.  In the circumstances, there was no reason why any lower sentence was warranted.",2003-11-21 00:00:00,SG District Court

Criminal Law
  – 
Violation of the restriction imposed by the Police Supervision Order
  – 
Section 33(1)(b)(vi) r/w section 33(3) Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67)
 
1.        The accused pleaded guilty before me to a charge under section 33(1)(b)(vi) read with section 33(3) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67).  The charge involved violation of the restriction imposed by the Police Supervision Order to which the accused was subject.  A second, similar charge was taken into consideration.  I sentenced the accused to 18 months’ imprisonment.  As he now appeals against the sentence, I am setting down the reasons for my decision.
The facts
2.          In respect of the charge to which the accused pleaded guilty, the facts were as follows.  The accused was subject to a Police Supervision Order (PSO), No. MHA (CL) 0020/2002, issued on 24 May 2002.  The PSO, which was to operate for a period of 3 years from the date of issuance, contained various restrictions.  Inter alia, the accused was to remain indoors at his residence at Block 465 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 #04-1078, Singapore 560465 between the hours of 7.00 pm and 6.00 am.  He was to be out-of-doors between these hours only by special permission in writing of the Office-in-Charge of the Police Division in which he resided.  The PSO was signed by the accused who indicated by his signature that he understood fully the contents & effects of the order.
3.        On 16 July 2003, whilst the PSO was still in effect, a supervisory check was conducted on the accused at his residence at about 10.00 pm.  The accused was not at home.  He was subsequently caught returning home by the police officers who had gone to his residence to conduct the check.   It was established that he had left his residence during the curfew hours stated in the PSO; further, that at the material time, he had not been granted special permission to leave his residence.
4.        The second charge which was taken into consideration stated that on a different date (13 May 2003), the accused had also failed to remain indoors at his residence between the stated curfew hours.
The accused’s antecedents
5.         On the accused pleading guilty, I was informed that he had various antecedents.  These were as follows.
6.         On 7 June 1991, the accused was convicted of 3 charges of being absent without leave under section 24(1) of the Vigilante Corps Act (Cap 343).  He was fined a total of $300, which fines he paid in full.
7.         On 30 September 1992, the accused was convicted of 2 charges of unauthorised drug consumption under section 8(b) of the Misuse Of Drugs Act (Cap 185).  He was fined a total of $3,000, which fines he paid in full.  He was subsequently placed under drug supervision for 24 months.
8.         On 8 June 1994, the accused was convicted of 3 charges under the Misuse of Drugs (Approved Institutions & Treatment & Rehabilitation) Regulations, of failure to report for urine tests pursuant to his drug supervision order.  He was fined a total of $4,000.  The fines were not paid.
9.         On 22 April 1998, the accused was convicted of one charge of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and one charge of theft under section 379.  He was sentenced to a total of 20 months’ imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.
10.        On 17 November 2000, the accused was convicted of a charge of being a member of an unlawful assembly under s 143 of the Penal Code.  He was sentenced to 3 months’ imprisonment.
11.        On 8 January 2001, the accused was convicted of a charge of voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon under s 324 of the Penal Code.  He was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment.
12.        On 12 October 2001, the accused was convicted of a charge of affray under s 160 of the Penal Code.  He was sentenced to 1 month’s imprisonment.
13.        On 24 May 2002, the Police Supervision Order was issued against the accused.
The accused’s mitigation
14.        In mitigation, defence counsel stated that the accused regretted his actions.  Counsel informed that the accused had just been married and had in fact planned to hold the ceremonial wedding on 2 November 2003.  At the commencement of the mention, counsel had in fact applied for an adjournment of the accused’s case on the ground that the accused wished to undergo the ceremonial wedding on 2 November.  I had refused the application for an adjournment, as counsel had already raised the matter of the ceremonial wedding at the pre-trial conference (PTC) on 22 September 2003; and both counsel as well as the accused had expressly been put on notice at that time that the accused would be given a 4-week adjournment from the PTC to settle his personal affairs.  Moreover, the 2 charges in this case had been preferred in court several months ago, on 16 May and 18 July respectively, which meant that the accused had had several months in which to deliberate over the arrangement of his personal affairs.
15.        Counsel also stated that the accused had promised to turn over a new leaf as he would be starting a family soon; and he asked for a lenient sentence.
The sentence
16.        The offence under section 33(b)(vi) of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act is punishable with a mandatory minimum 1-year term of imprisonment.  The maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed is 3 years.
17.         In this case, I considered the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty.  I also took note of the fact, however, that this was a case where he really had no other choice: he was caught red-handed in the act of returning to his residence after having left it without permission, by police officers who had gone to conduct a check on him.  In these circumstances, the mitigating value of his plea of guilt was greatly diminished: 
Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP
 
[1991] 1 MLJ 321
.
18.        As for the possible hardship which might be caused to the accused’s new wife as a result of his incarceration, it has been held that such hardship is a normal coincidence of the accused’s own wrongdoing and will carry little weight in sentencing: 
R v Ingham
 (1980) 2 Cr App R (S) 184; 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
.
19.       I also considered the accused’s record which revealed a disturbing pattern of law-breaking, particularly in the years from 1998 onwards.  Several of the previous convictions were for offences of a violent nature: for example, rioting (in 1998), voluntarily causing hurt with a dangerous weapon (in 2000) and affray (again in 2000).  These antecedents, taken together with the accused’s present breach of the Police Supervision Order, indicated a deplorable lack of respect for the law.
20.       Finally, I noted that another similar charge was to be taken into consideration in sentencing.  The effect of charges being taken into consideration is that the sentences which the court would otherwise have imposed is increased: 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
.
21.       In the circumstances, I was of the view that a sentence beyond the mandatory minimum 1-year’s imprisonment was warranted; and I accordingly sentenced the accused to 18 months’ imprisonment.",2003-10-21 00:00:00,SG District Court

1          The plaintiffs are a company which is in the business of trading in computer products.  They leased premises on the second and third floors of a building known as Seiclene House at 25 Delta Road.  The Seiclene House belonged to the second defendants who also own and run department stores.  The premises leased by the plaintiffs were specifically, units #02-01/04 and #03-01/04.  The first defendant, now a bankrupt, was at the material time carrying on the business of supplying security services.  She ran her business under the name of Eshar Security Services.  Eshar was engaged by the second defendants, by contract, to provide security guards to Seiclene House.  It was established at trial that sometime between 8.30pm on 13 February 2003 and 7.30am on 14 February 1996 that unit #02-01/04 was burglarised and the loss of property amounted to $253,820.36 (including $1,780 for repairing the roller shutters and door).  The thieves had broken into the unit by sawing off the aluminium roller shutters and then breaking the lock of the door.
 
2          The plaintiffs alleged that the second defendants were liable in breach of cl 2(b) of the contract of lease, and alternatively, in negligence in failing to provide any adequate security or failing to supervise the security officers.  The plaintiffs’ claim against the first defendant was on the basis of vicarious liability on account of her being the employer of the only security guard on duty at Seiclene House on the night in question.  That guard was not called as a witness by any party.  There was no reliable evidence, however, to connect him with the theft.  He as well as the plaintiffs’ employees were questioned by the police but released.  The details of how the theft was carried out were also unavailable.  The plaintiffs’ case, therefore, was essentially founded on inferences and conclusions to be drawn from the following assertions, namely, that:-
a)         the second defendants were contractually obliged under cl 2(b) to provide security to their premises;
b)         the solitary guard was inadequate for the purposes;
c)         the guard must have failed in his duty because he did not ground the lifts and must have been himself asleep at the material time
Clause 2(b) that the plaintiffs relied on reads as follows:
‘subject to Clause 3(3), the monthly service charge of Dollars Four Thousand Six Hundred and Fifteen and Cents Eighty ($4,615.80) for the cleaning, lighting, upkeep, maintenance and repair of the common parts of the Building and for the maintenance, upkeep and operation of the services supplied and used in the Building (hereinafter referred to as the ‘service charge’).’
3          The theft was carried out by unknown persons.  There was no evidence as to how the stolen items were packed or taken out of the building compound.  Two police officers involved in the case were called as witnesses for the plaintiffs but they were unable to provide any information other than what the parties themselves knew.  It was a well-planned theft.  The burglars knew precisely what they wanted and how to get them.  Tech Pacific (S) Pte Ltd was not a random target.  It was selected from the many tenants in the huge building.  The stolen goods were specific and selected products, not the usual plunder of cash and jewellery.  There were photographs of what remained in the plaintiffs’ premises after the theft, but those were not helpful in this regard.  What is significant is that there was evidence from the second defendants’ warehouse manager, Bek Eng Lee, that cargo movement in and out of the building continued even after 7pm.  This evidence was accepted by Mr Rao.  The last employee of the plaintiffs left that night between 10pm and 10.45pm.  There is contradictory evidence from the plaintiffs in that a police report (admitted as PB32) made by their operations manager Ernest Enver (who did not testify at trial) stated that his staff on the third floor of Seiclene House left the building about 10.45pm.  The plaintiffs’ loss adjustors interviewed the staff and they told him that they left at 10pm.  One employee gave evidence, and that was Illya Zahri (who said that he left at 8.30pm).  There was no evidence as to how visitors into the building were tracked or recorded.  Evidence was also adduced to show that the plaintiffs’ premises were protected by a Chubb Alarm System.  If armed, the plaintiffs’ manager would be notified directly when a break-in occurs.  The alarm system was inspected after the theft and no inherent fault or malfunction was detected.  The reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the system was either not armed or not properly armed.  The plaintiffs’ employee who was charged with the duty of arming the system declared that he had armed it on the night in question.  If that were so, then he obviously did not arm it properly.
4          The first defendant entered into a contract with the second defendants to provide three security guards to the Seiclene House.  Two of the guards were for daytime duty and one for the night.  The scope of duty under that contract were specified as follows:-
‘1.        Prevent unauthorised personnel from entering the premises.
2.         To control and ensure a smooth functioning of activities within the premises.
3.         Control and record all visitors and vehicles moving in and out of the premises.
4.         Control traffic moving in and out of premises and to ensure the vehicles are properly parked.
5.         To ensure that the building is empty before grounding the lifts at 2200 hrs.
6.         To ensure that doors to the entrance of the premises are securely locked up.
7.         To patrol the buildings at half-hourly intervals and punched in the clocking device at designated checkpoints.’
On the facts and evidence that I had set out above, the plaintiffs prayed to make the first and second defendants liable for the theft.  Before considering the merits of their claim, it is important to be mindful that two key features stand out in this action.  First, the damage was caused by third parties (the thieves).  Secondly, the negligence and breach of duty alleged against the defendants were for an omission that is, the failure to protect the plaintiffs’ premises and goods.  I shall elaborate on latter point shortly.
5          I shall first consider the plaintiffs’ claim in contract.  Their counsel, Mr Rao, submitted that by cl 2(b) of the lease agreements  the second defendants were obliged to provide security services.  This claim is without merit because the natural reading of cl 2(b) does not include nor can it be read to include security services.  Moreover, the clause was silent as to what form of security the second defendants were obliged to provide and most, if not all, the allegations by the plaintiffs as to the security they were entitled under the lease had to be implied.  There is no reason to do so unless the principal term is clear.  Clause 2(b) provides the consideration for the imposition of the service charge.  ‘Security Services’ was not specified in the list of services provided and cannot be smuggled into the term under the cover of the words ‘services supplied and used in the Building’.  The reference to ‘cleaning, lighting, upkeep, maintenance and repair of the common parts of the Building’ specify what the tenant is entitled to receive for paying the service charge.  Anything else that the landlord might provide out of the funds collected would be out of goodwill and which contractually, the tenant would not be entitled to demand.  Even if the tenant were entitled to security services by virtue of this clause, they would only be entitled to the services as provided at the time the contract was signed.  There was no evidence that the landlord were obliged to provide more than one guard each night.  Hence, contractually, even if cl 2(b) may be read as requiring a guard to be provided, then there was no breach since a guard was in fact provided.  It would be an extravagant reading of cl 2(b) to require specific modes of security, additional guards, and the mode in which they were to carry out their duties.  It would be too great a strain on the natural language in cl 2(b).
6          I shall now refer to the plaintiffs’ claim in negligence.  The tort of negligence gained ascendancy with 
Doughue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
 a case cited so often that one might be forgiven for taking the classic passage of Lord Atkin for granted although occasionally, a case is presented on facts in which the Atkinian jewel is shown in remarkably brilliant and attractive light.  Although this is not such a case, it is a sufficiently important example of the need to isolate cases of ‘pure omission’ from ‘acts of negligence’.  The duty of care is owed by one person to another not to do any act as will foreseeably cause harm to that other.  The Atkinian formulation referred to ‘acts or omissions’ but it is well established that the omissions there referred to were omissions to do such act as to ameliorate the harm or lessen the danger first created by his act.  Hence it is said that a man who creates a danger owes a duty to take measures to prevent his Atkinian neighbour from being harmed.  An omission to do so is a tortious omission.  Pure omissions, on the other hand, generally create no duty; otherwise, a person would be compelled at law to be a good Samaritan.  (See

, 247).  Thus, I may owe a duty to  a man who leaves his goods in my house to secure them reasonably and keep them safe from foreseeable damage.  But I owe no such duty to a man to whom I had leased my house or a room in my house, unless by an express term in our lease that I should be so obliged.  The clearest distinction between a culpable omission and a ‘pure omission’ can be gleaned from the facts in this case.  Restricting access by unauthorised persons to the building was one of the contractual duties of the first defendant’s guards.  A breach of this term will occur when he allows persons whom he had not ascertained to be authorised to enter the building, but, the mere fact that some unauthorised person or persons had slipped past him is not in itself a culpable omission on his part.  The fact is that a solitary guard was given the task of discharging a guard’s duty in a building as large as the Seiclene House.  If he was at the gate he cannot be faulted in not knowing that someone is on the second floor.  In short, he cannot be in two places at once.  Thus, an omission of this kind is not a culpable omission in itself.  There must be sufficient proof that the standard of care was not met.  That has to be distinguished from a mere failure to apprehend the thieves.  A general duty to apprehend thieves or an absolute duty to prevent theft goes beyond the contractual duty and is too widely cast.  Hence, the mere omission of a guard to apprehend a thief whom he did not know was in the building is a ‘pure omission’.  On the other hand, the plaintiffs’ employee Illya Zahri (PW3) was the person charged with the duty of arming the Chubb alarm.  He left the premises without arming the alarm when there were other employees of the plaintiffs still in the building.  There was a direct duty on his part to a positive act namely, to arm the Chubb alarm and to do it properly.  A failure to do either is a culpable omission.  Consequently also, it had not been proved to my satisfaction that the negligence (if any) of the defendants led to the theft.  The burden in this regard remained with the plaintiffs.
7          In the present case, the relationship between the plaintiffs and the second defendants was purely contractual.  The premises that were burglarised had been leased to the plaintiffs who had the complete and exclusive control and occupation of it.  It is not difficult to see that in such circumstances, the landlord cannot be responsible for the goods in the tenant’s premises.  What requires deeper consideration is the question as to whether the landlord who might have retained full control of the common corridors owes a duty of care to its tenants such that thieves and unauthorised persons are not permitted to step into those corridors.  Again, it is superficially attractive to think in terms of a positive duty to do so.  But upon reflection, a multitude of conceptual and practical problems apply to diminish the initial attraction of such a rule.  Any such rule would have increased the existing law not incrementally, but by a leap so large that its application to many fact situations can only be tenuous.  Would such a rule apply only in respect of warehouses, or ought it apply to office and other buildings as well?  What sort of distinction should be made?  Should the rule apply only after working hours, and if so, must it not be made sufficiently flexible to accommodate the different hours depending on the type, nature, and specific building?  If such a duty is imposed, what are the limits to the imposition of reasonable observance?  Must there be one guard for every 1,000 square metres of corridor space?  Or one guard for every point of ingress into the building?  The factual distinctions of such requirement will virtually be distinguishable from building to building such that the diversity of factual conditions is sufficient to destroy the notion of a single workable principle with minimal exceptions.  In coming to these conclusions, I am mindful that we may be entering the age of tight security (and might perhaps have already done so).  The common law rules are amenable to some flexibility in this regard and, in some instances, a stricter interpretation of the duty of care required from those who provide security services may be warranted.  There is insufficient evidence in this case to justify any extension of the common law principles.  The plaintiffs merely failed to adduce adequate proof of the act or acts of negligence of the guard.  The plaintiffs’ counsel suggested that the second defendants ought to have employed more security guards.  That is more a commercial, rather than legal, question.  The general security and access into the building must be one of the standard items a prospective tenant would have enquired.  If he is not satisfied with the existing arrangements, he would have to negotiate for more secure measures.  In the process of such negotiations, the landlord would be entitled to increase the rent or auxiliary charges in consideration.
8          Can the same be said of the first defendant’s situation?  She offered no evidence because she had no knowledge of how the theft was carried out or what her employee was doing at the time.  Her liability depends on the liability, if any, of her employee the solitary guard on duty at the material time.  The first defendant had no contractual relationship with the plaintiffs.  Her contract was with the second defendants.  The evidence against the first defendant was sparse.  Mr Rao, in fact, relied on 
res ipsa locquitur
 because he could not explain how the theft took place.  Neither did he know where the guard was or what he was doing at the material time.  The liability of a security guard in negligence is similarly based on a breach of his duty to take care and does not include pure omissions.  A short explanation is necessary here.  A guard’s duty, of course, is to guard and he fails in his duty if he allows a stranger to take away that which he was guarding.  What was he guarding in the present case?  It was, on the evidence before me, the building known as Seiclene House.  That was a huge building.  The police officers who testified at trial said that it took about twenty minutes for a guard to walk around the building.  Given the fact that only one guard was on duty at night, the fact that the thieves entered without his knowledge and carried out the theft is not in itself evidence of negligence.  That would impose too onerous  a duty on the shoulders of any one man or woman.  The plaintiffs had to prove the negligent act on the part of the guard.  The pleading averred that the guard abandoned his post and fell asleep on duty.  I suppose that the plaintiffs mean either of three situations.  First, they could be saying that the guard abandoned his post and went to attend to something else that had no connection with his work, for example, to see a film with his friends or to visit his dentist.  For the avoidance of doubt, I would not, regard going to the toilet as ‘abandoning his post’.  Secondly, the plaintiffs could mean that the guard was at his post but fell asleep on duty.  Thirdly, they could mean that the guard abandoned his post and went somewhere to sleep.  In this third situation, going to the toilet to sleep could be construed as abandoning his point.  However, the plaintiffs adduced no evidence as to what  the guard did that night.  It cannot be assumed that he had abandoned his post or had fallen asleep.  If as the evidence showed, it would have taken twenty minutes to walk around the building, the thieves could have entered when the guard’s back was turned.  A guard who did not detect intruders is not by that failure alone, negligent.  The specific factual situation or context is important.  A guard who watches over the ingress through a single door may have no excuse if an intruder enters through that door.  A guard who has the watch over the Seiclene Building is vulnerably exposed to exploitation by intruders.  It is unreasonable to find him liable without proof of any positive act of negligence and that will only serve to amplify the exposure of such guards.  For these and foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the allegations that the second defendants did not have a proper system of security, or were negligent in not maintaining that system, have not been proved.
9          
Res ipsa locquitur
 is often too liberally pleaded.  Generally, where particulars of negligence are pleaded, there is no room for the application of this principle.  When a plaintiff pleads that ‘the thing speaks for itself’ he is saying that ‘I have no proof how it happened but it did and it was something that does not occur in the ordinary course of things’.  Bags of sugar falling on a dock worker is the classic case on point (see 
Scott v London and St. Katherine Docks
 
Co
 (1865) 3 H&C 596).  When specific acts of negligence or the cause of negligence is pleaded any reliance on 
res ipsa locquitur
 is a self-defeating admission that he has no proof to support the pleaded acts of negligence.  If a plaintiff says that the defendant was negligent because he fell asleep on duty and is unable to prove so, he cannot then say ‘the thing speaks for itself’.  On the facts before me, the fact that thieves had broken in does not necessarily conjure an image of a sleeping guard.
10        Lastly, I shall address the issue of the exemption clauses under cll 6(11), (12) and (13) of the lease agreement.  This exercise is undertaken only for completeness sake since I found that neither defendants was liable in negligence or contract.  These clauses provided as follows:
‘           
LANDLORD NOT LIABLE FOR ACT
OMISSION OR NEGLIGENCE ETC.
(11)      Notwithstanding anything herein contained the Landlord shall not be liable to the Tenant nor shall the Tenant have any claim against the Landlord in respect of any act omission or negligence of any porter attendant or other servant or employee of the Landlord in or about the performance or purported performance of any duty relating to the provision of the said services or any of them.
            
LANDLORD NOT LIABLE FOR ACCIDENT, INJURIES, ETC
(12)      Notwithstanding anything herein contained the Landlord shall be under no liability either to the Tenant or the Tenant’s licensees servants visitors or to others who may be permitted to enter or use the Building or any part thereof for accidents happening or injuries sustained or for loss of or damage to property goods or chattels in the Building or in any part thereof whether arising from the negligence of the Landlord or of any servant or agent of the Landlord.
            
LANDLORD NOT LIABLE FOR INTERRUPTION IN SERVICES, NEGLIGENCE, DAMAGE, LOSS ETC.
(13)      Notwithstanding anything herein contained the Landlord shall not be liable to the Tenant, nor shall the Tenant have any claim against the Landlord in respect of:
(a)        any interruption in any of the services hereinbefore mentioned by reason of necessary repair or maintenance of any installations or apparatus or damage thereto or destruction thereof by fire, water, riot, act of God or other cause beyond the Landlord’s control or by reason of mechanical or other defect or break-down or other inclement conditions or shortage of manpower, fuel, materials, electricity or water or by reason of labour disputes;
(b)        any act, omission, default, misconduct or negligence of any porter, attendant or other servant or employee, independent contractor or agent of the Landlord in or about the performance or purported performance of any duty relating to the provision of the said services or any of them;
(c)        any damage, injury or loss arising out of the leakage of the piping, wiring and sprinkler system in the Building and/or the structure of the Building and/or the premises in the Building.’
These provisions were sufficiently clear.  So far as cll 6(11) and (12) are concerned, they apply only in respect of negligence caused by the landlord’s servant or employee.  The evidence in this case clearly showed that the first defendant was an independent contractor to the second defendants.  Accordingly, cll 6(11) and (12) are irrelevant and inapplicable.  In respect of cl 6(13), Mr Toh, counsel for the second defendants, misread the clause as applying to ‘security services’.  It does not.  It referred only to ‘services’ and ‘security services’ was not enunciated as part of those services, which in cl 13(b) were in respect of those of  ‘a porter, attendant or other servant or employee’ of the second defendants.
For the reasons above, the plaintiffs’ claim against both defendants fail and is accordingly, dismissed with costs.",2003-10-20 00:00:00,SG High Court

1          The first accused was 59 years old and was a taxi driver by occupation.  He was originally charged with conspiracy (with the second accused) to traffic 1063g of cannabis.  That was a capital charge.  He also faced seven other various charges of trafficking in smaller quantities of cannabis and cannabis mixture, as well as a charge for consumption of cannabis.  The second accused was originally charged with trafficking the said 1063g of cannabis.  He also faced five other charges relating to drug offences, including one for consumption of cannabis.  The prosecution reduced the capital charges against both accused.  Each of the two accused pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of trafficking 499.9g of cannabis, and a charge of consumption of cannabis.  Both accused agreed to have all the other charges taken into account for the purposes of sentencing.  They admitted the statement of facts without qualification.  Accordingly, I convicted both of them as charged.  The trafficking charges were for an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Ch 33.  The consumption charges were for an offence under s 8(b)(i) of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
2          The facts were uncomplicated.  The two accused had known each other since 2002.  The second accused was a 45 year old Malaysian who was unemployed.  He lived in Singapore at Blk 729 Woodlands Circle.  He received a telephone call from the first accused at 9.50am on 25 January 2003.  He was asked to help the first accused retrieve a plastic bag containing cannabis.  As instructed, the second accused collected a bag hidden in a rubbish bin at Blk 728 Woodlands circle and brought it back to his flat and there unpacked the drugs.  Later that afternoon, the second accused met the first accused and the two were seen driving off in the first accused’s taxi.  The taxi was intercepted by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau at 3.20pm at Woodlands Drive 61.  The second accused’s flat was subsequently searched and the drugs which were the subject matter of the trafficking charge were found in a cupboard in his flat.  The urine sample of both accused were taken at the Central Narcotics Bureau on the same day.  The samples were tested positive for controlled drugs by the Health Sciences Authority.  I sentenced both accused to 22 years imprisonment and in addition, the second accused was sentenced to 15 strokes of the cane in respect of the trafficking charge; and one year’s imprisonment for each of them in respect of the consumption charge.  The terms of imprisonment are to run concurrently with effect from 27 January 2003 when they were first remanded.
3          The prescribed punishment for the trafficking charge is 20 to 30 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, or life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.  The prescribed punishment for the consumption is imprisonment up to 10 years or a fine up to $2,000 or both.  There was little by way of mitigation for both accused persons save that these charges were their first offences concerning prohibited drugs.  The first accused is 59 years old and had been hospitalised when he suffered a stroke about four or five years ago.  The second accused is 45 years old.  His counsel submitted a medical certificate reporting that he had surgery for an inguinal hernia.
4          The learned DPP submitted that pleading guilty merits no discount in sentence if the public is to be protected.  He then referred to Parliament increasing the range of punishment to include life imprisonment as an indication that the trafficking offence is one such offence where a plea of guilt does not count in sentencing.  The DPP also submitted that the absence of previous convictions was of minimal value for mitigation purposes.  Finally, the DPP submitted that the drugs recovered were twice the threshold for a capital case.
5          There is one factor which I think must not be overlooked in the sentencing of a criminal, and that is the range of prescribed punishment.  A range from 2 years to 3 years is materially different from a range of 20 to 30 years imprisonment.  Increasing a 20 year sentence by 1% is only 2 years, but that is double the span of an original 2-year sentence.  Furthermore, 50 year old criminal who is imprisoned for 3 years will be 53 when he is released (if there is no remission of sentence) but if the same person is imprisoned for 30 years he will be 80 years old when released.  The rigours of imprisonment are felt not only during incarceration but also upon release.  Readjustment to society requires a greater effort after a 30-year sentence than a 3-year one.  This observation is not a declaration that, as a rule, no one ought to be imprisoned to the age of 80 or thereabouts.  Neither am I saying that a long custodial sentence is always more appropriate in the case of young persons, say in their 20’s or 30’s.  The point is that the range of prescribed length is a factor that must be taken into consideration in each case together with all other factors so that it can rightly be said that the sentence is a fair one in 
each
 instant case.
6          Some judges appear to be harsher in respect of some offences; some in respect of all offences; some judges appear to be more lenient in respect of some offences; and some in respect of all offences.  The lower and higher end of the range of prescribed punishment mark the limits of harshness and leniency.  The fair and appropriate sentence will vary from case to case and the indicia of an inappropriate sentence – whether it is manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate – is measured by taking all the relevant factors of the individual case into account.
7          The range for the appropriate sentence in unexceptional cases will likely to be fairly wide, and individual sentences can be diverse, including offences such as the present where the range is between 20 to 30 years, or life imprisonment.  Divergent sentences are the consequence of the application of judicial discretion to the individuality of the cases.  It is not necessary to attempt any comprehensive list as to what is or is not a factor to be considered.  Some factors are inherently weak as some are inherently strong.  Some others still are weak in comparison.  For example, a thief who steals a watch merely because he is too lazy to work attracts much less sympathy than one who steals bread because he had no job and had not eaten for days.  Thus, in the latter circumstances judicial sympathy can more readily be expressed in the leniency of sentence.
8          While I agree with the DPP that the fact that the accused persons had pleaded guilty is not an important factor in itself; nor do I disagree with the fact that having no previous convictions is of lesser importance when the offences in question are serious offences.  However, these factors should not be totally ignored because if they are acceptable factors, then they must have a place in the overall picture.  The sentence that is meted out must ultimately be based on the perception of that overall picture.  Some features may stand out in sharp focus (whether towards enhancement or mitigation of sentence) and others may lay in the obscure background.  It is apt and appropriate to give greater weight to the distinct features and little or no weight to the background.
9          I ought also to address the DPP’s submission that it is relevant to note that  the prosecution proceeded only on 499.9g of drugs when the weight of the drugs seized  was in fact 1063g.  I am of the view that it would be relevant to take into account the quantity and weight of the drugs seized, but one must not exceed the relevancy of this factor, and regard the DPP’s decision to amend the charge to a non-capital one as justifying a higher sentence in itself.  It must be borne in mind that the charge in respect of which the accused persons were convicted stipulated the weight to be 499.9g and it is that weight that merits attention.  The accused may had admitted a larger quantity in the statement of facts but they are not charged for that quantity.  It is speculative to draw any conclusion as to why the charges were reduced and why the accused agreed to admit the larger quantity in the statement.
10        Finally, in the present case, I decided on the same length of imprisonment for both accused because the circumstances do not merit any variance.  In my view, if any distinction is at all required to distinguish the sentences of the two accused, it would not be very significant on the facts of this case.  Although the first accused was the initiator I cannot say, on the basis of the sparse facts, that the second accused was a mindless minion of a great mastermind.  Their roles were about the same.  I also took into account the fact that the first accused would by reason of his age, be spared caning.  However, given his age and the sentence of 22 years imprisonment, no adjustment was, in my opinion, necessary.",2003-09-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

The background
 
1          Kanafatty (the plaintiff) was involved in an accident at the Causeway Woodlands, when his motorcycle numbered AX6908D (the motorcycle) he was riding on collided with a motor vehicle EC 9069T (the vehicle) driven by Peter Chan (the defendant).  At the conclusion of the trial I awarded interlocutory judgment to the plaintiff with costs, on the basis that the defendant was 75% liable for the accident.  I directed that damages for the plaintiff should be assessed by the Registrar with the costs of such assessment reserved to the Registrar.  The plaintiff being dissatisfied, has filed a notice of appeal (in Civil Appeal No. 60 of 2003) against my decision.       
The facts
(i) the plaintiff's version
2          The plaintiff now works as a security guard.  On 22 October 2000 (a Sunday) at about 2.30pm he came into Singapore from Johor Baru on the motorcycle, on his way to the SBS depot at Defu Avenue 1 where he then worked as a bus captain.  The motorcycle occupied the lane reserved for motorcycles; the traffic was heavy at the time.  After entering the motorcycle lane leading to the Singapore Immigration checkpoint, the plaintiff (PW1) noticed the vehicle was in a stationary position directly ahead of him, at a distance of about 7.5m-9m away.  The plaintiff applied his brakes and stopped some distance behind the vehicle.  At about the same time, the defendant reversed the vehicle and its rear collided into the front of the stationary motorcycle.  The plaintiff fell off the motorcycle and sustained injuries to his left leg/hand as a result.
3          Cross-examined, the plaintiff said he was travelling at about 30-40 kph that afternoon, there were many motorcycles around him.  There were 2 motorcyclists in front of him who moved to his left side.  It was only then that he saw the vehicle being reversed.  As he had no space to move to the left side because of the other 2 motorcyclists and could not move to the right (where there was metal fencing), he applied the brakes and stopped the motorcycle.  Within a matter of seconds, the vehicle collided into the motorcycle.  The impact threw the plaintiff off the motorcycle.  He landed on the road near the metal fencing while the motorcycle landed about 1½m behind the vehicle after hitting the concrete pavement on the right side.  In this regard, the plaintiff claimed that the sketch plan drawn by the police investigation officer (showing the position of the motorcycle after the collision) was incorrect.
4         The plaintiff did not produce photographs of the motorcycle to substantiate its damage caused by the collision.  Indeed, it did not occur to him to take photographs.  He explained the motorcycle was then about 20 years old and its certificate of entitlement was about to expire; he had intended selling the motorcycle.  As he had no money to repair the damage caused by the collision, he scrapped the motorcycle after the accident.
5          Counsel for the defendant pointed out that in the plaintiff's police report, the plaintiff did not say he had stopped.  The plaintiff's police report (see AB3) lodged on 2 November 2000 stated:-
On 22.10.2000 at about 2.30pm, I was riding my motorcycle AX6908D along Causeway and entered the Singapore Immigration complex.  I was on the lane for motorcycle only.  A motorcar EC9069 entered into my lane for motorcycle only and was directly in front of me.  All of a sudden, the driver applied brakes and started to reverse. I sounded my horn but the rear of the motorcar collided into the front of my motorcycle.  As a result I fell and injured my left leg and left hand.  My motorcycle was also damaged.  I was conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital by ambulance.  I have one witness and his name is Gopal h/p 012-752304.
The plaintiff explained that a police officer assisted him in drafting.  His English is not fluent and, after he had explained to the attending officer what happened, the latter drafted out the report on a piece of paper which the plaintiff copied into his police report.
6          The plaintiff denied he was negligent that day, that he failed to keep a proper lookout, that he was travelling too fast as which result he was unable to take any evasive action, causing the front of the motorcycle to collide into the vehicle (which was stationary) and severely damaging its rear portion.
7          The person identified in the plaintiff's police report namely Gopal V Perumal (Perumal) testified on his behalf.  Perumal was a good Samaritan who went to the plaintiff's assistance after the accident; they did not know one another beforehand.  Perumal gave his telephone number to the plaintiff and told the latter to contact him should the plaintiff need any help, after telling the plaintiff he had witnessed the accident.  The plaintiff's solicitor eventually met Perumal in August 2002 pursuant to the plaintiff’s arrangement with Perumal.  The plaintiff revealed that Perumal visited him once at his home after the plaintiff had undergone an operation in April 2001.
8          Perumal (PW2) corroborated the plaintiff's version of how the accident happened, that it was the vehicle which reversed and hit the motorcycle.  Perumal had helped the plaintiff to his feet after the impact and waited with the plaintiff until the ambulance arrived to take the latter to hospital.  Perumal disagreed with the plaintiff's version only in that he did not think the traffic was very heavy that afternoon.
9        Cross-examined, Perumal claimed he did not notice whether there were other motorcyclists travelling side by side with the plaintiff that day or in front of the plaintiff.  He only paid attention when he heard horning by the motorcyclists heading towards the checkpoint.  When he saw the plaintiff, the plaintiff was exactly behind the vehicle and the motorcycle had stopped.  Perumal denied counsel's suggestion that he did not witness the accident and he was merely giving the plaintiff's version of how the accident happened.
10        One Sergeant Hariati binte Ahmad (Hariati) from the traffic police department testified for the plaintiff.  Her testimony was not helpful at all as she was not the actual investigation officer (Azril) who investigated into the accident and prepared the sketch plan and the vehicle damage report; Azril has since resigned from the police force.  Hariati (PW3) could only say that the defendant accepted a composition offer for careless driving from the traffic police department.
(ii) the defendant's version
11        The defendant was the only witness for his case.  He testified he was returning home from Johor Baru that afternoon; no one was with him.  The vehicle was in 1 of 2 lanes leading up to the immigration checkpoint.  After he had travelled for about 50m he realised that he was in the lane meant for motorcycles only.  Consequently, he stopped the vehicle immediately and turned on his hazard lights.  The defendant then checked for traffic behind him.  When he saw that the lane was clear, he reversed slowly.  After he had reversed for about 5m, the defendant stopped to let some motorcyclists pass him.  After they had passed him, the defendant noticed another motorcyclist coming straight at the vehicle. As the motorcyclist did not appear to be slowing down, the defendant horned.  It was only when the motorcycle (whom he later realised was ridden by the plaintiff) was less than 5m away from the vehicle, that the rider applied his brakes and tried to swerve the motorcycle but to no avail; the motorcycle hit the rear of the vehicle.  The defendant blamed the plaintiff for the accident -- had the plaintiff kept a proper lookout and proceeded slowly, he would have seen and avoided, the stationary vehicle.
12        Cross-examined, the defendant explained that the extreme left lane of the Causeway facing Singapore was a dual function lane; it could be used by motorcars or motorcycles or both and clearly so stated in the markings on the lane.  It was only when he had driven into the lane and was about 50m from the motorcycle zone that the defendant realised it was restricted to motorcycles that afternoon; he stopped the vehicle immediately.  He could not do anything else but reverse as the metal gate in front was closed and there was no room to make a U-turn. (The metal gate is marked as a wide 
X
 in the police sketch plan found in 1AB9).  While it crossed his mind to seek assistance, the defendant said he did not know which (telephone) number to call.  Although it did occur to him the immigration officers were one possible source, the defendant felt they were not the appropriate persons to help him; hence, he did not approach them.
13        Although there was a steady flow of traffic in the motorcycle lane, it was moderate not endless.  The defendant could and did take, advantage of gaps in the flow to reverse the vehicle, after switching on his hazard lights.  When he was reversing the vehicle, motorcyclists were far away.  He reversed for about 5m and then stopped as a bunch of motorcyclists were approaching.  After they had passed him on the left of the vehicle, he continued to look in his rear view mirror to try to reverse.
14        The defendant then saw the plaintiff in his rear view mirror, a lone motorcyclist about 2 lamp-posts away from the vehicle.  Contrary to the testimony of the plaintiff and Gopal, the defendant did not hear any honking from any motorcyclists before the impact.   Indeed, it was he who horned repeatedly and stepped on his brake lights when he saw the plaintiff seemingly heading straight towards him.  When the plaintiff was about 5m away from the vehicle, the defendant noticed the plaintiff had a startled look suggesting it was only then that the plaintiff saw the vehicle; the plaintiff tried to swerve and brake.  The defendant then heard a loud bang and saw the plaintiff's body on top of the vehicle's boot with the plaintiff's face on the rear windscreen, after which the plaintiff disappeared from his view, having fallen off the boot.  The defendant alighted and went to the back of the vehicle.  He found the plaintiff conscious and sitting behind the vehicle next to the motorcycle, which was about a metre away from the vehicle.  He helped the plaintiff (who said he was in pain) to the side of the road.  He did not think the plaintiff was seriously injured.
15        The defendant's estimate of where the motorcycle landed (marked as 
Z
 on the police sketch plan) was close to the plaintiff's estimate (marked as 
X
); both estimates were far off the mark 
H
 shown on the police sketch plan.  In fact, according to the defendant, the position 
H
 was where the concrete divider started, demarcating lanes for use by motorcycles and cars.
16        While the plaintiff claimed that only the back bumper of the vehicle was dented, the defendant said the damage was far more extensive -- the lights, boot and the chassis sustained damage in addition to the bumper.  There were apparently also scratches on the vehicle's rear windscreen where the plaintiff landed. This was to be contrasted with the damage to the motorcycle -- its front fender was dented, the fork twisted and the rim of its front tyre bent.
17        Questioned why he had accepted the offer of composition (2 years after the accident) from the police for careless driving if he felt the plaintiff not he, was responsible for the accident, the defendant explained that he had consulted his lawyer who advised him to accept the same.  It made sense to accept as fighting the case may not necessarily result in a different verdict.
18        At this juncture, I pause to look at the police report lodged by the defendant.  Unlike the plaintiff's, the defendant's report was lodged on the morning of 23 October 2000, a day after the accident.  It stated:-
On 22/10/2000 at about 1500 hr, while I was driving along the Woodlands Causeway coming towards the immigration checkpoint, I was driving on the left lane, when I approached the Y-junction.  I continued travelling on the left lane, not realising that it is the m/cycle lane.  I stopped about 15m into the m/cycle lane.  I turned on my hazard lights and checked for clear traffics and then I reversed my vehicle.  About 5m of reversing, I stopped to allow on coming m/cycle to pass me. Then I noticed a m/cycle about two lamposts behind me, heading straight to my car.  The m/cycle rider seems not aware of my vehicle and only when he was quite near then he noticed me.  He tried to brake and swerve but failed and end up crashing onto my vehicle.  He suffered minor injuries and his m/cycle AX6908D suffered damage at the front portion.
One observation I would make at this juncture is that unlike the plaintiff, the defendant's testimony especially under cross-examination, was entirely consistent with his police report.
The decision
19        Although I believed his testimony, it was clear from the evidence that the defendant's conduct in reversing the vehicle was the main catalyst which caused the collision between the vehicle and the motorcycle.  The defendant should have considered other alternatives of getting the vehicle out of the motorcycle lane.  One possibility would have been for him to stop the vehicle and seek assistance from the immigration/custom officers at the checkpoint to find out whether they could open the metal gate (marked on the police sketch plan as a wide 
X
) to let him through.  If not, he should have sought the same officers' assistance to direct the motorcycle traffic to ensure he could reverse safely out of the lane.  It is noteworthy however, that the defendant did his best to warn other road-users of the vehicle's presence by flashing his hazard lights.
20        The plaintiff however was also partly to blame for the collision.  I was not entirely convinced he was being truthful when he said he had seen the vehicle reversing towards him just before the impact.  It was far more likely, consistent with the damage caused to the vehicle/the motorcycle and the defendant's version, that the plaintiff only saw the vehicle when it was too late for him to take evasive action.  Hence, the motorcycle crashed into the rear of the vehicle and flung the plaintiff forward onto the boot of the vehicle.  Had it been the vehicle which collided into the motorcycle, the impact would have pushed the motorcycle much back further than 1 to 1.5m behind the vehicle.  I disbelieved the plaintiff when he claimed he had stopped and horned at the vehicle.  It was the defendant who horned and flashed his hazard lights to alert the plaintiff when he saw the plaintiff heading straight towards him.  The plaintiff's testimony lacked conviction because he was not speaking the truth; it was difficult to pin him down to one version of what actually transpired just before the impact.  Had the plaintiff been more alert, the accident may well have been avoided as the defendant contended, bearing in mind that a number of other motorcyclists passed the vehicle on its left without incident.  It was common ground the lane was 4.7m wide, while the vehicle’s width was 1.4m; there was therefore an allowance of 3.3m for motorcyclists to pass the vehicle.
21        I was equally sceptical of the alleged corroborative testimony of Perumal; I disbelieved him.  If indeed Perumal had witnessed the accident as he claimed, he would have noticed the flow of traffic that day in the motorcycle lane, whether there were motorcyclists on the side of the plaintiff, whether other motorcyclists passed the vehicle before the collision and, whether it was a strong impact when the motorcycle and vehicle collided, instead of only seeing the vehicle reversing.  What Perumal told the court was what the plaintiff had told him.
22        Consequently, although I held that the defendant was primarily responsible for the accident, I was also of the view the plaintiff's own inattention was partly to blame.  As such, I apportioned liability between the parties on the basis of ¾ and ¼ in favour of the defendant and plaintiff respectively.  I felt it was a fair apportionment, using the guidelines extracted from the cases cited by counsel on behalf of the defendant (

Trafficking in controlled drugs.
 
 
1          The accused Dhanabalan s/o A Gopalkrishnan aged 33 pleaded guilty to two charges of trafficking in a controlled drug.  The first charge related to the trafficking of 499.99g of cannabis, and the second in respect of 749.99g of cannabis mixture.  He was arrested on 24 February 2003 at 8.35pm in a flat at Blk 52 Teban Gardens after cutting and packing cannabis from a bigger block of the substance.
 
2          He was retrenched from his job as an operations executive at Natsteel some time in July 2002.  He tried a new job selling food at a coffeeshop but found it hard to make ends meet.  He told his friend Raman Selvam about his impecuniousity.  Raman then offered to pay him $100 for each block of cannabis that he helps Raman cut and pack.  The prosecution accepts that the accused was not the main trafficker.  There were also other mitigating factors in relation to his role.  He had refused to transport the packed cannabis and saw his role simply as an assistant, packing the cannabis for his friend to traffic.  He had no known previous record for any drug offence.  And, finally, the co-operation that he had rendered the Central Narcotics Bureau and the prosecutor in the investigation of his case as well as Raman’s.
3          The minimum sentence for the offences which he had pleaded guilty to was 20 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.  In view of the circumstances and facts of his case I sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment for each of the two charges as well as 15 strokes of the cane for each charge.  I ordered the terms of imprisonment to be served concurrently.  The maximum number of strokes, however, is restricted to 24 by virtue of s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Ch 68.",2003-08-21 00:00:00,SG High Court

1          In the early hours of 10 July 2001 a taxi-driver, Abdul Aziz drove into the carpark at the Newton Hawker Centre.  He believed it was about 4.05am.  As he advanced towards the Automated-Teller Machine (‘ATM’) kiosk he saw three men running past his taxi towards the food stalls.  Moments later, a young Indian girl ran from the ATM kiosk and stopped his taxi.  She got in through the passenger side of the car and appeared distraught.  Abdul Aziz described her as ‘distressed and hysterical’.  She told him ‘Uncle, three boys raped me and they beat me’. Abdul Aziz testified that he could see that the girl was bloodied and injured.  The medical evidence showed that her injuries included abrasions to the head and face, as well as tenderness around the abdomen region.  The medical evidence also showed the presence of spermatozoa in her vaginal and urethral areas.  These evidence were given by Dr Goh Wei Ching, Dr Tay Seow Yian and also Dr Jasmine Heng, a forensic scientist.
 
2          While trying to calm the girl, Abdul Aziz also called the police.  Shortly after that he noted that the girl had calmed down slightly and he let her have his handphone which she used to call her then boyfriend Rajesh Kumar who worked as a waiter at the ‘Asoka Pub’.  The girl in question was the complainant in this case.  She is 22 years old and was known to her friends as ‘X’.  Rajesh Kumar testified that shortly after 4am he received a telephone call from X.  This was the one made with Abdul Aziz’s telephone.  He said that X told him in Tamil repeatedly that three men raped her.  Rajesh asked if she knew who they were.  She told him that one of them was ‘X’s boyfriend’.  Z was a friend of X and worked with her at the ""N"" pub as a waitress.  Z was a full-time waitress but X was a part-time waitress.  Z’s boyfriend was Samynath A/L Marimuthu, the second accused in this case.
3          Rajesh then spoke briefly with the taxi-driver because X appeared too distraught to even tell him where she was.  Rajesh, upon being told by Abdul Aziz that they were still at the Newton Hawker Centre, rushed there by taxi.  The police were already there when he arrived.  He asked X again if she knew who they were.  This time she said that it was the three men were among the group she was with at the ‘Asoka’ pub at 1.20am.  She told Rajesh that besides Samynath, one of the three wore a scarf (later ascertained at trial to be a bandanna) and the other wore a red-netted T-shirt.  These two were later ascertained to be Mark Kalaivanan and K. Balamurugan, the first and third accused respectively.  Mark is 24 years old, Samynath is 25 and Balamurugan is 26 years old.  At the material time, the first accused was in the Navy performing national service.  The third accused was a regular in the army.  Samynath was unemployed.
4          At this point, it is relevant to trace what X and her friends were doing on the night just before 10 July 2001.  X started her duty at ‘N’ on 9 July 2001 about 7pm.  At 12.45am, 10 July 2001 her friend and colleague, Z asked if she (X) would join her and some friends at the ‘Asoka’ pub (where Rajesh was working).  X agreed, pleased with the prospect of meeting Rajesh, with whom she had a minor misunderstanding earlier in the evening of 9 July 2001.  Z and X arrived at the ‘Asoka’ pub at 1.20am.  She was introduced to the second accused as Z’s boyfriend. The others in the group were the first and third accused, one J, S (who was the girlfriend of the first accused), and P.  This group including Z and X drank and danced while Rajesh was working.  At 2.30am when the pub was about to close, X told Rajesh that she was going home but he, probably still peeved by their earlier misunderstanding, ignored her.
5          X was subsequently persuaded by Z to join the group at the Newton Hawker Centre for supper.  When they arrived the group sat at two tables.  Z and X were together while the other six were at another table.  X and Z had an argument over the use of Z’s handphone.  X then borrowed the handphone from the second accused.  The evidence from the second accused was that this handphone belonged to his girlfriend Yogeswari.  A total of five calls were made from this handphone to Rajesh’s handphone between 3.02am and 4.27am.  X only managed to speak briefly to Rajesh once, and she was crying at that time so one of the accused took over the phone and spoke to Rajesh.  Over the next few calls, the accused persons told Rajesh a number of lies, saying, for instance, that X had left Newton Hawker Centre and gone home.  This particular and significant lie was told to Rajesh during the second call.
6          What happened at the Newton Hawker Centre was quite different.  X did not go home.  She was deceived into believing that Rajesh was on his way to take her home and that she was to wait for him at the ATM kiosk.  She followed the three accused to the kiosk.  The second accused took her there with the first and third accused just behind them.  Independent evidence from the rest of the group, including S, showed that the three accused left the group about the same time; but none of those witnesses suspected foul play and were, therefore, not paying full attention, resulting in some minor discrepancies in their account of the events.  The second accused took X behind the ATM kiosk and there he tried to hug her.  When she pushed him away she was punched.  She testified that she was assaulted on the head and face by two of the accused while a third covered her mouth.  Thereafter, the second accused, first accused and third accused took turns in that order to rape her.
7          She was wearing several layers of clothing.  For her top she had a brassiere and a blouse.  She wore a pair of shorts over her panties, and a pair of tights over her shorts, and finally a pair of pants.  Her pants were taken off her and was subsequently found nearby at the kiosk.  Forensic evidence showed that the second accused person’s semen was found on the pants.  The first accused’s semen was found in X’s vagina.  She testified that all three had penetrated her in vaginal intercourse.  The three accused had tried variously to impute that X was a wanton of loose morals, but I do not think that there was any reliable evidence to sustain that assertion.  I find her to be a reliable witness and accept her evidence.
8          After the sexual assault was over, X overheard the men talking as if they might harm her further.  In fright and fear she made her escape and rant to the car park.  The three accused were seen by Abdul Aziz running back towards the food stalls.  Abdul Aziz impressed me as a very reliable witness although under cross-examination, he did at one stage agree with Mr Mohan, counsel for the first accused, that he cannot be absolutely sure.  However, it is my distinct impression that he said this to avoid appearing that he was sure beyond a shadow of a doubt.  His evidence overall was that what he had heard and seen were reliably imprinted in his memory and he had accurately recalled them in testimony in court.  He testified that one of the three men wore a ‘red jersey with blue pants’ (fitting description of the third accused), another had a bandanna (fitting the description of the first accused), and the third, a greyish-black T-shirt and black pants (fitting the description of the second accused).  X stopped Abdul Aziz’s taxi and got in.  Abdul Aziz helped her call Rajesh as well as the police.
9          In the meantime, the friends of the three accused testified that the trio returned to their table about half an hour after leaving with X.  S noticed scratches on the face of the first accused and his T-shirt was dirtied.  He told her that he was chased ‘by someone’ and fell.  He declined to elaborate when asked. S noticed that the second accused was perspiring and looking exhausted.  P testified that when the three accused returned to their table she noticed that the first accused’s T-shirt was dirtied.  She also noticed that the third accused’s trousers was unzipped and she could see his underpants.
10        In his defence, the first accused said that the second accused had taken X to the ATM kiosk and left her there.  When he returned he told the first accused that X ‘was high’ and he had ‘romanced her’.  The first accused then wanted a piece of the action and so he followed the second accused back to the ATM (without the third accused).  He found X to be lying on the bench and he carried her to the back of the ATM.  Shortly after that he saw her masturbating the second accused. When she finished, he went to talk to her and the second accused left the place.  X then started to cuddle him and he was aroused.  They then had sexual intercourse but he claimed that she had consented because he had dated her twice before and on each occasion they had sexual intercourse too.  This assertion was denied by X and I believe her.
11        The second accused also claimed that X masturbated him but he did not have sex with her.  He explained that that was why his semen was found on her pants and not inside her.  He said that after that he walked back to the food stalls alone and did not know what the other two accused were doing.
12        The third accused said that he did not have any sexual contact with X but he admitted to hitting her because he was angry that she led his friends, the first and second accused to commit rape.  He claimed that he saw the first and second accused holding X down and raping her.  So, when they finished, he suggested that they hit her and knock her out – or ‘concuss her’ in his own words – so that they will have time to get away.  His evidence on the act of causing hurt, was contradictory and inconsistent with that of the first accused who said that he saw the third accused going behind the ATM kiosk to talk to X but soon heard her screaming and shouting obscenities at the third accused.  This infuriated him (the first accused) because the third accused was his childhood friend.  So that was why he and the third accused hit X.  Some blood stains were found on his underwear.
13        The evidence of all the three accused were inconsistent with the evidence of independent witnesses who included their friends, Z, S, J and P, and also Rajesh and Abdul Aziz, as well as the medical and forensic evidence.  More significantly, they contradicted each other so fundamentally that I have no doubt that their versions were not true.  Furthermore, none of them had presented their defence or anything close to that in any of their previous statements to the police, and that included the cautioned statement under s 122(6).  Finally, the first and third accused accepted their friends’ testimonies that once at the food stalls, and once in the police van these two accused had spoken in Tamil to their friends, asking them not to tell the police that they (the accused) had left the tables at any time.  This conduct was clearly incriminating in nature.
14        In the closing submissions, Mr Mohan on behalf of the first accused, and Mr Gurdaib Singh, counsel for the second accused pointed out a number of inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.  I do not think that those discrepancies rendered their evidence unreliable.  For example, whether the three accused left their tables at the same time or whether the second accused went first followed by the first and third accused seems to me, in the circumstances, to be a difference in perception.  It was likely that the second accused was either a few metres ahead of the other two, or in terms of time, the other two left a minute or less after him, but it may appear to some that the second accused left first, followed by the other two, and by others as all three leaving about the same time.  I adopted the same approach in respect of the evidence of the three accused.  Where they are minor and do not appear to be material, I do not hold them against the accused.  The major contradictions, however, cannot be ignored.  For example, two accused said that X only masturbated the second accused but the third accused said he saw the second accused having sexual intercourse with her.  The different versions as to why the first and third accused hit X after the rape were also major discrepancies.  The first accused also contradicted himself in court when he said that he had dated X twice before, but in his statement to the police he said he did not know her.  His explanation that he was then afraid to tell the truth did not convince me.
15        I am satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case on all the charges against the three accused, and the defence did not raise any reasonable doubt in my mind and, accordingly, I found all three accused guilty as charged and convicted them.  There was little by way of mitigation save that none of the three accused had committed any sexual offences previously, and that although they each faced three charges, all the offences concerned the same incident.  In respect of the two abetment charges that each of them faced, they could be amalgamated into one.  The decision lies with the prosecution, but in sentencing the accused, I think that the principle of a global or overall view of the punishment is relevant and appropriate.  Further, although hurt was caused, the injuries suffered were not very severe.  In the circumstances, I sentenced each accused to a total of 16 years imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.",2003-08-11 00:00:00,SG High Court

1            Racehorse owners do not train their horses themselves.  They buy them and send them to trainers who look after them and prepare them for racing.  If the horses do not perform to expectation there may be unhappiness.
 
2.         In this case, the plaintiffs are the horse owners and the defendants the trainers.  The first plaintiff Gary Desker has been in horse racing since 1993.  He owns horses with other persons, and he manages a stable with the assistance of his wife, the second plaintiff.
 
3.         The second defendant Malcolm Thwaites, a leading horse trainer in Singapore, offers his services through his company, the first defendant.  Leigh McKenzie is his racing manager.
 
4.         In July 2000 the plaintiffs imported three horses namely Classic Sport, Supreme Gold and Crypto Charge from the United States, and placed them with the defendants.  They bought another horse Palace Star the following month which was also placed with the defendants after it was purchased.  This horse was checked by Malcolm Thwaites before it was bought.
 
5.         The horses are no longer with the defendants.  Palace Star and Supreme Gold were put down and Classic Sport and Crypto Charge were taken out of the defendants’ stables and transferred to another trainer, Stephen Gray.
 
6.         The plaintiffs have instituted these proceedings against the defendants.  They identify the issues in their claim as
 
(i)         Whether Malcolm Thwaites gave negligent advice which lead to the purchase of Palace Star.
 
(ii)        Whether the defendants failed to provide proper and adequate treatment for Palace Star, Classic Sport and Supreme Gold.
 
(iii)       Whether the defendants were negligent in continuing with the training of the horses, Classic Sport, Palace Star and Supreme Gold and racing them, without providing treatment for the injuries they carried.
 
(iv)       Whether the defendants in mistakenly sending Palace Star to Ipoh, converted the horse.
 
(v)        Whether the plaintiffs had agreed that Palace Star should remain in Ipoh under K P Hoy as trainer.
 
(vi)       Whether the plaintiffs gave instructions and authority to the defendants to put down Palace Star in Ipoh.
 
Palace Star
 
7.         Richard Ang, the owner of Palace Star offered it to Gary Desker.  Richard Ang told him it needed an injection to the knee.
[1]
  Gary Desker was interested and intended to send it to trainer Charles Leck if he bought it.  When he broached the subject with Leck, he was advised that the horse should be sent to a veterinary surgeon for a check-up before any commitment was made.
[2]
 
8.         Before he could arrange for a veterinary examination, he received a telephone call from Malcolm Thwaites, who was at Richard Ang’s stable.  Gary Desker recounted that “(h)e advised me that the horse was a good horse and all that was needed was an injection to the knee.  He confirmed that the asking price of Richard Ang (at S$45,000) was reasonable.  I did ask Malcolm Thwaites whether I needed to send the horse to the vet for a report.  He represented that he had inspected the horse and there was no need to send it to a vet.”
[3]
  He bought Palace Star and sent it to the defendants for training on 30 August 2000.
 
9.         The plaintiffs claimed that “but for the representations made by the 1
st
 Defendants on behalf of the 2
nd
 Defendants 
(sic)
 that Palace Star was a suitable horse for racing, the Plaintiffs would not have purchased it without extensive medical tests being performed on it as is the practice.”
[4]
 
10.       In March 2001 Malcolm Thwaites informed Gary Desker that Palace Star required surgery on its fore legs.  The operation was undertaken by Dr Ian Fulton on 4 April.  Gary Desker recalled that “(a)fter the operation, I had a meeting with Ian, Leigh McKenzie together with the 2
nd
 Plaintiff.  At that meeting, I was advised by Mr Fulton that when he performed the surgery, he observed that the horse’s fore legs (which he operated on) had wear and tear of an 8-year old horse.”
[5]
 
11.            Malcolm Thwaites also advised him that Dr Fulton would return in two to three months to review the horse’s condition.  However, in early June he learnt from Leigh McKenzie that the defendants had sent Palace Star to Ipoh by mistake, and that a trainer had done a gallop on the horse.
[6]
 
12.       He and his wife met Malcolm Thwaites and Leigh McKenzie at the Orchard Hotel to discuss the matter.  Malcolm Thwaites apologised for the error and offered to a refund on the expenses incurred on Palace Star from April to June 2001 to pay the operation costs.  Malcolm Thwaites also asked Gary Desker if he wanted Palace Star back in Singapore but he could not decide without knowing the horse’s condition.  Malcolm Thwaites promised to keep him informed, but did not follow up on that.  He did not hear further about Palace Star until he was informed by the Malayan Racing Association (“MRA”) in February 2002 that it would be deleted as it was not raced for more than a year.
 
13.            Malcolm Thwaites’ evidence was that “(s)ometime on or about August 2000, the 1
st
 Plaintiff approached me and told me that he was considering purchasing a horse known as “Palace Star” which he told me had some joint problems.  He asked me whether “Palace Star” was suitable for racing and training.  I was not asked to give my opinion on the said horse’s medical condition.”
[7]
 
14.       He went to Richard Ang’s stable where he examined the horse.  He did not detect any injuries although the joints did not look normal.  He told Gary Desker that
 
“Palace Star” was “worth taking a chance on.”  Even at this stage, I qualified my comments and made it clear that any purchase of “Palace Star” would be a gamble on the Plaintiffs’ part.  At this point in time, Palace Star was handicapped at top weight, namely 59 kg and because of its small frame, both of these factors combined with its DJD [degenerative joint disorder] meant that the horse already had three (3) disadvantages in racing.
[8]
 
15.       The plaintiffs’ pleaded case that Malcolm Thwaites was asked whether Palace Star was a suitable horse for racing raised interesting questions.  What does “suitable for racing” mean?  Is a positive answer equivalent to an examination by a veterinary surgeon?  Taking the second question first, Gary Desker was advised by Charles Leck to send the horse for inspection by a veterinary surgeon before committing himself on the purchase.  He knew Malcolm Thwaites is a trainer, not a veterinary surgeon.   When he sought his view on Palace Star’s suitability for racing, Gary Desker cannot expect to get the equivalent of a veterinary report.
 
16.            Malcolm Thwaites’ explanation that
 
I understood the 1
st
 Plaintiffs request to mean that he was seeking my expert opinion on the winning potential of “Palace Star” based on my assessment of 
inter alia
 the race horse’s track record and temperament.  This opinion was to be given in my capacity as a professional race horse trainer based on my knowledge and experience from my many years of participation in horse racing and dealing with race horses.
[9]
 
was reasonable.  He could not have considered himself qualified to give an opinion on a horse’s medical condition when he would consult the veterinary surgeons of the Singapore Turf Club and foreign veterinary surgeons like Dr Fulton when there were problems with the horses in his care.
 
17.       Gary Desker acknowledged that he was told that the horse’s knee needed treatment by injection.
[10]
 
The previous owner Richard Ang described the horse to be in perfectly fine condition “save for some small bruises and minor injuries which are common for race horses” and “its right fore fetlock was swollen due to strain.”
[11]
 
18.       When Palace Star was brought to the defendants in late August 2000 it was examined again.  No swelling, pain or heat nor limp was detected.
[12]
  The horse was trained and raced on six occasions between 28 October 2000 and 3 February 2001.  It performed creditably, coming second four times.
 
19.            However in mid-February 2001, it became lame from joint problems.
[13]
  Dr Fulton was engaged to carry out an operation on it.  Dr Fulton specialises in horses and has considerable experience in treating them.  He also lectures and writes on the subject.  Although his practice is in Australia, he has an arrangement with the defendants to make regular visits to their stables.
 
20.       He operated on the front fetlock joints of Palace Star on 4 April 2001.  He found ulcerations and erosions in the left fetlock indicative of severe advanced degenerative joint disease.  These injuries would have existed four to eight weeks before the surgery
[14]
 
but severe degenerative joint disease would have developed less than six months prior to the operation.
[15]
  He noted in his surgery report that retirement of the horse was a real prospect because of the advanced degenerative bone disease in the left fetlock.  He proposed two alternatives to retirement, first, to give the horse total rest for four months before undertaking a training program, and second, to treat it for six weeks, then reassess the lameness and pain in the fetlock after six to eight weeks.
 
21.       By the plaintiffs’ case, Malcolm Thwaites had informed Gary Desker that the horse needed an injection.  The plaintiffs had no basis to dispense with a veterinary report because of anything that Malcolm Thwaites said because he was not a veterinary surgeon and did not give veterinary advice.  Malcolm Thwaites’ advice was that Palace Star was suitable for racing, and events vindicated him.  The horse raced with some success and did not become lame until six months after it was purchased.
 
22.       The plaintiffs also alleged that the horse’s condition was caused by negligent handling and training.  This complaint was not supported by any evidence.  Counsel was left to speculate that “(f)or Palace Star to have entered into these races, the hard training sessions would have been carried out.  This would have severely aggravated the joint injuries.  There is no other explanation.  Certainly, the Defendants have offered none except to say that race horses being what they are, injuries should be expected as part and parcel of their normal misfortune.”
[16]
 
23.       The horse was not raced again after the operation.  It left the defendants’ stables and was sent to Ipoh to the stables of K P Hoy.  The circumstances were disputed by the parties.  The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs gave instructions for that to be done, then countermanded them when the horse was in quarantine in preparation for its journey to Ipoh.   Through a mistake on the defendants’ part, the horse was not taken out of quarantine and arrived in K P Hoy’s stables in Ipoh on 16 June.  They did not realise the mistake till Palace Star had been in K P Hoy’s custody for 10 days when K P Hoy informed Leigh McKenzie that the horse had gone lame.
 
24.       The plaintiffs’ case was that there was never any instruction to send the horse to Ipoh.  Gary Desker was shocked when Leigh McKenzie told him that the horse had been sent there by mistake and that it had been put through a gallop.
 
25.       The parties met at the Orchard Hotel in late June to decide what was to be done.  The second plaintiff recounted that “(a)t that meeting, Malcolm Thwaites apologised for the mistake and accepted responsibility.  He offered to make amends by refunding the costs of the surgery and the training fees for April to June 2001.  He also offered to bear all expenses for the horse in Ipoh.”
[17]
 
26.       The first and second plaintiffs discussed the offer with the other co-owners before accepting the offer.  The parties’ accounts of the events after the meeting differed.  Gary Desker claimed that Malcolm Thwaites promised to check on the condition of Palace Star and revert to him
[18]
 
but did not do that.  He heard nothing until he was notified by the MRA in February 2002 that the horse would be deleted (the horse was already put down by this time.)
 
27.       Leigh McKenzie deposed that the plaintiffs instructed him after the meeting to obtain a veterinary report.  The horse was then examined by Dr Alistair Murdoch of the Perak Turf Club who prepared a report dated 4 July 2001 which noted lameness of the left foreleg and recommended further surgery on the left fetlock and gave warning of “a reduced prognosis for future racing.”  It was faxed by K P Hoy to the defendants and Leigh McKenzie in turn sent it to the plaintiffs.  Leigh McKenzie then received instructions from the second plaintiff that the plaintiffs did not intend to race Palace Star any further and that it was to be put down.
[19]
 
28.       The defendants did not keep records of K P Hoy’s transmission of the report to them in July 2001, or their transmission of it to the plaintiffs.  They also did not confirm in writing the plaintiffs’ instructions to put the horse down.  One would expect them to be more careful after the blunder of despatching it to Ipoh.
 
29.            However Leigh McKenzie’s account of the events was corroborated by K P Hoy.  He gave evidence that Leigh McKenzie had instructed him to get the horse examined, and had subsequently informed him that the owners wanted the horse deleted.
 
30.       Gary Desker’s version of the events raised some doubts.  When he was told in late June that his horse had been taken to Ipoh by mistake, he was understandably surprised and annoyed, and was only placated by the defendants’ offer to waive their fees and bear the operation costs.  But he was still concerned about the horse, and he said Malcolm Thwaites promised to keep him informed.  Yet he did nothing when he did not hear from him.  A reasonable owner would have asked about his horse, but he was apparently content to be kept in the dark.  Why did he not ask Malcolm Thwaites or Leigh McKenzie about the horse?  The plaintiffs had not forgotten about it.  In October 2001 the second plaintiff called the MRA and was informed there was a transfer form signed by Malcolm Thwaites.
 
31.       If the plaintiffs were not kept informed about the horse by the defendants, it would be natural for them to be furious when they got the information from the MRA.  It would have been intolerable for the horse to be sent to Ipoh by mistake, then for Malcolm Thwaites to renege on his promise to keep them updated on the horse, then to learn that he had executed a transfer form, and the horse was facing deletion.  But they never complained or demanded an explanation.
 
32.       There were questions about both parties’ accounts of these events.  The defendants’ repeated failure to keep proper records reflected poorly on them and their operations, but the plaintiffs’ inaction and silence was unbelievable.  The reasonable inference is that they were in communication with the defendants as the latter alleged.
 
33.       On these findings, there was a conversion of the horse when it was sent to Ipoh up to the time of the plaintiffs’ instructions that Palace Star was to remain in Ipoh pending their further decision.  There was no conversion after that time because the plaintiffs had instructed that they did not want the horse any more after receiving Dr Murdoch’s report.
 
34.       The defendants pleaded that the plaintiffs cannot sue for conversion because the matter “was fully and finally settled between the Plaintiffs and the 1
st
 Defendants and/or this was in full accord and satisfaction between the Plaintiffs and the 1
st
 Defendants.”
[20]
 
35.       They contended that
 
The 1
st
 Plaintiff and the 2
nd
 Plaintiff admitted on the stand that that the Plaintiffs accepted the 1
st
 Defendant’s offered compensation in respect of ‘Palace Star’ being sent to Malaysia and all consequences flowing from the same, the benefit of which payment credit and refund they enjoyed;
 
This was corroborated by the oral evidence of the 2
nd
 Defendant and Leigh.
[21]
 
36.       There was an agreement.  But was that in full and final settlement of the matters discussed?  Malcolm Thwaites’ account of the meeting was that
 
… I proposed to the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Plaintiffs that the matter be resolved as follows: -
 
a) the 1
st
 Defendant was to pay for expenses pertaining to the various surgeries performed in Singapore by Dr Fulton, including the surgeries performed before ‘Palace Star’ was transported to Malaysia;
 
b) the 1
st
 Defendant was to pay for the expenses pertaining to the transportation of ‘Palace Star’ to Malaysia and its expenses in Malaysia; and
 
c) the 1
st
 Defendant was prepared to credit to the Plaintiffs the training fees paid by the Plaintiffs to the 1
st
 Defendant for ‘Palace Star’ for the months of April and May and to waive the training fees for ‘Palace Star’ for the month of June.
 
Speaking on behalf of the 1
st
 Defendant, I also offered to bring ‘Palace Star’ back to Singapore at the 1
st
 Defendant’s expense, but the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Plaintiffs refused stating that they did not want the horse to be brought back to Singapore.  They said that they would consider the 1
st
 Defendant’s offer and revert accordingly.  The meeting ended on good terms and 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Plaintiffs said that whatever happened, they wished to put their difference behind them.
 
Some two (2) days later or so, the 2
nd
 Plaintiff called Leigh and said the Plaintiffs had decided to accept the 1
st
 Defendant’s offer.  During the same telephone conversation, she again confirmed that ‘Palace Star’ was not to be brought back to Singapore.
[22]
 
37.       Leigh McKenzie deposed that
 
(T)he 2
nd
 Defendant proposed that in full and final settlement of any claims the Plaintiffs may have against the 1
st
 Defendant in this matter (which liability is not admitted) and in the interests of maintaining the relationship between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants, the 1
st
 Defendant was prepared to credit to the Plaintiffs the training fees paid by the Plaintiffs to the 1
st
 Defendant for ‘Palace Star’ for the months of April and May and to waive the training fees for ‘Palace Star’ for the month of June.  In addition, the 1
st
 Defendant was prepared to bear the costs of inter alia the various fees and expenses connected with the sending of ‘Palace Star’ to Malaysia as well as the costs pertaining to the surgery and treatment of ‘Palace Star’ before it left Singapore.  The 2
nd
 Defendant even offered to return the race horse to Singapore at his own cost.
 
The 1
st
 and 2
nd
 Plaintiffs said at the meeting that they would consider the matter.  On the very next day, the 2
nd
 Plaintiff called me on the telephone and informed me that the Plaintiffs had decided to accept the 1
st
 Defendant’s proposal.  The 2
nd
 Plaintiff used words to the effect of “lets put the past behind us and go on and look forward to the future.”
[23]
 
38.       By both accounts, the parties met upon realising that the horse was in Ipoh to decide what was to be done.  The defendants accepted responsibility and offered to refund their charges, pay the operation expenses and to bring the horse back to Singapore.  This was a damage-control exercise to pacify the plaintiffs.  There was nothing in Malcolm Thwaites’ and Leigh McKenzie’s affidavits or their evidence in court which showed that the acceptance of the offer extinguished the defendants’ liabilities.  They said that the plaintiffs were concerned over the horse’s condition, and wanted it to be sent for examination before making a final decision.  Clearly the plaintiffs did not waive their rights when they accepted the offers in those circumstances.
 
39.            Consequently, that defence fails.  However, for the subsequent period when the horse remained in Ipoh with the plaintiffs’ knowledge and on their instructions for it to remain in Ipoh pending further examination, the claim for conversion cannot stand.  Likewise, there can be no conversion when the horse was deleted and put down on their instruction.
 
Supreme Gold
 
40.       The plaintiffs’ case was that Supreme Gold had its racing career ended by the negligent training and upkeep of the defendants
[24]
 
and was eventually put down on 28 August 2001.   Supreme Gold was unraced when it was sent to the defendants’ stables.  While it was there it was raced three times between 3 February and 25 May with poor results.
 
41.            Malcolm Thwaites deposed that Supreme Gold was very immature when it went into his possession, and he took special care that it was given gentle training over a longer period than the usual time.
[25]
  Despite the care, he noticed in mid-March 2001 that there were lumps at the horse’s front fetlock joints, and he sent it for examination by veterinary surgeon Dr Martin Lenz of the Singapore Turf Club.  Dr Lenz found mild degenerative changes in the fore fetlocks, and advised treatment with intra-articular medication for the joint problem.
 
42.            Malcolm Thwaites advised Gary Desker that Supreme Gold was not good enough to race in Singapore and suggested that it be sent to Malaysia.  Gary Desker accepted the suggestion and instructed that it be sent to trainer K L Chong in Ipoh.
 
43.       K L Chong sent Supreme Gold to be examined by Dr Murdoch in Ipoh.  Dr Murdoch found early development of osteophytes in both front fetlocks.  He advised that it was a common injury of race horses in the MRA circuit and cautioned that the injury usually progresses to eventual pain and lameness.  K L Chong raced the horse twice in August.  It did not perform, and was eventually put down.
 
44.       Gary Desker deposed that “I would have accepted if the horse was simply not good enough.  But Malcolm Thwaites clearly ran the horse to its death, in training and racing.”
[26]
 
45.       In the closing submissions counsel argued that
 
These adverse conditions of Supreme Gold were never disclosed by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs.  There was a complete absence of advice from the Defendants except that Supreme Gold was not good enough to compete in Singapore races.
 
It is clearly probable that these progressive injuries were already afflicting Supreme Gold when it was trained by the Defendants, before it was sent to Ipoh.  It could not have happened overnight whilst in K L Chong’s custody.  Instead, K L Chong did not put the horse into any training but at once sent it to Alistair Murdoch for the examination.  It is conclusive evidence that the injuries were sustained and existing while Supreme Gold was in the Defendants’ custody.
[27]
 
46.       K L Chong, Dr Lenz and Dr Murdoch were not called as witnesses.  There was no one to lend substance to Gary Desker’s complaint.  The defendants obtained Dr Fulton’s views and the two veterinary reports.  Dr Fulton examined the radiographs Dr Lenz took of Supreme Gold and was of the opinion that the light training Supreme Gold received in the defendants’ care did not cause the rapid deterioration of the joints, and that the osteophytes Dr Murdoch found is a common injury which is not caused by exercise.
[28]
  His views were not challenged in cross-examination.  The plaintiffs also did not call any veterinary surgeon to contradict Dr Fulton.
 
47.            Although Supreme Gold carried injuries when it was examined by Dr Lenz and Dr Murdoch, there was no link between the injuries and the treatment it received at the defendants’ stables.  There was no evidence that the injuries were the result of maltreatment, or that they could be avoided or arrested if the horse had received proper treatment in the defendants’ stables.
 
Classic Sport
 
48.       Classic Sport performed well initially under the defendants’ care, but the good performances stopped after May 2001.
 
49.       The defendants arranged for it to be examined by Dr Fulton on 10 July.  Dr Fulton put up a report that
 
Clinical examination revealed a slightly distended right fore flexor tendon sheath that produced a mild pain reaction when the fetlock region was flexed.  Palpation of the flexor tendon demonstrated a small withdrawal reflex.  A recommendation for ultrasonographic examination was made.
 
The ultrasound exam demonstrated the presence of a tenosynovitis of the right fore flexor tendon sheath.  Type 1 lesions in the superficial flexor tendon proximal to the tendon sheath and also in the medial branch below the fetlock were also identified.  The presence of type 1 lesions in the flexor tendon of thoroughbred race horses is referred to as tendonitis.  Interestingly similar lesions were noted in the left for superficial flexor tendon, despite the absence of any pain sensation evident on palpation.
 
Due to the absence of significant lesions in the tendon within the tendon sheath, I recommended that long acting cortisone be injected into the sheath as there would be an immediate rest from training.  The cortisone was recommended to reduce the tenosynovitis present.  I recommended a 5-6 week break from training and then to resume as long as the tendon sheath had returned to normal and there was no evidence of discomfort during palpation.  Type 1 tendonitis in racing horses can be transitory and does not require the prolonged rest associated with more advanced tendon pathology.  Provided the affected area settles so there is no heat, pain or swelling I believe it is reasonable to resume training and continue monitoring the region.
[29]
 
50.            According to Malcolm Thwaites, Dr Fulton meant that Classic Sport was to be rested from 
full training
 for five to six weeks, and he rested it for four weeks, followed by two weeks light trotting.
[30]
  Dr Fulton confirmed that Malcolm Thwaites had understood his recommendations correctly.
[31]
 
The second scan was not carried out as the horse was transferred to Stephen Gray about the time it was to be done.
 
51.       Gary Desker was not satisfied with the horse’s progress, and arranged for it to be taken out from the defendants’ stables with Crypto Charge and transferred to trainer Stephen Gray.
 
52.       When Stephen Gray received the horse he saw a bump on the tendon of the right foreleg
[32]
 
and he sent it to be examined by veterinary surgeon Dr Brian Stewart of the Singapore Turf Club on 3 September.  Dr Stewart performed an ultrasound examination of the tendon and reported
 
I found the tendon had a hypoechoic (damaged) area of about 20% of the cross sectional area of the mid tendon region.
 
The damaged area showed significant improvement in the sonographic quality of healing from the previous scan in July.
 
To encourage tendon fibre alignment and strengthening, it was recommended that light road work with frequent monitoring of the injury be commenced.
 
The prognosis for future racing after a tendon injury is always guarded to poor.
[33]
 
53.       The plaintiffs pleaded that
 
i. This racehorse was diagnosed with a tendon injury caused by a strain to its fetlock region on 10.7.01.  The 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 4
th
 Plaintiffs aver and will contend that injuries of this kind mandate total rest for at least 3 to 4 months, followed by a further check by a vet and x-rayed before training is resumed.
 
… …
 
iii. In the alternative, which the 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 4
th
 Plaintiffs do not admit, the Defendants contend that this racehorse resumed training after 1 month’s rest in August.  There was no further check by a vet.  No x-ray was taken.  The 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 4
th
 Plaintiffs aver and will contend that even if this is true, this constitutes a breach of the Defendants’ contractual obligations to them.
 
iv. The 1
st
, 2
nd
 and 4
th
 Plaintiffs will contend that as a result of this breach, this racehorse did not completely heal.  As a direct result of the Defendants’ breach, on 3.9.01 the right fore superficial digital flexor tendon of this horse was diagnosed by Dr Brian Stewart as having a hypochoic area of about 20% of the cross sectional area of the mid tendon area.  Its prognosis of future racing was found to be ‘guarded to poor’.
[34]
 
54.            Stephen Gray was a witness for the plaintiffs.  He discovered a bump which he also described as a thickening of the tendon on Classic Sport’s right fore leg when he received the horse, and sent it to Dr Stewart.
 
55.       From his recollection the horse was rested for five to six months before it was put on light work.  After Classic Sport recovered, it raced again, but performed badly as it was out of form.  He did not consider it to have a serious tendon injury because it was reparable, and he could not say that Classic Sport’s failure was due to the tendon injury.
 
56.       No evidence was led to substantiate the assertion that the horse should have been given total rest for three to four months and be re-assessed by a veterinary surgeon before training is resumed.  The plaintiffs did not call anyone knowledgeable in the treatment or training of horses to say that the horse should have been rested for at least three months.  The only reference to a three to four month rest period was made by Gary Desker when he informed Malcolm Thwaites that two other horses owned by the plaintiffs recovered fully after being rested for those periods.
[35]
 
57.            Likewise, the plaintiffs did not produce anything to contradict Malcolm Thwaites’ evidence that Classic Sport was rested for four weeks, and no informed opinion was offered that four weeks’ rest was inappropriate or inadequate.
 
58.       No one has stated that Classic Sport should have been rested for at least three months or that one months’ rest was insufficient.  I doubt that Gary Desker was asserting that because two other horses were rested three to four months, Classic Sport should be rested for three months.  If he was, he was doing it with no proper basis.
 
59.       The plaintiffs have not made out the case that Classic Sport should have been rested for a minimum of three months or that the four weeks rest it was given delayed or prevented its recovery.
 
The counter-claim
 
60.       When the plaintiffs withdrew Classic Sport and Crypto Charge from the defendants’ stables, another dispute arose.
 
61.       The plaintiffs wanted to transfer the horses to Stephen Gray immediately.  The defendants insisted that if they wanted that they have to pay one month’s training fees in lieu of notice.  The monthly training fees for each horse was $2,200.  The plaintiffs contended that no such payments were due.
 
62.       The defendants pleaded that
 
The mutually agreed terms and conditions are inter alia, as follows:
 
… …
 
Save where expressly provided otherwise, the agreement between the Plaintiffs and the 1
st
 Defendant would be governed by the recommended general terms and conditions between racehorse trainers and owners as issued by the Association of Racehorse Trainers (Singapore) (“ARTS”).
[36]
 
ARTS’ Terms and Conditions of Training (“the ARTS’ Conditions”) provide for one month’s payment in lieu of notice.  The plaintiffs denied any such agreement.
 
63.       In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief Malcolm Thwaites went further and deposed that
 
13. In any case, I aver and verily believe that it is implied by custom and practice that unless specifically excluded or varied, all contracts between race horse owners and race horse trainers in Singapore would be governed by the recommended general terms and conditions between racehorse trainers and owners issued by ARTS.
 
14. I further aver and verily believe that it is implied by custom and practice that unless specifically excluded or varied, all contracts between race horse owners and race horse trainers in Singapore would include the various terms set out in the recommended general terms and conditions between racehorse trainers and owners issued by ARTS.
 
… …
 
16. Further, I aver that it is a clear and common practise that race horse owners who intend to terminate their contracts with race horse trainers must give the race horse trainer at least one (1) month’s notice, failing which one (1) month’s basic training fee in respect of the horse being withdrawn from the race horse trainer’s care, training and management in question is due and payable to the race horse trainer in lieu of notice.”
[37]
 
64.       It was noteworthy that Malcolm Thwaites did not say in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the plaintiffs had expressly agreed that there shall be payment in lieu of notice, or that the ARTS’ conditions were to apply.
 
65.       When questioned in court, Malcolm Thwaites said he had mentioned to Gary Desker that one month’ payment in lieu of notice was payable, but not with reference to the ARTS’ conditions.
[38]
  This was inconsistent with the pleaded counter-claim that the ARTS’ conditions were agreed to, and with the affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the term was incorporated by custom and practice.
 
66.       The defendants stated in the closing submissions that
 
… it was an express term of the contract between the Plaintiffs and the 1
st
 Defendant that should the Plaintiffs wish to remove their horses from the 1
st
 Defendant’s stables, the Plaintiffs are obliged to give the 1
st
 Defendant at least one (1) month’s notice of their intention so to do, failing which the Plaintiffs are obliged to pay one (1) month’s training fees for each horse they intend to move out of the 1
st
 Defendant’s stables.
 
…
 
Further and/or in the alternative, it is submitted that it is an implied term of the contract that the trainer must be given one (1) month’s notice or be paid one (1) month’s training fees in lieu of notice.
 
and that
 
Insofar as implied terms are concerned, the law will imply terms into a contract on several grounds, inter alia: -
 
a) A term will be implied into a contract if it is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract; and/or
 
b) A term will be implied in a contract if it is so obviously a stipulation in the agreement that the parties must have intended it to form part of their contract.
[39]
 
It was noteworthy that no reliance was made on Malcolm Thwaites’ reference to custom and practice.
 
67.       While the plaintiffs maintained throughout that there was no agreement the defendants alleged variously that
 
(i)         the agreement was governed by the ARTS’ conditions,
 
(ii)        the ARTS’ conditions applied by custom and practice,
 
(iii)       the ARTS’ conditions are implied to give business efficacy to the contract.
 
68.       The lack of consistency did not help on the defendants’ case.  The first ground cannot hold because the ARTS is a trainers’ association.   It has no control over horse owners and cannot limit or impose terms into the training agreements they enter into.  ARTS can put up standard conditions for training agreements that it considers to be fair to trainers and owners.  ARTS and its members can recommend or require that those conditions be incorporated into the agreement with an owner.  If the owner agrees, that shall form part of the training agreement.  But if that is not recommended, or if the owner does not agree, he is not bound by the conditions.  As Malcolm Thwaites had not stated in evidence that Gary Desker or the plaintiffs agreed to the ARTS’ conditions, they do not apply.
 
69.       The defendants were not entitled to rely on custom and practice to invoke the ARTS’ conditions because this was not their pleaded case.  They pleaded that the parties had agreed that the terms and conditions were to apply to the training agreement.  They did not plead that independently of the alleged mutual agreement, the conditions applied through custom or practice.
 
70.       Even if they had, they still fail.  They adduced evidence from Bernard Ang, president of ARTS on the background to the ARTS’ conditions.  He explained that the conditions were compiled in July 2002, from the conditions used in practice, adding that “ARTS was formed in November 1996.  Before then there was no association, no body to represent trainers in Singapore.  Trainers based in Singapore had their own sets of rules for contracts with owners and that by and large they would have similar terms and conditions, including that for payment in lieu of notice.”
[40]
  That implied that it was not the universal practice of all trainers.  He did not explain whether any effort was made by him or ARTS to ascertain how prevalent the practice was to impose such a condition.
 
71.       His evidence revealed that the ARTS' conditions were not in existence when the training agreements between the plaintiffs and the defendants were made.  Furthermore the practice from which they were drawn was not accepted by all trainers and owners, and cannot be incorporated into the agreement by custom and practice.
 
72.       The alternative claim that the condition should be implied on the ground of business efficacy was also without basis.  It is not unbusiness-like for a trainer not to insist on payment in lieu of notice; that may persuade more owners to sign on with him.  And if a payment must be imposed for business efficacy, why one month’s payment?  Why not a fortnight’s, or two months’?
 
Conclusion
73.       The defendants had converted Palace Star when they sent it to Ipoh till the time when the plaintiffs decided that it was to remain there pending a further examination.  The plaintiffs are to receive damages for this period of conversion to be assessed by the Registrar.  They are also to get costs for this part of their claim.  The Registrar shall determine after the assessment whether these costs are to be taxed on the High Court, District Court or Magistrate’s Court scale.  The costs of the assessment are also to be decided by the Registrar.  The rest of the plaintiffs’ action is dismissed with costs.
74.       The defendants’ counterclaim is dismissed, with costs to be taxed on the Magistrate’s Court scale.

  – 
Offences
  – 
Various charges of theft, cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust and giving false statements/information.
 
The charges
1          This is an appeal against sentence by the Accused.  The Accused pleaded before me to 15 charges, namely:
a. 1 charge of theft in dewelling under s 380 PC (DAC 59076/02)
b. 5 charges of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 PC (DAC 60484/02, 60487/02, 60489/02, 60491/02 and DAC 1762/2000)
c. 1 charge of criminal breach of trust under s 406 PC (DAC 60486/02)
d. 5 charges of giving false statements under s 182 Penal Code (DAC 62072/02, DAC 62071/02, DAC 62072/02, DAC 62073/02 and DAC 62074/02)
e. 1 charge of giving false information under s 28(a) PCA (DAC 62238/02)
f. 1 charge of theft under s 379 Penal Code (DAC 38713/99) and
g. 1 charge of cheating under s 420 Penal Code (DAC 1764/00)
2          Upon her conviction on the 15 proceeded charges, she admitted to the offences in another 111 similar charges and consented to these charges to be taken in consideration for the purpose of sentencing.  She was sentenced to 10 years’ corrective training.
The facts
3          The Accused admitted without qualification to the Statement of Facts (
Exhibit C
).
4          In respect of DAC 59076/2002, the Accused went over to the complainants’ residence in late August 2002 to discuss the complainants’ request to transfer her (the latter’s) maid.  While the complainant was looking for the required documents, the Accused stole a blank cheque number 857663 from complainants’ cheque book that was left on the table in the living room.
5          In respect of DAC 60484/02, DAC 60487/02, DAC 60488/02, DAC 60491/02 and DAC 1762/2000, the Accused stole blank cheques from the various complainants and forged their signatures on the cheque and deposited the cheque into various bank accounts.  She then withdrew the respective amounts and use the monies for her own use or to pay her own debts.  The details of the particulars of these 5 offences are shown in the table below:

6          With regard to DAC 60486/02, the Accused had on 29 April 2000 dishonestly misappropriated a cash cheque 796918 for $5000 for her own use.   The cheque was entrusted to her by Lau Poh Lam as payment for the bank guarantee for the Indonesian maid that the said Lau Poh Lam had wanted to employ.

At that time, the Accused had been placed on the Police “wanted list” for having absconded from Court.  The particulars of the incidents are listed below:

8          In respect of DAC 62238/02, Accused made a false statement on 15 January 1998 to CPIB officer SSI Wong Pong Yen stating that she was instructed by Robin Cheah, the Managing Director of Robin Employment Agency, on 3 occasions to hand over passports and visas in an envelope to Lim Chye Seng of Singapore Immigration and Registration for extension of visit passes, which information she knew was false.
9          With regard to DAC 38713/99, the Accused stole on 9 September 1999 a blank Standard Chartered Bank cheque 132237 from Lim Chee Khoon when she visited the later’s residence to collect the employment fees of Lim’s maid.
10        In respect of DAC 1764/00, Accused between 15 February and 18 February 1999, cheated one Ms Trude Muhlberger by inducing her to hand over two Citibank cash cheque numbers 629712 and 629714 amounting to $715 by falsely representing that they were for payments to her maid agency for the transfer fee.  She used the monies to settle her debts.
Antecedents and mitigation
11        The Accused admitted that she was previously convicted on 2 occasions for similar offences.  In 1984, she was convicted of theft in dwelling and was sentenced to 1 day imprisonment and a fine of $1,000.  In 1996, she was convicted of 4 counts of cheating under s 420 Penal Code and 1 count of forgery for the purpose of cheating under s 468 Penal Code with 24 similar charges under s 468 Penal Code, s 381 Penal Code and s 420 Penal Code taken into consideration.  She was then sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment.
12        In her written mitigation, the Accused said she was remorseful.  She said she committed these offences as she was in financial difficulty and because she had difficulty securing loans.  She pleaded for a lighter sentence as she is a divorcee and is the only person supporting her 4 young children.  She informed the Court that she absconded in year 2000 because she felt she needed to take care of her youngest son who was then 6
1
/
2
 years old.          She also tendered in a written plea by her four children for the Court to be lenient by imposing a short jail sentence instead of a sentence of corrective training.
DPP’s submission
13        The prosecution pressed for a deterrent sentence citing various aggravating factors in this case including the large number of offences committed by the Accused.  Most of the offences were committed by the Accused whilst absconding from the law.  The DPP submitted that she had show her blatant disdain for the law by repeating similar offence while she was on the run.  She had also betrayed the trust reposed in her by those who dealt with her as a maid agent and had made no restitution at all.
Reasons for sentence
14        Given her previous similar convictions and the large number of similar offences committed in the present case, I called for a pre-sentence report to determine her suitability for corrective training.  She was found by the medical doctor to be fit for corrective training.
15        The Accused committed the first set of cheating and forgery offences in 1999, just within two years of her release from a two-year imprisonment term for similar cheating and forgery offences.  In fact, she also committed offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act shortly after her release from prison.  More likely than not, the previous sentence was insufficient to deter her from further crimes.  She was charged in Court on 30 September 1999 for the first series of 5 offences.  On 22 March 2000, she pleaded guilty before the late District Judge Thyagarajan in Court 17.  Through her counsel, she sought a 3-month adjournment for mitigation as she was then sorting out custody and matrimonial matters and had also wanted to make full restitution of the amount of $29,000 that she had illegally taken.  The case was then adjourned to 23 May 2000 for mitigation and sentencing.  She then absconded and a warrant of arrest was issued on the return date on 23 May 2000.
16        Whilst she was on the run, she continued her forgeries and cheating offences to obtain monies for her own use.  Although she was placed on the police “Wanted List”, she evaded apprehension by assuming the false identity of one Kristina Marlene Colling by using that person’s Indonesian passport to travel in and out of Singapore over the next 1 1/2 years.  Altogether, she committed over 100 offences during the period she had absconded from the law.
17        It is clear that the Accused is not remorseful despite her written pleas. She earlier claimed she wanted to make restitution, but she did not do so.  As the DPP had rightly pointed out, she is a skilled forger who had no hesitation to perpetrate fraud to obtain monies to serve her own needs.  The fact that she had brazenly gone on to commit  myriad crimes (some 109 offences) whilst on the run till her arrest clearly shows that she is in dire need of reformation.  Given that she started repeating her crimes so soon after her release from prison, and that she had little compunction to repeat similar offences to enrich herself and evade apprehension, I was of the view that a longer period of corrective training was necessary to reform her and for the prevention of crime (see 
Kua Hoon Chua
 v PP 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
).
18        Accordingly, I sentenced the Accused to ten years’ corrective training.  The Accused has filed a notice of appeal and is presently serving sentence.",2003-07-31 00:00:00,SG District Court

DAC 16054/03
You, Chua Kim Teck, Male/27 years NRIC No: S7532759E, are charged that you on the 3
rd
 day of April 2003 at about 1.50 pm at Blk 757 Choa Chu Kang North 5 #06-119, Singapore, did attempt to commit house-breaking by day, to wit, by inserting a key into the key hole of the aforesaid unit belonging to Noriza Binte Abdul Hamid and used for the purpose of human dwelling, in order to commit theft and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 454 read with Section 511 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The statement of facts
2          The accused admitted the statement of facts but also maintained in his written mitigation plea (marked ‘D1’) thus: ‘I committed these offences because at the point of time, I was consuming sleeping pills and I don’t know what I am doing’.  When I sought clarification from him, he confirmed his admission to all the elements of the charges.  In particular, he confirmed that he had possessed the requisite mens rea for both offences.  I proceeded to convict him on the basis that he had admitted the statement of facts without any qualification.
3          In respect of DAC 16054/03, investigations revealed that on 3 April 2003 at about 1.50 pm, the accused had been spotted loitering suspiciously around the sixth floor of Block 757 Choa Chu Kang North 5.  He was seen trying to open the locks of flat #06-119.  He did not succeed in doing so and eventually left.  A resident in the neighbouring unit (#06-121) had observed his movements.  The accused was arrested later that afternoon at the void deck of Block 757.
4          The complainant and victim, Ms Noriza Binte Abdul Hamid (‘Ms Noriza’), resides at #06-119.  The police conducted a search on the accused and found a bunch of keys and a key tag with the name ‘Noriza’ on it, and an identity card belonging to Ms Noriza, in his possession.  He confessed that he had earlier tried to break into Ms Noriza’s house with the intention of committing theft.  He did not succeed as Ms Noriza had already changed the locks to the house.  He also admitted that he had stolen her brown sling bag on 1 April 2003 from O’Brien’s Irish Sandwich Bar, where she worked as a waitress.  He kept her keys and identity card to facilitate his subsequent attempt to break into her home to commit theft.
5          The circumstances relating to the theft of the bag (DAC 17429/03) were as follows.  On 1 April 2003 at about 7.00 am, Ms Noriza had left her brown sling bag on a table near the entrance to the premises.  The accused saw that the bag was unattended.  He went into the premises, took the bag and ran off.   Thereafter, he kept the bunch of keys, her identity card and handphone and threw the rest of the items away.  He admitted that he had spent the money (presumably derived from the disposal of the handphone, although this was not expressly made clear in the statement of facts).  The bag and the other items have not been found.
Antecedents and mitigation
6          The accused admitted that he had a varied list of antecedents despite his relatively young age of 27 years.  His record of criminal activities enumerates 20 entries in all.  In 1989, he had his first brush with the law when he was sent to Perak House Boys’ Hostel by the juvenile court for 36 months for housebreaking and theft by night (s 457 Penal Code (Cap 224)) and fraudulent possession of property (s 37(1) Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184)).  In 1991, he was again dealt with in the juvenile court for an offence of theft (s 379 Penal Code) and ordered to spend 12 months at the Singapore Boys’ Home.
7          From 1991 to 1997, he has had two convictions for theft (s 379 Penal Code), four convictions for theft in dwelling (s 380), and one conviction for attempted housebreaking (s 453 r/w s 511).  Within those six years or so, he had also chalked up numerous other Penal Code convictions, such as one conviction each for affray (s 160), obscene act (s 294), mischief (s 427), criminal trespass (s 447), house trespass (s 448, including one charge taken into consideration) and criminal intimidation (s 506).  There were also convictions for fraudulent possession of property and drug possession.
8          His most recent convictions took place on 13 November 1997.  These involved two counts of theft in dwelling (s 380), for which he was sentenced to the minimum period of five years corrective training.  He was sentenced separately to 4 months’ imprisonment for an offence framed as ‘MAC’ (ie. a Magistrate’s Arrest Case) involving house trespass under s 448 Penal Code.  The court ordered the sentence to run concurrently with the term of 5 years corrective training.
9          As noted earlier, I had ascertained that his plea of guilt was valid and unequivocal.  In his written mitigation, the accused said that he was remorseful.  He pleaded for one last chance, as his father was elderly and suffering from cancer.  His mother had passed away 9 years ago.  He was the only one left in the house to take care of his father.  He swore that he would not commit any offences again and pleaded for a minimum sentence.  He claimed that while he did intend to break into Ms Noriza’s house to commit theft, he had actually also intended to return her identity card in the process. 
Reasons for sentence
10        The accused had pleaded guilty before me on a mention date designated for dealing with persistent repeat offenders.  The prosecution submitted that the accused should be placed under preventive detention as he had previously undergone corrective training, but with no apparent effect.  I was mindful that he had numerous similar or related antecedents involving theft, housebreaking and trespass on property.  There was hardly any mitigating value in his plea of guilt as he was more or less caught red-handed, in possession of incriminating evidence on his person.
11        The accused committed the present offences shortly after his release from a five-year sentence of corrective training for similar theft offences.  Perhaps the previous period of incarceration was somehow still not substantial enough to effectively deter him from further crime.  He was clearly not remorseful at all, despite his pleas to the contrary.  His story about intending to return the identity card while trying to break into Ms Noriza’s house in order to commit theft was totally unbelievable.  In my view, it was crafted purely in the calculated hope of obtaining a lighter sentence.
12        I was minded to give him ‘one last chance’, as he requested, but only to the extent of ordering him to undergo a long term of corrective training and not sentencing him to preventive detention, for which the starting point would have been seven years.  Even if he was ultimately not going to be reformed or deterred, a long-term sentence would at least serve the more important basic purpose of preventing further crime by incapacitating him for a lengthy period.  Both corrective training and preventive detention could achieve the same objective, as the court was empowered to order long-term incarceration.
13        I did not call for a pre-sentence report to determine his suitability for corrective training, as he had previously been found suitable for such a sentence in lieu of imprisonment.  He appeared to me to be mentally and physically fit for corrective training.  In any event, there is no mandatory requirement for the court to obtain a suitability report for these purposes: see 
Kua Hoon Chua v PP
 
[1995] 2 SLR 386
; 
PP v Wong Wing Hung
 
[1999] 4 SLR 329
.
14        As there was an obvious risk that the accused would reoffend, I sentenced him to the maximum term of fourteen years’ corrective training.  This would mean that he would be incarcerated for a period far in excess of the minimum duration of seven years’ preventive detention.  In my opinion, this was the most appropriate course in the present case.  I understand that the accused filed a notice of appeal on 21 May 2003.  He is presently serving sentence.",2003-05-23 00:00:00,SG District Court

1.          This was a claim arising from an accident when a kelly bar hit the plaintiff (SBS) bus.  The kelly bar was unloaded by the first defendant (Pilecon) from a trailer parked on the first lane of the road.  In the course of the unloading, the bar swung out of the first lane onto the second lane on which the bus was travelling and collided with it.  The bar was lifted by a crane owned by Pilecon and operated by its servants and or agents.  The bar was lifted from the trailer owned by the second defendant (‘Bok Seng’) and driven by its servant.
2.          The trial before me was to establish if there was liability on the part of Bok Seng.
3.          SBS had commenced this action alleging that the accident was caused by the negligence of Pilecon and or Bok Seng.  Pilecon went under judicial management and from the summons for directions stage, SBS proceeded against Bok Seng only. 
The evidence
4.          The evidence, largely undisputed, was as follows.
5.          Bok Seng was engaged by Pilecon to provide transport to deliver the kelly bar to Pilecon’s construction site at Maples Avenue along Bukit Timah Road. The kelly bar is a metal bar used at construction sites to bore holes.  It was 18 metres in length, 1 foot in diameter and 7.8 tonnes in weight.  The transport was with traffic police escort. 
6.          Bok Seng’s job scope did not include unloading of the kelly bar from the trailer.  A crane would be required to unload the bar, and Pilecon did not order the supply of a crane.  The practice in such cases was for the customer to provide its own crane and unload the goods itself using its crane. 
7.          Accordingly, it was Pilecon's men who hoisted the kelly bar from the trailer.  Pilecon did so using its crane which was inside its construction site.  It was 15 to 20 feet away from the trailer. 
8.          The bar was originally to be unloaded in the construction site.  However Bok Seng’s driver found the entrance to the site obstructed.  Pilecon’s staff instructed Bok Seng’s driver to park beside the construction site along Bukit Timah Road which he did accordingly.  After parking the trailer, Bok Seng’s driver disengaged the prime mover from the trailer and parked the prime mover some distance ahead.  The traffic police officer then left the scene.
9.          The trailer had escort lights on.  Bok Seng’s driver waited by the side of the road for Pilecon’s men to unload the bar in order that he could re-attach the prime mover to the trailer before leaving.  While waiting, Pilecon's men used the arm of the crane to hoist the bar to unload it onto the construction site.  While it was hoisted, the bar swung out onto the second lane and hit the bus travelling on the second lane.
10.        There were at least four lanes along the stretch of Bukit Timah Road.  SBS driver first noticed trailer far away when he was stopped a distance away at the Sixth Avenue traffic lights.  The road was not very dark at the time of the accident.
Pleadings
Statement of claim
11.        The particulars of negligence pleaded against Bok Seng and Pilecon did not distinguish the particulars applicable to each.  The particulars of negligence which appeared applicable to Bok Seng were the following:
(1) failing to heed the presence of the bus;
(2) failing to maintain proper and effective control of the trailer;
(3) managing the trailer in a reckless and dangerous manner in total disregard for other road users;
(4) failing to exercise due care, skill and diligence in the management control and operation of the trailer;
(5) failing to manage the trailer to avoid the accident;
(6) failing to give notice and or barricades to warn other road users of the danger; and
(7) allowing the kelly bar to be lifted without making checks first.
In closing, SBS relied only on the particulars at para (6) above i.e. failing to warn other road users of the danger.
Defence
12.        At trial, Bok Seng did not pursue its pleaded defence that SBS was contributorily negligent.  It argued that the accident was caused by Pilecon’s negligence particularised in its defence as follows:
(1) Preventing Bok Seng's servant and/or agent from driving the trailer into the job site to unload the kelly-bar;
(2) Failing which to ensure that the entrance to the job site along Maple Avenue was not blocked so as to allow the Bok Seng's servant and/or agent to drive the trailer into the job site to unload the kelly-bar;
(3) Directing the Bok Seng’s servant/or agent to park the trailer along Maple Avenue adjacent to the job site for the purpose of unloading the kelly-bar;
(4) Carrying out the unloading of the kelly-bar along Maple Avenue without taking adequate safety precautions or at all and when it was unsafe and dangerous so to do;
(5) Lifting the kelly-bar negligently;
(6) Allowing the kelly-bar to be lifted without making checks first;
(7) Failing to provide any or any adequate lighting and/or warning in order to warn other road users along Maple Avenue of the unloading of the kelly-bar;
(8) Managing the crane in a reckless and dangerous manner in disregard of other road users;
(9) Failing to maintain proper and effective control of the crane;
(10) Causing the kelly-bar to hit the bus; and
(11) Failing to exercise due care skill and/or diligence in the management, control and/or operation of the crane so as to avoid the collision.
13.        Alternatively, it argued that Pilecon’s acts broke the chain of the causation.
14.        In closing, Bok Seng also argued that Pilecon was required by the Factories Act Cap 104 (‘the Act’) to cordon the area off manoeuvering load over a public area pursuant to regulation 16, Factories Act (Cap 104, sections 68, 77 and 102) Factories (Operation of Cranes) Regulations.
Findings
15.        The SBS driver’s evidence was that there were no persons directing oncoming traffic.  Bok Seng’s driver said that there were three or four men from Pilecon directing traffic away. 
16.        I accepted the evidence of the SBS driver for the following reasons.  First, Bok Seng’s pleaded defence was that Pilecon had failed to provide warning of the unloading at para 4(g) of the defence.  Secondly, had there been such warning, it would be strange for the bus driver to ignore the warning and persist in taking the second lane when there were at least three other lanes open to him and traffic was light, according to their accident reports. 
Proximate cause
17.        The collision was not with the trailer but with the kelly bar that was hoisted and swung into the airspace of the second lane.  The proximate cause of the accident was the fact that the kelly bar swung out of the first lane and encroached into the second lane on which the bus was travelling.
Decision
18.        SBS argued Bok Seng owed a duty of care to other road users and breached its duty of care by failing to warn other road users of the danger it created.
Duty of care
19.        I found Bok Seng owed a duty of care to other road users.  The question was whether there was breach and if so, whether such breach caused the accident.
Breach
20.        SBS argued that Bok Seng’s breach of the Highway Code (Cap 276, R 11) s. 91 and Road Traffic Rule (Cap 276, R20) was evidence of negligence on the part of Bok Seng.  SBS relied on 
Tong Khing Kia v. Yeo Kong Boon
 
[1990] SLR 1321
, where the cause of the accident was the sudden stopping of the car in front without signal to pick someone up. In stopping to pick up, there was a breach of rules in the Highway Code.  Under s. 112 (4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276), such breach may be relied on as tending to establish or to negative any liability in civil proceedings under the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276). The Court found the by stopping abruptly on the main road without signal, the driver created a dangerous situation which was the cause of the accident, and found no liability on the part of the vehicle behind the car stopping, which had taken the only evasive step possible, by braking.
21.        In the present case, the breaches related to parking along the yellow line and the failure to place the advance warning triangle a distance behind the trailer.  The breaches related to creating an obstruction on the road.  The breaches of duty, if any, in obstructing vehicles on the first lane, did not 
cause
 the accident.  The bus did not collide with the trailer on the first lane.  The bus collided with a kelly bar which swung out when hoisted by Pilecon's servants or agents using Pilecon's crane from a site controlled by Pilecon and from a trailer parked at a location Pilecon had directed.
Causation
22.        Bok Seng argued that even if there was breach, Pilecon's acts amounted to 
novus actus interveniens
 and broke the chain of causation.
23.        SBS argued if what is relied on as 
novus actus interveniens
 is the very kind of thing which is likely to happen if the want of care which is alleged in the case takes place, then it is no defence to say that there has been a 
novus actus interveniens.
24.        SBS argued that while there is no general duty to prevent a third party from causing damage to another, there are certain special circumstances in which a duty may arise one of which was where the defendant is negligently responsible for a state of danger and it is reasonably forseeable that a third party may interfere with it and cause damage by ‘sparking off’ the danger: 
Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore
 para 240.271.
25.        The question therefore is whether or not, Bok Seng was negligently responsible for a state of danger and it was reasonably foreseeable that Pilecon would interfere and cause damage.
26.        SBS argued that by its pleading, Bok Seng had conceded the accident was the natural and probable result of Bok Seng’s act of parking the trailer by the road to unload.
27.        SBS relied on para 4 (d) of Bok Seng’s defence which read: ‘carrying out the unloading of the kelly bar without taking adequate safety precautions or at all and when it was unsafe and dangerous to do so.’
28.        SBS read para 4(d) to mean that: (1) Pile Con was carrying out the unloading without adequate safety precautions; and (2) 
Pilecon was carrying unloading by the road and it was unsafe and dangerous to carry out unloading by the road as there is no safe way of unloading by the road.
29.        I did not agree that Bok Seng had cast its case in such a restrictive manner.  Para 4(d) of the defence was open to be read as: Pilecon was unloading by the road. There are safe and unsafe ways to go about unloading by the road; But Pilecon was using an unsafe way to unload.
30.        SBS also argued that Bok Seng’s driver had accepted that it was dangerous to allow things to be lifted up from the trailer on a public road.  The notes of evidence read, at p. 10 C:
‘Q: Do you think it is dangerous to allow things to be lifted up on a public road?
A:   Straight road with 5 lanes. Pilecon have the confidance.
 
Q:   Repeat question.
A:   Yes, but I had no choice. Pilecon were the ones who ordered the vehicle.’
31.        Viewed in its context, Bok Seng’s driver was making a general statement that it was dangerous to allow things to be lifted on public roads generally.  At the highest, it was a general observation, no more than say, ‘it is dangerous to cross the road’. It was a response to a general question. One would be hard put to say that he went so far as to accept that the reasonably forseeable result of unloading on the first lane was that an accident would occur, just as it would not be fair to say that the reasonable forseeable result of crossing a road would be an accident.
32.        When Bok Seng parked on the road as directed by Pilecon, it was certain that Pilecon would start unloading at the main road.  But the question was whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the bar would necessarily swing into the airspace of the second lane.  There was no evidence adduced as to the manner in which a kelly bar is ordinarily manoeuvred, and the manner in which the kelly bar was in fact manoeuvred on that day.  Can we speculate that a crane lifting a kelly bar in a direction away from the second lane would involve an encroachment over the second lane?  I think it would be difficult and dangerous to do so.  It is quite conceivable that moved in a certain manner, the kelly bar would not encroach at all into the airspace of the second lane.  After all, the police escort saw nothing wrong in parking the trailer where Pilecon had directed.   In that event, it would not be reasonably foreseeable that it would swing into the airspace of the second lane.
33.        Assuming for a moment that SBS had proved (which it had not) that whatever the manner of lifting, the kelly bar would necessarily encroach into the airspace of the second lane, it appeared Pilecon was required by regulation to cordon off that section of the second lane to traffic.  Regulation 16, Factories Act (Cap 104, sections 68, 77 and 102) Factories (Operation of Cranes) Regulations provides:
16. Any person operating a crane -
(a) shall not carry out any lifting operation unless a lifting supervisor is present or has approved the carrying out of such operation;
(b) shall not engage in any act or manoeuvre which is not in accordance with safe and sound practice;
(c) shall not manoeuvre or hold any suspended load over any public road or public area unless that road or area has been cordoned off;
(d) shall not hoist any load unless he has received a clear signal from a signalman when this is required under regulation 19. (emphasis mine)’ 
34.        SBS questioned if the Regulations were applicable when the lifting operations did not take place in a construction site but along a public road.  In my view, the Regulations were applicable.  Regulation 3 provides that the Regulations apply to any factory in which a crane is employed.  In the present case, the crane was employed in a construction site which fell within the definition of ‘factory’ under the Act.  It matters not that the lifting operation is outside the ‘factory’.  What matters is the crane which controls the lifting operations is in a factory.  The regulations are then applicable.  s6(2)(q) of the Act provides:
(2) Whether or not premises are factories by reason of the definition in subsection (1), ""factory"" also includes the following premises in which persons are employed in manual labour:
…
(q) any premises in which building operations or works of engineering construction are being carried on;…
‘Building operations’ defined in section 7 of the Act includes:
‘the construction of a building (including the re-wiring of any electrical installation, the replacement of any lift . . .  the demolition of a building, and the preparation for, and the laying of foundation of, an intended building)’
35.        Even if Pilecon was not required by regulation to cordon off the second lane, it had a duty at common law to other road users and would need to take safety precautions, whether to close the second lane or give notice to warn traffic off the second lane.  If it had done so, it would not have been reasonably foreseeable that there would be an accident.  At the time Bok Seng complied with Pilecon’s direction to park, there was nothing to show that Pilecon would not lift the bar using proper safety precautions.  Was Bok Seng to anticipate that Pilecon would lift the bar without safety precautions and in breach of any applicable regulations?  It was hard to say that Bok Seng would reasonably expect Pilecon would lift the Kelly bar in flagrant disregard for safe practices and any applicable regulation. Whether the intervening act of Pilecon involves negligence is relevant; Negligent conduct is more likely to breach the chain of causation and positive acts will more easily constitute new causes of action 
Knightley v Jones
 [1982] 1 AER 851.  Quite clearly, something went wrong in the circumstances of the lifting. We do not have a clear picture of what happened exactly.  The lack of clarity of what occurred tells against SBS because the onus is upon it in this issue.
36.        SBS relied on 
Haynes v Harwood
  [1934] AER 103, CA where a horse drawn vehicle was left unattended in a busy street and a third party, by throwing a stone at the horses, caused them to bolt and cause injury.
37.        SBS also relied on 
Newby v. General Lighterage
 [1955] 1 273, where the 1
st
 defendant’s barge moored alongside the 2
nd
 defendant’s wharf beside a public path was cast adrift by an unknown person.  The barge collided with the plaintiff. The Court found the 1
st
 defendant liable.  The 2
nd
 defendant, who were in no way responsible for mooring the barge, were held not liable.  The Court of Appeal observed that a vehicle or vessel out of control in a public highway is a great danger to other persons using the highway.  The evidence disclosed that someone mischievous had loosened the ropes and let the barge go after it had been tied up by the 1
st
 defendant.  That part of the river was frequented by youths who indulged in horse play.  Such interference had happened three quarters of a mile up, and the barge people there fastened their barges with chains and padlock to prevent such interference.  The court found that a reasonable person might have anticipated that at this part of the river, there was a possibility, at least, if not a likelihood, that there might be interference by mischievous persons loosening the barges. In reviewing a number of cases, the court observed that the court had found no negligence in those cases because interference by third persons of the particular kind in question – to set the thing in motion – could not reasonably be anticipated.  The court was of the view that in 
Newby
 however, interference by untying barges could reasonably be anticipated.
38.        Both 
Haynes
 and 
Newby
 are distinguishable.  In both cases, a third party intervened and the intervention could reasonably be anticipated.  This was not so in the present case.  In 
Haynes
, the horse which caused damage bolted when struck by stones from mischievous children on the street.  There was evidence that the street was busy.  In 
Newby
, the barge which caused damage was cast adrift by an unknown person.  There was evidence that that part of the river was frequented by youths who indulged in horseplay and the court found that interference by untying the barges could reasonably be anticipated.
39.        In the instant case, it was not proved that the intervention of Pilecon, to unload in an unsafe manner, (swinging the bar in a direction opposite to the intended direction onto a lane not closed to traffic), could be reasonably anticipated by Bok Seng.
40.        Counsel for SBS argued that the Court of Appeal in 
Newby
 held that the onus of proof was on the 1
st
 defendants to prove that the risk of the barge breaking adrift by wrongful interference could not reasonably have been anticipated.  Having failed to do so, the 1
st
 defendants were liable to the plaintiff.  This was not accurate.  What the Court of Appeal said was that 
in those
 
circumstances
, the 1
st
 defendant bore such a burden.  The circumstances disclosed that the area was frequented by youths who indulged in horseplay.  Indeed, the Court reviewed previous cases of interference by third persons which found no negligence because interference by third persons could not reasonably be anticipated.  In 
Newby
, third party interference could be reasonably anticipated  and hence the burden on the 1st defendant to prove it could not so anticipate.
41.        SBS also relied on 
Rouse v. Squire
 [1973] 2 AER 903, where 
B
 negligently managed a vehicle and caused it to obstruct a highway and constitute a danger to others. Another car came and collided with 
B
’s vehicle.  The two cars were stationary after the collision.  
F
 stopped to shine lights on them.  
S
 did not realise they were stationary and braked, skidded and collided into 
F
 which hit 
R
 who was rendering help.  The Court held 
B
 25 percent and 
S
 75 percent liable to 
R
. 
42.        SBS also relied on 
Saper v. Hungate Builders Ltd
, [1972] RTR 380 where 
H B
 carried out building work at 
B’s
 house.  At 
HB’s
 request 
R;
 a self-employed carpenter working for them on the job, obtained a skip from 
S G
.  The skip, a steel object painted yellow, was 11 feet 7 inches long, 5 feet 3 inches wide and 3 feet high.  It was placed, by 
S G
’s driver, outside 
B’s
 house some 60 yards from the blind crest of a hill so that it projected four and a half feet into the road opposite a street lamp.  
B
, at 
R’s
 request, placed two lighted builders’ lamps on top of the skip at each offside corner.  At about 12.30am 
K
, with Miss 
S
 as passenger, drove his car up the hill, failed to see the skip and collided with it.  Both were injured.  Miss 
S
 alleging negligence and/or nuisance sued 
H B
, 
R
, 
S G
, 
K
 and 
B
, and 
K
 alleging negligence and/or breach of statutory duty under section 146 of the Highways Act 1959 sued 
H B
, 
R
, 
B
 and 
S G
.  The court gave judgment for 
S
 and 
K
 against 
H B
, 
R
 and 
S G
 and 
B
.  As regards 
S G
, the court held that having placed and left the skip in the road, 
S G
 were liable to the Plaintiffs since they could not escape liability to third parties by delegating the task of lighting it; that 
H B
 were liable to the Plaintiffs in having caused the skip to be placed and kept in the road; and that 
R
, who, on the facts had been a servant of 
H B
, was equally liable with them to the Plaintiffs having allowed the skip to be placed in the road and having assumed the task of lighting it; but that, 
B
 not having failed to do properly what he had been asked to do, there would by concession be no judgment against him.
43.        In both 
Rouse
 and 
Saper
, the collision was with an obstruction created by the defendant.  In 
Saper
, the car collided with the skip placed by the road.  The cause of the accident was the obstruction posed by the skip on the road into which the car collided, and hence liability on the part of the party who left the skip there or caused the skip to be left there.  It was proved that driving up the hill, K 
failed to see
 the skip placed 60 yards from the blind crest of the hill.  In 
Rouse,
 
B
’s vehicle constituted an obstruction.  The second vehicle collided with and added to the obstruction.  It was to 
avoid this obstruction
 that caused 
S
 to brake, skid and collide with a nearby vehicle which hit the plaintiff 
R
.  The obstruction was a proximate cause of the accident in 
Rouse.
44.        In the present case, the trailer did not pose any obstruction to the SBS bus.  The SBS driver said that he saw the trailer on the first lane from a distance when he was stopped at the traffic lights at Sixth Avenue.  The bus was on the second lane at the material time of the accident.  This was not an accident where the bus collided into the trailer or the bus sought to avoid any obstruction the trailer posed in its path and braked and met with an accident.  The trailer posed no obstruction to the bus.  At the material time, the bus was travelling without incident alongside the trailer and would have continued its path of travel without incident if not for the kelly bar swinging out onto its path.  The collision was with the kelly bar.  The obstruction of the kelly bar in its path of travel was created by Pilecon and not Bok Seng.  The question was whether it was reasonably foreseeable that (1) in unloading, Pilecon would swing the bar out of the first lane onto the second lane (when hoisting the bar in a direction away from the second lane) 
and
 (2) Pilecon would not close the second lane to traffic.  As I have stated above, there was nothing to show how a kelly bar is ordinarily manoeuvred, and how it was manoeuvred that day.  There was nothing to show that in a manoeuvre with reasonable care, it would necessarily encroach onto the second lane.  In fact, if it were so, one would expect Pilecon to close the second lane to traffic.  There was nothing to show that Bok Seng should reasonably anticipate Pilecon not to close the second lane to traffic. 
45.        SBS relied on 
Kimber v. Gas Light and Coke Co. Ltd
 [1918-19] AER 123.  There, the defendant made a hole in a property which it left unguarded and failed to warn the plaintiff, a prospective tenant who came to view the property. The thing which the defendants created, the hole, 
without more
, without third party intervention, caused the injury.
46.        In 
Pope v. Fraser
 (1938) TLR 55, 324, F was liable because his driver was responsible for the presence of a nuisance (sulphuric acid) on the highway which he allowed to remain there after knowing that it existed without warning users of the highway about it. The plaintiff, a motorcyclist, thinking it was water, rode through it, skidded, fell and was burned by the acid.  The Court held that F’s duty was to go back at once and see if a substantial amount of acid had fallen on the road and if so, to warn traffic not to proceed. This was because he was responsible for the spillage.
47.        Both in 
Kimber
 and 
Pope
, the defendant’s act of creating a hole or spilling the acid, 
without more
, was sufficient to and did cause the accident.  In the present case, Bok Seng’s act of parking the trailer by the road, 
without more
, was not sufficient to and did not cause the accident.
48.        In 
Diboll v. City of Newcastle
 [1993] PIQR 16, the plaintiff was injured when the van in which he was travelling as a passenger, struck a scaffolding pole which projected two and a half feet onto the highway at a height of six and a half feet. The first defendant, who was employer of the driver as well as the local authority, which had overall control of the market and overall power to supervise was held 80 per cent liable.  The second defendant, who erected the scaffolding was 10 per cent liable for creating the hazard.  The third defendant, the owner of the stall, was 10 per cent liable.  The third defendant had left his stall and the scene when he knew or ought to have known that the scaffold pole created a hazard to users of the highway.
49.        The stalls were constructed by tubular scaffolding.  At the end of the day’s trading the scaffolders dismantled the stalls.  The third defendant could see the hazard posed by the projecting scaffolding before he left the scene.  He had removed the canopy on the poles.  The hazard was manifested early on.  The third defendant was aware of the hazard, was able to do something about it (he had contorl over the one who dismantled the scaffold) and did nothing.
50.        In the instant case, there was nothing to show that the hazard manifested itself early enough for Bok Seng to do anything.
51.        In the instant case there was no evidence that the bar would necessarily swing out, or that if Pilecon was going to unload it in such a manner that the bar would swing out onto the second lane, that no attempts would be made to close or warn traffic off the second lane. 
52.        In any event, there was no suggestion that Bok Seng was in any position to control those who brought on the hazard.  On the contrary, it was Pilecon that paid for Bok Seng's services, and had control over it.  It would not be reasonable to have expected Bok Seng’s driver to have dissented vigorously and to have stopped the trailer at a place other than as directed.  In the same vein, it would not be reasonable to have expected Bok Seng, having parked the trailer at the location as directed, to intervene and stop Pilecon’s men from unloading when it became clear that the bar was swinging out onto the second lane not closed to traffic, if at all there was time for him to intervene.  If Pilecon’s men refused to stop unloading, was Bok Seng to direct them to close the second lane to traffic, and when this was not heeded, was he to run forward to provide a solitary human barricade to forewarn traffic?  It would be exceedingly onerous to impose such a duty and correspondingly to find Bok Seng liable in tort for failing to warn other traffic.  It would effectively reallocate the parties’ respective obligations under their contractual agreement.  I did not think it was reasonable to expect Bok Seng to object and seek to control the performance of work of someone over whom Bok Seng had no control, least of all over someone who paid and controlled Bok Seng.
53.        In the circumstances, I was of the view that SBS had failed to establish its claim against Bok Seng and I dismissed its claim and costs.",2003-04-29 00:00:00,SG District Court

Criminal Procedure and Sentencing
  – 
Sentencing
  – 
Appropriate sentence under s 304 (a) of the Penal Code where the accused suffers from an impairment to the mind.
 
 
1          The accused is 52 years old and unemployed.  He was renting a flat at Jalan Kukoh together with his friend Pang Siew Yin (‘Pang’) at the time of the offence.  Pang was 55 years old.  About 1am on 17 September 2002 the accused woke from sleep and went to brush his teeth at the kitchen sink.  He spied a knife next to the sink and promptly took it in his hand and walked to Pang who was asleep.  The accused plunged the knife deep into Pang’s chest.  Pang woke up with shock and ran out of the flat where he collapsed and died.  The accused was charged with killing Pang under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, Ch 224, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.  The particulars of the charge aver that the act of the accused ‘was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause death’.  The accused pleaded guilty to the charge.  He was not represented but an 
amicus curiae
, Mr Subhas Anandan was appointed to assist the court in respect of some important aspects relating to the mental state of the accused and to address the court in mitigation on behalf of the accused.
 
2          The accused was examined by Dr Tommy Tan of the Department of Forensic Psychiatry at the Woodbridge Hospital.  Dr Tan gave his evidence orally and three of his reports on the accused were admitted into evidence.  Dr Tan testified that he examined the accused over two or three occasions for a total of about two hours.  He also studied the medical record of the accused.  He stated that he did not peruse any of the statements given by the accused to the police because he did not think that they would be of much help to him.
3          The accused has a history of mental illness going back to 12 January 2001 when he was first admitted to the Woodbridge Hospital for setting fire to his landlord’s corridor.  According to Dr Tan, the accused was then suffering from a paranoid delusion that his landlord was conspiring with a neighbour to harm him ‘and set five ghosts on him’.  He believed that the landlord was spraying ‘special fragrant flakes’ that made people lose their minds, but he believed that he (the accused) was given special powers by some visiting monks to protect himself.  The accused was admitted to the Woodbridge Hospital again on 31 January 2002 after the police arrested him at the Hotel Phoenix where he was found talking to himself.
4          In respect of the present offence, Dr Tan stated in his report of 4 October 2002 (P5) that the accused was examined by him and found to have ‘psychomotor retardation, that is to say [that] his mental processes, is slowed down.  He spoke slowly and [his] movements were retarded.  His affect was depressed.  He could not tell [Dr Tan] why he had killed the deceased.  He said that he was in a state between awake and asleep [at] the time of the alleged offence.  He felt some force controlling him.  He could have some paranoid beliefs about the deceased.’  Dr Tan concluded that in his opinion, the accused had a ‘schizoaffective disorder’ at the time of the offence which ‘substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the acts that caused the death of the deceased’.  Dr Tan is of the opinion that the accused ‘was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence, as he knew what he was doing and what he did was contrary to law’ (sic).  However, Dr Tan added that, in his view, the accused qualified for the defence of diminished responsibility because of the impairment to his mind caused by the schizoaffective disorder.
5          A person who is convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) of the Penal Code shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or caning if the act by which death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury, as is likely to cause death.  Dr Tan had expressly stated in his report, which he re-affirmed in his testimony in court, that the accused was not of unsound mind but, nonetheless, qualifies for the defence of diminished responsibility.  What the psychiatrist means is that he does not think that the accused can be described to be of unsound mind within the meaning of s 84 of the Penal Code:
‘84.      Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.’
6          However, in his view, the accused can be said to have a diminished responsibility within the meaning of Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code at the time of the offence.  Exception 7 reads:
‘
Exception 7
. – Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.’
It is important to state at this point that whether or not s 84 or Exception 7 applies in any case is a matter for the court to determine.  In that sense, the opinions of doctors and psychiatrists cannot be the final word.  That is obvious in cases where there is conflicting medical evidence.  Where, as in this case, the only medical evidence comes solely from one psychiatrist, that point may not be as obvious.  Nonetheless, in considering the application of s 84 and Exception 7, medical evidence is essential, and though not the final word, no court may proceed without it; that is because both statutory provisions have encrypted the requirement for specialist medical evidence into the legislative provisions.  In the one case, medical evidence is required, at least, to determine, first of all, whether the accused is of unsound mind in the medical sense; and in the second, to determine whether he was labouring under an abnormality of mind arising from a retarded development of the mind, or any inherent causes, or induced by disease or injury.
7          In the eyes of the layman and any reasonable man, however, the accused in this case, with his long history of mental illness - talking to himself and imagining being harmed by his landlord and various others - is undoubtedly of unsound mind, or insane.  That is to say that some ailment is afflicting his mind and causing him to imagine and believe things that a rational person would not.  It is the combination of the ailment and the thought sequences produced in his mind by that ailment that distinguish such a person from one who, unaffected by any medical condition of the mind, forms beliefs that other rational men would not share – for example, some rational men may believe that it is bad luck to walk under a ladder while other equally rational men may not.
8          What then, is the distinction between s 84 and Exception 7?  Section 84 is known as an absolute defence in that if that provision applies – and the burden of proving so is on the accused - the accused may be acquitted and, pursuant to s 315 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Ch 68, be ordered to be kept in safe custody and subsequently be confined in a mental hospital or other suitable place during the President’s pleasure.  A person to whom Exception 7 applies is guilty of culpable homicide but by reason of that exception, the culpable homicide is not murder and he cannot, therefore, be tried or convicted on a capital charge.  The punishment would be within the range set out in s 304(a) of the Penal Code.
9          In the present case, the learned DPP Mr Tham argued that the accused is a danger to himself and society so long as he is labouring under the schizoaffective disorder.  Mr Tham pointed out that the accused habitually did not comply with the regime of medical treatment prescribed to him.  He therefore submitted that a sentence of life imprisonment ought to be imposed.  His argument was supported by the evidence of Dr Tan.
10        Mr Anandan made some very pertinent points in his address to me relating to the state of mind of the accused and the extent to which his mental illness had diminished his culpability.  I use the word ‘diminished’ here in the general sense and not in the sense which it is used in the context of Exception 7.  Much of what Mr Anandan says is not challenged by Mr Tham.  Mr Anandan recognises that there are serious problems posed by the accused in his condition and hence, when he made the recommendation that should a sentence of life imprisonment be handed down, the court should direct that the accused be made to serve his incarceration in a mental institution instead of the prison.  Unfortunately, a direction of that nature can only be made if s 84 applies.
11        In considering the appropriate sentence for this accused we must remind ourselves that he had, with guidance of an able counsel, pleaded guilty and so precluded himself from the defence under s 84 although  I  accept that an order under s 315 of the Criminal Procedure Code (which is consequential only upon a successful defence under s 84) is the most appropriate order in circumstances such as the present. But s 84, by reason of its stringent requirements, has proved to be virtually inaccessible to accused persons who are mentally ill.  That provision is a statutory expression of an outdated common law icon – the M’Naghten Rule, (from 
M’Naghten’s Case
 (1843) 10 Cl & Fin 200) a point I had previously made in 
Public Prosecutor v Dolah bin Omar
 
[2001] 4 SLR 302
.  One of the difficulties of s 84 is that it compels the doctors and the courts to draw a distinction between insanity and acts of insanity.  It is one thing to say that a man who commits an act of insanity may not be insane; but it is quite another to say that a man who is insane (at the time of the offence, and not during a lucid interval) and commits an act of insanity must be required to prove that in doing so he was incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that what he was doing was either wrong or contrary to law.
12        Another problem, associated with the first, is the difficulty of determining whether an insane person was capable of knowing the nature of his act, or that what he was doing what was either wrong or contrary to law.  In practice, that depends very much on what that insane man tells the examining psychiatrist.  How badly has the insane man’s perception of himself and his own conduct has been warped, or conversely, preserved by his mental illness is a relevant point that has not been raised in any antecedent case.  How much effort is required to establish the reliability of the insane man’s answers?  If we do not believe him when he tells us that his landlord sets five ghosts on him, that is because that claim does not accord with our view of reality.  Yet we may choose to believe him when he says that he knew that what he did was contrary to law, but that may be so only because those words conform to our view of reality.  In the present case, Dr Tan spent no more than two hours with the accused.  What transpired during this time?  No record or transcript of the examination was available.  Dr Tan did not look at the statements made by the accused to the police although those statements might, and probably would have been, more contemporaneous than those he made to Dr Tan.
13        Finally, s 84 (or the M’Naghten Rule) befuddles even doctors, and constrains them from calling a spade a spade.  This is evident from the evidence of Dr Tan himself who, in attempting to justify why he had diagnosed the accused as suffering from a serious mental disorder at the time of the offence and yet not to be of unsound mind.  His answer was that he ‘applied’ the M’Naghten Rule.  It is clear to me that by that answer, he meant that from the medical, but not the legal point of view, the accused was of unsound mind (or insane, in common parlance).
14        Reverting to the present circumstances, with s 315 of the Criminal Procedure Code and s 84 of the Penal Code excluded, the choice is therefore between a term of imprisonment of up to ten years or imprisonment for life.  Gangsters who stab one another to death and are charged under s 304(a) have been sentenced within the range of six to ten years imprisonment, depending on the mitigating or aggravating circumstances of the individual case. In my view, the punishment for a person whose mental culpability is so diminished by illness ought to be for a lesser not greater term.  But such a shorter sentence can be inappropriate or inadequate in many instances.
15        A mentally ill accused who is released from prison and does not continue his medical treatment may suffer a relapse, and consequently, result in death or injury to himself or others.  Thus, the principle of deterrence – not so much the deterrence in the traditional sense of deterring others from committing like crimes, (for we are dealing here only with persons of deranged minds) but that of protecting the public as well as the accused himself - requires that such accused persons be incarcerated for as long as is necessary.  In the circumstances of this case, with no other statutory provisions to measure what is necessary or to determine the 
juste millieu
, the most appropriate sentence has to be, by default as it were, a sentence of life imprisonment.  The accused will receive the appropriate medical treatment in prison and his mental illness can thus be kept in check.   Dr Tan testified that if medical attention to the accused is interrupted, the likelihood of a relapse is strong.  In this case, the accused who is a divorcee with no family support, is likely, if released, to forsake the long-term medical treatment that he will require.  But that treatment will be available to him whilst he remains in prison.  The paradox, therefore, is that a medically rehabilitated person in this accused will have to continue to spend the rest of his life in prison.
16        Notwithstanding the observations that I have made above, the only recourse I have in the circumstances of this case is to impose a sentence of life imprisonment.  I, therefore, sentence the accused to a term of imprisonment for life, with effect from 17 September 2002. The date of commencement is material in the event the accused qualifies for release pursuant to any executive orders.",2003-05-09 00:00:00,SG High Court

Delivered by Chao Hick Tin JA
1 The three appellants (""Ng"", ""Rosdi"" and ""Roseley"" aged 35, 37 and 42 respectively) were tried together and convicted by the High Court of two separate capital charges. Ng was charged with conspiring with Rosdi and Roseley in trafficking 48.21 grams of diamorphine. Rosdi and Roseley were charged that they, in furtherance of their common intention, had trafficked in the said quantity of diamorphine. They were found guilty and each was sentenced to suffer the punishment of death.
2 On 27 March 2002, on information received, officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau (""CNB"") were deployed in the Sembawang area to observe the movements of two vehicles, one bearing registration number SCG 5421M and the other SBP 6331 Y.
3 At about 12.55pm, the CNB officers spotted SBP 6331Y coming from Admiralty Drive into Sembawang Drive, in the direction of Admiralty link. It then turned right into the driveway in front of Block 406A, which is a multi-storey car park (""the m/s car park""), and onto a side road between Blocks 412 and 415. It stopped at a loading bay in that vicinity. A person (later established to be Roseley) came out of the car and walked to Block 411 where he met another person (later established to be Rosdi) and together they walked to the adjacent Block 410 and sat on a bench at the void deck.
4 At about 1.15pm, a vehicle, bearing registration number JFY 5311, drove into the m/s car park and parked in a lot on the first level. The driver (later established to be Ng) alighted from the car and walked away. Soon afterwards Rosdi entered into the car park and walked towards JFY 5311. He opened the car door of the front passenger seat and took a haversack out of the car. He shut the car door and walked towards Block 410 where Roseley was waiting. Both of them then walked towards Block 418 Canberra Road.
5 At that juncture, the CNB officers were instructed to arrest Rosdi and Roseley. As the officers approached them, the duo ran and Rosdi either dropped or threw the haversack he was carrying (Rosdi said later that it slipped off his shoulder). They were caught after a short chase. The haversack was also recovered and in it there were 20 wrapped bundles which were later established to contain not less than 48.21 grams of diamorphine, which constituted the subject matter of the charge against both of them.
6 In the meantime, Ng returned to his car and drove it out of the car park. He was trailed. At the junction of Sembawang Drive and Sembawang Crescent, when he stopped his car at the traffic lights, he was arrested.
Voir Dire
7 In the course of investigations, a number of statements were obtained from the three appellants. Rosdi and Roseley did not object to their statements being produced in evidence at the trial. However, Ng objected (except in respect of his cautioned statement) and a trial-within-a-trial was held to determine the admissibility of Ng’s statements, three in all, apart from his cautioned statement.
8 Basically, what Ng alleged was that he did not make any of the three statements voluntarily. The first was an oral statement made on the day of his arrest to Station Inspector See (""SI See"") while seated in a CNB car. He said it was made out of fear. Ng explained that on that day, at the traffic junction where he was arrested, one S/Sgt Subramaniam had pointed his gun at his head twice and that had frightened him. S/Sgt Subramaniam admitted that, at the junction of Sembawang Drive/Sembawang Crescent, he pointed his gun at Ng when the latter refused to open his car door as requested by the officers who were trying to arrest him. But he denied that there was a second occasion, a while later when Ng was opening the boot of his car for the officers to inspect, when he pointed his gun at Ng.
9 In relation to the other two investigation statements recorded on 1 and 5 April 2002, Ng said that, on 1 April 2002, while the interpreter was out of the room to fetch some water for him, the Investigating Officer (""IO"") told Ng that he would have a chance to escape the death penalty if he were to testify against the other two. It was because of that inducement that Ng gave the statements to the IO.
10 The trial judge, without deciding whether there was in fact a second incident where S/Sgt Subramaniam pointed his gun at Ng, held that the oral statement made by Ng was not in any way affected by the threat, if any. SI See, whom Ng spoke to in the car, never threatened or did anything to him. As regards the allegation that the IO made a promise to entice Ng to make the two investigation statements, the trial judge, after reviewing all the evidence, found that Ng had made them voluntarily.
11 This finding of the trial judge, that all the statements of Ng were made voluntarily, was clearly a finding of fact, based on the evidence before him and the demeanour of the witnesses. However, counsel for Ng argued that the trial judge did not give sufficient consideration to a number of factors and the main ones were –
(i) That there was contradictory evidence from other prosecution witnesses which showed that S/Sgt Subramaniam was present at the boot of the car when the alleged second incident of gun pointing took place.
(ii) On the day before the statement of 1 April 2002 was taken, Ng was not well and had seen a doctor. His lips were cracked. So it was not unlikely that he could have asked for a drink of water, even though the interpreter denied that he had got out of the room to get some water for Ng.
(iii) In his cautioned statement of 27 March 2002, Ng denied any involvement with the drugs. But he changed that position in the two investigation statements. This was wholly consistent with Ng’s assertion that the IO had offered him an inducement. The IO needed Ng’s cooperation to nail Rosdi and Roseley who up to that point had denied knowledge of the drugs.
(iv) There was conflict in some aspects of the evidence of the IO with that of the interpreter.
12 It is settled law that an appellate tribunal should not disturb a finding of fact by the trial court, based on the testimony of witnesses, unless it is clearly against the weight of the evidence and is not supportable. The determination by the trial judge that the statements made by Ng were voluntary was such a finding of fact. We were unable to hold, in spite of the criticisms made by the counsel, that the trial judge was clearly wrong as there was available evidence to support that finding. The trial judge was conscious of these aspects.
Ng’s statements
13 We now set out in gist what each of the appellants stated in their statements. Unless essential, we do not propose to set out each statement in 
extenso
.
14 In Ng’s oral statement made to SI See in the car, he said he gave ""twenty balls of heroin"" to two Malays at Block 406 Sembawang, as arranged over the telephone, by leaving the stuff in the car for them to pick up. However, in his cautioned statement he said –
""I do not admit to the charge. The 20 bundles of heroin were not seized from my car. It was taken away by the 2 male Malays.""
15 Ng said that the two Malay persons, whom he saw as he turned his car into the m/s car park, were the persons to whom the bundles were to be delivered. The day of 27 March 2002 started for Ng at about 7.00am. As agreed with his supplier, one Ah Ken (""Ken""), Ng left his car unlocked at Taman Jaya, Johore Bahru, and went for some coffee so that Ken could place the heroin in the car. He had met Ken some time earlier through friends at a night spot in Johore Bahru and knew that Ken was a drug dealer. He had previously asked Ken for jobs and that was how he got this assignment. He was told by Ken to go to the m/s car-park at Block 406A, Sembawang, leave the car unlocked on the first level, go for a drink and then come back to the car when instructed.
16 After the drugs had been properly concealed in his car, Ng returned to it and drove to Singapore. After clearing the Woodlands Checkpoint, Ken called him and, as instructed, Ng drove to a nearby car park, left the car unlocked and went to a shop to buy a bag. He bought a black haversack. He understood that in the meantime someone would come to his car and take out the heroin from where it was concealed. Half an hour later, upon receipt of a call on his hand phone, he returned to the car and saw 25 bundles lying on the floor of the front passenger seat as well as on the back seat of the car. Again, as instructed, he placed 20 bundles into the haversack. The remaining five bundles were put into an empty red plastic bag which was on the back seat. The haversack was then placed by Ng on the front passenger seat and the red plastic bag (with the five bundles) was put into the car boot. He then drove to Block 406A.
17 Ng was familiar with the m/s car park, having made a similar trip two weeks earlier. As he was about to turn into the car park he saw Rosdi and Roseley at the edge of the void deck of a block opposite the car park. They were the same persons he saw on his first trip. He parked the car, left it unlocked and walked away.
18 As far as Ng was concerned, his role was just that of a courier. He did not need to bother about collecting payment. That was a matter between Ken and the buyer. It was also Ken who would contact the customer to collect the drugs. However, Ng did not have the contact number of Ken. It was always Ken who contacted him.
Rosdi’s statements
19 As regards Rosdi, he gave his first statement to Inspector Xavier Lek shortly after his arrest. In this statement, he admitted obtaining the haversack from a car parked at the m/s car park, but denied knowing what was in the 20 bundles found inside the haversack. He was supposed to deliver the bundles to someone.
20 The next statement made by Rosdi was his cautioned statement, the substance of which consisted of three sentences:-
""My intention of going there was not to traffic. I do not know the haversack contained drugs. Roesley also does not know anything about this matter.""
21 Rosdi also made two investigation statements. What he said may be summarized as follows. On the fateful morning, a friend called Rahman telephoned him and arranged to meet him at the AZ Restaurant, along Sembawang Road, to talk about work. He had first met Rahman in early March 2002 at the Turf Club. They became friends because of their mutual interest in horse betting. However, Rosdi did not know how to contact Rahman as he did not have his address or contact number. Rosdi drove to the appointed place, arriving before 12 noon. Fifteen minutes later, Rahman arrived. Rahman wanted him to collect a bag of gold and deliver it to another person called ""Boy"" who would be coming to Block 416 in a taxi. Before that, a Malaysian car would be coming into the m/s car park. Rahman told him that the way in which the gold had been brought into Singapore rendered it contraband. Hence the need for such clandestine means of delivery.
22 While he was walking towards Block 416, he ""bumped into a friend"", Roseley. At his request, Roseley walked with him towards the m/s car park and sat on a bench at the void deck of a block opposite the car-park. Roseley told him that he was checking out a food stall in that vicinity. He also told Roseley why he was there. Soon, a light grey or brown Malaysian car drove into the m/s car park. This was followed by a telephone call from Rahman saying that the Malaysian car had arrived and that he was to get the things from the car. Rosdi asked Roseley to wait while he walked into the car park.
23 His account of the subsequent events was substantially as described above. When he slung the haversack over his shoulder, he found that it was heavy. But he never opened it to see what was inside. He thought they were gold bars and white gold nuggets as sometime earlier Rahman had shown him a small gold bar and a white gold nugget and asked him to source out buyers. As he walked towards Roseley, the latter was talking on the phone. At his request, Roseley walked with him to the main road. As the haversack appeared to be heavy, Roseley asked what was inside. Rosdi answered that he did not know.
24 Rosdi explained that at that point in time he ran because he was shocked at seeing five or six people chasing him and Roseley. The haversack slid off his shoulder and fell to the ground. Upon his arrest, he told the CNB officers that he did not know how many bundles there were in the haversack.
25 Rosdi asserted that his meeting Roseley that day was purely coincidental although the day before he had called Roseley on the handphone to enquire if the latter was going to Kallang Stadium on 27 March to watch the Hong Kong horse racing. He did not use his handphone to contact Roseley or anyone else on 27 March.
Statements of Roseley
26 Roseley made a number of statements to the CNB officers. In the first statement, which was made immediately after his arrest, he said that he bumped into Rosdi by chance as he was there to check out a coffeeshop. He did not know what was in the bag Rosdi was carrying. He repeated this in his cautioned statement.
27 The gist of Roseley’s four investigation statements was as follows. On that fateful day, at 12.30pm, he left his food stall at Seiko factory canteen at Marsiling Lane and drove to Sembawang, arriving at 1.00pm at a coffeeshop which was in the vicinity of the m/s car park. He parked along the main road. He intended to open a second food stall there. He had learnt of this business opportunity from a friend called Azman, whose telephone number he did not have. Having sat in the coffeeshop for about half an hour and realizing that his car might receive a traffic summons, he moved his car and parked it at a nearby loading bay (between Blocks 412 and 415). He did not park in the m/s car park because he thought it would be full, as he had seen many cars entering and leaving it. He then walked back towards the coffeeshop, intending to continue observing the crowd there.
28 On the way, he saw Rosdi standing near a staircase of the m/s car park, carrying a haversack over his shoulder. He stopped and chatted with Rosdi, who said he was waiting for a friend. Later, Rosdi indicated that he would be going in the direction where Roseley had parked his car. Roseley chose not to go back to the coffeeshop but decided instead to accompany Rosdi, as the lunch hour would soon be over. Although Rosdi took a longer route, Roseley followed him and they were arrested near Block 417.
29 Roseley said that during the entire period he was with Rosdi, he never asked or said anything about the haversack. Neither had he been to the area near the m/s car park. That day had been his first visit to the area. On that day he did not telephone Rosdi; neither did Rosdi call him.
30 We should also add that both Rosdi and Roseley said that they were, for a period, partners in the food stall business at the Marsiling canteen.
Defences of the appellants
31 At the trial, the defence of Ng was that he did not know that the haversack contained heroin. He retracted what he had stated in his statements and claimed that he thought Ken was engaged in smuggling jewellery and gold bars and not drugs. On the first transaction which he undertook for Ken, he had only seen Rosdi and not Roseley. He did not know that the 20 bundles contained drugs although he admitted that he could have opened them to see what they contained.
32 Rosdi admitted having, before the fateful day, carried out a similar transaction for Rahman. He had believed that he was transporting gold bars and jewellery on behalf of Rahman. On each occasion he did not have an opportunity to check what was in the bundles. Regarding the question as to whether calls were made on his handphone that day, and contrary to what he said in his statements, he admitted, in the light of the call tracing record, that between 12.32pm to 1.15pm, he had received four calls from Roseley. He gave various accounts (talking about horse racing and picking up a friend) of what the four calls were about. He explained that he did not refer to these calls in his statements because he was confused.
33 Roseley’s defence was that, although he had known Rosdi for about a year, he knew nothing of the transactions between Rosdi and Ng. That day, after removing his car from the main road (where there were double yellow lines), he decided to drive around to look at the area generally. Thus, he did not drive directly to the nearest place to park his car but instead went on a somewhat longer drive from Sembawang Drive to Admiralty Drive and into Canberra Road, and at a certain point he made a U-turn and came back to Sembawang Drive in the opposite direction from where he had started and finally parked his car at the loading bay area. Roseley also corrected what he said in his statements about making or receiving no calls that day. He explained that as he could not remember at the time the statement was recorded, whether calls had been made or received, he had simply stated that no calls were made or received.
34 Roseley also made another correction. Contrary to what was in his statements, he said that when he first met Rosdi, the latter was not carrying a haversack. Rosdi went to collect the haversack only after they had met and sat on the bench at the void deck at Block 410 to chat for a while. He tried to shift the blame for this error in the statements to the recording officer.
Decisions below
35 In the light of the statements made by Ng, which were ruled by the court to have been voluntarily made, the trial judge held that the defence of ignorance claimed by Ng failed. In the alternative, he held that Ng had not rebutted the presumption under s 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
36 Rosdi’s defence of ignorance of the nature of the contents in the haversack was also rejected by the trial judge. The trial judge noted that Rosdi did not know Rahman well and yet he had been prepared to carry out Rahman’s bidding in a suspicious manner. Rosdi did not even ask Rahman what things he was supposed to collect. Neither did he examine the contents of the haversack. He was paid a handsome sum of $3,000/- for his services on the first occasion. The trial judge held that he had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge under the Act.
37 As regards Roseley, the trial judge rejected his evidence that he had just happened to be where Rosdi was that day and that he had no part in Rosdi’s scheme. The judge held that Roseley had in his statements told a number of material lies evidencing guilt. The statements were recorded many days after the event. The judge found that Roseley was obviously trying to distance himself from Rosdi. The judge was thus satisfied that Roseley was acting in concert with Rosdi.
Issues raised by Ng
38 Before us, counsel for Ng raised two main arguments. First, the trial judge erred in admitting Ng’s statements (other than the cautioned statement). Second, prejudicial evidence, unrelated to the charge, was erroneously admitted at the trial.
39 We have earlier dealt with the first argument. What remains is the second argument. Here, what counsel objected to was the admission at the trial of the evidence relating to the five bundles of drugs found in the boot of his car (which formed the subject matter of a charge against Ng and which was stood down) and of the evidence relating to a previous incident of drug trafficking alluded to by Ng in his statement. Counsel contended that such similar fact evidence should not have been admitted as its prejudicial effect far outweighed its probative value.
40 The rationale for the rule against similar fact evidence, as well as the circumstances where such evidence may be admissible, were enunciated by this court in 
Tan Meng Jee v PP
 
[1996] 2 SLR 422
 as follows:-
The underlying rationale for the rule excluding similar fact evidence is that to allow it in every instance is to risk the conviction of an accused not on the evidence relating to the facts but because of past behaviour or disposition towards crime. Such evidence without doubt has a prejudicial effect against the accused. However, at times, similar facts can be so probative of guilt that to ignore it via the imposition of a blanket prohibition would unduly impair the interests of justice.
Obviously, if the strength of inference to be drawn from similar facts is weak and the effect of the evidence too prejudicial, then such evidence should be disregarded and not be admitted.
41 In our judgment, it was clear that the previous incident had more probative value than its prejudicial effect for two reasons. First, the defence of Ng to the present charge was that he did not know the bundles contained drugs. Thus evidence on the previous occasion where Ng did a similar errand for Ken, and the unusual manner in which the things were to be delivered, went to show that Ng could not be ignorant of what he was conveying for Ken. Second, Ng recognised Rosdi and Roseley because he had seen them on his first trip. This went to establish that Rosdi and Roseley were the two persons to whom Ng was to pass the haversack. The similar fact evidence was clearly connected with the issues before the court. We would also add that in the course of the trial, the judge had made it clear that he would not take into account the potentially prejudicial effect of this similar fact evidence as suggesting that Ng had the propensity to commit the offence of drug trafficking.
42 As regards the evidence relating to the five packages found in the red plastic bag in the boot of Ng’s car, it seemed clear to us that this evidence was adduced as a matter of completeness. Ng stuffed twenty bundles into the haversack and the remaining five into the red plastic bag and put them into the boot. That was the complete story as to what happened when Ng returned to the car after buying the haversack. More importantly, in the course of the trial the judge expressly said that aside from the limited purpose of providing the court with a complete account of the facts, the evidence on the five bundles would be disregarded by him in considering the charges preferred against the three appellants.
43 The charge brought against Ng was one of conspiracy. More often than not, evidence of a conspiracy is to be inferred from acts or conduct. Seldom is there direct evidence of a conspiracy. As this court observed in 
Lai Kam Loy & Ors v PP
 
[1994] 1 SLR 787
:-
… The essence of a conspiracy is agreement and in most cases the actual agreement will take place in private such that direct evidence of it will rarely be available. A frequent method of proving a conspiracy is to show that the words and actions of the parties indicate their concert in the pursuit of a common object or design, giving rise to the inference that their actions must have been co-ordinated by arrangement beforehand. We emphasize that these acts do not of themselves constitute the conspiracy but constitute evidence of the conspiracy.
The fact that there was no direct communication between Ng on the one hand and Rosdi and Roseley on the other did not mean that there could not have been any conspiracy. A conspiracy could very well have existed through third party intermediaries.
44 On the totality of the evidence, we had no doubt that Ng acted in concert with Rosdi and Roseley in leaving the twenty bundles of heroin in his unlocked car parked at the m/s car park to be picked up by Rosdi and/or Roseley.
Issues raised by Rosdi
45 The primary contention of Rosdi was that the trial judge had erred in holding that Rosdi had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge as to what was in the haversack. It was contended that the trial judge:-
(i) erred in finding that Rosdi was engaged in a suspicious transaction, having regard to the fact that he was paid $3,000 for a simple job in relation to the previous errand and the unusual manner of taking delivery;
(ii) failed to appreciate that there was no evidence of any direct communication between Ng and Rosdi;
(iii) erred in not believing that the meeting that day between Rosdi and Roseley was purely coincidental. The fact that there were a number of telephone conversations between them did not necessarily suggest otherwise as they were friends;
(iv) erred in not believing Rosdi that he thought the errands he did for Rahman were in connection with gold bars and jewellery and that Rosdi’s task was to deliver them to a person called ""Boy"" along the main road;
(v) erred in thinking that Rosdi’s failure to check the haversack meant that he knew the nature of its contents; and
(vi) failed to appreciate that, apart from what were in the haversack, there was no evidence, either from Rosdi’s car or his residence, that he was involved in drugs.
46 The fact of the matter was that the trial judge had carefully considered all the evidence before rejecting Rosdi’s claim that he did not know that the errand he carried out for Rahman involved drugs. Rosdi’s defence was that he thought the haversack contained gold bars. The burden was on Rosdi (pursuant to s 18 of the Act) to satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that he did not know that the 20 bundles in the haversack contained drugs. The trial judge, in disbelieving his claim, said:-
(Rosdi) did not know Rahman well at all .. did not know his full name, address or telephone number … He thought that they were gold bars and silver nuggets because Rahman had given him samples for him to look for buyers and he in turn asked the third accused to look for buyers for the gold bars without informing him the selling price or the quality.
He must have realised that he was not engaged in a normal transaction. On the previous occasion, he was paid $3,000 for his services. From the exceptional manner of taking a bag from an unlocked car to the delivery to someone in a taxi, he must have known or suspected something surreptitious was going on. Yet he did not ask Rahman what was being collected and delivered and did not examine the bundles when he had them in his possession.
47 We agreed with the trial judge that the circumstances stank to high heaven. Rosdi must have known what he was involved in. On his own evidence, he said he was paid $3,000 (in respect of the first errand) for the simple task of taking something from an unlocked car and passing it on to another person a short distance away. It would be fair to assume that he would also be paid a similar sum for the present errand. The reward was clearly out of all proportion to the effort required of him. In truth, Rosdi was really being paid handsomely for the risks he assumed. This explained why he did not bother to look into the haversack. As this court stated in 
Yeo Choon Huat v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 217
 (at ¶22):-
Ignorance is a defence only when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of examination; ignorance simpliciter is not enough.
Issues raised by Roseley
48 The arguments raised by counsel for Roseley were that there was no evidence whatsoever to link Roseley to what Rosdi did on the day of their arrest. Counsel submitted that there was clear evidence from both Rosdi and Roseley that their meeting that day near to the m/s car-park was wholly by chance. Counsel asserted that, while it was true that there were some discrepancies and contradictions between Roseley’s testimony in court and what he stated in his statements, most of the discrepancies and contradictions had been explained.
49 Counsel also contended that the trial judge was wrong to have treated certain evidence of Roseley, which was established to be untrue, as corroborative evidence of guilt.
50 The significant lies told by Roseley in his statements were the following:-
(i) In his statements, he said he had never been to the coffeeshop before 27 March 2002 and that he only knew of the stall’s availability on that day itself when Azman told him of it. But his wife, Masrina bte Awi, said that they had been to see the coffeeshop on 24 March 2002. On 26 March 2002, he told her a stall was available in the coffeeshop.
(ii) In his statements he said he left his stall at the Marsiling canteen at 12.30pm. In court, he claimed it was 12.15pm. He blamed the IO for the mistake. But his wife said it was 12.45pm when he left the canteen. Even though in cross-examination by Roseley’s counsel she said she determined the time based on the fact that the last batch (4
th
) of workers at the factory, released at 12.15pm, would have had their lunch, Roseley could not have left the canteen at 12.15pm. He had to help at the stall in view of the crowd.
(iii) In his statements he said that when he first met Rosdi, the latter was carrying the haversack over his shoulder and he could see that the sack was full and heavy. The truth was that, when they first met, Rosdi was not carrying anything. Rosdi went to collect the haversack from the car after they met and chatted a while at Block 410. Roseley admitted that this was an error.
(iv) Both Roseley and Rosdi said that on 27 March 2002, they did not telephone each other. With the production of the call tracing record, Roseley had to admit that this was a lie. So did Rosdi. He explained that, being in fear on account of his arrest, and as he could not remember what happened on 27 March, he simply gave the answer that there were no calls.
51 As the trial judge rightly found, to distance himself from Rosdi, Roseley had to explain why he was in the vicinity of the m/s car park. Thus, Roseley created the story of going to check out a stall in a coffeeshop in that neighbourhood with a view to expanding his business. He claimed to have been told of the availability of the stall only on that very day by Azman (who was not called by Roseley to corroborate what he said). Thus, after his arrest and upon being asked by Insp Lek what was he doing there, he said that he ""wanted to see shop"". But as his wife testified, they had been to see the stall three days earlier. He also knew of the availability of the stall the day before. His wife also said he left the canteen that day at about 12.45pm. He was spotted driving his car at 12.55pm in the vicinity of the m/s car park. So to corroborate his assertion that he had already been to the coffeeshop to observe the crowd there for some 20-30 minutes, and that he had parked his car along the main road illegally, which necessitated him moving it, and to explain why, when he was seen at 12.55pm his car was coming from the opposite direction of Sembawang Drive from where he had allegedly parked his car illegally, he had to claim that he left the canteen at 12.15pm. Otherwise, there would not be sufficient time to do all that. Moreover, to show that he had no part in the doings of Rosdi he claimed that when he first met Rosdi, the latter was carrying the haversack on his shoulder. Furthermore, to establish that their meeting was purely by chance, he had also to claim that they did not speak to each other at all on that day.
52 The trial judge had considered the 
locus classicus, R v Lucas
 
[1981] QB 720
, as well as some local cases, namely, 
PP v Yeo Choon Poh
 
[1994] 2 SLR 867
, 
Tan Hung Yeoh v PP
 
[1999] 3 SLR 93
 and 
Heng Aik Peng v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 469
, and was very much aware that a distinction should be drawn between lies which were evidence of guilt and lies which merely touched on creditworthiness, as an accused person might lie for a variety of reasons not connected with guilt of the offences. The following celebrated passage of Lord Lane in 
Lucas
 was quoted by the trial judge:-
To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of court must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The jury should in appropriate cases be reminded that people sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.
53  In our judgment, in the light of the totality of the evidence, the following findings of the trial judge were amply justified –
I found that the third accused told these lies because he was fearful that the truth about his visit to Sembawang Drive and his involvement with the second accused would incriminate him.
The truth was that he did not go to Sembawang Drive because Azman told him that morning about a stall that was available. I did not believe that he had been to the coffeeshop on 27 March at all. His car was seen going along Sembawang Drive towards the loading bay from the opposite direction of the coffeeshop. The drive along the long route to recce the area was not mentioned in his statements. When he arrived at the loading bay and parked his car he did not go to the coffeeshop as he said he had intended to do.
The second and third accused’s claim that they met by chance was incapable of belief. If it was a chance meeting, the natural thing for them to do would be to exchange greetings then get on with what each had set out to do. For the third accused it was to go to check the coffeeshop as a business prospect. The second accused’s assignment was to collect a bag from an unlocked car in a car park and to deliver it to someone coming in a taxi. He would not want any one not involved in the arrangements to witness his activities and to accompany him for the delivery. The telephone calls between them shortly before they met also suggested that there was an arrangement.
The irresistible inference drawn from all the circumstances was that they had arranged to do what they did; to meet, to take possession of the haversack from the car and deliver it. These acts were done pursuant to their common intention.
Common intention
54 Before we conclude, we must address the issue of common intention, an essential element in the charge preferred against both Rosdi and Roseley. They argued that this element had not been established by the prosecution and therefore their convictions for the offence should be set aside.
55 Section 34 of the Penal Code provides that ""when a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone."" In 
Mahbub Shah v Emperor
 (1945) AIR PC 120, the Privy Council said –
To invoke the aid of s 34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the common intention of all. If this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.
56 Roseley argued that merely being in the company of Rosdi could not give rise to an inference of a common intention with the latter. Moreover, there was no evidence as to what role Roseley was to play pursuant to the common intention. There would have been no point in Roseley being there, risking his own life too. His counsel submitted that the circumstances were consistent with Roseley’s explanation that their meeting was purely by chance and that he had no part in what Rosdi was doing.
57 It is settled law that, for the purpose of s 34, a common intention between two or more accused persons may be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case: see 
Abdul Rahman bin Yusof & Anor v PP
 
[1996] 3 SLR 15
. Counsel for Roseley conceded as much. It should surprise no one that it is often difficult to procure such direct evidence, unless one of the co-offenders should squeal. It has invariably to be inferred from acts or conduct and surrounding circumstances.
58 Bearing in mind the finding of the trial judge that Roseley’s meeting with Rosdi that day was not coincidental, but pursuant to an arrangement, and that one of the calls made by Roseley to Rosdi was when the latter had gone into the car park to pick up the things from the car of Ng, it was reasonable for the trial judge to infer that they were there pursuant to a plan to obtain drugs through a supplier in Johore Bahru for the purpose of trafficking. The fact that Roseley was not at the car when Rosdi took possession of the haversack was not critical. Counsel asked what role Roseley could possibly have played as he did not follow Rosdi into the car park. He need not have been there and risk being implicated. For the purpose of the present case there was no necessity to answer this question. If one were to venture a guess, he could well have been the look-out man. This would explain why Roseley called Rosdi when the latter went into the car park to collect the stuff. The essential question was whether Roseley took part in the scheme with Rosdi to obtain the drugs from Ng’s car and to pass them off to another. In view of the trial judge’s findings, the answer to that question was a clear yes. By virtue of s 34, Roseley was liable for the act of possession of the drugs by Rosdi as if he was in possession of the same for the purpose of delivering them to another. There was simply no basis for us to interfere with the trial judge’s verdict.
Judgment
59 For all the above reasons, we held that there were no merits in the appeals of the three appellants and we therefore dismissed all the appeals.",2003-04-17 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

1          The accused aged 40 pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted murder.  On 16 August 2002 he went to the office of Euro-Asia Garment Manufacturers where his ex-wife Leong Mei Chan worked.  He had with him a fruit knife at the time.  A heated quarrel witnessed by Leong’s colleague, Teo Li Yen, ensued in the course of which the accused was taunted by Leong and during which she was heard to say, “if you want to kill me, you can kill me” and “come, come” (the record referred to by Mr Ang, counsel for the accused, reflected a comma between the words “come, come” but from the circumstances, the exclamation mark would have been a more appropriate emphasis).  Following that the accused then stabbed Leong 14 times.  From the medical report of Dr Sujai Hegde, all the wounds save one were superficial.
 
2          The accused appeared remorseful after the event and promptly called a couple of ‘help-lines’ in search of help, and very quickly surrendered himself in tears to the police.  He was diagnosed by Dr Tommy Tan of the Woodbridge Hospital as suffering from a ‘recurrent depressive disorder’ with a severe current episode.  This illness, he said in his report, was characterised by a low mood, suicidal thoughts, invitability, agitation, loss of appetite and weight.  He was of the view that the accused had acted impulsively ‘when taunted by [Leong]’.
3          Leong was hospitalised for eight days at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Although only one of the wounds was potentially life threatening, it is plain for anyone to see that one fatal wound is more than enough to kill.  That Leong did not die was her good fortune, and in that sense, also the accused’s, for he might otherwise have faced a capital charge.
4          In sentencing him, I took into account the severity of the assault and the pain and danger that he had put Leong through, no matter how much anguish she might have caused him during the unhappy end of their marriage.  From the circumstances, I accept that he had also to struggle against his mental illness and that the assault on Leong may not have been something he would have done in a cooler hour.  His hitherto unblemished record also adds to the scales in his favour.
5          Although Mr Yim described the accused’s act as ‘cold and calculated’, I think that in the context, that may only fairly be said in relation to the planned confrontation with Leong.  It was not his case that the accused had planned to stalk her with the intention of killing her.  The wilfulness of the accused’s conduct must therefore be considered in the circumstances of the case.
6          Consequently, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence would be a term of imprisonment of 5 years and 4 strokes of the cane.  I, therefore, sentenced him to 5 years imprisonment and 4 strokes of the cane.  The term of imprisonment shall take effect from 17 August 2002.",2003-04-14 00:00:00,SG High Court

The facts
1 The first plaintiff (TJ) are a Singapore company (incorporated in 1996) and are in the business of supplying security systems (such as closed circuit television and metal detectors), fire-fighting equipment and other engineering activities. The second and third plaintiffs Ting Siew Hood (Ting) and Leow Chin Bee (Leow) are the managing-director and a director respectively, of TJ whilst the fourth to ninth plaintiffs are sales staff of TJ. Ting is also a major shareholder (45%) of the company. TJ counts amongst its customers the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Prisons Department, the Singapore Civil Defence Force, shopping malls and condominiums.
2 The defendant Ngow Kheong Shen (Ngow) was at the material time (and still is), the system sales manager of a company called Cisco Security Technology Pte Ltd (Cisco) which is in the same business as TJ and has a similar customer base.
3 On 3 June 2002, Ting was informed by Leow that the Corruption Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) wanted to interview Leow. Subsequently Ting himself received a call from the CPIB with a request that Ting and the fifth plaintiff Fiona Lo Ooi Yit (Lo), attend at their office. CPIB wanted to question Leow, Ting and Lo as part of their investigations concerning an officer Simon Sng from the Police Technology Department (PTD).
4. Ting knew Simon Sng as the latter was the officer from PTD who dealt with TJ, since the company was awarded (on 24 September 2001) a contract by the police force for the supply and delivery of walk-through metal detectors. The CPIB questioned Ting whether Simon Sng had requested for money or treats from TJ in their dealings; Ting gave a negative answer.
5 In the evening of 11 June 2002, Ngow (who calls himself Jonathan Ngow) sent an e-mail (the e-mail) to 15 persons within Cisco's organisation; his message (see1AB9) stated:-
This is to share with you that TJ System (sales staff and directors) has been called up by CPIB for investigation on bribery made to a police officer from Police Technology Dept, on 6 June 2002.
CPIB are reviewing all information relating to projects awarded to TJ System by PTD in the last 4 years. From a reliable source, PTD has internally debar TJ System for future projects, or any supplier/vendor who works with them to bid for police projects, as CPIB has possessed ""strong"" evidence against TJ.
If you have any dealings with TJ, please restrain (sic) from doing it as TJ System is our competitor and we should not help our competitor to grow.
Regards
Jonathan Ngow
Manager, System Sales
Cisco Security Technology
Later that same month, TJ received from an anonymous sender through the post, a copy of the e-mail; the envelope containing the e-mail was marked for Ting's attention.
6 Ting complained the e-mail was malicious and untrue of TJ, its directors and sales staff; there were repercussions. In June-July 2002, Ting was asked by four (4) persons (including one Philip Lee from Cisco) in the industry whether there was any truth in the allegation ─ that TJ was in trouble with and that, CPIB had obtained evidence of the company's corruption with PTD. One of them had learnt of the e-mail from an unnamed Cisco employee. Ting was understandably upset by such grist from the rumour mill since TJ, its directors (himself included) and sales staff had never engaged in corrupt practices or offered bribes to officers from the PTD. Moreover, no one from TJ had been called up for further investigations by the CPIB after June 2002, no action had been taken by CPIB against TJ or anyone in the company and, Simon Sng still worked for the PTD. Neither had TJ been notified by PTD it was nor has it been, barred from police projects since June 2002. Indeed, in September 2002, TJ tendered to supply night vision binoculars to the PTD (which tender is still under consideration); the company continues to enjoy a good working relationship with the police. Further, Ngow (whom he had met 3-4 times) did not contact Ting (or any of TJ's sales staff) to verify the truth of the allegation/rumour of the company being investigated for corruption/bribery before the e-mail was sent/circulated.
7 Consequently, Ting contacted TJ's solicitors shortly after receipt of the e-mail and instructed them to demand an apology from Ngow together with a retraction of the defamatory allegations contained in the e-mail. Ngow refused to and did not, apologise. Instead, through his solicitors' letter dated 1 July 2002, Ngow contended that the words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege as, the e-mail contained a standard qualification stating the information contained therein was privileged and only meant for the intended addressees who were his colleagues, with whom Ngow shared a common and corresponding interest in the subject matter of the publication and, was sent to them in the ordinary course of business. The letter went on to deny that Ngow had acted maliciously in publishing the words.
8 Not surprisingly, Ngow's solicitors (Peter Chua & Partners) were then asked by TJ's solicitors whether they had and upon their confirmation that they did have, his instructions to accept service, the writ of summons herein was served on the former.
The pleadings
9 In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs alleged that by their plain and ordinary meaning, the allegations in the e-mail meant or were understood to mean, 
inter alia
 that:
(i) the plaintiffs had been investigated by the CPIB on the charge of bribing a police officer from the PTD and/or are guilty of bribing or attempting to bribe a police officer from the PTD;
(ii) CPIB is looking into the charges alleged very seriously;
(iii) CPIB is reviewing all information relating to projects awarded to TJ by the PTD in the last 4 years;
(iv) CPIB has done a thorough check on the projects awarded to TJ in the last 4 years and/or CPIB has already gathered 'strong' evidence in favour of the allegations of bribery;
(v) the plaintiffs have been dishonest in their business dealings and/or are unreliable business associates;
(vi) the first plaintiff, TJ has been awarded projects by the PTD over the last 4 years and/or the reason why TJ was ever awarded projects by the PTD was because of bribery;
(vii) PTD has internally debarred TJ and/or any supplier or vendor who works with TJ from future projects and/or from bidding for future police projects;
(viii) the plaintiffs have conspired with the suppliers and vendors in committing bribery;
(ix) the plaintiffs are guilty of corruption and/or corruptly procuring the withdrawal of tenders and/or bribery of a member of the public body and/or having attempted bribery of which all of the above alleged crimes are punishable with imprisonment; and or
(x) the plaintiffs possess the propensity to bribe people in order to garner projects, especially with respect to PTD projects in the last 4 years.
10 The plaintiffs alleged that by reason of the publication of the e-mail, the plaintiffs had been gravely injured in their professional standing, reputation and goodwill, have been exposed to public scandal, odium, contempt and ridicule and have suffered loss and damage.
11 In support of their claim for aggravated and exemplary damages, the plaintiffs relied on the fact that Ngow failed to make any or any proper, inquiry of them prior to publication, notwithstanding that Ngow knew or ought to have known, the gravity of the allegations and the width of publication they would achieve. They alleged that Ngow acted with reckless disregard as to whether the allegations in the e-mail were libellous, having calculated that the prospect to his material advantage or commercial benefit therefrom, far outweighed any compensation payable to the plaintiffs. His mode of publication (by e-mail) showed that Ngow intended the defamatory remarks to be republished as, it was foreseeable that there would be widespread republication of the e-mail by the recipients in Cisco, given the ease of transmission of such messages.
12 The plaintiffs next alleged that Ngow had refused to apologise for the offending allegations, despite being given an opportunity by the plaintiffs' solicitors.
13 Further, on or about 11 June 2002, Ngow had authored and published a further sentence contained in an e-mail and sent it to various persons, which sentence reads as follows:-
If you have any dealings with TJ, please restrain from doing it as TJ System is our competitor and we should not help our competitor to grow.
The plaintiffs alleged that the above sentence showed that the e-mail was made with the dominant intention of causing injury to the plaintiffs, not Ngow's desire to perform a relevant duty or protect a relevant interest.
14 In the defence he filed, Ngow admitted sending the e-mail, he 
inter alia
:-
(i) averred he had learnt from the market in early June 2002 that TJ, its sales staff and directors had been called up by CPIB on bribes made to a police officer from the PTD;
(ii) contended he wrote the e-mail to the addressees who were his office superiors, his peers or his subordinates, as fair comments on a matter of public interest;
(iii) alternatively, the occasion was one of qualified privilege as he acted in good faith and intended that only the addressees would be the recipients. He and the recipients had a common interest in the subject matter of the e-mail in the reasonable protection of his own legitimate interests and those of his colleagues;
(iv) asserted that the e-mail contained privileged/confidential information and was meant to be read by his colleagues only;
(v) denied the words in the e-mail bore the defamatory meanings alleged by the plaintiffs.
15 Ngow admitted the positions held by the second to ninth plaintiffs in TJ. Finally, he admitted that he had refused to apologise to the plaintiffs and to retract the allegations made in the e-mail.
The evidence
(i) the plaintiffs' case
16 Before I go on to consider the testimony of the plaintiffs’ witnesses, I need to make one observation. Not all the individual plaintiffs filed their affidavits of evidence-in-chief nor testify; those who did not testify were Lo (the fifth plaintiff), the seventh, eighth and ninth plaintiffs. Ting testified for himself as well as for his company. When his cross-examination commenced, Ting testified that as the managing-director of TJ, he was 
very sure
 he had the authority to pursue this claim on behalf of his employees including the fifth, seventh, eight and ninth plaintiffs; he had not but could, ask them for their authorisation if counsel for Ngow insisted. Whilst he agreed that he and Leow were the prime movers behind this litigation, Ting disagreed with counsel that the other individuals were only nominal plaintiffs.
17 I turn now to other aspects of Ting's cross-examination. Ting testified he barely knew Ngow, having last met the latter at a security show in October 2000. He did not know whether Ngow had a grudge against him, whether CPIB investigations on TJ and its staff (including himself) were still pending, nor whether the copy of the e-mail he received in the post was an unauthorised republication. He accepted that Ngow did not intend to republish the e-mail to the plaintiffs and, the message was not meant for him/other plaintiffs. In his written testimony, Ting had deposed that he had faced awkward situations by which he meant, that he faced difficulties in explaining when his customers called him. He candidly admitted that he did not know whether the e-mail was the source of what his customers had heard, about TJ's alleged problems with CPIB.
18 Ting (PW1) was questioned on the contents of the e-mail; he denied they were substantially correct. On para 1, he pointed out that the date (6 June 2002) was incorrect; he and the others were called for interview by CPIB on 3 June 2002. Paragraph 2 was also incorrect ─ the plaintiffs were only assisting the CPIB in investigations whereas the e-mail stated that CPIB was reviewing all information relating to the projects awarded to TJ by PTD in the last four years. What made it worse was Ngow's statement that PTD had internally debarred TJ from future projects together with suppliers/vendors who works with TJ to bid for police projects and his use of the words 
'strong evidence'
 when TJ had not been charged with let alone convicted of, any offence. Counsel suggested to Ting the statement meant the opposite ─ that Ngow had heard from reliable sources that PTD had not officially debarred TJ from future projects and were adopting a 'wait and see' attitude. Not surprisingly, Ting disagreed. As for para 3, Ting explained that malice was to be found in Ngow's use of the words 
'we should not help our competitor to grow
' even though it was a request which Ngow addressed to his colleagues. Ting however agreed that TJ and Cisco are competitors. Even so, when re-examined, Ting complained Ngow's intention in the e-mail was to ensure that TJ did not grow.
19 Of the four (4) persons who had asked Ting about the allegations in the e-mail, only one (Darrell Lim) was willing to be a witness for the plaintiffs; I shall refer to his evidence later. Ting explained that the others whom he had named were reluctant to testify for the plaintiffs because it affected their rice-bowl, not that they did not exist or would not have supported the plaintiffs' case, as counsel suggested. However, none of them were subpoenaed to testify for the plaintiffs. Ting was certain the source of the rumours on his company and staff could not have been other than the e-mail because, only three (3) persons knew of the CPIB investigations, namely himself, Leow and the fifth plaintiff. None of TJ's staff would have wanted the world to know about the investigations. However, Ting could not say whether PTD was the source of the leak.
20 I move next to the testimony of Leow (who is also known as Jimmy Leow). Leow (PW3) testified he was very upset when in early July 2002, he was contacted by an acquaintance (Jimmy Tan) from Cisco who said Cisco's sales department had told the latter that TJ was being investigated for corrupt practices and CPIB had obtained evidence of such corruption; however there was no mention of the e-mail. Leow deposed that there was absolutely no truth in the rumour as neither he, nor any of his sales staff, had been involved in or engaged in, corrupt practices in tendering for projects from PTD. Like Ting, Leow pointed out that Ngow never contacted him to verify whether, TJ was really being investigated, CPIB had obtained evidence of TJ's corruption or if TJ had in fact been barred from all future police projects. Neither did Ngow contact any of the company's sales staff to verify the contents in the e-mail. He had immediately reported to Ting what was told to him by Jimmy Tan. Subsequently, he was shown by Ting the e-mail which came in the post. Although he was not acquainted with Ngow, Leow testified that TJ's customers, its competitors and business associates all knew he was/is a director of the company as, he had distributed his name cards showing his designation, in the course of his business dealings.
21 When Leow took the stand, he produced further documents (see 1AB113-115) which showed that as late as 22 November 2002, TJ had been invited by PTD to tender for the supply of portable handheld explosive vapour and particle detectors. The company had submitted its tender on 9 December 2002 and on 16 December 2002, PTD had made a written request of TJ to provide a sample unit for the department's evaluation. Further, on 3 January 2003, the company through the fourth, sixth and eight plaintiffs, had accepted an invitation from PTD to attend a briefing, for the purpose of a new tender exercise for the supply, testing and commissioning of camera surveillance systems for three (3) locations in Singapore.
22 I turn now to the testimony of the reluctant witness Darrell Lim (Lim). I describe him as reluctant because when he took the stand, he requested the court to lift the subpoena which had been issued against him, which request I rejected. Lim (PW2) clarified that Jimmy Tan, the source who conveyed information regarding the alleged investigation of TJ for corruption, did not/does not work for Cisco but was/is a director of Cisco's Indonesian company called Ciscomas. Lim said Jimmy Tan returns to Singapore from Indonesia once a month and would go to Cisco's office upon his return. Lim was told that Jimmy Tan had heard the rumours from staff in Cisco's sales or other departments. I should point out at this juncture that Jimmy Tan was not a witness for either party.
23 The testimony of the fourth plaintiff Wang Yong Hong (Wang) touched on a conversation he had with one Teo Lian Chye (Teo) of Secure Tech Engineering, who he understood, was a subcontractor of Cisco. Like Leow's testimony concerning what Jimmy Tan said, Wang's evidence concerning what was told to him by Teo in Hokkien (concerning CPIB's investigation on TJ for corruption) was hearsay as, Teo did not testify. In any event, no names from Cisco were mentioned by Teo.
24 In cross-examination, Wang agreed that Teo could have heard the rumour from sources other than Cisco, which in itself is a big organisation (with more than 3,000 staff). Counsel then suggested to Wang who agreed, that there is a tendency for such information to snowball during which process it becomes less and less accurate. Wang was shown the e-mail 1-3 weeks after he conveyed to Ting what Teo had said.
25 Wang clarified that although he was supposed to attend the tender briefing of PTD on 6 January 2003 with the sixth and eighth plaintiffs, he was substituted at the last minute by a representative of a subcontractor (Vector Infotech) of TJ.
26 The last witness of the plaintiffs was the sixth plaintiff. Foong Kok Seng (Foong) is a sales engineer who has been with TJ since 1999. Foong (PW5) focussed on a conversation he had with his company's subcontractor Tok Teck Bee (Tok) of Trit Engineering and Services (who had in turn heard it from Teo) wherein the latter said that TJ was being investigated by the CPIB and, that TJ was strongly suspected of having committed corruption. He did not know the source of the rumour. Foong disagreed with counsel that there was no connotation of guilt from what Tok said; he understood the words to mean that TJ was guilty of corruption. He denied he thought the words were defamatory only because Ting told him they were so. Subsequently, Foong had sight of the e-mail together with other staff, at a meeting called by Ting.
(ii) the defendant's case
27. I start with Ngow's evidence. Ngow (DW1) is the senior manager for direct sales at Cisco, having risen through the ranks since he joined Cisco as sales executive in May 1994. His company is part of the Cisco group in Singapore which comprises of seven (7) other companies. In his written testimony, Ngow explained how he came to know of the investigations by CPIB of TJ. One Tay Ko Khee (Tay) his course-mate at Ngee Ann Polytechnic was, until 1996, a project officer of the PTD. Tay was aware that Cisco had business dealings with and was a competitor of, TJ. On or about 10 June 2002, Tay informed Ngow (probably at a social meeting one evening) that:-
a. on or about 6 June 2002, some if not all, the plaintiffs had been called up by CPIB for investigations into bribery of a police officer in the PTD;
b. CPIB was reviewing all information relating to projects awarded to TJ by PTD in the last few years;
c. pending CPIB's investigation, he assumed that PTD would be very careful with awarding any future police projects for a period of time to TJ or any supplier/vendor of the company, until the investigations reveal no offence has been committed.
28 Following on the information he received from Tay, Ngow sent out the e-mail on the evening (6.38pm) of 11 June 2002. He justified his action on the basis that the e-mail was sent in the ordinary course of business, the recipients had an interest in the subject matter and an interest in receiving the e-mail; the e-mail was also confidential. In that regard he and other employees of Cisco had signed declarations, which drew their attention to s 5 of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213) and s 10 of The Commercial & Industrial Security Corporation Act (Cap 47). In his Declaration made on 16 May 1994 he had stated:-
I understand and agree that all official information, no matter what its security grading may be, acquired by me in the course of my duties is to be treated as of a strictly confidential nature, and is not to be published or communicated by me, either during or after my service, to any person in any form whatsoever, except in the course of my official duties.
I further understand that any breach or neglect of this responsibility is a disciplinary offence, and may also render me liable to prosecution under the Official Secrets Act or The Commercial & Industry Security Corporation Act.
As such, employees of Cisco understood that all internal e-mails should not be republished in any form whatsoever, to anyone outside the Cisco group. To reinforce his argument, Ngow had two (2) addressees of the e-mail to testify for him, one was his superior and general manager Teo Beng Lee (DW4), while the other was his colleague Lian Mei Yuan (DW3) who is a project officer.
29 Ngow pointed out he had included in the last paragraph of the e-mail, the following standard qualification:-
Privileged/confidential information may be contained in this message. If you are not the intended addressee (or responsible for delivery to such person), you must not copy or deliver this message to anyone. Any use of its contents is strictly prohibited. Please destroy the message and notify the sender of this error.
Consequently, he did not expect or foresee that recipients of the e-mail would republish the same, as it was not meant to be read by anyone outside the Cisco group. In cross-examination, he modified this statement further to say that it was alright to distribute the e-mail within his company, but not to the Cisco group at large.
30 Ngow deposed in his affidavit (of evidence-in-chief) that he understood the e-mail to have the following meanings:-
a. some if not all, the plaintiffs had been called up by CPIB for investigation on bribery made to a police officer on 6 June 2002;
b. the CPIB were reviewing all information relating to projects awarded to TJ by PTD in the last four (4) years;
c. it was natural and logical that the PTD would not award any future projects to TJ or any supplier/vendor who works with TJ to bid for police projects as CPIB possessed strong evidence against TJ with respect to allegations of bribery;
d. if any of his colleagues at Cisco, namely the recipients of the e-mail had dealings with TJ, they should refrain from starting new projects with the company;
e. TJ was identified as a competitor of Cisco who could affect the success of Cisco's business.
He did not intend to nor did his e-mail, mean what the plaintiffs alleged in their statement of claim; neither was he actuated by malice. His desire was to perform his duties (as the senior manager of direct sales) and to protect his own legitimate interests by giving information to his colleagues (hence his use of the word 
share
 in the opening words of the e-mail) which he deemed relevant to them to succeed in their business. Re-examined, Ngow explained that TJ was a supplier of Cisco and sometimes, quotations for jobs by his company would include equipment supplied by TJ. This aspect of his testimony was confirmed by his general manager Teo Beng Lee, who produced various purchase orders (see 3AB8-12) issued by Cisco to TJ in 2002 in support thereof.
31 In cross-examination, Ngow :-
a. said the addressees of the e-mail included, his senior manager of the installation department (Low Eng Thai), his maintenance department manager (James Ler), senior projects manager of the installation department (Lim Bon Kee) and senior sales executives from his department who were in the commercial segment;
b. said although he had no proof other departments had dealings with TJ, nevertheless he disagreed those departments had no interest in the information contained in the e-mail;
c. gave the total staff in the departments of all the recipients as about 60;
d. said he had no regrets about sending the e-mail, maintaining he had chosen his words carefully;
e. contended the contents were true to the best of his knowledge (save for the period in para 2 which should read 
'for the last few years
' instead of 
'the last 4 years'
 which mistake was due to his 
oversight
);
f. felt he was making an important announcement in his capacity as a senior staff member when he wrote the e-mail;
g. disagreed that his choice of the words 
'share with you
' instead of 
'this is to inform you'
 meant that he was not obliged to pass on the information he heard from Tay but he wanted to;
h. said it did not occur to him to call a meeting of interested colleagues to inform them of what Tay had said instead of sending the e-mail, nor did it occur to him that Tay's information may not be completely accurate, given that Tay had left PTD for 6 years;
i. said he did not think the five (5) recipients from his department would pass on the e-mail because of the Official Secrets Act;
j. said he was unaware that TJ supplied security systems to both commercial and residential projects;
k. said on his inquiry of Tay, he was told that the information 
came from the horse's mouth ─
 the person at PTD who was being investigated;
l. agreed that police officers are also bound by the Official Secrets Act;
m. deleted the word 
'any'
 before 
supplier/vendor'
 in para 2 line 2 of the e-mail and said he meant Cisco by the words 
'supplier/vendor
'.
n. he meant 
refrain
 when he used the word 
restrain
 in the last paragraph/sentence;
o. disagreed that the e-mail did not accurately reflect what Tay said even though he (but not Tay) had used the words 
strong evidence
.
32 When he received the plaintiffs' solicitors letter (dated 21 June 2002) demanding a retraction and an apology, Ngow's immediate reaction was that the security of his company had been breached, so he raised the matter with his superiors. He left it to his company's internal security department to check the e-mail logs at the office for the source of the leak. He had handed the plaintiffs' solicitors' letter to his solicitors, telling them the contents of the e-mail were true. However, he acknowledged that this was not reflected in their reply dated 1 July 2002. Instead, his solicitors claimed qualified privilege for the offending words and relied on the confidentiality clause appended at the end of the e-mail to say the e-mail was only intended for the addressees. Ngow denied his main intention after receipt of the plaintiffs' solicitors' letter of demand was to find out who had passed on the e-mail to and cause inconvenience, to TJ.
33 Counsel drew Ngow's attention to the fact that Tay's reason for informing him about the CPIB investigation differed from Ngow's. Whereas Ngow claimed he disseminated the information to notify/warn his colleagues who had business dealings with TJ (see para 16 of his affidavit), Tay had in his affidavit (para 6), deposed that he gave the information to Ngow out of concern that any future collaboration or joint efforts between Cisco and TJ would be stuck or delayed, because of the CPIB investigation. Ngow explained the discrepancy as arising from a different 
choice of words
 disagreeing with counsel's suggestion that his explanation was an afterthought, after these proceedings were commenced. Ngow also disagreed with counsel that with less competition from rivals (be it from TJ or other parties), Cisco's market share would increase. He denied he had not taken reasonable steps to verify the truth before he sent out the e-mail.
34 Tay testified for Ngow and I now turn to his evidence. Tay (DW2) described himself as a security equipment dealer, who had worked as a project officer with PTD between 1990-96. Tay testified he passed on to Ngow the information on CPIB investigation as he knew Ngow's company had business dealings with TJ; he confirmed he conveyed to Ngow what was set out in para 30 (a) and (b) above. He had also told Ngow:-
pending the CPIB investigation, he presumed that PTD would be very careful with awarding any future police projects to [TJ] or any supplier/vendor who works with [TJ] for a period of time or until the investigation reveals no offence has been committed.
35 Cross-examined, Tay explained that when he was with the PTD, his duties included evaluating and awarding, tenders. Although six (6) years had lapsed since his departure from the PTD, Tay still had many contacts (30-40) in the department including one Simon Sng, the officer who was under investigation by the CPIB; hence, the information he was able to obtain and pass on to, Ngow.
36 Shown a copy of the e-mail by counsel for the plaintiffs, Tay agreed it went beyond what he had told Ngow, in particular the following sentence in para 2:-
From a reliable source, PTD had internally debarred TJ System for future projects, or any supplier/vendor who works with them to bid for police projects as CPIB has possessed ""strong"" evidence against TJ.
He had sight of the e-mail for the first time when it was shown to him by Ngow at the time (September 2002) he was approached to be a witness. When he was re-examined, Tay said it was 
possible
 he may have used the words 
strong evidence
 when he spoke to Ngow.
The issues
37 The following two (2) issues need to be determined in this case:-
(i) are the words in the e-mail complained of by the plaintiffs defamatory?
(ii) if the words are defamatory, do they refer to or are capable of referring to, each of the other eight (8) plaintiffs, besides TJ?
Before the issues can be determined, it is necessary to look at some basic principles in the law of defamation.
The law
38 I note that counsel in their closing submissions proceeded on the premise that the offending words were indeed defamatory; both parties had focused on the second issue and on whether the defences raised in the pleadings had been made out. For the first issue, I turn to 
Gatley on Libel and Slander
 (9 ed) where (at p 7 para 1.5) the learned authors state:
What is defamatory?
 There is no wholly satisfactory definition of a defamatory imputation. Three formulae have been particularly influential:
(1) Would the imputation tend to ""lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally?"" 
1
(2) Would the imputation tend to cause others to shun or avoid the plaintiff? 
2
(3) Would the words tend to expose the plaintiff to ""hatred, contempt and ridicule"" 
3
The question ""what is defamatory?"" relates to the nature of the statement made by the defendant; words may be defamatory even if they are believed by no one and even if they are true, though in the latter case they are not of course actionable.
39 There is little doubt that the following extract in the e-mail is defamatory of TJ
…CPIB has possessed strong evidence against TJ.
Read in their context the words (reinforced by the words 
internally debar TJ Systems for future projects
) impute the possible commission of a criminal offence (bribery) by the company or, TJ's imminent prosecution for corrupting a police officer/public servant. Giving those words the most innocuous interpretation, they meant that the company was suspected of having bribed PTD staff to procure projects. The sting of the defamation was in Ngow's use of the words (i) 
investigation for bribery
, (ii) 
internally debar from future projects
 and (iii) 
strong evidence
, the logical conclusion following upon (iii) being that ultimately, charges for abetting corruption would be preferred against TJ under s 109 read with s 161 of the Penal Code Cap 224 or, the company would be charged with corruption under ss 5(b) or 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act Cap 241.
40 What then of the other plaintiffs? Their counsel relied on 
Lee Kuan Yew v Davies & Others
 
[1989] SLR 1063
 for his submission that Ngow's statements, taken in the context of the whole of the e-mail, defamed TJ's two (2) directors and six (6) sales staff as particularised in para 9 above. Ngow had stated (in parentheses) in the e-mail 
sales staff and directors
. It is not disputed that the second and third plaintiffs are directors of TJ whereas the remaining plaintiffs are sales staff of TJ. Their respective positions were in fact admitted by Ngow in his Defence. It cannot be seriously disputed that a legal entity like TJ can only act through its human organs namely, its directors and staff. If TJ indeed attempted to bribe some police officer(s) in the PTD, the company could only have done so through its directors and other representatives. Sales personnel would logically be the department of TJ which would be involved in such bribery or attempts as, the company's sales staff are the ones who sell/market the company's security systems to the PTD.
41 The question that follows is, would the defamatory words, in their context lead reasonable persons acquainted with these plaintiffs to believe they were being referred to in the e-mail? To answer that question, I refer to a case cited by the plaintiffs.
42 In 
Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd
 [1944] 1 ALL ER 495, the House of Lords had to determine whether the defendants' publication of the following words in their newspaper on 1 July 1941
But the quislings on whom Hitler flatters himself he can build a pro-German movement within the Soviet Union are an émigré group called Mlado Russ or Young Russia.
They are a minute body professing a pure Fascist ideology who have long sought a suitable fuehrer -- I know with what success. Established in France and the United States they claim to have secret agents able to enter or leave the Soviet Union at will.
could refer to the plaintiff, who was not specifically mentioned at all in the article. Evidence was adduced at the trial that the plaintiff had joined the Young Russia Party in 1928, that he became assistant representative of the Young Russia Movement in Great Britain in 1935, and representative of the Movement in Great Britain in 1938 and then head of the British branch of the Movement. The headquarters of the Movement were in Paris until June 1940, when they were removed to America. The trial judge had held that the words of the libel did refer to the plaintiff whereas the Court of Appeal decided otherwise and dismissed the plaintiff's action. Their lordships (Viscount Simon LC) held that when defamatory words are written or spoken of a class of persons, it is not open to a member of that class to say that the words were spoken of him unless there was something to show that the words about the class refer to him as an individual. As there was nothing to show that the words referred to the appellant as an individual, his claim/appeal failed.
43 The following passage from the judgment of Viscount Simon LC (at 497F) is particularly relevant to our case:
There are two questions involved in the attempt to identify the appellant as the person defamed. The first question is a question of law – can the article having regard to its language, be regarded as capable of referring to the appellant? The second question is a question of fact, namely, does the article in fact lead reasonable people who know the appellant to the conclusion that it does refer to him? Unless the first question can be answered in favour of the appellant, the second question does not arise, and where the trial judge went wrong was in treating evidence to support the identification in fact as governing the matter, when the first question is necessarily, as a matter of law, to be answered in the negative.
44 Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the defamatory words indeed referred to the second to ninth plaintiffs as, the court can take into account all relevant circumstances which might lead persons reading the libel and who are acquainted with these plaintiffs, to believe they were being referred to, citing inter alia 
Vlasic v Federal Capital Press of Australia
 [1976] 9 ACTR 1, 
DHKW Marketing v Nature's Farm Pte Ltd
 
[1999] 2 SLR 400
 and, my decision in 
Mohd Hussein v Chew How Yang Eddie
 
[1995] 3 SLR 177
 to support his proposition.
45 
Gatley on Libel and Slander
 (supra) at pp 161 and 163 contains the following passages:-
7.2 Plaintiff need not be referred to by name
The test is whether the plaintiff may reasonably be understood to be referred to by words.
7.3 Statement capable of referring to the plaintiff
The statement must 'identify' the plaintiff, that is to say, it must be capable of referring to him. The issue of identification is to be decided on principles similar to those which govern the question of whether the words are capable of a defamatory meaning…The question is not whether anyone 
did
 identify the plaintiff but whether persons who were acquainted with the plaintiff 
could
 identify him from the words used.
46 Applying the test culled from the cases and from the textbook authority, it would be reasonable for anyone acquainted with the fourth to ninth plaintiffs to associate them with the allegation in the e-mail, more so in the case of the second and third plaintiffs, who are known in the security systems industry as directors of the first plaintiff. Consequently, I answer the first question of law as well as the second question of fact posed by Viscount Simon, in the positive.
47 I pause to make certain observations at this juncture. Firstly, in para 2 of his Defence, Ngow admitted sending out the e-mail but 
denied,
 para 5 of the statement of claim. Does his denial of that paragraph relate to the allegation that the e-mail was defamatory of the plaintiffs? If so, why did he go on to plead that the words were fair comment on a matter of public interest as a defence and not in the alternative? Implicit in the plea is an admission that the e-mail did defame the plaintiffs. My impression is reinforced by Ngow's further defences of qualified privilege, justification and, his counsel's closing submissions wherein he submitted there was lack of publication of the e-mail to sustain the plaintiffs' action. Yet, in paras 9 to 18 of his Defence, Ngow denied that the e-mail contained the defamatory meanings ascribed to the words by the plaintiffs.
48 I now turn my attention to the defences raised by Ngow. Before the defence of fair comment on a matter of public interest can succeed, the law requires that the words are comment and not a statement of fact (see 
Gatley on Libel and Slander
 p 248 para 12.2). Based on the definition alone, this defence fails 
in limine
. I agree with the plaintiffs' closing submission that by no stretch of the imagination, can Ngow's assertions of fact regarding TJ, its directors and sales staff, be construed as comments, bearing in mind that this defence is normally raised by the press and broadcasters. One can even question what public interest was being served by Ngow's statements relating to the alleged misconduct of a competitor of his company, when the latter had yet to be charged.
49 According to 
Gatley on
 
Libel and Slander
 (p 328 para 14.4), the main classes of statements which come under the defence of qualified privilege at common law are:-
(i) statements made in the discharge of a public or private duty;
(ii) statements made on a subject matter in which the defendant has a legitimate interest;
(iii) statements made by way of complaint about those with public authority or responsibility;
(iv) reports of parliamentary proceedings;
(v) copies of or extracts from public registers;
(vi) reports of judicial proceedings.
Only (i) and (ii) can possibly apply in Ngow's defence. In this regard, I can do no better than to rely on an authority cited by his counsel namely 
Chen Chang v Central Christian Church
 
[1999] 1 SLR 94
 where our appellate court (at p 113 para 56) adopted Lord Atkinson's definition (at 334) of qualified privilege in 
Adam v Ward
 [1971] AC 309:
A privileged occasion is….an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest, or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential.
The plaintiffs submitted that this defence also failed because (some of) the recipients had no interest to receive the e-mail. This was because nine (9) of the 15 recipients came from departments other than Ngow's; the e-mail was also forwarded to his general manager Teo Beng Lee and 5 sales staff, one of whom (Lian Mei Yuan) testified that she had no dealings or contact with TJ, as she was from the residential not the commercial, segment of the sales department. No evidence was led on the need for the general manager to know the contents of the e-mail. I note that none of the other recipients testified on why they needed to be informed by Ngow on the contents of the e-mail. Consequently, Ngow has not discharged the burden of proof to succeed on this defence.
50 Moving next to the issue of publication, it was Ngow's contention as part of his defence, that the e-mail was meant for circulation to the 15 addressees only, relying on the concluding paragraph on confidentiality (para 29 
supra
), in the e-mail. Consequently, if there was further publication or circulation of the e-mail, he should not be held responsible or liable, as that was not his intention. Ngow's counsel relied on a passage from the 8
th
 edition of 
Gatley on Libel and Slander
 (at p 84) to support this argument; it reads:-
231 Publication: Intention and foresight
As a general rule, when a letter is addressed to a particular person, the writer is not responsible except for a publication to that person. If A addresses to B a letter defamatory of him, and B shows, or reads, the letter to C, the publication of the letter to C, the publication of the letter by B to C is his own act, for which A will not be liable.
However the 9th edition of the same textbook also contains the following passage (at p 136)
6.12 Loss of defamatory document and mistake at common law
The defendant is liable for unintentional publication of defamatory matter to a third person unless he can show that it was not due to any want of care on his part.
Granted, it may have been Ngow’s intention to limit circulation of the e-mail to only the 15 recipients but, it was also naïve of him to expect the supposedly privileged communication clause he appended to the e-mail to be respected, in a large organisation like Cisco. It should have been foreseeable, as the plaintiffs submitted, that the e-mail could be easily re-published. However, there was no evidence either way, to prove that the e-mail was/was not further circulated by one or more of the 15 addressees, or whether one such recipient was prompted to post a hard copy to TJ. It could also have been the case that one of the 15 (original) addressees was the anonymous sender of the e-mail to TJ.
51 Ngow’s reliance in this regard on s 5 of the Official Secrets Act Cap 213 is misconceived. The relevant extracts of section reads as follows:-
(1) If any person having in his possession or control any secret official code word, countersign or password, or any photograph, drawing, plan, model article, note, document or information which —
(a) …………………
(b) ………………….
(c) ………………….
(d) …………………
(e) he has obtained, or to which he has had access, owing to his position as a person who holds or has held office under the Government, or as a person who holds, or has held a contract made on behalf of the Government or any specified organisation, or as a person who is or has been employed under a person who holds or has held such an office or contract,
does any of the following:
(i) communicates directly or indirectly any such information or thing as aforesaid to any foreign Power other than a foreign Power to whom he is duly authorised to communicate it, or to any person other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate it or to whom it is his duty to communicate it;
(ii) uses any such information or thing as aforesaid for the benefit of any foreign Power other than a foreign Power for whose benefit he is authorised to use it, or in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of Singapore;
(iii) ………………
(iv) ……………….
that person shall be guilty of an offence.
Clearly, s 5 of The Official Secrets Act Cap 213 affords no defence to Ngow; it has no application to the e-mail, which did not even state the facts correctly.
52 Reliance on The Commercial & Industrial Security Corporation Act (Cap 47) does not help to advance Ngow’s case any further either, as can be seen from s 10 which reads:-
(1) Except for the purpose of the performance of his duties or the exercise of his functions or when lawfully required to do so by any court or under the provisions of any written law, no member, officer or employee of the Corporation shall disclose to any person any information relating to the affairs of the Corporation or of any other person which he has acquired in the performance of his duties or the exercise of his functions.
(2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.
It would be straining the language of the section to say that, in relaying to the 15 addressees of the e-mail what he had heard from Tay, Ngow was 
disclosing information relating to the affairs of the Corporation…in the performance of his duties or the exercise of his functions
 when, what he circulated had nothing to do with his company save that it was a competitor of TJ, the subject of the e-mail.
53 Ngow’s counsel had argued that (Darrell) Lim's testimony was hearsay, as was Ting's vis a vis what they both had heard, since the sources of their information did not testify. In fact, Lim had testified that he did not know about the e-mail at the material time, until shown a copy much later. I agree that Lim’s testimony was founded on hearsay, so was Ting’s, where he referred to other persons asking him about the allegations contained in the e-mail. However, it is highly unlikely (as Ting pointed out) that he or Leow or the fifth plaintiff (Lo Ooi Yit) could have been the source of the allegations; these three (3) would be the last persons to want the world to know they, and or their company, were being investigated for corruption. The only other source of the leak would have been the PTD, on which there was no evidence as, no representative from the department testified. As was the case with Lim’s evidence, Tay’s testimony was based on hearsay as Simon Sng, the police officer who allegedly informed Tay he was the subject of CPIB investigations, did not take the stand.
54 Consequently, the defences raised by Ngow have not been made out. What I found to be reprehensible conduct on his part was Ngow’s total lack of regret/remorse for what can only be said to be an irresponsible act

 sending out an e-mail containing such serious allegations without taking steps to verify what he had heard; even worse, embellishing the allegations in the process. He had also refused to apologise for and to retract, the allegations made in the e-mail. Whilst I do not agree with the closing submission of the plaintiffs that Ngow had published the e-mail maliciously, I would agree that he had done so recklessly. It is of course no defence at law for Ngow to say that he did not mean the e-mail to have the defamatory meanings ascribed by the plaintiffs since, according to 
Gatley
 
on Libel and Slander
 (9 ed p 78 para 3.12):
What imputation is conveyed by any particular words is to be determined on an objective test, that is, by the meaning in which the ordinary reasonable person would understand them, and is not to be determined by what the defendant intended to convey.
Conclusion
55 Consequently, I find that Ngow had indeed defamed the first, second, third, fourth and sixth plaintiffs by the statements contained in the e-mail. However, as they did not testify, the claims of the fifth, seventh, eighth and ninth plaintiffs are dismissed with costs. Ting's perception that he could testify on their behalf is misconceived. Defamation is an actionable tort, not a representative action. It is for each plaintiff to inform the court how the defamatory statements had affected him/her and caused each of them grief; their feelings cannot be conveyed on their behalf by the managing-director or any other representative from their employer.
56 Accordingly, there will be interlocutory judgment for the five (5) abovenamed plaintiffs on their claims with costs, damages will be assessed by the Registrar with the costs of such assessment reserved to the Registrar.",2003-03-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

Husband kicking wife upon discovering she was lying to him
  – 
Whether motive for offence relevant for sentencing under s 304 (a) Penal Code, Cap 224.
 
1 The accused, aged 34, pleaded guilty to a charge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code Ch 224 for causing the death of his wife Norafidah Binte Saparuan, also aged 34. The accused was unemployed. Norafidah’s marriage to the accused had been de-stabilised and the couple were in conflict in more ways than one. Norafidah was seeing another man (Sheik Abdullah) and wanted a divorce. The accused wanted reconciliation.
2 On 27 August 2002 Norafidah spent the night at Sheik Abdullah’s flat. They left the flat at 7am the following morning and walked to the bus-stop together. Sheik Abdullah’s bus arrived first and he left for work. The accused and another man confronted Norafidah at the bus-stop before her bus arrived. The accused asked her to take him to Sheik Abdullah’s flat and then told her to call him (Sheik Abdullah) back to the flat.
3 The party consisting of Norafidah, the accused and the other man reached the flat a while later. A woman named Sharrifah who lived there was still in bed, and so was her daughter Siti Shehah. It was not known what their relationship was with Sheik Abdullah. A commotion arose when the accused lost his temper after hearing Sharrifah refer to Norafidah as a ""divorcee"". He punched Norafidah who fell but the accused’s friend helped her back on her feet.
4 To avoid embarrassment and attention Siti Shehah asked everyone to go into the flat. By this time, the accused’s male friend had left but an unknown woman friend joined them. The accused and Sharrifah sat on the sofa and Norafidah and the unknown woman sat on the floor with their backs to the wall.
5 The accused was still in a foul mood and it darkened further when he learnt that Norafidah had lied to him more than he had suspected. Questioning Sharrifah, he found out that Norafidah did not come to the flat to help Sharrifah bake cookies as she had told him. Thereupon, he walked to Norafidah and told her to lower her hand from her mouth. He then kicked her in the mouth. The force caused her head to jerk backwards, hitting the wall. Resulting from the impact with the wall Norafidah developed an instantaneous epileptic fit. There was no doubt that the kick was an extremely violent one. It appears that the impact had caused a subarachnoid haemorrhage in her skull. She died from her head injury. The accused initially tried to revive her but fled when he realised the seriousness of her injury. However, he instructed the unknown woman to call for the ambulance before leaving the scene.
6 The facts show that this case could have been brought as an offence under s 304(b) of the Penal Code instead of s 304 (a). Under s 304(b) the punishment is imprisonment of up to ten years or fine whereas the punishment for an offence under s 304(a) is imprisonment for life or ten years. A case may justifiably be brought under s 304(b) if death was caused without the intention to cause death or the intention to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. Whether the injury in the present case falls within (a) or (b) of s 304 may depend on whether the injury was the kick itself or the kick and the resulting impact against the wall.
7 Whether the accused ought to be charged under (a) or (b) is a matter at the prosecutor’s discretion and must so be respected. In this case, the prosecution case was presented by an experienced and learned prosecuting counsel, Mr Jaswant Singh, and, furthermore, the accused was represented by counsel of equal standing. In determining the appropriate sentence, the court must find a range within the limits prescribed under s 304(a) alone. That the facts might have justified the charge being brought under s 304(b) would not be relevant.
8 In this case, I took into account that the offence was committed in the culmination of deep feelings none less than the passion of ‘love to hatred turned’. I think it a fair and reasonable inference that the accused had not intended or appreciated the impact caused by Norafidah’s head hitting the wall. In the circumstances, I am of the view that a sentence between 7 to 9 years imprisonment as suggested by the learned DPP is not appropriate in this case. That may be more appropriate in cases where the offender has a deeper and more wilful motive, or cases where the physical assault is more heinous. I mention this without diminishing my view that the assault in the present case was a violent one. But given the circumstances of this case, I think that a sentence of 5 years imprisonment is sufficient.",2003-03-25 00:00:00,SG High Court

Whether outstanding charges could be taken into account for purpose of sentencing.
 
 
1          The accused is a 36 year old man who was charged with two offences of rape under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code, Ch 224 and one offence of outraging modesty under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code.  The first charge concerned an 18 year old girl who was also a niece of the accused.  The offence was committed on 1 July 2002 between 9am and 9.45am in the flat belonging to the girl’s mother. The charge of outraging modesty also concerned this same girl and was also committed during the same morning.
 
2          The second charge of rape also concerned an 18 year old girl who is acquainted with the accused.  The offence took place in a field near a school on 19 February 2002 between 1am and 1.30am.
3          The accused pleaded guilty to all three offences.  He also had a number of previous convictions including one public gaming, two robbery charges, one for theft, and two for possession of controlled drugs. One of the robbery offences was for armed robbery and the other for robbery with hurt.
4          In the present charges, a knife was used to intimidate the second victim.  In both cases, the victims were put in fear of personal safety but were not seriously harmed although the statement of facts showed that some force was used to restrained the victims.  The accused initially disputed the part of the statement of facts that he had used a pillow to “suffocate” the first girl (his niece).  However, he subsequently withdrew his objection.
5          The accused stated from the dock that he has some outstanding charges including charges relating to robbery which he would like the court to take into account for the purposes of sentencing.  The learned DPP confirmed that there are a number of charges that are still pending against the accused but are not subject of the preliminary inquiry that brought the accused before this court.  In the circumstances, I am unable to take those offences into account for the purposes of sentencing the accused on the charges before me.
6          In view of the seriousness of the offences, his previous antecedents, the circumstances relating to the present offences I sentenced the accused to 12 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane in respect of each of the two rape charges and two years imprisonment and two strokes of the cane in respect of the third charge.  Taking a global view of the overall punishment I ordered that the terms of imprisonment in respect of the two rape charges to run concurrently and the imprisonment in respect of the third charge to run consecutively to the first two sentences.",2003-03-24 00:00:00,SG High Court

Background
 
 
1
         
 The accused is C, male, 30 years of age.
 
 He faced 23 charges in relation to the same victim who is his step-daughter.
2
         
 There were 12 counts under s 377 of the Penal Code i.e of voluntarily having carnal intercourse against the order of nature.
3
         
 There were 11 counts under s 354 of the Penal Code i.e of using criminal force knowing it to be likely that he would thereby outrage the modesty of the victim.
4
         
 He also faced a 24
th
 charge under s 30(2)(a) of the Films Act i.e of having in his possession video compact discs containing films which he knew to be obscene.
5
         
 The prosecution proceeded with 11 charges:
(a)
       
 the 1
st
, 4
th
, 10
th
, 12
th
 and 22
nd
 charges under s 377
(b)
       
 the 2
nd
, 3
rd
, 9
th
, 11
th
, 21
st
 and 23
rd
 charges under s 354.
6
         
 The offences came to light in the following manner:
(a)
       
 On 13 September 2002, the victim’s teacher referred the victim to the school principal when the victim returned to school after being absent for two days from 10 to 12 September 2002.
(b)
       
 The victim was referred to the school counsellor.
 
 During the counselling session, the counsellor understood that the victim had been molested.
 
 The counsellor informed the school principal who contacted the victim’s mother to see her the same day.
(c)
       
 When the mother came to the school, the victim was brought to the principal’s office to meet her mother.
 
 Upon seeing her mother, the victim broke down and cried and disclosed to her mother that the accused had been sexually abusing her for some time.
 
 The principal then advised the mother to make a police report but the mother requested some time to consider whether to do so.
(d)
       
 Two weeks later, on 27 September 2002, when the principal did not hear from the mother, the principal instructed the counsellor to report the matter to the Child Protection Service of the Ministry of Community Development and Sports (“MCDS”) for the matter to be reported to the police and the counsellor did so.
(e)
       
 On 30 September 2002, the victim was taken down to MCDS to be interviewed.
 
 Later that day, she lodged a police report.
7
         
 The accused pleaded guilty to the 11 charges and was convicted accordingly.
 
 He agreed to the remaining charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing.
8
         
 Most of the offences under s 377 of the Penal Code involved instances of anal intercourse.
 
 Only the 20
th
 and 22
nd
 charges, which were also under s 377, involved the accused making the victim perform fellatio on him.
9
         
 Most of the offences under s 354 of the Penal Code involved instances where the accused inserted his finger into the anus of the victim.
 
 Only the 21
st
 charge, which was also under s 354, was an instance of the accused touching the vulva of the victim.
10
       
 The accused’s reason for committing the offences was that he could not control his lust.
 
 He thought that by having anal intercourse, this would be less painful because faeces pass through the anus.
 
 He claimed to regret what he had done and sought leniency.
11
       
 Mr Imran Hamid for the prosecution did not press for a deterrent sentence.
 
 Mr Hamid submitted that the case before me stood somewhere between the case of 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 1 SLR 801
 and 
Adam Bin Darsin v Public Prosecutor
 
[2001] 2 SLR 413
.
12
       
 In 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
, the accused faced a total of 40 charges and pleaded guilty to ten.
 
 The offences comprised anal intercourse and coercing or cajoling the victims to perform fellatio on the accused.
 
 The victims were five boys between the age of eight and twelve.
 
 The accused there also had previous convictions for similar offences.
 
 The High Court sentenced the accused to ten years’ imprisonment on each of the four charges on anal intercourse which the prosecution proceeded with.
 
 Each of these sentences were to run consecutively making a total of 40 years.
 
 The accused’s appeal against sentence was dismissed.
13
       
 In 
Adam Bin Darsin
, the accused faced a total of 23 charges and pleaded guilty to eight.
 
 The accused there had committed fellatio on eight boys between 12 and 15.
 
 The High Court sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment on each of the charges under s 377 and ordered four of such sentences to run consecutively.
 
 The Court of Appeal reduced each of these four sentences to five years and also ordered these four sentences to run consecutively, making a total of 20 years.
 
 The Court of Appeal was of the view that:
(a)
       
 of the three forms of unnatural carnal intercourse, anal intercourse was the most serious.
 
 Causing a victim to perform fellatio was of intermediate gravity and performing fellatio on the victim stood at the bottom of the scale,
(b)
       
 anal intercourse was, depending on the circumstances, equated with rape,
(c)
       
 the appropriate sentence for performing fellatio on the victim was around five years in the absence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances.
14
       
 As for cases under s 354, Mr Hamid submitted that in 
Chandrash Patel
 (unreported), Chief Justice Yong Pung How had suggested that nine months and between three to four strokes of the cane was applicable.
My Decision
15
       
 For cases under s 354, Yong CJ had also said in 
Ng Chiew Kiat v Public Prosecutor
 
 
 
[2000] 1 SLR 370
 that nine months’ imprisonment and caning is warranted for acts of molest involving intrusion of the victim’s private parts although in 
Toh Kok How v Public Prosecutor
 
[1995] 1 SLR 735
, the accused was also sentenced by Yong CJ to nine months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane for using his knuckles to press onto the right breast of the victim.
 
 On the other hand, Yong CJ also said in 
Ng Chiew Kiat
 that there were offences under s 354 which were relatively minor for which a fine would suffice.
 
 Ultimately, the appropriate sentence would depend on the nature of the act of molest as well as the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.
16
       
 I accepted Mr Hamid’s submission that in the case before me, the gravity of the offences and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences under s 377 stood somewhere between the case of
 
 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
 and 
Adam Bin Darsin
.
17
       
 The actions of the accused before me under s 377 comprised mainly anal intercourse.
 
 Although there was only one victim, the accused had committed the offence many times.
 
 The accused was in a position of authority and trust being the step-father of the victim, unlike the accused in 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
 and in 
Adam Bin Darsin
.
18
       
 For the offences under s 354, the accused had inserted his finger into the anus of the victim which was more painful for the victim than if he had simply touched her private parts.
19
       
 The accused had a previous conviction in 1990 for voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons or means for which he was sent to a reformative training centre.
 
 He also had a previous conviction in 1999 for theft in a dwelling, read with s 34 Penal Code on common intention, for which he was sentenced to two weeks’ imprisonment.
 
 Those offences were not similar to the offences for which he was charged before me.
20
       
 In the circumstances, I sentenced the accused as follows:
(a)
       
 On the second charge, under s 354 of the Penal Code, one year’s imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
(b)
       
 On the third charge under s 354 of the Penal code, one year’s imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
(c)
       
 On the fourth charge under s 377 of the Penal Code, ten years’ imprisonment.
(d)
       
 On the ninth charge under s 354 of the Penal Code, one year’s imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
(e)
       
 On the tenth charge under s 377 of the Penal code, ten years’ imprisonment.
(f)
        
 On the 11
th
 charge under s 354 of the Penal Code, one years’ imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
(g)
       
 On the 12
th
 charge under s 377 of the Penal Code, ten years’ imprisonment.
(h)
       
 On the 21
st
 charge under s 354 of the Penal Code, nine months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.
 
 This was the offence in which the accused had touched the victim’s vulva instead of inserting his finger into her anus.
(i)
        
 On the 22
nd
 charge under s 377, seven and a half years’ imprisonment.
 
 This was an offence in which the accused had made the victim perform fellatio on him.
(j)
        
 On the 23
rd
 charge under s 354, one year’s imprisonment and four strokes of the cane.
(k)
       
 On the first charge under s 377, ten years’ imprisonment.
21
       
 The sentences for the fourth, tenth, and first charges were to run consecutively from the date of remand i.e 5 October 2002.
 
 The other sentences of imprisonment were to run concurrently with the consecutive sentences.
 
 The aggregate term of imprisonment was 30 years.
 
 The total number of strokes of the cane was 23.

Whether trial judge erred in assessment of evidence

Whether finding unsupportable or against weight of evidence
 
 
1 The appellant Cheung Kan Lam (‘Cheung’) faced two counts of housebreaking with intent to commit theft in furtherance of a common intention, which was an offence under s 457 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He was jointly tried with his accomplices Samuel Lam Kong Shan (‘Sam’), Lam Chi Yu (‘Lam’) and Yiu Pun Hwa (‘Yiu’). The three accomplices faced a total of three housebreaking charges, of which only two
 
were committed with the appellant in furtherance of their common intention. District Judge Audrey Lim convicted Cheung along with his accomplices. He received a sentence of three years’ imprisonment for each charge with the sentences to run consecutively. I dismissed Cheung’s appeal against his conviction and sentence. I now give my reasons.
Church break-ins
2 In February 2002, there was a series of church break-ins, all of which occurred at night. Christ The King Catholic Church located at Ang Mo Kio was burgled on 10 February, followed shortly by St Teresa Church at Bukit Purmei Road on 13 February and, lastly, by Lighthouse Evangelism Church at Tampines Street 82 on 17 February. Substantial sums of money were stolen from each church.
The arrest
3 On 4 April 2002, Cheung and his accomplices were arrested along with one Chan Fook Ming (‘Chan’) in connection with a spate of burglaries on private residences occurring between December 2001 to early April 2002.
Lam’s statements and site visit
4 During the course of investigations, Lam admitted to being a courier for stolen goods but denied committing housebreaking. However, in his statement of 24 April 2002, Lam confessed that he had not been involved in the residential burglaries but had actually participated in church break-ins. This was the first time the police became aware that the accused persons were involved in the church break-ins.
5 Several further statements were taken in which Lam unequivocally implicated Sam, Cheung and two other persons, Ah Mong and Ah Ti. In one of them, Lam indicated the order in which the churches were broken into and was able to provide an extremely accurate sketch map of the location of Lighthouse Evangelism Church with its surrounding landmarks. He told the police that Cheung was only involved in the break-ins of two of the churches while the other accused persons had taken part in all three break-ins. Cheung had refused to take part in the third break-in because of a disagreement with Ah Mong. In another statement, Lam gave a fairly detailed explanation of the role each accused played in the break-ins.
6 On 25 April 2002, Lam led a party of four police officers to the sites of the churches broken into. Though he did not know the exact names of the churches, Lam was able to direct the police to them by referring to specific landmarks.
7 Subsequently, Cheung was charged with the first two break-ins while the other accused persons were charged with all three. At trial, Lam alleged that the police had fabricated the statements and he had signed them involuntarily after having been beaten up. At the end of a lengthy voir dire, the trial judge held that the statements had been given voluntarily and admitted them accordingly.
Supporting evidence
8 In addition to Lam’s confessions, the prosecution highlighted the following:
 
(a) All four accused persons had been in Singapore at the time the churches were broken into. In fact, they had made multiple trips to Singapore on a number of occasions between December 2001 and March 2002, save for Lam who only came after February 2002. The prosecution alleged that these visits were sinister in purpose as they were for the accused persons to familiarise themselves with potential housebreaking sites in Singapore.
 
 
(b) From 28 December 2001 to 3 April 2002, large sums of money were remitted to the bank accounts of Sam, Cheung, and Cheung’s wife. All remittances were made in cash. On 18 February 2002, soon after the third church break-in, two remittances totaling $56,000 were made to Sam’s bank account in Hong Kong. The applicant stated in the receipt was Cheung. The prosecution alleged that the remittances comprised the proceeds from the burglaries.
 
 
(c) Sam had been in possession of a rented white Toyota Corolla at the time of the offences. In a statement, Lam described Sam as driving a white car for the housebreaking committed on 10 and 13 February.
 
 
The defence
9 All four accused persons denied committing the offences. Cheung’s defence was that he had come to Singapore for the purpose of sightseeing and to look for suitable sites to set up a food business. He claimed there was no pre-arrangement between the accused persons on when they were to be in Singapore. It was pure coincidence that he often arrived and left Singapore at the same time as the other accused persons. As for the remittances, he denied they were an attempt to siphon away proceeds from the burglaries. He claimed ignorance of the remittances made in his name and said that Sam had used his name without his permission. The remittances to his wife’s and his own bank accounts came from money that he had brought from Hong Kong to Singapore and were for his family’s expenses.
Decision of the court below
10 Having ruled that Lam’s statements were admissible, the trial judge found them to be true and reliable. In doing so, she considered that there was no reason for Lam to falsely implicate the other accused as Lam admitted that he bore no grudges or animosity towards them at the time the statements were recorded. While there were some discrepancies in the statements, the trial judge found that they were not fatal to the prosecution’s case.
11 The trial judge also considered the other supporting evidence which led to the inference that they were involved in the commission of the church break-ins. She rejected the claims that the accused persons had been in Singapore at the same time on numerous occasions as the result of a series of coincidences. She found it to be extremely unlikely that Sam, Cheung and Lam could stay in the same flat on most occasions but each did not know what the others were doing in Singapore despite meeting up regularly for meals and nightclubbing. As for the remittances, she rejected Sam’s claim that the moneys comprised the winnings from football bets. She noted that he must have been ‘a very lucky person to have won some $85,000 throughout this period’, and that despite these huge winnings, he was not able to name a single game on which he won, nor could he name any football team other than Manchester United. Her analysis of the testimonies of each of the accused persons showed them to be ‘unreliable and inherently contradictory’.
12 In relation to Cheung, the trial judge found him to be a dishonest and unreliable witness who was extremely evasive and hesitant in answering questions and often gave unsatisfactory answers on material issues. Though he claimed that he had come to Singapore to look at sites for setting up a food business, he could give no details of the sites visited nor could he satisfactorily explain why he had to stay in Singapore for 22 days in January to look at a mere two to three sites. As such, the trial judge found this whole story about setting up a food business to be a mere sham to conceal the fact that he had actually come to look for potential sites not for a food business, but for housebreaking.
13 As for the remittances made to the bank accounts of his wife and himself in Hong Kong, the trial judge rejected Cheung’s ‘lame explanation’ that he had to remit the money for his wife’s and children’s expenses. Having admitted that he had set aside a sum of money in Hong Kong for these expenses prior to his trip to Singapore, there was no reason for him to bring money to Singapore only to remit them back to Hong Kong. Cheung was also unable to provide a satisfactory answer as to why he had remitted the money using someone else’s name. The suspicious manner in which he went about remitting money led the trial judge to conclude that he was trying to cover his tracks with regard to the movement of money out of Singapore.
14 On the basis of the statements made by Lam, the supporting evidence and the ‘unconvincing and unsubstantiated reasons’ of the accused persons for their presence in Singapore on all the occasions, the trial judge found that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.
The appeal
15 The sole question in this appeal was whether the trial judge had erred in her assessment of the evidence. After perusing the grounds of decision, I was of the view that the appeal was without merit. It is trite law that an appellate court will not overturn findings of fact unless they can be shown to be against the weight of evidence:

[1998] 2 SLR 704
. There was nothing on record to indicate that the district judge’s findings were unsupportable or against the weight of the evidence adduced. On the contrary, the weight of evidence was clearly against the appellant.
16 I was of the view that the trial judge was correct in holding that Lam’s statements had been made voluntarily. Given that the statements were admissible, the conviction could have been sustained solely on the confession of Lam, a co-accused: 
Chin Seow Noi & Ors v Public Prosecutor
 
[1994] 1 SLR 135
 and s 30 Evidence Act (Cap 97). In addition, a retracted confession could still be relied upon for the truth of the facts therein, without the need for corroboration: 
Yusof bin A Samad v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 4 SLR 58
. As such, the trial judge was entitled to find the discrepancies in Lam’s statements to be immaterial and to use them as a basis for convicting Cheung.
17 The reliability of those statements was supported by the fact that it was consistent with the other evidence. The fact that the accused persons were all in Singapore at the material time, the large remittances made shortly after the burglary and the rental of the white car constituted circumstantial evidence which, when viewed in totality, supported the inference that the accused persons had committed the offence in the manner described in the statements. On the other hand, the testimonies of the accused persons, Cheung included, were filled with material inconsistencies. Cheung’s explanations for his conduct were tenuous at best. As such, the trial judge could not be faulted for concluding that Cheung was a dishonest and unreliable witness.
Conclusion
18 In light of the above, I dismissed the appeal against conviction. No submissions were made on sentence nor were any mitigating factors put forward. In any case, I was of the view that the sentence was appropriate and accordingly also dismissed the appeal against it.",2003-02-18 00:00:00,SG High Court

Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) ss 256, 266 & 268
 
 
 
1          
 The accused, Jaykumaran s/o Saminathan Retinam (“Kumar”) was jointly charged with his friend, Sahadevan s/o Gundan (“Sahadevan”) for committing robbery with hurt of $50 under s 394 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). Both of them were convicted of the charge and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment each by the district judge.
 
2
         
 Pursuant to my powers under s 266 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), I called for and examined the records of proceedings in the district court, in respect of Kumar.
3
         
 Briefly, the case was as follows : The victim, Vellaikkannu Pandi (“Pandi”) was an illegal immigrant offender, who had been issued a special pass by the immigration department. It was his evidence that in the early hours of the morning of 8 January 2002, he had met Kumar and Sahadevan outside a ‘Cheers’ outlet at Blk 291, Yishun Ring Road. After chatting for a while, both of them left him at the compound wall outside the ‘Cheers’ outlet and went to the side entrance of the outlet. They returned shortly afterwards and Sahadevan asked Pandi how much money he had with him. When Pandi replied that he had no money, Kumar spoke to him in a very harsh tone “big brother is asking, why don’t you hand over your money”. Kumar then moved off a few metres away and left Sahadevan and Pandi alone. Pandi alleged that Sahadevan robbed him of $50 and slapped him twice on the cheeks. Sahadevan also took what turned out later to be a copy of Pandi’s special pass. Pandi testified that he was advised by a passer-by to call the police and he did, using the public phone located at the side of the ‘Cheers’ outlet.
 
 When he returned to where Sahadevan and Kumar were previously, he found only Sahadevan there. He pleaded with Sahadevan to return his special pass to him. At this point in time, Sahadevan took out a lighter, burnt the copy of the special pass and threw its remains over the compound wall.
4
        
 Both Sahadevan and Kumar denied the allegations. Sahadevan claimed that he had taken a number of alcoholic drinks with Kumar that night and had dozed off on the compound wall. He further claimed that Pandi came up to him and threatened to ‘finish him off’. He was afraid and rushed into the ‘Cheers’ outlet to call the police. While he was waiting inside the store for the police to arrive, someone came from outside and pushed him, causing him to fall outside the store. As for Kumar, he claimed to have left shortly after chatting with Sahadevan on the compound wall and did not know of the alleged altercation between Sahadevan and Pandi.
5
         
 In reviewing the case, I found that Pandi’s credibility was affected to a large extent by the many inconsistencies between his first information report and his evidence in court. It followed that his evidence should have been placed under greater scrutiny, especially when the prosecution’s case rested primarily on his evidence that it was Sahadevan who had robbed him of $50 and slapped him.
6
         
 In relation to the copy of the special pass, there was no evidence to corroborate that it had been burnt by Sahadevan or that it even existed at all. Since the evidence on this point was rather equivocal, any reservations as to whether the copy of the special pass had indeed been burnt by Sahadevan should be resolved in favour of both accused, since the prosecution bore the burden of proof. Taking into account the surrounding circumstances and the need to place a greater scrutiny on Pandi’s evidence, the failure to recover the $50 from either Sahadevan or Kumar further weakened the prosecution’s case.
7
         
 Furthermore, by Pandi’s own account, there was a passer-by who was there all the while, being the only one at the scene that night other than himself, Sahadevan and Kumar. This passer-by was the one who had advised him to call the police and who had pushed Sahadevan onto the ground. This was corroborated by Sahadevan’s own evidence and the still photographs from the CCTV recording at the ‘Cheers’ outlet. Three of the still photographs which were admitted into evidence showed chronologically, a man in a vertically-striped shirt with his hand on Sahadevan’s shoulder at the entrance of the outlet, Sahadevan on the ground and the same man in the vertically-striped shirt talking to the police. As such, contrary to the trial judge’s view, the passer-by was very much a material witness. Since he was at the scene and had, apparently, observed the entire incident, he would have been able to witness Sahadevan slapping Pandi. The failure on the part of the prosecution to call such a material witness to give evidence entitled me to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act.
8
         
 In my opinion, the trial judge erred in finding that the prosecution had proven the case against Sahadevan and Kumar beyond a reasonable doubt. At this juncture, I should add that I had previously heard Sahadevan’s appeal and allowed it, setting aside his conviction and sentence.
9
         
 For these reasons, I am of the view that Kumar’s conviction under s 394 of the Penal Code could not be sustained and should be quashed; and I do so order in exercise of my powers of revision under s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code read with s 268(1), without calling for a further hearing.",2003-03-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

1
         
 Each of the five accused persons is charged with having committed an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code, by virtue of s 149 of the Penal Code.
 
 The offence under s 326 of the Penal Code is one of voluntary causing grievous hurt by means of any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death.
 
2
         
 The five accused persons were involved in an attack on one Zulkefelee Bin Md Nor and two of his friends at about 2.23am of 5 February 2002 outside Legenda Karaoke Lounge at 441 Joo Chiat Road.
 
 At the time of the attack, Zulkefelee and his friends were merely squatting at a five foot way fronting the lounge.
 
 The attack involved the use of knives and wooden poles and, as a result of the attack, Zulkefelee was killed.
3
         
 In mitigation, it was stressed that none of the accused had inflicted the two fatal stab wounds. 
 
 It was also suggested that the accused persons did not know that other members of their group had knives.
 
 Also none of the accused persons was the mastermind behind the attack.
 
 Four of them did not know the reason for the attack while the mitigation plea of the fourth accused Norizan Bin Tahir suggested that he might have been aware of the reason which was a problem between the deceased and the deceased’s girlfriend.
 
 Even then he did not say that he knew what the specific problem was.
4
         
 As for antecedents:
(a)
       
 the first accused Mohamed Ridwan Bin Omar had been convicted on 28 December 1999 of an offence of affray but was punished with a fine only,
(b)
       
 the other accused persons either had antecedents which were not relevant or no antecedent.
5
         
 On the other hand, even if none of the accused persons knew that other members of their group had knives, they all knew that some members of their group were armed with wooden poles.
 
 They must have known, before the attack on the deceased and his friends, what the common object was and that death may be caused, which unfortunately turned out to be the case.
 
 Although none of the accused persons inflicted the fatal wounds, they facilitated the act of others who did so.
6
         
 The fact that the accused persons did not even know the actual reason for the attack emphasises how senseless their actions were.
7
         
 In 
Shamsul bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor
 
[2002] 4 SLR 176
, Chief Justice Yong Pung How cited with approval the following factors from Practitioners Library - Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts (2000) as relevant in sentencing under s 326 of the Penal Code:
 
 (a) seriousness and permanence of injuries, (b) group action, (c) premeditation, (d) weapon used, (e) vulnerability of victim, (f) whether offender was in a position of authority, (g) racial motivation and (h) prior record of violence.
8
         
 I would add that whether an accused pleads guilty or claims trial and whether an accused surrenders himself should also be relevant factors in sentencing.
9
         
 In the circumstances,
(a)
       
 I sentence Mohamed Ridwan Bin Omar to eight years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.
 
 The sentence of imprisonment is to run from the date of his arrest i.e 5 February 2002.
(b)
       
 I sentence Mohd Ashik Bin Zainuddin to seven and a half years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.
 
 The sentence of imprisonment is to run from the date of his arrest i.e 5 February 2002.
(c)
       
 I sentence Mohamed Helmie Bin Abdullah to eight years’ imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane.
 
 The sentence is to run from the date of his arrest i.e 6 August 2002.
(d)

1 The accused pleaded guilty before me to the following amended charge:
DAC 57556/02
You, Adam bin Abu Bakar, Male 43 years old, S1365054C, are charged that you on the 26
th
 day of November 2002, at or about 9.00 pm, at No. 15 Lorong K, Telok Kurau Road, PAP Joo Chiat Branch, Singapore, did commit house-breaking by night, to wit, by dismantling the perimeter fencing in order to gain entry to the building in the possession of the PAP Joo Chiat branch secretary general, one Tan Ee Sing, which is a building used for custody for property, after 7.00 pm, and before 7.00 am, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 456 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
The statement of facts
2 The accused admitted the statement of facts without any qualification. He was detained on 26 November 2002 by the police, who had been alerted to a suspected break-in at the PAP Joo Chiat branch (‘the premises’) located at No. 15 Lorong K, Telok Kurau Road. The secretary-general of the PAP Joo Chiat branch, one Tan Ee Sing, had been conducting a security check at about 11.00 pm at the premises when he noticed some tobacco leaves and a lighter strewn on the floor. As he sensed that there was an intruder in the premises, he caused a police report to be made.
3 Investigations revealed that the accused had been loitering around the vicinity of the premises at about 9.00 pm that evening. He noticed that the premises was in darkness and not guarded. On ensuring that no one was around, he broke into the premises by dismantling the perimeter fencing. He then went into the hall area through a door that was not secured. When he heard noises at the main gate, he hid in the store-room.
4 The police eventually discovered the accused in the store-room. He was placed under arrest. Nothing was found missing from the premises. The accused admitted that he had broken into the premises for the purpose of committing theft. However, he disputed part of para. 8 of the original statement of facts. He denied that he had been ‘looking around for valuables to steal’. The prosecution agreed that this portion could be deleted.
Antecedents and mitigation
5 The accused admitted that he had various antecedents. His record of criminal activities runs into eight pages, listing 34 entries in all. He has four previous convictions for theft (s 379 Penal Code (Cap 224)). The last of these took place on 26 September 2000, for which he was sentenced to the maximum imprisonment term of three years. He also has three previous convictions for theft in dwelling (s 380 Penal Code), of which two are of a recent vintage. On 6 January 1998, he was convicted on two counts under s 380 and sentenced to an aggregate term of three years’ imprisonment.
6 In the preceding 17 years, the accused has also been convicted on two counts of criminal intimidation (s 506 Penal Code), one count of doing an obscene act in a public place (s 294 Penal Code), one count of wilful trespass on property and two counts of fraudulent possession of property (s 21 and s 35(1) respectively of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act Cap 184). He was also placed under inhalant supervision six times and detained thrice at the inhalant treatment centre in respect of offences under s 3(1) of the Misuse of Intoxicating Substances Act (Cap 146A). In addition, there are some minor traffic offences.
7 In mitigation, the accused said that he admitted his mistake. He explained that he was desperate for a place to sleep as he had just been released from prison and his sister had chased him away from the house.
Reasons for sentence
8 The accused had numerous related antecedents involving theft and trespass on property. Although this was his first housebreaking conviction, he admitted that his purpose of gaining entry into the premises was to commit theft. It was fortuitous for the owners of the premises that there was a spot-check conducted shortly after the accused entered the premises. In the circumstances, it was of little mitigating value that no items were in fact stolen by the accused. There was no mitigating value in his plea of guilt as he was caught red-handed.
9 The accused committed the present offence shortly after his release from a three-year sentence of imprisonment for a theft offence. Even fairly substantial terms of imprisonment had not been sufficient to deter him from further crime. In my view, the maximum permitted sentence of three years’ imprisonment under s 456 would not be adequate to achieve a measure of individual and general deterrence. After all, he had already served two separate terms of three years’ imprisonment in quick succession, in 1998 and 2000 respectively. Evidently these sentences did not deter him as it did not take him long to return to his old habits.
10 I called for a pre-sentence report to determine his suitability for corrective training, as he was eligible for such a sentence in lieu of imprisonment. He was found to be mentally and physically fit for corrective training. He claimed to have had a history of psychiatric illness. However, although he had received treatment previously at the Institute of Mental Health (‘IMH’), there was no sign of any recurring illness or lack of fitness or capacity to plead to the charge.
11 There was an obvious risk that the accused would reoffend. I therefore sentenced the accused to five years’ corrective training with a view to reforming him and preventing the commission of further crime. In my opinion, this was the most appropriate course in the present case. I understand that the accused filed a notice of appeal on 30 January 2003. He is presently serving sentence.",2003-02-10 00:00:00,SG District Court

Charge
 
1. The accused, Mohamad Shahrezza Bin Mohamad Zuhri, faced two amended charges under the Penal Code (Cap 224). The first charge was for an offence of rioting armed with a deadly weapon under Section 148. The second charge was under Section 147 for rioting. The accused pleaded guilty to the first charge. This charge read as follows:

Facts
2  The accused was 17 years old. His accomplices which numbered about 46 were members of the secret society known as ""Sio Kun Tong"" or ""369"". Of these, 16 of his accomplices have been arrested and charged. The remainder was still on the run. The 16 accomplices who had been apprehended were:
B1 – Mohammad Ridzuan Bin Senin, male/19 years;
B2 - Mohamed Juraidy Bin Mohamed, male/19 years;
B3 - Sulaiman Bin Hashim, male/19 years;
B4 - Mohammad Norfadhli Bin Ramlan, male/20 years;
B6 - Masrur Bin Muhammad Ali, male/17 years;
B7 - Hasni Bin Husaini, male/25 years;
B8 - Nurman Bin Osman, male/20 years;
B9 - Mohammad Fadzli Bin Abdul Rahim, male/17 years;
B10 - Mohamed Hidayat Bin Yassin, male/17 years;
B11 - Muhammad Al-Jufree Bin Abdul Hamid, male/16 years;
B12 - Mohamad Fairoz Bin Hussin, male/18 years;
B13 - Mohammad Assry Bin Samsul Bahri, male/17 years;
B14 - Mohamad Deliman Bin Mohamed Noor, male/27 years;
B15 - Mohd Hisyam Bin Roslan, male/16 years;
B16 - Mohamed Bin Ismail, male/19 years;
B17 - Muhammad Shafie Bin Zulkifly, male/17 years.
3  On 31 August 02 between 5.30 pm and 7.00 pm, B1, B2, B3, B12, B13, B14, B16 and 20 others assembled at the Sio Kun Tong meeting area at the Tanjong Rhu Hawker Centre. This pre-arranged meeting was attended by numerous headmen of the secret society, including B12 and B14 who were junior headmen. The purpose of the meeting was to plan and co-ordinate a revenge attack on rival members from the Teck Whye Sio Kun Tong. Members of the latter had purportedly beaten up a member from the Tanjong Rhu branch about a week prior to that. It was agreed at the meeting that the revenge attack would take place along the stretch of Orchard Road starting from HMV Hereen to Lucky Plaza and Far East Plaza. A number of the gang members were already armed with knives and parangs. Others were going to arm themselves as well for the revenge attack. The gang members then broke up into groups and proceeded to HMV Hereen.
4 On the same day at about 8.00 pm, Mohamed Fauzi Bin Noordin, male/19 years (A1), Halipi Bin Kamis, male/20 years (A2), Zakaria Bin Ishak, male/18 years (A3) and a few of their friends were at the fountain outside HMV Hereen. They noticed a large number of persons comprising the accused and his accomplices nearby. B3 emerged from his group and approached A1, shook his hand and had a brief exchange of words. B3 then returned to his group.
5 Moments later, the accused and his accomplices began to shout. They charged at A1’ group. A1 and his friends attempted to flee from the accused and his accomplices but they were surrounded. A1, A2 and A3 were slashed with parangs and knives as well as kicked and punched. The injuries sustained by A1, A2 and A3 are set out in the medical reports tendered. A1 sustained various injuries including the following:
Scalp laceration x 3;
Left ear lobe cut off;
Deep laceration at right forearm and tendons to all fingers and thumb cut;
Muscles and nerve of left arm cut; and
Deep laceration on left thigh.
6 A2 sustained an incisional wound measuring 3 cm with surrounding haematoma over his right elbow as a result of being hit over the said elbow with a knife.
7 As for A3, he was admitted into the Cardiothoracic Unit of the Singapore General Hospital. He had a 7 cm stab wound over the right parietal region. He also sustained a 10 cm slash wound in the back, a right penetrating chest wound, a right thumb laceration and a left hand laceration. In addition, he was unresponsive on admission with no recordable blood pressure. He was resuscitated and sent for an emergency operation on his chest. He also underwent a wound closure of the scalp and back lacerations. On the following day, he underwent further surgical procedures. Subsequently, he developed ischaemic hepatitis and acute renal failure. The latter required dialysis. A3 was warded in the Cardiothoracic Unit for 20 days before he was transferred to the Renal Medicine Department for further dialysis. He was re-admitted twice for further treatment.
8 In the course of the attack launched by the accused and his accomplices, two bystanders were also injured as they were in the way of the attacking gang. One of the bystanders was Karen Lim Phui Chi, 19 years old. She sustained a 15 cm open slash wound on her left hand. Five of her tendons and a nerve were cut. She underwent an operation to repair the structures and had also to undergo occupational therapy. The other was a 64-year-old female tourist from Myanmar. She sustained a hip fracture after she fell as a result of being pushed by the attacking gang.
Charge taken into consideration
9 With the consent of the accused, the following charge was on the application of the Prosecution taken into consideration:
DAC 53471/2002 (Exhibit P2A)
You, MOHAMAD SHAHREZZA BIN MOHAMAD ZUHRI, MALE 17 YRS OLD, NRIC NO.: S8521449-G
are charged that you on the 31st day of August, 2002 at or about 8.20 pm at infront of Lucky Plaza, Orchard Road, Singapore, together with Mohammad Ridzuan Bin Senin, Sulaiman Bin Hashim, Mohamed Juraidy Bin Mohamed, Mohammad Norfadhli Bin Ramlan, Mohamed Hidayat Bin Yassin, Masrur Bin Muhammad Ali, Hasni Bin Husaini, Nurman Bin Osman, Mohammad Fadzli Bin Abdul Rahim, Muhammad Al-Jufree Bin Abdul Hamid, Mohamad Fairoz Bin Hussin, Mohammad Assry Bin Samsul Bahri, Mohamad Deliman Bin Mohamed Noor, Mohd Hisyam Bin Roslan, Mohamed Bin Ismail, Muhammad Shafie Bin Zulkifly and about 10 other unknown male persons, were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object was to cause hurt to Muhammad Faizal Bin Maisanan and Rahmat Hidayat Bin Jaas, and that while you all were members of the said assembly, one or more of you in prosecution of the said common object, used force in causing hurt to the said Muhammad Faizal Bin Maisanan and Rahmat Hidayat Bin Jaas to wit by punching and kicking them and you have thereby committed an office punishable under Section 147 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
Sentencing Factors
Mitigating Factors
10 The accused had pleaded guilty to the charge. This was a mitigating factor. However, the weight to be attached to it must depend on the circumstances of the case. This had been made clear by case authorities. The Court also considered the fact that the accused had been forthright and forthcoming with the police. Furthermore, his expression of regret for his action and his personal circumstances were taken into account.
11 The learned Defence Counsel had in his mitigation plea highlighted the fact that the accused was a first offender with no antecedents of any kind. There is a sentencing practice that a deterrent sentence should not be meted out to an offender who has an unblemished record. However, it is necessary to be aware that there is an exception to this practice. The exception is where the offence involved is rioting. This was recognised by the learned Senior District Judge in the case of 
Public Prosecutor v Diki Zulkarnaini Bin Saini
 (DAC 57026/200 & Ors) where the offender faced a charge of rioting under Section 147 of the Penal Code. In the present case, the accused had been convicted of a rioting charge under Section 148 read with Section 149 of the Penal Code. Therefore the said sentencing practice did not apply to the accused’s case.
12 The learned Defence Counsel also drew the Court’s attention to the circumstances under which the offence was committed. While not denying the fact that other members of the group were armed with weapons and that the injuries sustained by the victims were not minor, he went on to state that the accused was not armed and had followed the group due to ""naivete and peer pressure."" It was not in dispute that the accused was armed with any weapon though he was one of the attackers. Is the fact that he was unarmed a strong mitigating factor in a case of rioting under Section 148 read with Section 149 of the Penal Code? To answer this question, it is imperative to adopt a correct perspective of the offence. The offence of rioting with deadly weapon is one of the offences contained in Chapter VIII of the Penal Code under the heading, ""OFFENCES AGAINST THE PUBLIC TRANQUILITY"". Thus, rioting is to be perceived as a crime in breach of the public tranquility. The offence of rioting is defined in Section 146. It reads:
Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or by any member thereof, in prosecution of the common object of such an assembly, every member of such assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting.
It could therefore be seen from Section 146 that an offender would be guilty of rioting even though he himself did not use force or violence. Section 149 also makes every member of an unlawful assembly liable for an offence committed by any member in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or such offence as the members knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object. It must be recognised that the gravamen of the offence under Section 148 lies in the acts in breach of public tranquility by an unlawful assembly or any of its members in prosecution of its common object. In other words, in the eyes of the law, a member of an unlawful assembly has to answer for the acts of the unlawful assembly or that of any of its members. Therefore the sentencing approach for a rioter rightly should be to punish him for being a member of the unlawful assembly for the force or violence used by the unlawful assembly or any of its members rather than his individual acts. As such, a sentencing approach which focuses on the acts of the individual in isolation would be highly misconceived and inappropriate as it is his participation in the unlawful assembly that really counts. Therefore the fact that the accused in our case was not armed during the riot where weapons were used could not possibly carry much weight as a mitigating factor. 
Aggravating Circumstances
13 There were several aggravating factors in this case. Firstly, the nature of the offence for which the accused had been convicted of under Section 148 read with Section 149 of the Penal Code was clearly serious. It was an offence punishable with a mandatory imprisonment term of up to 7 years. In addition, the accused was also liable to be caned. The punishments prescribed by law manifested the serious view taken by the legislature towards such an offence. The offence under Section 147 of the Penal Code which was taken-into-consideration was also serious in nature. It carried a mandatory imprisonment sentence of not more than 5 years. The offender was also liable to be caned. Once again, the punishments set for the offence gave an insight into the seriousness of the offence.
14 Secondly, the manner and circumstances in which the offence was committed bore a number of aggravating features. I was first and foremost struck by the number of rioters in this case. There were 17 known rioters and about 30 unknown rioters making a total of 47. This was indeed a very large assembly of rioters. The very thought of such a huge group of people pursuing the 3 victims and their friends and assailing them in the heart of town conjured up a very frightening scene of violence and lawlessness. What made it even scarier was that this group of ruthless persons comprised secret society members. They had set out on a mission to seek vengeance on members of another branch of the gang. It must be remembered that the armed revenge attack had been planned and co-ordinated by headmen of the secret society beforehand. The locations of the planned attacks were pre-determined. The planned attacks were systematically executed.
15 The place, day, and the time of the offence were factors of great aggravation in this case. The offence took place along Orchard Road, a highly popular shopping belt for tourists and locals alike. The accused and his accomplices rampaged through this area at about 8 in the evening on a Saturday night. In the circumstances, the rioters had chosen to commit such a violent defiance of the law at a very crowded location in total regard of the safety and wellbeing of the members of the public who were legitimately there for lawful purposes. The Courts had always taken a stern view of acts of violence occurring at crowded public areas. It had frequently been stressed in the judgments of the Courts that there was a dire need to protect the general public from harm and danger posed by violent acts perpetrated in its midst. The well-being of the public must not be allowed to be compromised with immunity by violent breakers of the law. In this case, public safety had indeed been compromised when the accused and his accomplices carried out the attack at a crowded spot along Orchard Road resulting in grave harm being inflicted on two innocent ladies. As mentioned in detail earlier, a young lady and an elderly lady tourist sustained serious injuries when they were caught in the middle of the attack. This incident had brought disrepute to the favourable image of Singapore as a safe place to live in and to visit into question.
16 The seriousness of the injuries sustained by victims at the hands of rioters had always been regarded by the Courts as an aggravating factor. This can be seen from the case of 
Lee Tiaw Chwee v Public Prosecutor
 
[1998] 3 SLR 563
. The appellant together with four or five others were charged with a charge of rioting under Section 147 of the Penal Code. The group had attacked the victim who sustained multiple abrasions over the right shoulder and chest, mild abrasions over the right elbow that was bleeding from the subdermal vessels. The appellate court recognised the injuries as one of the aggravating factors that led to the dismissal of the appeal against sentence and an enhancement of the imprisonment and caning sentences. In this case, the injuries sustained by the 3 victims and the two innocent by-standers were as already mentioned in detail earlier serious in nature and therefore constituted an aggravating factor.
17 Yet another weighty aggravating factor for consideration was the fact that in the experience of this Court, the offence of rioting was a rampant one. There must be an adequate and appropriate response to this problem before it escalates out of hand.
Sentencing Principles
18 In view of the accused’s age, the type of offence committed and the punishments prescribed by the law, the Court had three options in dealing with the accused. On the one hand, it was open to the Court to order the accused to undergo probation treatment as provided for under the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252). On the other hand, there was the option to impose a term of imprisonment and caning on the accused as spelt out in Section 148 of the Penal Code. Between these two options was the third the option of ordering the accused to undergo reformative training as provided for under Section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68). The Defence urged the Court not to impose a custodial sentence on the accused but instead consider probation treatment or reformative training for him.
19 Section 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252) relates to the ordering of an offender to undergo probation instead of sentencing him. It reads:
 
5(1) Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the opinion that 
having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so
, the court may instead of sentencing him, make a probation order, that is to say, an order requiring him to be under the supervision of a probation officer or a volunteer probation officer for a period to be specified in the order of not less than 6 months nor more than 3 years.
 
                (Italics added)
20 In 1993, Section 5 was amended to add a proviso in respect of young offenders who commit offences that carry a specified minimum or mandatory minimum sentence. The proviso is worded in the following terms:
 
""[W]here a person is convicted of an offence for which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or a fine or caning is prescribed by law, the court may make a probation order if the person –
 
has attained the age of 16 years but has not attained the age of 21 years at the time of his conviction,
 
and
 
has not been previously convicted of any offence referred to in this proviso and for this purpose s 11(1) shall not apply to any such previous conviction.""
 
21 As to when it is appropriate for the court to make a probation order, the learned Chief Justice made the following observations in the case of 
Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
:
 
""Rehabilitation is the dominant consideration where the offender is 21 years and below. Young offenders are in their formative years and chances of reforming them into law-abiding adults are better. The corrupt influence of a prison environment and the bad effects of labelling and stigmatisation may not be desirable for young offenders. Compassion is often shown to young offenders on the assumption that the young ""don’t know any better"" and they may not have enough experience to realise the full consequences of their actions on themselves and on others. Teens may also be slightly less responsible than older offenders, being more impressionable, more easily led and less controlled in their behaviour. However, there is no doubt that some young people can be calculating in their offences. Hence the Court will need to assess the facts in every case.""
 
22 In the case of 
Public Prosecutor v Muhammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin
 
[2000] 1 SLR 34
, the learned Chief Justice went on to explain the rationale of probation treatment. His Honour said (at p 40):
 
""16 Probation under the Act is intended to be used to avoid the sending of offenders of not very serious offences to jail, where they may associate with hardened criminals, who may lead them further along the path of crime. The Act recognises that many of these crimes are committed through ignorance or inadvertence or due to bad influence of others. The offenders, but for such lapses, might be expected to be good citizens in which case a term of imprisonment might have the opposite effect to what is intended to be served by the imposition of the sentence. The traditional and broad rationale of probation therefore has always been to wean offenders away from a life-time career in crime and to reform and rehabilitate them into self-reliant and useful citizens. In the case of youthful criminals, the chances of effective rehabilitation are greater than in the case of adults, making the possible use of probation more relevant where young offenders are concerned. Nevertheless, the above-italicised portions of s 5(1) of the Act make it clear 
that probation is
 
never granted as of right, even in the case of juvenile offenders
. In deciding whether or not probation is the appropriate sentence in each case, the court still has to take into account all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender,""
 
               (Emphasis added)
23 In the case of 
Wu Si Yuan v Public Prosecutor
 (MA No. 221 of 2002) 
[2003] SGHC 7
, the learned Chief Justice in reference to the above two extracts added the following comments:
 
9 The above, however, should not be interpreted as indicating that probation is automatically suitable for a young offender whose lapse is better attributed to naivety and youthful folly than to any criminal tendency. It must be emphasised that the court takes into account all the circumstances of a case when deciding whether to grant probation, and one factor which is relevant to this consideration is the likelihood of success of the attempted rehabilitation. If the circumstances are such that the probation will not afford the offender in question a realistic opportunity to rehabilitate his or her life, than a prison sentence will be more appropriate. After all, the core function of the Singapore prison service is to protect society through the safe custody and rehabilitation of offenders.
 
It is useful to note from the above extract that a custodial sentence could serve two purposes. Firstly, the offender is kept in safe custody for the protection of the public. Secondly, it could serve to rehabilitate the young offender by helping them to becoming responsible citizens.
24 With regard to reformative training, Section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) reads as follows:
 
13(1) Where a male person is convicted by the High Court or District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment, then if on the day of his conviction he is not less than 16 but under 21 years of age, and the Court is satisfied having regard to his character and previous conduct, and to the circumstances of the offence, that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court may, in lieu of any other sentence, pass a sentence of reformative training.
 
25 While the reformation of a young offender is an important factor, the Court would have to consider other factors as well. One such factor was the public interest. In the English case of 
Caird
 [1970] 54 Cr App R 499, the Court of Appeal dealt with this aspect in the following manner:
 
""What, however, has to be assessed is whether the sentences were, in the view of the Court, in each individual instance appropriate. In each case it has looked at the overall sentence imposed as a whole. The Court has felt bound in each case to give proper weight to the public interest and not simply to regard the welfare of the defendant as the paramount consideration.""
 
26 The approach which this Court adopted was therefore to strike a delicate balance between the individual needs of the accused and the protection of the interest of the community at large and the uniform application of the law. In adopting this approach, I had guidance from the learned Chief Justice in the case of 
Fay v Public Prosecutor
 
[1994] 2 SLR 154
 when his Honour said:
 
""I do not doubt that the legislative intent behind the amendments to the Probation of Offenders Act was to promote the rehabilitation of young first-time offenders. However, as demonstrated by the wording of the above proviso, the legislature has entrusted to the courts the discretion to decide the suitability of such offenders for rehabilitation while weighing also in the balance the wider concerns of society. Indeed the delicate balancing of individual needs and community concerns is a crucial factor which, with respect, was not sufficiently highlighted. This court agrees that the administration of justice should be tempered with a keen regard for the needs of the individual as far as the ambit of our laws allows. At the same time, our judiciary must remain conscious of its responsibility to safeguard the interests of the law-abiding general public and to uniformly apply the law to all those who violate it.""
 
27 In determining the sentence to be meted out, the nature of the offence that the accused had committed was a vital factor to be considered. The offence of rioting is to be perceived as an offence in breach of public tranquillity. The Court has the paramount duty to protect the right of the public to tranquility and safety. Any act that jeopardises such an interest must be dealt with decisively and robustly. The accused and his numerous gang members are youths and young adults. They had gathered in such a large number to attack the victims in a busy public place. Such an audacious act of gang hooliganism constituted an affront of law and order and a serious threat to public safety. Singapore cannot afford to have gangs mounting revenge attacks on their enemies in the streets. As noted by the Court of Appeal in 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Kei Loon Allan
 
[1999] 2 SLR 288
, ""juvenile delinquency is an increasingly serious problem on Singapore streets."" The Court was conscious of its part to ensure that our streets and public places were not turned into arenas where gangs of rampaging youths carry out such overt and mindless acts in breach of peace and good order. It was therefore imperative for the protection of the public interest to impose a sentence that would convey a stern warning in no uncertain terms that such anti-social behaviour would not be tolerated and that offenders could expect to be dealt with severely. The sentence must serve to deter the accused in particular as well as potential offenders in general, especially youthful delinquents, from committing such acts of group violence in future. In 
Muhamammad Nuzaihan bin Kamal Luddin’s
 case, the learned Chief Justice pointed out that ""considerations of general deterrence must in certain instances take precedence over those of specific or individual deterrence."" In the interest of the public and indeed the country, the importance of general deterrence in cases of street violence by large groups of youths and young adults cannot be over-emphasised.
Sentence
28 Having considered the factors mentioned above, the Court firmly believed that it would be wholly inappropriate to order probation treatment or reformative training for the accused in the circumstances of the case. The Court sentenced the accused to 4

Relevance of the likelihood of success of the rehabilitive attempt
 
1  The appellant was convicted in the district court on a charge of having consumed N, α-Dimethyl-3, 4-(methylenedioxy)phenethylene (‘Ecstasy’), an offence under s 8(b)(i) read with s 8A of the Misuse of Drugs Act (‘MDA’) (Cap 185). She was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment and appealed against her sentence. After calling for a probation report, I dismissed her appeal and upheld the sentence imposed by the district court. I now give my reasons.
The facts
2  The appellant was detained on 21 March 2002 at the Singapore Immigration Arrival Bus Hall at Woodlands Checkpoint. A urine test was administered which tested positive for amphetamines, and she confessed upon questioning to having consumed Ecstasy at a Johore Bahru discotheque. Her urine sample subsequently tested positive for Ecstasy by the Centre for Forensic Sciences of the Health Sciences Authority.
3  The appellant pleaded guilty in the district court to the charge, and, in mitigation, the following account was disclosed to the court below: the appellant had gone to Johore Bahru with her boyfriend, one Alex, on 17 March 2002 as she was depressed by the constant altercations at home between her parents. The day after her arrival, her mother called her and asked her to come home. The appellant intended to comply, but was unwilling to depart on her own as she did not have any Malaysian currency on her. Alex refused her request to take her back to Singapore, and subsequently refused similar requests made on the following days. On 21 March 2002, the appellant accompanied Alex and their friends to a karaoke lounge in Johore Bahru, where she consumed some alcohol. Alex showed her an Ecstasy tablet, bit off half of it, and asked her to take the other half. She was initially reluctant to do so, but relented after Alex kept pressing her.
4  When the appellant returned to Singapore with Alex on the evening of 21 March, Alex was arrested at the checkpoint. The appellant was told that she could depart but elected to wait for Alex. Subsequently, she too was asked to provide a urine sample, and was arrested when her test showed a positive result.
5  The district judge sentenced the appellant to 12 months’ imprisonment, and she appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly excessive. Her grounds were that she was only 17 years old, had an unblemished record, had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, had shown by her good behaviour since her arrest that she had learnt her lesson, and had made a concerted effort to stay away from drugs and also from her boyfriend who had induced her to take the earlier tablet.
6  At the hearing of her appeal before me on 12 November 2002, I was informed that the appellant had gained admission to a polytechnic to pursue a course of Information Management, and she would be deprived of this opportunity of having a proper education if she had to suffer a term of imprisonment. Although I was of the view that none of these factors would justify an alteration in the sentence, I asked for a probation report and adjourned the hearing on account of the appellant’s age.
The principles governing the grant of probation
7 In the present case, the appellant had been convicted of the offence of consumption of drugs, which per s 8(b)(i) of the MDA carries a punishment of imprisonment up to 10 years, or a fine of up to $20,000, or both. However, s 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252) provides that:
 
Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law) is of the opinion that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation order…
 
8  In 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
, I made the following observations as to when it might be appropriate to grant probation to a young offender:
 
Rehabilitation is the dominant consideration where the offender is 21 years and below. Young offenders are in their formative years and 
chances of reforming them into law-abiding adults are better
. The corrupt influence of a prison environment and the bad effects of labelling and stigmatisation may not be desirable for young offenders. Compassion is often shown to young offenders on the assumption that the young ‘don’t know any better’ and they may not have had enough experience to realise the full consequences of their actions on themselves and on others. Teens may also be slightly less responsible than older offenders, being more impressionable, more easily led and less controlled in their behaviour. [my emphasis]
 
 
In 
PP v Muhammad Nuzaihan Bin Kamal Luddin
 [2000] 1 SLR 43, I added the following observations:
 
The traditional and broad rationale of probation therefore has always been to wean offenders away from a life-time career in crime and to reform and rehabilitate them into self-reliant and useful citizens. In the case of youthful criminals, the 
chances of effective rehabilitation
 are greater than in the case of adults, making the possible use of probation more relevant where young offenders are concerned. Nevertheless, [it is] clear that probation is 
never granted as of right, even in the case of juvenile offenders
. In deciding whether or not probation is the appropriate sentence in each case, the court still has to 
take into account all the circumstances
 of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender. [my emphasis]
 
9  The above, however, should not be interpreted as indicating that probation is automatically suitable for a young offender whose lapse is better attributed to naivety and youthful folly than to any criminal tendency. It must be emphasised that the court takes into account all the circumstances of a case when deciding whether to grant probation, and one factor which is relevant to this consideration is the likelihood of success of the attempted rehabilitation. If the circumstances are such that the probation will not afford the offender in question a realistic opportunity to rehabilitate his or her life, then a prison sentence will be more appropriate. After all, the core function of the Singapore prison service is to protect society through the safe custody and rehabilitation of offenders.
Application to the present case
10  It was with the above principles in mind that I resumed the hearing of the appeal on 7 January 2003. I had had the opportunity to study the careful and comprehensive report from the probation officer who had attended to this matter. In doing so, she had interviewed on many occasions the appellant and other members of her family, teachers at her secondary school and at the polytechnic to which she had gone, and officers of the Central Narcotics Board, and she was of the view that the probation prospects were not encouraging. Her parents did not get along and there was constant friction between them at home. Her father was assessed as a concerned but ineffective parent whose regular drinking habit and irregular work schedule had led to his complete lack of involvement in her supervision. Her mother, for her part, was seen to be concerned and protective, but at the same time was unable to exert any parental authority over the appellant. As for her two sisters, she had a close and good relationship with her younger sister but a strained one with the elder sister. The elder sister had in fact disclosed that she had not spoken to the appellant for about two years, did not want to be involved in her affairs, and did not see the possibility of a reconciliation in the near future.
11  With this family environment, it was not surprising to me that the appellant had become dependent on the company of friends with whom she would spend time at discotheques and night clubs, where she indulged in underage drinking, and stayed out until 3.00 am on about three to four times a week. I also noted that, although the appellant had been performing reasonably well in the first three years of secondary school, she had done dismally in her secondary four year and shown only a 75% attendance for that school year. Likewise, the appellant had not attended regularly at the polytechnic and she had failed all her subjects during her time there before she was arrested.
12  It was a reflection of this lack of parental control at home that the probation report took the view that the appellant might have a better chance of rehabilitation and improvement in an alternative physical and social environment. Accordingly, the report recommended a 24-month probation, split into 12 months of intensive and 12 months of supervised probation with the following additional conditions:
(a) to reside in a residential institution such as Andrew and Grace Home, which was prepared to take her, for a period of 12 months;
(b) to remain indoors from 9.00 pm to 6.00 am;
(c) to perform 120 hours of community service;
(d) to attend a prison visit;
(e) to undergo a urine test regime; and
(f) that her parents should be bonded to ensure good behaviour.
13  The prosecution, however, made several criticisms of the proposed probation, with which I agreed. In particular, the recommended home residential programme for teenage girls merely provided for temporary refuge. Its aim was to provide a cosy homelike atmosphere within the concept of a family for those who sought refuge, with surrogate parents providing love and care. While this might have been of benefit to the appellant in that it represented an improvement over her home situation, I noted that the home had no apparent focus on, or programme designed to achieve, the rehabilitation of offenders. The voluntary nature of the residential programme also meant that the appellant could discontinue her stay if she chose to. Of course, this would be tantamount to a breach of a condition of her probation, but the fact remained that the programme would not carry with it the sting of compulsion.
14  I was also mindful of the prosecution’s argument that prison, too, could achieve the aim of rehabilitating young offenders such as the appellant; the aim of the prison service being to help steer offenders towards being responsible members of society. It would also afford the appellant, if she was indeed sincere in continuing her studies, the opportunity to do so, through avenues such as the prison school. In this context, my attention was drawn to a speech made by the Minister for Home Affairs at the Prisons Workplan Seminar on 26 March 2002, in which the Minister noted that about 80% of the inmates taking the GCE ""A"" Level examination in the previous year had achieved a minimum of one ""A"" Level pass, which was about 50% higher than the national average for private candidates.
15   In light of the foregoing, I was of the view that while it is common for young offenders of the appellant’s age and who have committed similar offences to be granted probation, this would not be appropriate in the present case. A strong and committed family unit which is ready and willing to take a leading role in the rehabilitation of an offender is crucial to the success of such rehabilitative attempts, and clearly, this was not present in the instant case. The probation report had recognised this and suggested an alternative location for her probation to be served, namely at a residential home. However, I accepted the DPP’s view that the alternative suggested was not a viable one, as it was not tailored towards providing that requisite level of supervision and vigilance. Accordingly, I declined to accept the recommendation of the probation report and dismissed the appeal against sentence.",2003-01-21 00:00:00,SG High Court

Lai Siu Chiu J:
1          This suit revolves around a privatisation exercise, which went wrong, of Bedok Reservoir HUDC Estate (“the Estate”). The estate was privatised on 1 February 2000 and is now known as Waterfront View Condominium
The background
2          The Estate comprises of 583 flats in 13 blocks built by the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”), as a phase Ш HUDC estate in the 1980s. The abbreviation “HUDC” stands for Housing & Urban Development Corporation Pte Ltd. HUDC estates were built in the 1970s to cater to the housing needs of a “sandwich” class of Singaporeans, whose income overqualified them for ownership of HDB flats but was insufficient to enable them to purchase private housing. This was before the advent of executive condominium flats in 1995, also introduced by the HDB (but built by the private sector) to meet the public’s desire to own private property at more affordable prices. At the material time, all 79 plaintiffs were flat owners in the Estate, together with the first to fifth defendants. Carolyn Tan, R Ambika, Koh Sian Ann and Au Thye Chuen (the sixth to ninth defendants) were at the material time partners of the law firm known as Tan-Au Associates (“TAA”) which, on 10 February 2001, merged with another law firm Thomas Au & Lim to form Tan & Au Partnership (the tenth defendant).
3          In the mid-1990s, the government initiated a policy of privatising HUDC estates, with a view to converting all HUDC estates to private estates by 1998 (according to press reports). The intention (according to the written testimony of a HDB representative) was to allow HUDC residents to collectively upgrade their estates to a standard comparable to private residential estates, and thereby to enjoy the status and advantages of private property owners. Privatisation of HUDC estates could be effected, under (the amended) ss 126 and 126A of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the Act”), only if 75% or more of flat owners in an estate consented. However, the Act does not spell out precisely how the privatisation exercise should be carried out nor is there subsidiary legislation to assist. Neither did the HDB stipulate any mandatory procedures to be followed for the process. Upon privatisation, HUDC leases issued by the HDB are converted into strata titles under the Act, flat owners become subsidiary proprietors and are tenants-in-common of common property such as car parks, playgrounds, open areas and whatever other amenities that may have been built on the estate by the HDB. Management and running of the privatised estate is taken over from the HDB or Town Council as the case may be, by the management corporation formed under s 33 of the Act. The first HUDC estates to be privatised under the government policy were Gillman Heights and Pine Grove in 1995.
The facts
4          On or about 8 September 1996 at a block party held in the Estate, Matthias Yao, the then Senior Parliamentary Secretary of Defence and National Development, announced the privatisation of the Estate; this was followed by a gazette notification on 27 September 1996. The Ministry of National Development (“MND”) is in charge of the HDB.
5          Responding to the call by an adviser to the Kaki Bukit Grassroots Organisation for volunteers to join a pro-tem committee to co-ordinate the privatisation exercise, Johnny Chee (the first defendant) came forward. Later, Tang Se Kiong Adrian (the second defendant) and Liew Hiong Wah (the third defendant) also volunteered to be members. Subhash Chandra Mehta (the fifth defendant) joined the pro-tem committee in early 1997 but resigned in 1999 as its vice-chairman, when he moved out of the Estate. Ling Chwee Seng (the fourth defendant) joined the pro-tem committee in January 2000, after he moved into the Estate in 1999. Susan Ng (the tenth plaintiff) was also a member of the pro-tem at one time. So too were Francis Tan Seow Che (the 11th plaintiff), Syed Yahia Aljunied (the 20th plaintiff), Chong Kwen Sam (the 29th plaintiff), Khong Yueng Fung (the 31st plaintiff) and Adrienne Louise Pereira (the 40th plaintiff) at various other times. The first defendant served as the second vice-chairman of the pro-tem committee until he assumed the post of chairman, when the first chairperson, Cheong Wai Yin, resigned around March 1997.
6          The pro-tem committee, which was considered an informal grassroots organisation, initially came under the auspices of the Eunos Constituency secretariat but in 1997, it was transferred to the charge of the secretariat of the Kampong Kembangan constituency. Members of the pro-tem committee had to be approved and were advised by the constituency’s Member of Parliament (“MP”) which in this case was and still is George Yeo, currently the Minister of Trade and Industry. The role of a pro-tem committee in a privatisation exercise of an HUDC estate was contained in an information package (“the Information Package”) issued by the HDB. Essentially, the pro-tem committee was, 
inter alia
, to:
(a)        act as the flat owners’ representative in the privatisation process in consulting the HDB and other government bodies;
(b)        inform the HDB, the relevant Town Councils and other authorities of the flat owners’ views;
(c)        keep flat owners informed of the status quo of privatisation;
(d)        appoint solicitors to act in the privatisation process.
7          Apart from being pro-tem committee members, flat owners could also assist in the privatisation exercise by becoming block representatives 
ie
 each block in the Estate had a representative who served as the liaison between the pro-tem committee and flat owners of the block that appointed him. The articles and objects of the pro-tem committee of the Estate were approved at its third meeting held on 1 October 1996. The pro-tem committee received no funding from the HDB or any government or grassroots organisation and its members were not paid. Members of the pro-tem committee held meetings amongst themselves, and also with flat owners, relating to the privatisation exercise. After such meetings, newsletters (by way of “updates”) were distributed to all flat owners to apprise them on developments as well as seek their views on the privatisation exercise as well as on the general welfare of the Estate.
8          Between late 1996 and early 2002, the pro-tem committee issued 16 updates to the Estate’s flat owners. Before the updates were distributed to flat owners, drafts were first submitted for approval to Kampong Kembangan Constituency Secretariat. The updates would also go the HDB and the MP. In the first update dated 20 October 1996, the pro-tem committee explained the meaning of privatisation, set out its pros and cons and estimated that the cost would be about $25,000 per flat. Notice was also given that a mandate exercise would be carried out to obtain the views of flat owners on privatisation.
9          On 11 November 1996, the pro-tem committee distributed an informal survey form to the Estate’s flat owners to obtain their feedback on the privatisation exercise. By 23 July 1997 (when the third update was issued) the pro-tem committee had obtained the results of the informal survey. Of the 40% flat owners who responded, 79% were in favour of privatisation.
10        In September 1997, members of the pro-tem committee took active steps to garner support for privatisation of the Estate by making door-to-door visits to every household, usually on weekends and Friday evenings. Notice of the pro-tem committee’s proposed visits was given in the fourth update dated 10 September 1997. By the date of the fifth update (10 December 1997), the door-to-door visits had taken place and the pro-tem committee’s mission was accomplished – there was overwhelming support for privatisation. In the fifth update, it was announced that the mandate exercise would be held on Sunday 22 February 1998 and lawyers would be appointed to take care of the legal aspects. The mandate procedure had been explained in the fourth update which stated under item 7:
The committee has set the voting target date to be in Feb 1998 or at the latest Mar 1998. All lessees of a unit in the estate must sign a legal document indicating their approval or disapproval. Those who are unable to sign the legal document personally must obtain the power of attorney to authorise someone to act for them. A mandate of more than 75% of all households approving privatisation is required for the estate to be privatised.
11        In preparation for the mandate exercise, the second defendant and the pro-tem committee’s secretary (Jeanie Hoon) were tasked with finding a law firm. After obtaining quotations from three law firms, the pro-tem committee decided to and did appoint TAA by a letter dated 5 January 1998. The pro-tem committee’s choice was based not only on the competitive quotation received from the law firm but on the track record of TAA; they had acted previously in the privatisation of the HUDC estate at Jurong East. According to the written testimony of the sixth defendant, TAA had also acted in the privatisation exercise of Hougang South as well as of Farrer Court, both HUDC estates. The pro-tem committee informed flat owners in the Estate of TAA’s appointment in the sixth update dated 6 February 1998. The relevant extract (item 2) of that update states:
Mandate for Privatisation: Voting is on Sunday 22
nd
 February 1998
The Pro-Tem committee seeks the mandate for privatisation from all lessees on the 22
nd
 Feb 1998. We have appointed the lawyers from Tan-Au and Associates to witness and validate the voting. There will be two voting sites – arranged for your convenience – void decks of blocks 727 (for lessees of blocks 726-732) and 738 (for lessees of blocks 733-738). Voting starts at 8 am and ends around 5 pm. For successful privatisation, 75% of residents must vote in favour of privatisation. Voting will be done by signing a consent form in front of a lawyer. … If you are physically out of town for a long period covering that date, may I encourage you to obtain the power of attorney and assign a trusted relative or friend to vote in favour of privatisation.
12        On 15 February 1998, the pro-tem committee issued a voting update (“the voting update”) furnishing details of how the mandate exercise would be carried out and giving flat owners as an alternative, the contact details and address of TAA should they need to go to the law firm’s office to vote. To further publicise the mandate exercise, the pro-tem committee pasted notices around the Estate which, 
inter alia
, stated the date, time and place of the scheduled voting. (The second defendant Tang See Kiong (DW3) was to later testify that the wording in the notices was copied from that used in the Jurong East privatisation exercise). Banners were also displayed around the Estate announcing the schedule. The HDB was also informed by letter.
13        The mandate exercise proceeded as scheduled on Sunday 22 February 1998 (“the Voting day”) with two stations for voting, which inquiry/help desks the first and fifth defendants helped to man. Voters who wished to vote in favour of privatisation were directed to a station manned by staff of TAA to sign their consents, whilst those who objected to privatisation were directed to another station to fill in a dissent form, stating their names and giving reasons for their objections. However, some flat owners who did not favour privatisation did not fill out the dissent forms; these were referred by the pro-tem committee as the “no show” cases. As for those who favoured privatisation, there were instances where only one of two joint lessees of flats signed the consent forms. These were referred to as “partial consent” cases. The third defendant and some other members of the pro-tem committee made door-to-door visits in the afternoon to remind flat owners to cast their votes. Unfortunately, many flat owners were not at home. In the event, the requisite 75% mandate was not achieved when voting closed at 5.00pm, according to a tally done subsequently by TAA.
14        The pro-tem committee decided against holding a second mass mandate exercise when it received TAA’s quotation for participation in the event, which it considered to be too high, even after a discount. As an alternative, the pro-tem committee accepted TAA’s proposal that flat owners be encouraged to visit the law firm’s office to sign the consent forms. TAA therefore wrote on 25 and 26 March 1998 to 67 “no show” and ten “partial consent” flat owners requesting them to call at the law firm’s office to sign the consent forms.
15        On 6 April 1998, TAA wrote to the pro-tem committee with a list of flat owners who had given “full” consents. The number totalled 435 which was 74.6% of all flat owners. Between 6 and 10 April 1998 however, TAA received three full consent forms which brought the tally to 438 votes, just crossing the statutory limit of 75% by 0.12%. On 16 April 1998 (unbeknownst to TAA), the pro-tem committee issued a circular to flat owners making an “unofficial” announcement that the Estate had been privatised. The circular urged flat owners who had not yet given their consent, to do so at TAA’s office. On the following day, it followed up with a letter to the Estate’s MP and adviser Minister George Yeo, to inform him of the voting outcome, indicating that the pro-tem committee intended to proceed further to obtain a mandate of 80%. On their part, TAA wrote to the HDB on 4 May 1998 forwarding the originals of the 438 consents the law firm had received.
16        With the prior approval of the MND, an official announcement of the privatisation mandate was made by Minister George Yeo at a block party held at the Estate on 27 August 1998; a press release was also issued that day. In their letter dated 24 August 1998 (approving the official announcement of the mandate exercise) addressed to the 1st defendant as chairman of the pro-tem committee, the HDB warned:
We wish to highlight that given the mandate result being only marginally above the statutory minimum level of 75%, the effect of the publicity would be touch and go. It may spur more residents in the estate to support privatisation or result in the reverse. Your pro-tem committee may thus wish to improve on the result further.
17        With the 75% mandate, however, there were immediate benefits to the flat owners, as spelt out in a letter dated 10 June 1998 from the HDB addressed to the second defendant as vice-chairman of the pro-tem committee. These included:
(a)        the eligibility to refinance or re-mortgage their flats before legal privatisation;
(b)        the eligibility to purchase HDB resale flats for owner-occupation whilst retaining their HUDC flat for rental;
(c)        the eligibility to sublet their entire HUDC flat without the HDB’s prior approval.
The letter concluded with a reminder to the pro-tem committee not to allow the support level for privatisation to fall below 75%. I should point out that even before the above letter from the HDB was received, the first defendant in his capacity as chairman of the pro-tem committee had issued the seventh update of 8 June 1998 (items 2 and 3) to inform flat owners in the Estate of the immediate benefits of privatisation. Item 1 of the seventh update stated:
Mandate for Privatisation is a Success
I would like to thank all lessees for participating in the vote for privatisation. Although some were undecided and some were not in favour, overall we received the mandate to privatise as more than 75% were in favour. Our lawyers have submitted the validated consent forms and HDB is already processing them. We should receive an official letter confirming our privatisation before the end of June 1998. Once again thank you to each and everyone of you, and especially to the Pro-Tem Committee members and the Block Representatives for their effort in all the work that has led to this successful privatisation.
18        As the population of the Estate was not static, due to flat owners moving in and out, or passing away, being adjudicated bankrupt or getting divorced, the pro-tem committee had to canvass support for the privatisation continuously, to replace previous consents given by flat owners which were no longer valid. The pro-tem committee relied on the HDB for information of changes in ownership of flats in the Estate. It also relied on the HDB for periodic updates on the status quo of the percentage of support, including the fact that in November 2001, support had fallen to about 73% to 74%. Whenever the HDB informed the pro-tem committee of ownership changes, the pro-tem committee would in turn instruct TAA (or the tenth defendant if after 10 February 2001) to prepare consent forms with which committee members would approach new flat owners for their signatures. New flat owners after 22 February 1998 included the 25th, 26th, 43rd, 44th, 45th, 47th, 49th, 50th, 51st, 54th, 56th and 78th plaintiffs. The ongoing process of obtaining new consent forms to replace invalid ones continued until 3 December 2001, when TAA lodged the application under s 126A of the Act with the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”) for issuance of Subsidiary Strata Certificates of Title (“SSCT”). I should add that TAA lodged the application only after the HDB, by their letter dated 13 October 2001, gave the green light. As at 3 December 2001, there were 444 consent forms equivalent to 76.15% of all flat owners.
19        In the course of procuring fresh consents from new flat owners, the pro-tem committee received feedback that “no show” and “partial consent” cases had found it troublesome to visit the law firm’s office to sign the consent forms. Consequently, in May 1998, someone mooted the idea of having members of the pro-tem committee witness the consent forms so that the same could be signed in the Estate itself. The HDB, when approached, agreed with the proposal, subject to TAA’s consent. When consulted, TAA raised no objections but required pro-tem committee members who witnessed the signing of consent forms to swear a statutory declaration to confirm that fact. The precautionary step was understandable, given that TAA, as the Estate’s solicitors, were required to issue the standard certificate under s 59 of the Act. Eventually, the first to fifth defendants were appointed to witness the signatures of flat owners to consent forms and each of them swore a statutory declaration for every consent form he or she witnessed. They witnessed 68 consent forms altogether.
20        The delay (between April 1998 and 3 December 2001) in submitting the application for SSCT was due to a number of unforeseen and other factors including:
(a)        the survey and realignment of the boundary of the Estate;
(b)        disputes with neighbouring HDB flat owners on the positioning of the boundary, which came too close to one of their blocks; and
(c)        slow progress in construction works necessary for privatisation including the boundary wall, fire-rated doors, resurfacing of car parks and hard standing bays.
The problem was compounded by the original contractors for the boundary wall having to be replaced because they ran into financial difficulties. The original and subsequent contractors were appointed by the Aljunied Town Council (formerly the Eunos-Pasir Ris Town Council), which had taken over management and maintenance of the estate from the HDB, in February 1990.
21        On 10 December 2001, the SLA wrote by registered mail to all flat owners in the Estate to inform them that an application for SSCT had been lodged on 3 December 2001 by not less than 75% of the registered proprietors of the flats. The letter enclosed copies of notices which the SLA had published in the English and Chinese dailies, 
The Straits Times
 and 
Lianhe Zao Bao
 respectively, on 6 December 2001. The notices were to the effect that the SLA would be issuing the SSCT to the flat owners after six weeks from that date, unless valid objections were lodged in writing with the SLA before the expiration of six weeks.
22        No objections were received by the SLA within the six-week deadline stated in the newspaper notices or at all. Consequently, the SLA proceeded to and did issue the SSCT to all the flat owners in the Estate which was officially privatised on 1 February 2002. On 2 February 2002, the SLA issued the certificate of formation of the Estate’s management corporation 
ie
 Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2625 (“the MCST”). In March 2002, the HDB through the MCST called for payment from the flat owners of $19,535.43 (the conversion fee) per flat, being the fees payable (inclusive of survey and legal fees) for privatisation. A further sum ($2,000–$3,000) payable to the HDB for construction costs has not yet been called for. The MCST held its first Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) on 4 May 2002, chaired by an officer from the HDB, Seng Joo How. It was attended by some 267 subsidiary proprietors including one Teo Boon Huat Patrick (“Teo”), who raised and questioned the validity of the privatisation process. Two days after the AGM, Teo sent a lengthy e-mail to Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the Minister of State for National Development, voicing his concerns on the privatisation process.
The dispute
23        On 21 March 2002, a group of flat owners from the Estate signed a petition to the HDB (“the Petition”) which was enclosed in a personal letter written by a flat owner Dr Kevin Tan (“Dr Tan”) to their MP, Minister George Yeo. The Petition questioned the validity of the privatisation exercise and complained of various defects in the Estate (including sinking aprons, exposed gas pipes, ageing lifts), which responsibility for, and cost of repair, the petitioners put squarely on the HDB.
24        I should point out at this juncture that Dr Tan chose not to be a plaintiff although his wife Tan Meng Lang (PW2) is the 57th plaintiff. When she was cross-examined on whether Dr Tan shared her views on privatisation (which she had opposed), the 57th plaintiff said she could not answer for him. Questioned by the court why Dr Tan as a co-lessee of her unit (Block 729 #12-5066) chose not to be a co-plaintiff, the 57th plaintiff said he had no time. That explanation has to be viewed with some scepticism, in the light of the fact that Dr Tan was the author of the Petition. He had attended meetings organised by Teo (particularly those held on 18 April, 19 April and 11 May 2002,), prepared the agenda and drafted the minutes of the April 2002 meetings and, in his capacity as chairman of the MCST, called for an extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) on 26 April 2003 to consider suing the HDB. Further, he presented a privatisation report at the EGM. Yet, Dr Tan did not have the time to attend court notwithstanding his many personal grievances over the privatisation process and the major role he played in drumming up support for Teo’s cause.
25        Although the 57th plaintiff disagreed with counsel for the defendants when the suggestion was put to her, there is little doubt in my mind that her husband is not a plaintiff because he wished to avoid being cross-examined. The offer from the plaintiffs’ counsel for Dr Tan to be cross-examined, after his wife had stepped down from the witness box, came too late and was rightly rejected by both the court and counsel for the defendants. The couple has not paid the $19,195.96 conversion fee; neither has Teo.
26        Between April and May 2002, no less than nine meetings of disgruntled flat owners took place organised by Teo, the seventh plaintiff. Teo’s involvement extended to “facilitating” (in his own words) the printing of a circular dated 13 April 2002, distributed to those who had signed the Petition. He invited the Petitioners to attend meetings which he had arranged on 18 and 19 April 2002 at which, at his own cost, his solicitor (now the plaintiffs’ solicitor) was present. Doubts were sown at these meetings on the propriety of the privatisation exercise. The discontent amongst the flat owners was reported in the press and led to the filing of this suit on 18 June 2002. It also prompted the Minister of National Development to make a statement in Parliament on 24 April 2003.
The pleadings
27        The original suit was commenced as a representative action by five plaintiffs against the first to fifth defendants and tenth defendant, purporting to represent 154 other plaintiffs. In December 2002, the writ of summons was amended to its present form and 80 flat owners withdrew from the suit. In the current and lengthy (105 paragraphs, 68 pages) statement of claim, the 79 plaintiffs alleged the following breaches were committed by the first to fifth defendants:
(a)        breach of agreement,
(b)        breach of fiduciary duties and agency,
(c)        negligence and breach of duty of care,
(d)        misrepresentation,
(e)        negligent misstatement.
28        The plaintiffs alleged that by the unofficial announcement in the circular dated 16 April 1998 and the seventh update dated 8 June 1998, the pro-tem committee, including the five defendants, made them believe that a mandate of 75% had been obtained on the Voting day, and that subsequent votes in favour of privatisation would be over and above the 75% procured on Voting day. The plaintiffs averred that in May 2002 they discovered the representation was false, misleading and untrue, as on Voting day, the percentage obtained was less than 75%. They alleged that although this fact was known to the defendants, all of them deliberately withheld the information from the plaintiffs between the Voting day and 3 December 2001, when the application under s 126A of the Act was lodged with the SLA.
29        The plaintiffs further alleged that in the interval (22 February 1998 to 3 December 2001), as flats in the Estate changed ownership, the first to fifth defendants continued to and did garner an additional 75 votes for privatisation, and the majority of consent forms executed during the period between July 1998 and December 2001 were not attested by the sixth defendant or any lawyer from TAA or the tenth defendant. The flat owners were alleged to have been induced to sign the consent forms by false and untrue representations made by the first to fifth defendants
 
-
 
since a mandate of 75% had been secured, these flat owners (who included the 25th, 49th, 51st, 52nd, 54th and 77th plaintiffs) had a legal obligation to sign the consent forms in order to obtain their SSCT under the Act.
30        The plaintiffs alleged that the consents lodged with the application for SSCT were null, void and of no effect since the total votes attained on the Voting day were less than 75%. Hence, there was no mandate for privatisation. Further, no further votes could be garnered after the ballot was closed without the express knowledge and consent of the flat owners to either extend the voting period or have a fresh voting exercise. Any further votes so garnered were consequently invalid.
31        In their (re-amended) defence, the first to fifth defendants, 
inter alia
:
(a)        denied they were and had assumed responsibilities as agents of, or stood in a fiduciary relationship with, the plaintiffs or owed the plaintiffs any duty of care as alleged; they asserted their membership of the pro-tem committee was more akin to being members of grassroots organisations;
(b)        denied they or any of them, had made any representation to any of the plaintiffs or to the flat owners at any material time, that the mandate for privatisation was to be solely determined by the total number of consents signed on the Voting day;
(c)        denied that the circular of 16 April 1998 and seventh update of 8 June 1998 made the representations alleged by the plaintiffs; they asserted that the contents of the circular and update were true as a matter of substance and form;
(d)        admitted that they (together with the sixth defendant) were aware that the total number of consents signed on 22 February 1998 was less than 75% but denied they had deliberately failed to inform flat owners of this fact; they further denied that they owed any duty or obligation enforceable in law to inform the plaintiffs or flat owners of the number of written consents signed that day;
(e)        admitted that members of the pro-tem committee continued to seek the signing of consents from flat owners between 22 February 1998 and 3 December 2001 and averred that in April 1998 the total number of written consents obtained from flat owners exceeded 75%; they contended that the total number of consents obtained on 22 February 1998 did not by itself determine if the privatisation would or would not proceed and averred that the pro-tem committee was at liberty to continue garnering more written consents;
(f)         admitted that 69 consent forms signed by flat owners were not witnessed by the sixth defendant or a solicitor from TAA or the tenth defendant; they denied their witnessing of those forms was not proper or lawful, as it was done with the knowledge and consent of the HDB, upon advice received from the SLA;
(g)        denied any representation was made by any of them to any of the plaintiffs or to any flat owner at any material time, that 75% mandate for privatisation had been obtained on the Voting day and that the flat owners had a legal obligation to sign the consent forms in order to obtain their SSCT; the five defendants specifically denied they had made any of the alleged oral representations to the 25th, 49th, 51st, 52nd and 77th plaintiffs;
(h)        contended that flat owners were at all material times aware, from the circular dated 16 April 1998 that those who had not signed consent forms on 22 February 1998 could continue to do so; the circular had stated:
One More Chance
For those who have not yet voted, we want to encourage you to sign the consent form at Tan Au Associates, 10 Anson Road … so that we may record and send a strong signal to the market that we have received a strong support for privatisation.
And for those who did not agree, but would now like to go with the majority, you may do so by signing the consent form at the lawyer’s office.
(i)         asserted there was a valid mandate for privatisation when the application for SSCT was lodged on 3 December 2001, which application was lodged not on their, but on the, instructions of the HDB.
32        There is no necessity to refer to the pleadings filed by the sixth to tenth defendants for the reason that in the midst of trial, namely on 17 November 2003, the plaintiffs withdrew their claim against the sixth, eighth, ninth and tenth defendants. Earlier in March 2003, the plaintiffs had discontinued their action against the seventh defendant. For convenience, the first to fifth defendants will henceforth be referred to as the defendants, as they are the only defendants left in this action.
33        On the third day of trial (13 November 2003), the defendants through their solicitors made an open offer to all the plaintiffs in the following terms:
The Defendants are prepared to allow any individual Plaintiff to discontinue his or her action against the defendants with each party bearing their own costs (subject to the respective plaintiff unconditionally withdrawing all allegations made in the action and undertaking not to take any other action against any of the Defendants in respect of any matter that had formed the subject matter of this action) and provided that any Plaintiff who wishes to accept this offer must communicate his or her acceptance to the Defendants’ solicitors no later than 6pm Friday 14 November 2003.
34        Notwithstanding the above deadline, the defendants allowed a number of plaintiffs to accept the offer after 14 November 2003. These were the ninth, tenth, 29th, 31st, 32nd, 38th, 58th and 66th plaintiffs. The ninth and tenth plaintiffs were not represented at the trial.
The evidence
35        Fifty of the 79 plaintiffs testified for their case. The principal witness for the plaintiffs was Teo, the seventh plaintiff, whose affidavit evidence was also the most lengthy. In their written testimonies, all the other plaintiffs adopted his evidence (save for the 57th plaintiff when she took the stand). The first, second, third and fifth defendants testified for the defence whilst the written testimony of the fourth defendant was accepted, without the need for cross-examination. The head of Special Projects Units from the HDB, Gan Bee Ghee (DW5), was the last witness for the defendants.
The plaintiffs’ case
36        I turn now to the evidence adduced from the plaintiffs’ witnesses, starting with that of Teo (PW1), who is a business consultant. Teo relied on the HDB guidelines for privatisation (“the Guidelines”) for the plaintiffs’ case that the defendants’ conduct of the privatisation exercise contravened the Guidelines in the following manner:
(a)        Voting took place on one day when the recommendation was to schedule the same over several days.
(b)        As the voting took place on 22 February 1998, the fate of the Estate was to be settled on that day and not any other days since the Guidelines state, “Lessees of at least 75% of the flats must agree before approaching HDB for conversion.”
37        Teo alleged that the ninth defendant whom he approached on the Voting day did not inform him there was a dissent form which flat owners could sign, only that to vote against privatisation, Teo would have to call at TAA’s office. He understood from the representations made to him (and to the other plaintiffs) by the pro-tem committee or the defendants, that the form he signed on the Voting day was meant solely for the purpose of the mandate exercise. He understood the results would be announced, as stated in the voting update. Instead, there was a period of silence before he received the pro-tem committee’s circular dated 16 April 1998 making the unofficial announcement that the Estate had been privatised. He was misled into thinking that the 75% vote had been achieved on the Voting day. His mistaken view was compounded by a letter dated 25 July 1998 from TAA signed by the sixth defendant which stated:
We wish to inform you that the voting day was held on 22
nd
 February 1998 and more than 75% of the voters are agreeable to the privatisation.
and by the seventh update dated 8 June 1998 which stated:
[W]e received the mandate to privatise as more than 75% were in favour.
38        Teo complained that in the interval between 22 February 1998 and 4 May 2002 (when the first AGM of the MCST was held), there was no indication or document to flat owners from the pro-tem committee, the defendants, TAA, the HDB or the tenth defendant, that the mandate exercise on the Voting day had failed to garner 75% support for privatisation. Flat owners were also not told that the mandate exercise would be extended and continued until such time as the requisite 75% for privatisation was secured. It was only in August 2002 that flat owners learnt that the 75% mandate was not obtained on the Voting day. Teo contended the sixth defendant’s letter dated 25 April 2002 was an afterthought as she attempted to justify the Voting day as a conveyancing exercise. As the requisite 75% vote was not obtained on the Voting day, Teo asserted it was necessary to schedule another voting date 
to re-garner votes, not to continue to garner votes
. Otherwise, the Estate could not be privatised. He cited the mandate exercise in Bishan-Shunfu HUDC (“Shunfu”) estate as an example of what he and other plaintiffs expected. I shall return to the Shunfu example later.
39        One of the plaintiffs’ assertions was that there was an agreement which the defendants had breached. Cross-examined, Teo explained that the agreement was one 
inter se
 reached between the defendants and all the flat owners on the Voting day, signified 
either
 by their turning up to vote that day or 
not
 turning up to vote. Anyone who did not want to be part of the agreement had to inform the pro-tem committee. Otherwise, he would be considered a party to the agreement. Teo further asserted that flat owners who purchased their units and moved into the Estate 
after
 22 February 1998 were bound by their vendors’ consents given on the Voting day and thereby became parties to the agreement. However, when cross-examined on the nature and terms of the agreement, Teo was unable to particularise and/or gave inconsistent answers. Initially, he said the terms were variously found in the fifth and sixth updates and the voting update as well as in the first, fourth, and seventh to 16th updates at another stage. The Guidelines were also thrown in for good measure. Eventually, he said that the agreement was by conduct and was evidenced in writing in the statement of claim itself.
40        Shown the relevant documents, Teo made the following concessions on his or the other plaintiffs’ allegations:
(a)        the Guidelines in the Information Package did not spell out that the mandate for privatisation must be done only on one day;
(b)        the consents of the flat owners need not necessarily be witnessed only by solicitors;
(c)        contrary to what attendees of the meetings held on 18 and 19 April 2002 were told, the HUDC Housing Estates Act (Cap 131, 1985 Rev Ed) does not apply to the Estate because it is a phase Ш estate.
41        On misrepresentation, the 57th to 79th plaintiffs (who did not consent to privatisation) alleged that they were led to believe they were bound by the 75% mandate supposedly obtained on the Voting day. Hence, they did not assert their right to object to privatisation. The first to 42nd plaintiffs alleged that they lost their right to give consents afresh or to withdraw their previous consents before the application under s 126 of the Act was lodged. They were unaware that no mandate was obtained on the Voting day. Yet another accusation levelled against the defendants was that they induced and procured six flat owners (the 25th, 49th, 51st, 52nd and 54th plaintiffs) to sign the consent forms by misrepresenting to those persons that the 75% mandate had been obtained and privatisation was inevitable. The plaintiffs largely relied on Teo’s testimony to support their allegations.
42        Cross-examined, Teo agreed that none of the updates he relied on had stated that only votes obtained on the Voting day or other specific days would be counted. On the contrary, some flat owners (such as Bena Belani) had requested to sign their consent forms before the Voting day and some (like Poon Bee Guan and Tan York Huay Sophia), after the voting day.
43        When he was cross-examined, Yu Mang Hsia (“Yu”), the 69th plaintiff and the treasurer (since September 2002) of the MCST, revealed that none of the resolutions tabled at the EGM by Dr Tan on 26 April 2003, including the following, were passed:
3.1        The need to immediately, and if necessary, commence legal action against the [HDB] to obtain an account of the Privatisation Costs claimed …
3.3        The need to immediately, and if necessary, commence legal action against the parties responsible for the acceptance of the estate from Aljunied Town Council (ATC) and/or HDB, including the HDB Interim Council (consisting of Seng Joo How, Ong-Gan Bee Gee and Lee Soon Ai) and the Protem Committee (PTC).
3.5        The need to immediately, and if necessary, commence legal action against the parties responsible for the awarding and/or administering of the contract for, the construction of and/or for the acceptance of the Boundary Fence including ATC, Premas International Ltd [managing agents before the MCST], the Interim Council ..., the PTC and/or the contractors.
3.7        To approve the call of contributions for the legal costs required of $160 per share-value or $640 per household for all or such of the above steps, and whether by a single lump sum payment and/or by several payments. …
3.8        Further, and in the alternative to resolution 3.7 above, to approve the call for contributions to cover the cost of carrying out the above rectification works up to a maximum of $21,250 per share-value or $85,000 per household, and whether by a single lump sum payment and/or by several payments. …
44        Yu (PW5) explained that the conversion fee of $19,535.43 was not paid by some households because flat owners had passed a resolution at the 2002 AGM of the MCST, to hold payment in abeyance until an explanation was forthcoming from the HDB, on how the bill was raised. The council received no response from the HDB. The HDB as well as the developers (not identified) refused to meet with members of the MCST to discuss outstanding issues. That prompted the calling of the April 2003 EGM; the MCST wanted to be proactive in solving problems.
45        Yu (who had voted against privatisation on the Voting day) also complained that the Aljunied Town Council spent $1m on the boundary wall when $600,000 would have sufficed. Even then, the boundary wall had shown defects soon after its construction in 2001–2002. When asked what action the Aljunied Town Council had taken on the defects, the MCST was told the council was claiming liquidated damages against the first contractor, which was futile since the contractor had gone bankrupt early in the construction stage. Yu added that the Aljunied Town Council only handed over $800,000 to the MCST as the balance of sinking funds for the Estate and did not provide a breakdown to date, despite requests from the MCST.
46        Yu did not justify or render a breakdown for the exorbitant figures of $21,250 and $85,000 set out in resolution 3.8 tabled at the EGM. I can only assume it was a tactic (as the defendants submitted) meant to scare the flat owners into accepting the much cheaper option of paying $640 per household to engage lawyers to sue whoever was at fault. Fortunately, good sense prevailed and none of the resolutions tabled were passed.
The defendants’ case
47        All the defendants testified that there was no such agreement as propounded by the plaintiffs. There was never any intention on the part of the pro-tem committee (including the defendants) to create legal relations between themselves and the other flat owners by way of the various updates or otherwise. The defendants’ assertion in this respect was not challenged by the plaintiffs’ counsel during their cross-examination.
48        The defendants’ key witness was the first defendant. He denied any representations were made to the plaintiffs. He clarified that statements in the various updates were not representations but only informal communications to flat owners. No representations were made to flat owners either, that the mandate for privatisation would only be taken on the Voting day and no other days. It was also evident from the Information Package that the mandate exercise could take place over a period of time. The exercise took place on one day purely for pragmatic reasons. Voting on that one day was not a polling exercise in the political sense.
49        The first defendant pointed out that it was clear from the voting update that flat owners could opt to sign their consents at the office of TAA, before and after the Voting day. If indeed the plaintiffs’ complaint had any credence, it was strange that none of the flat owners objected to the continued canvassing for votes by the pro-tem committee, after the Voting day and before early 2002. Further, the circular of 16 April 1998 had urged flat owners who had not done so, to sign their consents at the law firm’s office. There was no misrepresentation by him or the pro-tem committee in the circular of 16 April 1998 or in the seventh update of 8 June 1998 as, by those dates, the 75% mandate had indeed been achieved, according to TAA.
50        The first defendant denied he owed flat owners, including the plaintiffs, any duties of care in negligence. Neither did he owe them any duties not to make negligent misstatements. In any case, he had at all times taken care to provide accurate information to flat owners, pointing out that he and his fellow committee members (including some of the plaintiffs at one time) were all volunteers. He denied there was any understanding or agreement reached 
inter se
 between himself and the flat owners as alleged by Teo, and that the pro-tem committee members owed fiduciary duties to flat owners and acted as their agents. He disputed the plaintiffs’ allegation that the percentage of votes for privatisation had dropped to a low of 64.14% at some stage. He contended that the witnessing by the defendants of consent forms was perfectly valid, which evidence was corroborated by the HDB’s representative.
51        The first defendant revealed that despite privatisation, the flat owners still pay the same amount ($104) by way of maintenance charges, although not to the Aljunied Town Council but to the MCST. He concluded his written testimony with his surmise on why the plaintiffs had commenced this action
 
-
 
they were unwilling to pay the conversion fee and were attempting to obtain a waiver or reimbursement of the sum (if paid) from the HDB. The first defendant speculated that the real target of the plaintiffs is actually the HDB whom the plaintiffs are attempting to manoeuvre to the negotiating table, using the defendants as scapegoats. I believe his surmise is not unfounded as, when counsel for the plaintiffs cross-examined the first defendant, one of the first questions asked was whether the first defendant agreed that the HDB was at fault, and if so, should the court rule in the plaintiffs’ favour.
52        The first defendant was cross-examined on why the language used in the 13th update differed from that used in earlier updates by the pro-tem committee. He explained it was due to his receipt of Teo’s e-mail dated 5 July 2000 threatening legal action. On the advice of TAA, the pro-tem committee decided to put the following disclaimer in the 13th update:
Any information we present to you in the updates or in any other form is unofficial. If you want to act on the information, you must check it for accuracy and validity.
53        The 25th, 49th 51st 52nd and 54th plaintiffs who (except for the 52nd plaintiff) moved in after the Voting day, alleged that the defendants had visited them, told them the Estate had been privatised and that their consents were necessary for the issuance to them of the SSCT. The first, second, fourth and fifth defendants denied they made this representation, which denial was also not challenged during cross-examination. Strangely enough, although he complained that two of the defendants had misled him (whose identity he was not at all certain), the 51st plaintiff testified he did not want the Estate to be de-privatised. In the case of the 25th plaintiff, it appeared from his oral evidence that his complaint was not levelled against the defendants. He insisted it was two ladies from the pro-tem committee (whose names he could not recall) who procured his signature to the consent form, even though the first defendant testified he witnessed the 25th plaintiff’s signature, as evidenced from the consent form. The 51st plaintiff’s oral testimony contradicted the plaintiffs’ further and better particulars which alleged that the misrepresentation was made by the first and second defendants, but not the fifth defendant.
54        I refer next to the testimony of the HDB’s representative, Ong-Gan Bee Ghee (“Ms Gan”). The Special Projects Unit of which she is the head (since 1994) is tasked by the MND with overseeing the privatisation process of HUDC estates. She testified that the Estate was the fourth batch of HUDC estates to be selected for privatisation.
55        In order to assist the pro-tem committee on how to initiate the privatisation process, Ms Gan said the HDB not only furnished the committee members with the Information Package but also gave them the contacts of pro-tem committee members of Gillman Heights, Pine Grove and Jurong East HUDC estates. Ms Gan stated that the HDB never intended that the mandate exercise must or should be conducted on a single day. The pro-tem committee was given a large measure of independence to perform their work. As far as the HDB was concerned, the pro-tem committee (with whom it worked closely) could continue to garner support for privatisation, until such time as the application under s 126 of the Act was lodged. In a summary of the briefing given by the HDB on 26 September 1996 sent by the first chairperson of the pro-tem committee to the other committee members was a section entitled “Pointers to note about the ‘Polling’ Exercise”; it stated:
Individual owners are to indicate their support by signing Application for Subsidiary Strata Certificate of Titles.
Exercise should be carried out over a few days, including weekends.
Solicitor to witness and certify correctness of Application Forms.
All lessees of the same unit must sign on the form.
For death cases, Power of Attorney, change of name, etc, copies of legal documents are to be attached to Forms and verified against original documents.
56        Ms Gan confirmed that the HDB only received official confirmation of the 75% mandate from TAA on 4 May 1998. After the Voting day, the HDB was informed that the 75% vote was not achieved. The HDB checked and verified the original consents forwarded by the law firm on 4 May 1998 as well as those lodged for the application under s 126 of the Act, on 3 December 2001. The HDB was satisfied that the privatisation exercise was properly carried out by the pro-tem committee, in accordance with the law and the Guidelines. As the Estate was a phase Ш HUDC estate, the conversion fee included the loss to the HDB of income generated from car park lots in the Estate. This was clearly set out in the Information Package. The HDB had estimated the cost of each car park lot at $20,000; the Estate has 590 car park and 30 motorcycle lots. Further, unlike HUDC estates under phases І and П, the Estate being a phase Ш estate, did not own the common property. Flats in phase I HUDC estates such as Pine Grove had been sold at prices higher than those in phase Ш estates, to factor in the cost of common property. The conversion fee was billed to the MCST which, in turn, would recover the same from the flat owners by way of contributions. The HDB allowed subsidiary proprietors a year’s grace to pay the amount, subject to payment of interest commencing 60 days after the date of the bill.
57        Ms Gan revealed that even before the SLA’s notices to issue the SSCT appeared in the newspapers on 6 December 2001, the HDB of its own accord had written (in late January 2002) a comprehensive letter to all flat owners in the Estate. It updated them on post-privatisation developments in the Estate, including the formation of the MCST and billing of the conversion fee. No response and/or objections were received by the HDB from any flat owner to either the letter or to the notices placed by the SLA in the press.
58        Ms Gan further revealed that she rendered a reply (dated 30 April 2002) on the HDB’s behalf, to the plethora of complaints raised in the Petition presented by Dr Tan. At the behest of Minister George Yeo, the HDB agreed in the letter to carry out goodwill repairs to the aprons at three blocks in the Estate and indicated it would review sunken aprons at other blocks. She also wrote to Teo on 3 May 2002, replying to the e-mail he had addressed to the Prime Minister’s office on 27 April 2002. In the letter, she explained the role of TAA in the privatisation process, the estimated conversion costs of $25,000 and the roles of the Aljunied Town Council before, and the role of the MCST after, privatisation. She had also replied on 13 May 2002 to Teo on other queries he had raised in an e-mail to the 60th plaintiff on 6 May 2002, copied to the HDB.
59        Cross-examined, Ms Gan testified that seeking the 75% mandate was a continuing exercise which could go on indefinitely, citing as an example the experience of Hougang HUDC estate. In the case of Shunfu, Ms Gan said there was no mandate for privatisation yet and the HDB was prepared to wait until such time as the residents obtained the 75% vote. Where the HDB was concerned, there was no cut-off date to sign the consent forms nor for the residents of any HUDC estate to agree to privatisation. No cut-off date was stated in the Information Package. She emphasised that what was crucial was that the 75% mandate must be obtained as at the date the application under s 126 of the Act was submitted. Ms Gan explained that by 3 December 2001, all the necessary works for privatisation of the Estate had already been undertaken and completed at the HDB’s cost, including construction of fire engine access, hard standing areas and the boundary wall. Otherwise, TAA would not have been requested to lodge the application for SSCT.
The defendants’ submissions
60        In their closing submissions, the first to fifth defendants accused Teo (and Dr Tan as well as Lim Beng Huat Henry (the 60th plaintiff/PW43) of having a hidden agenda in instigating the other plaintiffs to institute this suit. The trio was described (in para 103 of the defendants’ submissions) as “ringleaders of a relentless propaganda campaign designed to stoke anti-privatisation sentiments among the residents of the Estate”. Their agenda was to generate sufficient adverse publicity so as to induce the authorities (such as the HDB and the MND) either to unwind the privatisation process or to agree to certain gratuitous benefits, 
eg
 the rectification of alleged defects in the Estate. Consequently, the defendants argued, this action was brought in bad faith and is an abuse of the court process.
61        The defendants relied on an e-mail from Teo to the first defendant and his co-chairman, Henry Low, dated 22 April 2002, as evidence of Teo’s true motive for whipping up dissent among the flat owners. The e-mail
[1]
 
states:
Why was the application to privatise done only on 3 December 2001. 
The valuation of my flat has dropped tremendously in the period
 and I have been unable to refinance to enjoy a lower interest rate because of this delay. Who shall I make my claim for damages on?
Why am I supposed to pay some $19,000 for the transfer of common property when to my understanding of the HUDC Act says that the transfer of common property is for a nominal sum of S$1.00.
Emphasis was placed on the italicised words by the defendants. Teo was described by the defendants as a dishonest witness whose numerous inconsistencies in his evidence were painstakingly highlighted by them in their submissions. The defendants also produced a transcript (which Teo and his counsel did not challenge) of Teo’s remarks to attendees at the meeting on 11 May 2002, to reinforce their accusation that he stoked discontent amongst flat owners. Teo was also accused of taking liberties with the truth in his e-mail dated 6 May 2002 to the Minister of State, MND.
62        The defendants further referred to extracts from a circular dated 27 August 2002 sent to flat owners by the 60th plaintiff which stated:
18         Don’t worry. It is not a question of we wanting to sue our PC [pro-tem committee]. It is not a question of we being not honourable. …
19         Others will know that we are serious in our affairs if we seek redress by suing – not by complaining or bemoaning. … There must be numbers. It is never too late, unless we wait till we bleed. Everyone is needed for the larger good.
20         The numbers taking action are very crucial. Let’s show that there is an overwhelming dissatisfaction and injustice. The Court or the Government will look at the ‘larger good’ even if justice seemed to be ignored or thrown out of Court.
21         Also with overwhelming numbers, the legal fee is unlikely to be near $1,000 per SP [subsidiary proprietor], if we lose the case. If we win, the fee will be even lesser and we may get back our $25,000. Surely, this action is better than paying and paying with privatisation and that is after throwing away $25,000.
63        The defendants pointed out that the 60th plaintiff had admitted, under cross-examination, that his intention was to get the authorities involved in mediating the privatisation process, by getting as much support as possible for himself and his fellow dissidents. The 60th plaintiff had then admitted that the plaintiffs were forced to sue when the authorities did not intervene as he had hoped. Questioned on his e-mail dated 3 April 2003 where he indicated he would bankrupt those concerned, the 60th plaintiff agreed the threat was directed against the defendants. However, he disagreed he intended to bring the defendants to ruin by suing them, claiming he only wanted to seek justice. He denied Teo was the plaintiffs’ ringleader. Although he opposes the privatisation process, the 60th plaintiff has paid the conversion fee, but he no longer resides in the Estate.
64        The defendants also singled out Francis Tan Seow Che, the 11th plaintiff (PW10), as another person with a hidden agenda. Notwithstanding that he had been a pro-tem committee member, he joined the action because he saw the court as an avenue to ventilate his unhappiness over the privatisation process.
65        Another observation made by the defendants was the lack of explanation (apart from that given by the 57th plaintiff) on why some co-lessees and spouses of plaintiffs (including Teo) did not join in the action. In their submissions, the plaintiffs did not attempt to give any explanation for the discrepancy but merely dismissed it as irrelevant to the claim and the defence, pointing out it would make no difference to the remedies sought by the plaintiffs, if co-lessees were omitted as parties to the action.
The plaintiffs’ submissions
66        The plaintiffs started their submissions with complaints on the defendants’ conduct, alleging the latter bombarded the plaintiffs will numerous interlocutory applications (including applications for further and better particulars of the statement of claim, interrogatories and holding Teo in contempt of court) in an attempt to stop the case from coming to trial.
67        On the defendants’ contention that they were used as scapegoats, the plaintiffs explained that they chose to sue the defendants and not the other members of the pro-tem committee because the defendants were the only ones who obtained statutory declarations from the plaintiffs, in breach of s 57 of the Act. In addition, the defendants were responsible for the material misrepresentations made to the plaintiffs.
68        Although the plaintiffs acknowledged that the defendants were gratuitous agents, they argued that such a fact did not exonerate the defendants from liability or responsibility. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendants still owed a duty of care to the flat owners to act in an honest and transparent manner; they cannot portray themselves as victims.
69        The plaintiffs argued that the words used in the updates were intended to create legal relations. They made much of the fact that the first defendant had used the words “voting” and “vote” in the updates and rejected his explanation that he had used the words out of convenience. The plaintiffs also criticised Ms Gan’s testimony that the words “voting” and “polling” were used for lack of better words. In their opening statement, the plaintiffs urged the court to take into account that the HDB has a vested interest in the outcome of this suit and would naturally align itself with the defendants’ position.
70        The plaintiffs contended the words “voting” or “vote” could only have meant that 22 February 1998 would be the polling day and no other. Consequently, the plaintiffs were led to believe it was a one-day exercise with a clear cut-off period. They disputed the defendants’ submission that nowhere in the updates was it stated that only the consents received on 22 February 1998 counted and that no further consents were to be obtained or received after that date. They relied on the evidence of Teo that the voting update merely advised the flat owners that they could, on 22 February 1998, have the alternative of going to the office of TAA to vote, if they were unable to do so at the Estate itself. The plaintiffs submitted that although a sample voting form was circulated with the voting update, there was no proper or adequate explanation on how the form was to be utilised.
71        The plaintiffs accused the defendants of creating a wrong impression by the untruths contained in the unofficial announcement of 16 April 1998, that the 75% mandate had been obtained on the Voting day. The defendants were also accused of acting in a dishonest and improper manner in tricking the 25th, 49th, 51st, 52nd and 54th plaintiffs to give consent forms. They alleged that the defendants had a vested interest in witnessing the consent forms as they wanted the Estate to be privatised. The plaintiffs pounced on an attendance note of TAA of 26 February 1998 which stated that the second defendant (with the knowledge of the first defendant) instructed TAA 
not
 to inform the HDB until the 75% mandate for privatisation was secured. They alleged it showed the surreptitious manner in which defendants concealed the outcome of the Voting day. It is only fair to point out that when he was cross-examined on the attendance note, the second defendant (DW3) explained that he was acting in accordance with the Guidelines as they stated that the HDB only wanted to be informed when the 75% vote was attained. In any case, Ms Gan testified that the HDB was informed by TAA of the outcome of the Voting day.
72        Although they admitted they were unhappy with the physical defects in the Estate, the plaintiffs denied that their instituting this suit was an indirect method to coerce the HDB into rectifying the defects. They denied they had a hidden agenda, claiming they were genuinely concerned about justice and wanted a proper legal recourse concerning the conduct of the defendants. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendants produced no evidence that Dr Tan instigated this suit or that he had influenced the decisions of the plaintiffs. They dismissed the allegations in this regard against Teo and the 60th plaintiff as baseless. The plaintiffs argued Teo was a concerned resident who gave his all to see that justice was done. Yet, the defendants attacked him to the extent that they served a statutory demand on Teo for failing to pay costs awarded to them for amendments to the statement of claim. The plaintiffs dismissed as irrelevant the Guidelines and the defendants’ conduct in relation thereto. I note that this submission runs counter to Teo’s evidence under cross-examination, that the Guidelines formed part of the terms of the agreement 
inter se
.
73        In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs did not address the other claims they had made based on breach of fiduciary duties and agency, negligence and negligent misstatement, nor reply to the lengthy submissions made by the defendants on those claims. They relied, instead, on their opening statement for their arguments on those heads of claim.
The findings
74        Before I make my findings, there are certain preliminary observations which I wish to make at this juncture. One, it was apparent from the evidence adduced in court that not all the plaintiffs are/were conversant with the procedures and implications involved in the privatisation of HUDC estates. Indeed, some of them appeared to be misinformed. One of them, Lai Chang Kuan (77th plaintiff/PW39), even denied he had instructed the plaintiffs’ solicitors that he was one of the persons (see para 42(f) of the statement of claim) to whom the defendants represented that 75% mandate had been obtained and that flat owners were legally obliged to sign the consent forms for purposes of obtaining their SSCT. His denial prompted counsel for the plaintiffs to make the unusual application (which I rejected) of wanting to treat the 77th plaintiff as a hostile witness. My surmise from such incidents is that some of the plaintiffs may have failed to read and/or understand the 16 updates distributed by the pro-tem committee. Even pro-tem committee members such as the tenth, 11th, 20th, 29th, 31st, 40th plaintiffs and the 69th plaintiff (as a member of the MCST), seemed not to have appreciated the meaning and consequences of privatisation. For this reason, I took pains to set out in the earlier part of this judgment, all the relevant facts pertaining to the Estate’s change of status from a HUDC to a private estate.
75        Secondly, I would like to return to the subject of the unsuccessful privatisation of the Shunfu estate. The plaintiffs had produced a letter dated 5 October 2001 addressed to residents by the estate’s MP, stating that the mandate exercise for privatisation carried out on 18 and 19 August 2001 failed to secure the requisite 75% vote. The plaintiffs argued that was how the mandate exercise should have been carried out. They should have been informed of the outcome on the Voting day. If they had known the real result of the votes collected that day, they would have had a choice to either opt out of privatisation altogether or continue to garner votes if they still wanted privatisation. Ms Gan, however, had explained that Shunfu was a different case. There, the pro-tem committee stopped the mandate exercise 
after
 19 August 2001, preferring instead to carry out repair and redecorating works, which were already due. According to her, Shunfu and Eunosville were the only HUDC estates which stopped garnering votes, after carrying out mandate exercises which rejected privatisation.
76        In the light of Ms Gan’s explanation, the Shunfu experience cannot be said to support the plaintiffs’ case that voting for privatisation could only be done once and once only and that residents of HUDC estates must abide by the outcome of one voting exercise.
Breach of agreement inter se
77        I now turn my attention to the first of the many claims put forward by the plaintiffs. It is trite law that to found an enforceable agreement at law, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
(a)        an intention to create legal relations,
(b)        consensus 
ad idem
, and
(c)        certainty of terms.
78        Apart from a bald assertion (para 16 of the plaintiffs’ submissions) that the manner in which the updates were phrased indicated an intention to create legal relations, no credible evidence was produced by the plaintiffs to prove that the above requirements were indeed fulfilled. The plaintiffs had relied on Teo’s evidence. Unfortunately, I found him to be an unreliable witness whose inconsistent and contradictory answers did nothing to advance the plaintiffs’ case at all ([39] 
supra
). Teo’s testimony came in for harsh criticism in the defendants’ closing submissions. I myself found it difficult to follow his convoluted and illogical reasoning – that the agreement 
inter se
 was reached between flat owners on the Voting day, whether they turned up to vote or not. Even more illogical was his contention that flat owners who purchased their units 
after
 the Voting day were bound by their vendors’ previous consents given on that day. His interpretation cannot be right. It runs counter to the HDB’s policy that such consents are no longer valid, once the parties that gave those consents relinquished their ownership of units in the Estate.  Even more absurd was Teo’s interpretation of the voting update to mean that those who did not vote at the Estate on the Voting day were supposed to visit the offices of TAA that Sunday to sign the consent forms. If flat owners are unable or unwilling to cast their votes on their own doorstep (in the presence of lawyers from TAA), why would they want to suffer the inconvenience of visiting the law firm’s office on the very same day to cast their votes?
79        I would highlight other aspects where Teo’s credibility as a witness was seriously undermined. At the meetings on 18 and 19 April 1998, his solicitor had informed attendees that the conversion fee contravened s 45(1) of the HUDC Housing Estates Act, which states that transfer of the common property should be effected for a $1.00 nominal consideration. Teo admitted in cross-examination that he knew (from information contained in the second update) that his solicitor’s view was incorrect; the Estate did not come under that Act as it is a phase Ш HUDC estate. Yet, he made no attempts to correct his solicitor’s interpretation, which he repeated in his own e-mail dated 22 April 1998 to the first defendant ([61] 
supra
).
80        I find it difficult to accept the plaintiffs’ argument that by merely issuing 16 (plus one voting) updates to flat owners, some (not all) pro-tem committee members intended objectively to enter into a legal relationship with their fellow flat owners. The updates (as the defendants contended) were only informal documents meant to disseminate information, nothing more.
81        Even if I am wrong and the 16 updates were indeed sufficient to create a legal relationship between the defendants and the plaintiffs, what were the terms of that agreement? What was the consideration provided for the agreement? It bears remembering that some, if not many, of the updates contained a hotchpotch of topics (see [84] to [87] 
infra
) other than privatisation. The essentials of an enforceable agreement, missing in our case, were not addressed by the plaintiffs.
82        In the case of the 57th plaintiff, she had withdrawn the following para 4 in her affidavit, in the course of her cross-examination:
I crave leave to refer to the affidavit of Teo Boon Huat Patrick (the 7
th
 plaintiff in the suit) and I concur with the contents therein.
with the result that she had no evidence to substantiate her various claims, other than her own statements that (a) she moved into the Estate on 10 March 1990; (b) she signed the dissent form on the Voting day; (c) she did not pay the conversion costs and (d) she was appalled by the disparity in treatment meted out by the pro-tem committee, in deciding who should or should not be given dissent forms to sign and in approaching those who did not consent to win over their votes.
Misrepresentations and negligent misstatements
83        It would be straining the legal definition to hold that the updates amounted to representations by the pro-tem committee, including the defendants, to all flat owners. At this juncture it may be appropriate to look at what constitutes effective misrepresentation at law. In this regard, I refer to the following relevant extract from 
Chitty on Contracts
 vol 1 (28th Ed, 1999) at para 6-004:
The traditional rule is that a representation must be a statement of fact, past or present, as distinct from a statement of opinion, or of intention, or of law.
Further, the following requirements are needed for a representation to be actionable:
(a)        the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted on by the plaintiffs or a class of persons which includes the plaintiffs;
(b)        the plaintiffs had acted on the false statement;
(c)        the plaintiffs suffered damage as a result; and
(d)        the representation was made to the plaintiffs knowing it was false.
In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs had relied on the representations allegedly contained in the first, fourth, fifth and sixth updates and the voting update. I shall now expand on my earlier brief references ([10] to [12] 
supra
) to these updates as it would be relevant to my findings.
84        The pro-tem committee had informed flat owners in the first update that:
There will be a mandate exercise carried out. The registered lessees of at least 75% of all the units in the estate must each sign a legal document signifying their approval.
The voting is scheduled for the first quarter of 1997. Every registered lessee of units in favour of privatisation must sign a consent register which will form part of the formal application (a legal document). If there are two registered lessees (eg husband and wife) both of them must sign. A lawyer will be present at our estate to witness the signing. A nominal legal fee will be charged. 
85        In addition to informing flat owners of forthcoming door-to-door visits, the fourth update announced the holding of two block parties, explained the benefits and opportunities of privatisation, as well as the roles of the HDB and the Town Council on defects. Item 13 of the update stated:
HDB and Town Council have clarified that defects/problems that require attention within the household are the responsibility of the lessees as the warranty period has long since expired. Their responsibilities to us are limited to attending to defects/problems of the common areas and facilities. Since it is a major effort for us to collate and redirect, we provide you instead with following contacts, whom you may contact directly …
and furnished the particulars of the Aljunied Town Council and the HDB (Bedok Branch office) for contact purposes, depending on the nature of the defects involved.
86        In the fifth update, the pro-tem committee announced that one block party instead of two would be held, advised flat owners not to feed birds, informed flat owners there had been a tree planting day by their MP on 2 November 1997, as well as set out in item 3 the following “Progress Towards Privatisation”:
We are pleased to inform you that we have successfully negotiated with HDB to re-surface all our car parks, re-mark the park lots (with enhancements), build hard-standing areas and fire-engine bays, replace fire-rated doors along emergency access routes, and renovate one office unit for future use as management committee’s office. All this will be based on the goodwill from HDB. These works, however will only commence upon successful voting on privatisation.
Meanwhile, the Aljunied Town Council which runs our estate, has been advised to hold back further landscaping works in our estate, in view of the construction work that will occur after successful privatisation. This is to minimise or avoid unnecessary expenses which may occur if landscaping is done now.
87        The sixth update, 
inter alia
, talked about the successful block party held on 14 January 1998, detailed rectification works of minor defects carried out by the Aljunied Town Council, exhorted flat owners not to throw bulky rubbish into bins at bin centres or feed pigeons, gave a breakdown of the estimated conversion cost of $25,000 payable in about one and a half years’ time, set out the mandate for privatisation and the contact particulars of the first, second and fifth defendants as well as those of other pro-tem committee members for flat owners who were still unsure about how to vote and needed clarification.
88        I am mystified why the plaintiffs view the five updates in question as actionable representation. Further, where have the defendants made negligent misstatements? The information given was factually correct, so too was the procedure required for a successful mandate for privatisation. No false statements were contained in those updates, let alone that the defendants made the statements knowing they were false. Accordingly, no question of reliance on the false statements can arise. Section 2 of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed) relied on by the plaintiffs therefore has no application, as it provides for the award of damages for contracts affected by negligent misrepresentation. I have already held that there was no agreement 
inter se
 between the parties. The issue of fraudulent misrepresentation also becomes academic, in the light of my earlier findings. If negligent misrepresentation is not made out, fraudulent misrepresentation cannot arise as it requires a higher standard of proof than the former.
Breach of fiduciary duties as agent
89        It was the plaintiffs’ case that the defendants were gratuitous agents. As such agents, the defendants owed fiduciary duties (in equity) to their principals who were/are the flat owners. The plaintiffs asserted that as pro-tem members, the defendants’ duties were akin to those of promoters of companies. The plaintiffs’ statement of claim pleaded that the defendants were entrusted with the tasks and responsibilities set out in the Guidelines. The defendants were allegedly in a position to unilaterally exercise their power or discretion so as to affect the legal or practical interests of the flat owners, rendering them vulnerable to or at the mercy of the defendants. It was pleaded that the flat owners relied on and acted on the information provided by the pro-tem committee members (which included the defendants) because there were no independent means of verifying such information.
90        Both sides were on common ground that the duties of gratuitous agents are as set out in 
Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency
 (17th Ed, 2001) at Art 44 (para 6-025) and followed in the case of 
Chaudhry v Prabhakar
 
[1989] 1 WLR 29
:
A gratuitous agent will be liable to his principal if in carrying out the work he fails to exercise the degree of care which may reasonably be expected of him in all the circumstances.
Bowstead
 
added (at para 6-026):
Where there is no contract between principal and agent, it would seem that the alleged agent cannot be liable for pure failure to do what he undertook to do without consideration. However, he can certainly be liable in tort for negligently failing to complete, or to complete with due care, work he has undertaken and upon which he has embarked. Thus a person who gratuitously agrees to procure insurance for another may owe a duty of care in respect of the manner in which he does so.
91        The duties imposed on gratuitous agents, however, are a far cry from those imposed on the defendants in 
Winnifred Wai Yue Yu v Allan Ni Kwan Kwok
 
[1999] NSWSC 992
. In that case, the plaintiff had sued the partners of an accounting firm into whose trust account the plaintiff’s moneys had (according to her) been wrongly credited. The plaintiff claimed her solicitor had instructed the defendants to deposit her moneys into the plaintiff’s cheque account. Instead, the moneys were credited to the firm’s trust account after which the defendants placed them on fixed deposits with BCC. Subsequently, a provisional liquidator was appointed to BCC, as a result of which the plaintiff, after receiving certain dividends from the provisional liquidator, lost $300,929.21. The plaintiffs’ reference in their opening statement to an extract (para 118) from Simos J’s judgment, on the non-fiduciary equitable duty arising from the parties’ fiduciary relationship, is therefore out of context.
92        Applying the facts in relation to the principles enunciated in 
Bowstead
 as well as in 
Chaudhry v Prabhakar
 and 
Winnifred Wai Yue Yu v Allan Ni Kwan
 
Kwok
, it is my view that the duties of the defendants as gratuitous agents were to select competent lawyers to act for the Estate in the privatisation exercise. They discharged this duty by their appointment of TAA. There can be no criticism of their choice as TAA had a track record and offered a competitive rate for their services. Since the plaintiffs have withdrawn their claims against the sixth to tenth defendants, complaints about TAA’s performance, conduct and all other allegations levelled against the latter are no longer in issue. It follows therefore that the defendants’ appointment of TAA is not open to question anymore.
93        Were there other duties which the defendants owed to the plaintiffs as gratuitous agents? It bears remembering at this juncture that the defendants are all laymen. In volunteering their services for the common good, on their own time and without payment, in what has turned out to be a thankless task, I believe it would be unduly onerous and unfair to saddle them with fiduciary duties of the standard imposed on the accountants in 
Winnifred Wai Yue Yu
 by the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The facts there showed the parties had a past relationship of accountant and client, since 1978. In our case, the privatisation exercise was the only occasion that the five defendants (and other pro-tem committee members) got together to represent their fellow flat owners. The principles in 
Hedley Bryne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd
 
[1964] AC 465
 relied on by the plaintiffs clearly cannot apply. I also disagree that the defendants have duties akin to those of promoters of companies. No authorities were cited by the plaintiffs to support this proposition.
94        Apart from choosing TAA as the law firm for the Estate, I find on the evidence, contrary to the plaintiffs’ many allegations and submissions, that the defendants did not exercise their own discretion on other matters relating to the privatisation or the maintenance of the Estate. I cite two examples. The first was the second defendant’s assiduous copying, chapter and verse, of the wording in the notices for the Voting day, from that used by the Jurong HUDC privatisation committee. Another example was the new name of the Estate. Waterfront View Condominium was chosen only after flat owners were consulted, by a voting slip attached to the 13th update. The new name was a compromise on the first choice of “Waterfront” by flat owners, after application to the Street Names Committee, which rejected “Waterfront” as inappropriate and counter-proposed Waterfront View, which was accepted by the pro-tem committee.
95        It was therefore mischievous of the plaintiffs (in particular the trio referred to by the defendants) to contend that the defendants acted on their own accord, without consulting the other flat owners. Nothing could be further from the truth. I cite as a third example Yu’s allegation that the boundary wall was erected without due consultation of the flat owners. He did not know or had forgotten (until it was drawn to his attention during cross-examination) that construction of the boundary wall was not the doing of the pro-tem committee or the defendants but that of the Aljunied Town Council who conducted a tender exercise. Like many of the other plaintiffs, the 69th plaintiff did not know the full facts nor did he take the trouble to find out. Yet, he opined in court that there had been a fair bit of non-transparency. It is very easy to criticise as Yu did, after the event, that the wall was too expensive and lights on the boundary wall were unnecessary. Why did he and the other plaintiffs not make their views known to the Aljunied Town Council 
before
 the wall was constructed? The flat owners were given every opportunity to contact either the HDB or the Aljunied Town Council or give their feedback on the Estate’s improvement before (in the fourth update), during (in the seventh update), and after (in the 14th update), the privatisation exercise.
96        In relation to the privatisation process itself, it cannot be denied by the plaintiffs that the defendants followed the Guidelines and/or the steps taken by other HUDC estates (Gillman Heights, Jurong East). They consulted the HDB often, according to Ms Gan’s testimony. I find that the plaintiffs have failed to discharge their burden to prove that the defendants did not carry out their duties properly as gratuitous agents of the plaintiffs and other flat owners in this regard.
Breach of duty of care
97        In order to succeed on this head of claim, the plaintiffs must prove there was sufficient proximity between themselves and the defendants for such a duty to arise, based on the “neighbour test” propounded by Lord Atkin in 
Donoghue v Stevenson
 
[1932] AC 562
. If such a duty did exist, the plaintiffs must further prove that they suffered loss and damage consequent on the defendants’ breach of this duty, which was foreseeable by the defendants. The defendants, I repeat, were volunteers who received no payment for their services. I have held that their duty as gratuitous agents of the plaintiffs and other flat owners was to appoint suitable lawyers and to follow the Guidelines and precedents set by other HUDC estates in privatisation. The defendants discharged all those duties; I cannot see what other duty of care they owed to the plaintiffs which they have breached.
98        Even if I am wrong in my findings and the defendants did owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs over and above what I have determined, what loss or damage have the plaintiffs suffered? No damage in negligence has been proved apart from the allegation that the plaintiffs “suffered harm” (in para 55(b)(i) of the statement of claim).
99        In para 104 of the statement of claim, the plaintiffs pleaded that their claims based on breaches of the agreement 
inter se
, negligent misstatement and misrepresentations were the following:
(a)        The difference between the amount paid or payable for the common property and the true and proper value of the common property.
(b)        The difference between maintenance fees payable by the plaintiffs for a privatised estate and maintenance fees payable if the Estate had remained a HDB property.
(c)        Costs and expenses which the plaintiffs as flat owners will have to bear in consequence of privatisation which they would not have had to bear otherwise, for which the plaintiffs sought an indemnity against the defendants. These included costs and expenses for construction works to be carried out, costs of rectification of structural and other defects and, costs for maintenance of the Estate undertaken by the HDB before privatisation.
100      In relation to item (a), the claim is misconceived. It is clear from the evidence that, the Estate being a phase Ш HUDC estate, the HUDC Housing Estates Act is not applicable. The HDB did not sell the common property to flat owners in the Estate initially. Consequently, flat owners must pay to the HDB a market price for the common property, which has since been transferred to them together with issuance of the SSCT. Item (b) is equally unfounded. The first defendant had testified that maintenance fees have not increased after privatisation. Indeed, an immediate benefit from privatisation is, flat owners who owned motor vehicles no longer had to pay monthly car parking charges of $65 to the HDB, on top of monthly maintenance fees of $104. It is no longer open to the plaintiffs to claim item (c). Construction works and rectification of defects were carried out and completed well before the application under s 126A of the Act was lodged, with the full knowledge of the plaintiffs, from information provided in the updates. The works were 
not
 undertaken by the defendants but by the HDB and/or Aljunied Town Council. As the plaintiffs had not objected at the material time to the works, it is too late for them to do so now, let alone to object to paying for the same.
The validity of the application under s 126A of the Act
101      The only person whom I would consider to be authoritative or familiar with the privatisation process would be Ms Gan, by virtue of her position and experience with the HDB. It is not for the plaintiffs to come to court and give their own interpretation of how the privatisation process should have been carried out. It is completely out of turn, therefore, for the plaintiffs to attempt to usurp the roles of the HDB and/or the SLA in this regard. It is a matter for the SLA, not the plaintiffs, to decide whether the consent forms witnessed by the defendants were valid. In any case, Teo withdrew his allegation that the consent forms could only be witnessed by solicitors. Similarly, it is for the SLA, not the plaintiffs, to determine whether the application lodged on 3 December 2001 by TAA was valid or otherwise. The SLA had obviously decided that the application was valid by proceeding to issue SSCT to flat owners. Their decision is not open to question by the plaintiffs nor can the plaintiffs rescind the same.
102      In their submissions, the defendants had highlighted the shift in position by the plaintiffs, even before the commencement of these proceedings. In the letter of demand to the first defendant from the plaintiffs’ solicitors dated 13 May 2002, it was alleged that the former had represented to flat owners that 75% votes were obtained by May 1998. This was to be contrasted with the plaintiffs’ previous stand, that the mandate had not been obtained on the Voting day itself. The defendants submitted that the change in position was due to Teo’s realisation that the 75% mandate was indeed obtained by May 1998, giving rise to suspicions, not unfounded, as to whether the plaintiffs’ action is 
bona fide
.
103      It is my view from the evidence adduced in court that the defendants:
(a)        did not deliberately conceal from flat owners that no mandate of 75% had been achieved on the Voting day;
(b)        did not state in the updates that the mandate exercise on the Voting day would be a one-day exercise;
(c)        did not surreptitiously garner more votes in support of privatisation after 22 February 1998, without disclosing the outcome of the vote on Voting day;
(d)        did not mislead flat owners by the unofficial announcement of 16 April 1998 and the seventh update into believing that 75% mandate had been obtained on the Voting day. Vote counting was the task of TAA on whom the defendants could, and did, rely.
The plaintiffs’ allegations are contrary to all the pre-privatisation updates, which documents made it clear that the pro-tem committee would continue in their efforts to garner more consents from flat owners. The defendants made no secret of their intention, nor concealed their door-to-door visits, in that regard.
104      I would add that the only fault if it can be called a fault, on the part of the defendants, was their enthusiasm for privatisation. Their indefatigable energy and commitment in that regard was commendable, especially on the part of the first defendant, who obviously devoted a great deal of his time to the cause.
105      I am puzzled as to what prompted the plaintiffs to commence these proceedings, particularly when some (like the 51st plaintiff) did not want the Estate to be de-privatised (if turning back the clock is possible). What have the plaintiffs lost, even if they were misled by the defendants’ actions into believing the mandate exercise was on 22 February 1998 and no other days? The usual benefit of privatisation of a HUDC estate is an increase in value of such flats. The immediate benefits the plaintiffs obtained, after the HDB was satisfied there was a 75% mandate, were the removal of restrictions imposed by the HDB on HUDC flat owners. Teo was one of those who benefited in this regard, as his wife purchased a resale HDB flat in 2002 whilst being a co-lessee with him of Block 727 #04-5034 in the Estate, which would otherwise not have been allowed under s 47 of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 1997 Rev Ed).
106      By instituting these proceedings, the majority of the plaintiffs were swayed by the wishes of a few who, for reasons best known to themselves, chose to take the defendants to court, when the defendants were obviously not the target of the plaintiffs’ discontent. In so doing, the plaintiffs were foolhardy and have done themselves, the defendants and other flat owners of the Estate a great disservice. There should have been a windfall for flat owners in the way of capital gains by the enhanced value of their flats after privatisation. Instead, by their actions, the plaintiffs have created adverse publicity for the Estate and prejudiced their own interests in the process. If the plaintiffs were genuinely against privatisation, the proper recourse would have been to move out of the Estate, lease out or sell their flats and use the sale proceeds therefrom to purchase alternative homes.
107      Apart from the defendants, another party, who seems to be hard done by as a result of the plaintiffs’ action, is the HDB. Indeed, the HDB is the only party that appears to have a legitimate claim based on misrepresentation. Acting in good faith and in the belief that flat owners of the Estate had voted for privatisation, the HDB expended time and money on construction and upgrading works (together with the Aljunied Town Council) necessary to bring the privatisation process to fruition, only to find, to its detriment, that those plaintiffs who voted for privatisation appeared to have changed their minds.
Conclusion
108      It follows from my findings above that the plaintiffs’ allegations against the defendants are unfounded and their claims, wholly unmeritorious. Accordingly, the plaintiffs’ action is dismissed with costs to the defendants.

Conversion

Whether the PARF certificate constitute a chattel.
 
 
 
 
 
3 May 2004
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
District Judge Valerie Thean:
1          The plaintiffs are a hire purchase company, the defendants a dealer in motor cars.  In this action, the plaintiffs claim damages from the defendants for the conversion of a Preferential Additional Registration Fee ('PARF') certificate.
Facts
2          The facts giving rise to the claim were these.  On 15 September 2000, the plaintiffs purchased a vehicle, SCK 8028 A, and entered into a hire purchase agreement with one Ang Eng Hian ('Ang') in the amount of $110,000.  The plaintiffs retained the motor vehicle log card and Certificate of Entitlement ('COE').  Through intervening fraud, the vehicle was deregistered on 18 October 2000 and shipped to East Timor thereafter.  The Land Transport Authority ('LTA') duly issued the PARF certificate for the de-registration of the vehicle, having a rebate value of $92,710, on 18 October 2000.  On the same date, one Huang Wei Duan trading as E-Type Motoring sold the PARF certificate to the defendants for the sum of $92,710.  The defendants thereafter used the PARF certificate for the registration of a vehicle purchased by Starwood Asia Pacific Management Pte Ltd, to offset the Additional Registration Fee, Quota Premium and Registration fee for the second vehicle.  The defendants were unaware of the existence of the hire purchase agreement or any of the circumstances leading to the de-registration of the vehicle or that the vehicle was de-registered without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiffs.
Action for money had and received
3          The plaintiffs advanced an alternate claim for money had and received, as they were the beneficial owners of the PARF certificate.  As it was conceded that the defendants were bona fide purchasers of the PARF certificate for good consideration, this claim in equity would have been overreached.  A common law proprietary claim to the certificate would be necessary if the plaintiffs wished to claim redress from the defendants.  This cause of action was not seriously pursued by Mr Phua.
Action in conversion
4          The plaintiffs rely on the form of conversion summarised in 
45 Halsbury's Laws of England (4
th
 Ed)
 para 1422 (and referred to in 
UCO Bank (formerly known as United Commercial Bank) v Ringler Pte Ltd
 
[1995] 1 SLR 713
) as follows:
To constitute the first form (of conversion) there must be a positive wrongful act of dealing with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner's rights, and an intention in so doing to deny the owner's rights or to assert a right inconsistent with them.  This inconsistency is the gist of the action.  There need not be any knowledge on the part of the person sued that the goods belong to someone else; nor need there by any positive intention to challenge the true owner's rights.  The action is not one in which fraud is a necessary ingredient.  Goods may be the subject of successive and independent conversions by persons dealing with them in such a manner and with such an intention.
5          The defendants advanced three arguments: that the PARF certificate was not a chattel capable of conversion; there was no wrongful appropriation; and that the plaintiffs had no immediate right to possession.
Is a PARF certificate capable of conversion?
6          Some arguments were made by counsel as to whether a PARF certificate was a chattel, on the basis that choses in action could not be converted.  It is settled law however, that physical documents evidencing choses in action may be converted, and where converted the person entitled would recover damages based on their value as choses in action.  Cheques, for example, have been held to be capable of conversion: see 
Kleinwort, Sons & Co v Comptoir National D'escompte de Paris
 (1894) 2 QB 157, 
Lloyds Bank, Ltd v Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China
 (1929) 1 KB 40.  On the same premise, a PARF certificate would be a chattel capable of conversion, and the value of it would be the face value of the certificate.
Whether there was wrongful appropriation
7          There was also some argument that the defendants had no knowledge of the intervening fraud, and were bona fide purchasers for value.  As made clear in the extract from 
Halsbury's
, for the tort of conversion, knowledge on the part of the defendants is immaterial.  Dealing with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner's rights, and an intention in so doing to assert rights inconsistent with the owner's, is sufficient.
Whether the plaintiffs had an immediate right to possession
8          The defendants contended that the plaintiffs had no immediate right to possession at the time that the PARF certificate was transferred to them.  Their argument was premised on the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Registration and Licensing) Rules ('the Rules').  Pursuant to the Rules, the hire purchase company is not registered as the owner of the car, but the hirer.  A PARF certificate is granted by the Registrar under s 7(2)(a) of the Rules, to the applicant if he ""is or has been the registered owner of a private motor car"".  A ""registered owner"" is defined in s 2(1) as ""a person registered under the Act as owner of a motor vehicle"".  In the present case, the registered owner was Ang.  The certificate was duly issued to Ang under s 7(2)(a).  Once issued, Ang, not the plaintiffs, had the right to possession of it.  Ang transferred the certificate to E-Type Motoring, and E-Type Motoring transferred it to the defendants.
9          In order to put the defendants' argument in perspective, an understanding of the common law position on the hire purchase of cars is first necessary.  At common law, where goods have been let on hire purchase terms, no proprietary interest in the goods hired vests in the hirer until he has exercised his option to purchase.  Until the last payment is made, the hirer obtains no proprietary right beyond the right to keep the chattel and use it for the month to come: see 
Helby v Mathews
 
[1895] AC 471
.
10        In Singapore, the monies disbursed under hire purchase agreements for cars cover various distinct property interests: the value of the physical chattel, expressed as Open Market Value ('OMV'), a ten year licence to own the car, being the Certificate of Entitlement ('COE'), and a Special Registration Fee ('ARF').  These properties also have distinct transactional values.  The car could be sold for parts or exported in whole.  COE and ARF have a surrender value calculated upon their unexpired remainder tenure.  For cars with COEs registered before May 2002, the PARF rebate is a percentage of the OMV, with the percentage varying with the age of the car.  For cars registered with COEs obtained after May 2002, the PARF rebate is a percentage of the ARF, with the percentage varying with the age of the car.  This rebate may be used to offset the taxes and fees of a new car, in particular, the ARF, the COE Quota Premium and the Registration Fee.  The value of the rebate is evidenced by the PARF certificate issued at time of deregistration.  The PARF certificate may be transferred and is widely traded.
11        If a hirer should purport to sell the car, he would not be able to transfer title to the purchaser.  The principle of 
nemo dat quod non habet
 would apply, and he would be unable to transfer a better title than what he himself possessed.  At the same time, his breach of the hire purchase agreement would give the hire purchase company the right to immediate possession of the car, and to maintain an action for conversion: see 
North General Wagon & Finance Co Ltd v Graham
 
[1950] 2 KB 7
.
12        Going a step further, it has also been held that, if the vehicle is sold with a licence that substantially affected its value, that licence was as much a part of the subject matter of the hire purchase agreement.  In 
Douglas Valley Finance Co Ltd v S Hughes (Hirers) Ltd
 
[1969] 1 QB 738
, for example, it was held that special ""A"" licences sold together with two lorries were capable of conversion.  McNair J held that they were so much appurtenant to the vehicles that without them the vehicles could not be used for their designated purpose and the licences substantially affected their value.  Thus, if it had been the COE which had been transferred to the defendants, this, too, would have been considered conversion, and the plaintiffs would be entitled to bring an action in conversion.
13        Viewed from this perspective, the defendants' argument that the plaintiffs have no right to immediate possession because the PARF certificate was issued in Ang's name is amiss.  The car itself was registered in Ang's name, as was the COE.  Yet the common law would have given the plaintiffs the immediate right to possession for both of these.
14        The novel point about the PARF certificate is that it goes one step further than the two scenarios where the protection of the common law action in conversion has been clearly established.  Unlike the car or the COE, the PARF certificate is not obtained at the outset when the hire purchase agreement is signed, but at the point where a car is de-registered.  The salient question, then, is whether the PARF certificate, obtained upon de-registration of the car, could be considered as part and parcel of the subject matter of the hire purchase agreement.  Was the PARF certificate a ""new chattel"" obtained after de-registration - which would be characterised, then, in a sense, as ""destruction"" - of the ""original chattel"", or did it form a part - as would the engine, or wheels - of the ""original chattel""?  If it was part of the subject matter of the hire purchase agreement, the plaintiffs had an immediate right to possession of it upon breach of their agreement. If not, Ang merely held the certificate on resulting trust for the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs have no claim in conversion for their equitable interest: see, for example, 
MCC Proceeds Inc v Lehman Bros International
 [1998] 4 All ER 675, where Mummery LJ explained that conversion is a common law action and the common law does not recognise equitable interests.
15        The plaintiffs contended that the PARF certificate formed an integral part of the motor car, and, upon consideration, that must be correct.  When a purchaser purchases a car, that chattel does not comprise merely its carcass, as when one buys a shirt, but a bundle of rights as explained at ¶10.  From the outset, the hire purchase company owns the surrender value, and the PARF certificate evidences this surrender value.  In this particular case, the right to the PARF rebate was in existence from inception: its price at any time during the hire purchase was dependent upon the age of the car and the car's OMV. Once the physical document, the PARF certificate, evidencing its value came into existence in the course of Ang's breach of his hire purchase agreement, the plaintiffs had an immediate right to possession of it.
Judgment
16        Judgment is therefore entered in the plaintiffs' favour for $92,710, the value of the PARF certificate at the time of conversion.  Interest is ordered at 6% from the date of the writ until today.  I shall hear solicitors on costs.",2004-05-03 00:00:00,SG District Court

GROUNDS OF DECISION
1        The accused pleaded guilty to the following charge :
 
 
""That you, Aw Teck Hock, on the 15
th
 day of May 2002, between 1.00 am and 5.00 am, at Blk 31 Taman Ho Swee #01-161 Singapore, did commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of one Aw Swee Seng, male/73 years, to wit, by kicking his body and head and throwing a plastic chair at him, which act was done with the knowledge of causing such bodily injury as was likely to cause death to the said Aw Swee Seng, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 304 (b) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.""
 
 
 
The Facts
2        The accused, then 37 years old, is the youngest son of the deceased. They lived together in a ground floor flat at Taman Ho Swee. On 15 May 2002, at 12.49 pm, the accused telephoned the police to report that he had a fight with his father the previous night and that when he woke up, he found his father had stopped breathing.
3        In response, two police officers went to the said flat. The accused led them to the living room where his father was lying motionless in a supine position on a mattress. Various injuries could be seen on the father’s body. The accused informed the police officers that he used a white plastic chair to hit his father in a fight the previous night. He was then arrested.
4        At about 1.40 pm, medical assistance arrived but the father was pronounced dead.
5        Subsequent investigations revealed that the accused returned home sometime between 1 am and 5 am on 15 May 2002 after an alcohol-drinking session. His father, who was still awake then, nagged him for returning home so late and began to scold him using Hokkien vulgarities. A quarrel ensued and that escalated into a fight. The accused pushed his father who fell backwards. He then went forward to kick his father’s body and head. He also picked up a plastic chair and threw it at his father. He then carried his father to the mattress in the living room before he went into his bedroom to sleep.
6        The accused’s neighbour informed the police that he was awakened by a commotion in the accused’s flat at around 3 am that day. He also heard arguments and what appeared to be the sound of something hitting the wall.
7        When the accused woke up past noon that day, he found that his father had stopped breathing and was not responding to his calls. He then called the police. Before the police arrived, he put right a sofa in the living room which had toppled over during the fight earlier. He also used a towel to wipe away some blood stains on the floor.
8        The police found a broken white plastic chair with bloodstains outside the rear door of the flat. Bloodstains were also found on the mattress cover, a towel, a cushion cover, the television set and the floor. Subsequent analysis showed that the blood came from the father.
9        The accused underwent a medical examination that same day. No injuries were found on him.
10        The post mortem revealed bruises and abrasions all over the deceased’s head, his neck and his 4 limbs. There were also fractures of the ribs. The cause of death was certified as ""multiple injuries"".
 
Previous Convictions
11        The accused was convicted of the offence of gaming in public in 1981, 1985 and 1994 and of the offence of gaming in a common gaming house in 1995 for which he was fined on each occasion.
 
The Mitigation Plea
12        The accused was a cleaner working in the Ministry of Environment Building. On 14 May 2002, he was invited by 4 colleagues to join them for drinks after work. 
13        At about 7 pm, 3 of them shared 2 bottles of beer at a coffee shop at Bukit Merah View. The other 2 persons drank coffee and then left the group. At about 9pm, the 3 proceeded to a pub at Clarke Quay where they shared one jug of beer. They then went to a karaoke lounge in Kim Seng Road. One of the trio had beer and then left. The accused and the remaining colleague drank one and a half bottles of brandy until about 2 am when they shared a taxi home. Both lived in Taman Ho Swee.
14        The accused stumbled home and opened the main door. In his drunken stupor, he saw his father storming towards him and hurling vulgarities at him. They quarrelled and he vaguely remembered having pushed his father away. The rest of the events in the early hours that day were completely hazy to him.
15        When he woke up around noon and saw his father lying motionless on the floor, he tried to rouse him. He then telephoned the police and his sister and waited for the police to arrive.
16        The accused married in 1989 and divorced in 1997. His wife has custody of their son aged 9 and their daughter aged 12. After his divorce, he moved in with his father. He was usually unemployed due to his low education and the poor state of his mental and physical health. He used to do odd job labour until March 2002 when he got a job as a cleaner earning $40 per day. He was paid fortnightly.
17        Being the youngest in a family of 7 siblings, he was doted on by his father with whom he had lived harmoniously for the past 5 years. His mother passed away a few years ago. The family had a tragic history. His eldest brother committed suicide in 1986 and his second eldest brother was stabbed to death in 2001. The attack on his father was completely uncharacteristic and he offers no excuse for his actions. He is truly remorseful and suffers immense agony over the tragic incident day after day. He ""is the one who will suffer the most from the loss of his father who died at his hands"". The tragedy happened within the family and the accused is not a danger to anyone.
18        His previous convictions were rather long ago and did not involve offences of violence. He used no weapon in the attack on his father. He was not a habitual drinker of alcohol – he could scarcely afford to do so.
19        Among the many cases cited was 
PP v Jamal anak Nyalau 
[2002] 3 SLR 66
 
where the 3 accused persons there were convicted of an offence under section 304 (b) Penal Code and sentenced to imprisonment of 6 years and 6 months each. There, the 3 accused persons had attacked a helpless victim without provocation. They had no previous conviction and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. No weapons were used. It was argued that there was some provocation by the father in the present case. Further the victim here was not outnumbered. I was therefore urged to imprison the accused for no more than 6 years. 
 
THE DECISION OF THE COURT
20        I acknowledge that the accused did inform and cooperate with the police and has pleaded guilty. I also accept that the previous convictions show him to be a man given to gambling rather than to violence. 
21        The father was 73 years old. It is quite apparent from the extensive injuries suffered by him and the total lack of injury on the accused’s body that the deceased was frail while the accused was much more robust despite his assertion about having a rather weak disposition. Whatever little provocation came from the elderly man was not something that was so out of the ordinary that it should cause so explosive a reaction. The accused literally kicked a man who was down and out.
22        It was highlighted in mitigation that the accused carried his father to the mattress after the attack before he went to bed. Even so, I seriously doubt it was an act of filial piety or of tender mercy or even of remorse. It is as comforting as having been robbed and then having the robber wish you, ""Have a good day"". It would of course be quite different if he had the good sense then to call for the police or for an ambulance.
23        It was also said that the accused was no habitual drinker of alcohol. However, the merry-making sessions in the evening of 14 May 2002 showed that this could not be so. The effects of consuming excessive alcohol are well known and should certainly be known to the then 37 year old accused. The law does not allow intoxication as a defence to a criminal charge except in very limited circumstances (sections 85 and 86 Penal Code). Intoxication is also of no mitigating value in the case of a grown-up man like the accused. He who imbibes excessively and is then imbued with Dutch courage should not be heard crying, ""Don’t blame me, it’s the alcohol"" when charged with some offence committed in the state of intoxication.
24        In the circumstances, I could not agree that the accused should be given a sentence at the lower end of the scale provided in section 304 (b) Penal Code. I therefore sentenced him to 9 years imprisonment with effect from 15 May 2002, the date of his arrest.

1904: Nov. 28.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.

Criminal law—Crown case reserved—Form of
charge—Theft—Taking ""fraudulently and without colour of
right""—Criminal Code , 1892, secs. 305 and 611—Form FF—County Court Judges'
Criminal Court —Court in banco—Jurisdiction of
quorum.

The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, composed of
a quorum of four judges only, has jurisdiction to hear and decide a Crown case
reserved stated by the judge of the County Court Judges' Criminal Court for the
opinion of the Supreme Court.

The prisoner was charged before the County
Court Judges' Criminal Court, with unlawfully stealing goods, but the charge
did not allege that the offence was committed fraudulently and without colour
of right.

Held, affirming
the decision appealed from, that the offence of which the prisoner was accused
was sufficiently stated in the charge.

Appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, declaring that the charge to
which the prisoner pleaded and on which he was tried and convicted in the
County Court Judges' Criminal Court was not bad by reason of the omission to
charge the offence of theft as having been committed fraudulently and without
colour of right. The case stated for the opinion of the court below was as
follows:

""Case
Stated for the Opinion of the Court.

Oct. 11, 1901.

""The prisoner was charged before me
under section 305 of the Code, that on a certain day in the month of April,
A.D. 1901, he unlawfully did steal one piece of

[Page 377]

Oregon pine wood, of
the value of five dollars and forty cents, the property of His Majesty the
King.

""At the conclusion of the evidence, Mr.
Power, counsel for the accused, objected that the charge of stealing in this
case must allege that the offence was committed fraudulently and without colour
of right, etc.

""I found the prisoner guilty, but at the
request of his counsel I suspended sentence, and granted a reserved case, upon
the following question:

""1. Is the charge to which the prisoner
pleaded, and on which he was tried, bad by reason of its omitting to charge the
offence as having been committed fraudulently and without colour of right, and,
if yes, is the conviction therefore bad, the accused not having objected until
after the close of the evidence?

""The only doubt which I entertain in
respect of the sufficiency of the charge is caused by the opinion expressed by
Mr. Justice Taschereau in his work on the Code, at page 675, as to the
restricted application of section 611 of the Code and the Form FF given in
schedule one. But for that opinion I would have had no doubt whatever as to the
sufficiency of the charge, and would have refused the application for a
reserved case.

""(Signed), W. B. WALLACE,

""Judge of County Court, District No. 1,

and Judge of the County Court Judges'

Criminal Court for the
County of Halifax.""

When the case was heard by the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia, sitting in banco, that court was constituted of four of
its judges only, being a quorum according to the rules of practice. The
majority of the judges, Weather be J. dissenting, were of opinion that the
charge to which the prisoner pleaded and

[Page 378]

upon which he was
tried and convicted was not bad by reason of the omission to charge the offence
as having been committed fraudulently and without colour of right, and ordered
the case to be remitted to the trial court and the proper sentence passed upon
the prisoner. The prisoner appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.

John J. Power for
the appellant. The charge was insufficient. It should have set out in substance
all the elements which under sec. 305  of the Criminal Code  constitute the
offence of theft or stealing; in other words, it should have been averred that
it was done ""fraudulently and without colour of right"" and with
""intent, etc.""

There was no jurisdiction in the court below
to render the decision now under appeal. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, by
sec. 5 of the Nova Scotia Judicature Act, is composed of seven judges and, as
constituted, in banco, of a number less than seven judges, it had no
jurisdiction to hear or determine the case reserved by the judge of the County
Court Judges' Criminal Court. Section 3, (e,
iii) of the Criminal Code  requires criminal appeals or cases reserved, in
Nova Scotia, to be heard before the court in banco. See definition of
""Court in banco"" in the Century Dictionary, also in the
Imperial Dictionary. Order 58, Rule 7 , and Order 61, Rule 1 , of the Nova Scotia
Judicature Act, fixing the quorum of judges on the hearing of appeals, relate
merely to civil matters and do not affect procedure in criminal and matrimonial
cases. These rules are rules of procedure only, passed under section 45 of the
Nova Scotia Judicature Act, and do not relate to the ""constitution""
of a court. See British North America Act, 1867, sec. 92, s.s, 14. Section 15
of the Imperial Judicature Act of 1881 allows a court composed of five judges
to hear criminal appeals in England. 

[Page 379]

Prior to the passing
of that Act all the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench attended during
arguments of Crown cases reserved. As no such provision regarding the proper
quorum in criminal cases exists in Nova Scotia, the attendance of all the
judges of the Supreme Court of that province is necessary to give jurisdiction.

Longley K.C., Attorney
General for Nova Scotia, for the Crown, was not called upon for any argument.

The judgment of the court was delivered by

Sedgewick
J. (Oral).—""We are all of
the opinion that there was jurisdiction in the court below to hear and decide
the case reserved and that the court as then constituted, composed of a quorum of
the judges only, was properly constituted for that purpose.

We are also of
opinion that the offence of which the appellant was accused is sufficiently
stated in the charge upon which he was convicted in the County Court Judges'
Criminal Court.

The appeal is,
therefore, dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
KING'S BENCH (APPEAL SIDE), PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Canada Evidence Act  1893—Husband and wife
Competency of witnesss—"" Communication""—Construction of statute—Privilege —Directions by legal
adviser—Practice—Reference to Hansard debates—Method of interpretation,

Under the provisions of ""The Canada Evidence Act ,
1893,"" the husband or wife of a person charged with an indictable offence
is not only a competent witness for or against the person accused but may also
be compelled to testify. Mills J. dissenting.

Evidence by the wife of the person accused of acts performed
by her under directions of counsel sent to her by the accused to give the
directions, is not a communication from the husband to his wife in respect of
which the Canada Evidence Act  forbids her to testify. Mills J. dissenting,

Per Girouard J. (dissenting).—The communications
between husband and wife contemplated by the Canada Evidence Act , 1893, may be de verbo, de facto or de corpore. Sexual
intercourse is such a communication and in the case under anneal neither
the evidence by the accused that blood-stains upon his clothing were caused by
having such intercourse at a time when his wife was unwell, nor the testimony
of his wife in contradiction of such statement as to her condition, ought to
have been received.

Per  Mills J. (dissenting).—Under the provisions of the
Canada Evidence Act  1893 and its amendments the husband or wife of an accused
person is competent as a witness only on behalf of the accused and may not give
testimony on the part of the Crown.

Per Taschereau C.J.—The reports of
debates in the House of Commons are not appropriate sources of information to
assist in the interpretation of language used in a statute.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal
side, on a criminal case reserved affirming the conviction of the appellant for
murder in the Court of King's Bench, Crown Side, sitting in the District of
Montmagny, Province of Quebec.

The trial court judge (H. C, Pelletier J.) stated
the reserved case as follows :

""Le 9 décembre 1902,
les grands jurés ont trouvé que l'accusation
portée contre Joseph Gosselin d'avoir tue malicieusement et illégalement la
femme Vitaline Marquis épouse d'Octave Trahan, était fondée, et le procès ayant
eu lieu, les petits jurés ont, le 18 du même mois rapporté
contre l'accusé un verdict de coupable de meurtre..

""J'ai présidé cette Cour Criminelle. Á la demande du procureur du prisonnier, j'ai
suspendu le prononcé de la sentence en attendant la sentence de la cour du banc du
roi, siégeant en appel, en la Cite de Québec, sur les cas réservés et sur
l'exposé des faits suivants :

"" Lors de l'enquête faite devant le coroner
pour s'enquérir des circonstances de la mort de Vitaline Marquis,
en mai dernier
Célestine Labonté, épouse de Joseph Gosselin, l'inculpé, a comparu comme témoin
et a rendu témoignage.

"" A l'enquête préliminaire devant le
magistrat du district, M. Panet Angers, qui a en lieu en juin 1902, à Montmagny, alors que l'inculpé était sous arrestation, accusé d'avoir tue Vitaline Marquis, Célestine
Labonté a été appelée comme témoin, deux fois, pour rendre témoignage et elle a
refuse de témoigner.

""Le 6 décembre 1902
M. L. J Cannon, assistant-procureur-général qui, avec M. Lachance, avocat, a conduit cette cause
devant la cour du banc du roi, de la part de la Couronne, a envoyé le sergent McCarthy,

[Page 257]

chef de la police
provinciale de Québec, à Saint-Da-mien, en le Comté de Bellechasse, quérir
Célestine La-bonté avec son père Pierre Labonté chez qui elle demeure depuis
que son mari est en prison, et thus deux ont été conduits à Québec.

"" Le 7 décembre M. Cannon a eu, à Québec, une eutrevue
avec Pierre Labonté et sa fille Célestine Labonté qui lui ont raconté ce qu'ils avaient à dire en cette
affaire s'ils étaient appelés comme témoins. Au
cours de cet entretien, Célestine Labonté a dit que son curé son
confesseur, lui avait couseillé de parler Si elle était appelée à témoigner
devant la cour.

""Célesiine Labonté est restée volontairement sous la protection
et la surveillance du sergent McCarthy tout le temps et
jusqu'à ce qu'elle ait rendu son témoignage devant cette cour à Montmagny.

""Il n'a pas été prouvé qu'aucune coutrainte ait été exercée soit de la part de M. Cannon,
soit de la part du sergent McCarthy, sur la femme Célestine Labonté pour
l'induire à rendre témoignage, et cette femme ne s'est pas plaint non plus de
ce qu'on l'a coutrainte en aucune façon.

"" M. Ernest Roy, le procureur du
prisonnier, affirme que le 8 décembre il a voulu voir
Célestine Labonté et lui parler, mais qu'il en a été empêché par le sergent McCarthy.

"" Le 9 décembre 1902,
l'avocat du prisonnier a demandé à la Cour que des ordres furent
donnés afin qu'il pit communiquer verbalement, avec la femme Célestine
Labonté, alors à Montmagny, et sous Ia surveillance du dit sergent McCarthy.
Cette demande n'étant appuyée d'aucune raison valable, suivant
moi, et ne faisant pas voir en quoi les fins de la justice seraient mieux
atteintes si l'avocat de l'accusé communiquait à cette heure verbalement avec
un des témoins que la couronne voulait faire entendre j'ai refuse de donner

[Page 258]

de tels ordres, car je considérais qu'à cet
étage de la cause la couronne ne faisait que son devoir : servir
les fins de la justice en mettant la dite Célestine La-bonté sous sa protection
et à l'abri de toute atteinte pour l'empêcher de rendre témoignage, si elle
était décidée à être entendue comme témoin suivant les conseils de son aviseur
spirituel, et que la dite Célestine Labonté n'avait pas perdu, sa liberté à la
connaissance de la cour. Ensuite cette femme a été appelée par la couronne
devant la cour comme
témoin, et elle a déclaré devant la cour, avant de rendre témoignage, qu'elle
consentait à être entendue comme témoin de la part dé la couronne et elle a
témoigné.

"" Cette femme n'a jamais été assignée de la
part de la couronne sous l'autorité d'un bref de subpoena.

"" Premier cas réservé.—Sous les circonstances ci-dessus relatées la femme Célestine Labonté
était-elle en état de rendre librement et volontairement son témoignage ?
Sinon, son témoignage doit-il être mis de côté ? ""

II.

"" La dite Célestine Labonté a été appelée
comme témoin par la couronne. Elle a d'abord été examinée sur le voir dire et
j'ai déclaré qu'elle était un témoin compétent, excepté quant aux
communications privilégiées entre époux, entr'elle et son mari, qu'elle ne pouvait pas
révéler, et je l'ai instruite de ce fait aussitôt que l'occasion s'en est
présentée.

"" Etant assermentée comme témoin et avant
que Célestine Labonté ne commença à rendre son témoignage l'avocat du
prisonnier a demandé
an président de la cour de l'instruire sur le droit qu'elle avait de ne pas
rendre témoignage si elle le voulait, et que si elle refusait de rendre
témoignage elle n'encourrait aucune peine. Sun cette application de la part de

[Page 259]

l'avocat du prisonnier j'ai refuse de donner
aucune instruction an témoin quant à présent, c'est-à-dire avant que le témoin ne réclamât elle-même son privilège, si elle en avait
un. Alors la couronne a demandé an témoin si elle consentait à rendre
témoignage et elle a répondu que oui et elle a témoigné. Pans le cours des
transquestions la femme Célestine Labonté a déclaré qu'elle avait peur de son
mari et a ajouté que si la cour lui avait dit qu'elle avait le droit de refuser
de rendre témoignage et qu'en refusant ii ne lui serait arrivé aucun mal elle
n'aurait pas rendu témoignage. Cependant elle a continue encore à rendre
témoignage sans invoquer son privilège. Pans le ré-examen elle a dit que
lorsqu'elle avait refuse de rendre témoignage à l'enquête préliminaire devant
le magistrat M.P. Angers, elle avait reçu de son confesseur des conseils lui
disant de rendre témoignage si on l'appelait commetémoin, et que le même jour
qu'elle descendait de StCharles à Montmagny, sun les chars, que l'avocat du
prisonnier, M. Roy, lui avait parlé et qu'elle a refuse de rendre témoignage
devant le dit magistrat.

"" L'avocat du prisonnier a fait motion pour
que ce témoignage de Célestine
Labonté fût mis de côté J'ai décidé que ce témoignage
devait rester devant la cour et les jurés s que c'était an témoin à invoquer son privilège et que ne l'ayant pas
invoqué le prisonnier ne pouvait pas s'en plaindre. Pour plus amples
informations je réfère les honorables juges de la cour d'appel an jugement que j'ai rendu an
cours du procès sur ce point, et qui est annexé an présent exposé de faits et
marqué pièce ""A"".

Second point réservé.—Célestine
Labonté, épouse du prisonnier, Joseph Grosselin, était-elle un témoin compétent
contre son mari ?

"" La cour devait-elle la renseigner et lui
dire qu'elle n'était pas obligée de rendre témoignage, sun la demande de
l'avocat du prisonnier ?

[Page 260]

""La cour en disant au jury de considérer ce témoignage l'a-t-elle mal guide ? ""

III.

"" Au cours de son témoignage, Célestine Labonté a dit qu'elle avait lavé les
hardes et le linge du prison nier pour faire disparaître les tâches de sang qui
étaient dessus et cela à la demande de l'avocat du prisonnier qui lui a dit de les layer au plus vite. La
defense a objecté à cette preuve comme tendant à révéler des communications
privilégiées, vu que la femme parlait à l'avocat de son mari.

""J'ai décidé que vu la nature des faits et
des circonstances qu'il ne pouvait pas s'agir de communications privilégiées et
j'ai permis cette preuve.

"" Troisième cas réservé.—Y a-t-il là, lieu
d'invoquer le privilège des communications privilégiées et la preuve faite en pareil cas est-elle illégale ?

IV.

"" Les taches de sang sur les habits du prisonnier constituent en cette
cause une preuve de circonstances très convainquantes. Ici. il s'agissait pour l'in culpé
d'expliquer les taches de sang que l'on avait vues sur ses
caleçons. Le prisonnier en rendant son témoignage a déclaré qu'il avait mis les
caleçons sur lesquels on avait trouvé des taches de sang le lundi matin, 26
mai, alors qu'ils venaient d'être lavés et qu'ils étaient
parfaitement nets. Son avocat lui a pose la question suivante :

"" Comment pouvez-vous expliquer qu'il y
avait du sang sur la fourche de vos caleçons,—comment
pouvez-vous expliquer cela ?

"" R. Je l'expliquerai bien si on m'en donne la permission 

"" (Objecté à cette preuve par la Couronne).

The questions raised on the present
appeal are stated in the judgments now reported.

Gibsone and E. Roy for the appellant.

Cannon K. C., Assistant-Attorney-Greneral for Quebec,
for the respondent.

The Chief Justice.
I entirely concur in my brother Davies' reasoning and conclusions upon the
merit of the question involved on this appeal, and I have
nothing further to add to his opinion which I have had an opportunity to
peruse. I deem it expe-

[Page 264]

dient, however, to say a few words upon the question raised
during the argument of the reference by counsel to the debates in Parliament
for the purpose of construing any statute. Such a reference has always been
refused by my predecessors in this court and, when counsel in this case began
to read from the Canadian Hansard the remarks made in Parliament when the
Canada Evidence Act  in question was under discussion, I did not feel justified
in departing from the rule so laid down, though, personally, I would not be
unwilling, in cases of ambiguity in statutes to concede that such a reference
might sometimes be useful. The same rule is observed in England
Alderson B. says, In re Gorham ([1]):

We do not construe Acts of Parliament by reference
to history.

And, in Barbat v. Allen ([2]), Pollock C.
B. says :

I must at the same time state that the history of a clause in
a statute is certainly no ground for its interpretation in a court of law and I
would guard myself against being considered as resorting to any such means.

See also Philips v. Rees ([3])
; Reg v. Bishop of London ([4]),
per Lord Esher, at page 224; and Robinson v. The canadian Pacific Railway
Company ([5]).

In the case of The Queen v. The Bishop of Oxford ([6]), it is true a
reference to a speech of the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords, relating to
a certain statute, was allowed by the Court of Appeal but the remarks of the
learned judges upon that point, if I read them correctly, are far from
justifying the contention raised in some quarters that they intended to alter
the general rule on that point.

Bramwell L.J. said:

Both my learned brothers have discussed our admission of the
opinion given by the Lord Chancellor to the House of Lords, on the

[Page 265]

occasion of the Public Worship Regulation
Act, 1874. I really do not know that there is any definite rule as to what may
or may not he cited and acted on as authority. No doubt, we must act on general
principles, and I suppose they would exclude what is said in debate
in either House of Parliament. But to reject the
opinion of the head of the law as to what is the law, given to advise the
highest court of judicature in the country, sitting indeed in its legislative
capacity, and at the same time admit the obiter dictum of a judge at nisi
prius either in our own or an American court, seems somewhat strange, more
especially as it is certain that, if it ought to be excluded, any judge knowing
of it and excluding it, would as soon as he left the court consult the Hansard
he had before rejected. I cannot think it was wrong to admit it.

Baggallay L.J. said:

Before leaving the subject of judicial authority as bearing
upon the question of the construction of that section I desire to refer to the
circumstances of our having allowed the counsel for the appellants to quote to
us a passage from the speech of the- Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords,
when moving the third reading of the Public Worship Regulation Act in 1874 ;
the counsel for the appellants whilst admitting that he could not refer to the
passage in question or any other passage in that or any other speech for the
purpose of construing the Public Worship Regulation Act, insisted that it was
perfectly open to him to refer to it as representing the opinion of the Lord
Chancellor as to the then state of the law relating to proceedings in respect
of offences against the laws ecclesiastical, which laws it was proposed to some
extent to affect by the bill before the House. After hearing the objections of
the counsel for the respondent we allowed the passage to be read and though I
have since entertained some doubts whether we were right in our decision, which
doubts have not been wholly removed, I am, upon the whole, of opinion that
there was no objection to the course that we allowed the appellants' counsel to
take. The question with reference to which we allowed it to be cited was whether
at the time of the passing of the Public Worship Regulation Act, there was a
general concurrence of judicial opinion as to the true effect of a provision in
an Act of Parliament passed thirty-four years previously. The courts have been
in the habit of allowing reference to be made to text books the authors of
which are living Judges, and I am unable to distinguish, in principle, an
expression of opinion by the Lord Chancellor as to the state of the law upon a
particular subject, with which he is inviting the House of Lords to deal, from
an expression of opinion upon the same subject by another judge in a treatise
published

[Page 266]

by him. The weight to be attached to the opinion, whether
expressed in the one form or the other, must, of course, depend upon the
surrounding circumstances.

The doubts I have entertained a3 to the propriety of our
allowing reference to be made to the speech of the Lord Chancellor, have arisen
from a consideration of the difficulties which in some cases, may arise, though
they do not exist in the present, in the way of strictly limiting the purposes
for which reference may be made to such expressions of judicial opinion.

Thesiger L J. said :

I would only say, that among the authorities upon which I rely
I do not count the speech of the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords. I was a
party to the decision under which it was allowed to be quoted to us, and the
ground upon which I thought it admissible was that it had in the occasion upon
which it was spoken and the position of the speaker at least as great a
sanction as the text-books of living Judges which have upon many occasions been
admitted as authorities»

But upon further consideration of the matter, I have been led
to doubt very much whether the principle upon which such text-books have been
treated as authorities is a sound one ; and, even if it were a sound one I
cannot but think the extension of it to speeches in a House of Parliament,
sitting in its legislative capacity, however eminent may be the speakers,
however solemn the occasion on which they speak, inexpedient in a very high
degree. it is true that m many instances, and perhaps this
particular one is a conspicuous example, the speech, looking to the
circumstances under which it was made the previous consideration which the
speaker has given to the subject and the character in which he speaks, may be
entitled to far more weight than the hasty utterances of a judge at nisi
prius or even the obiter dicta of a judge in banco ; but the
judge, in the latter cases has the safeguard of a judicial proceeding cast
around him ; his mind is not likely to be influenced by any considerations
beyond those which the law enforces upon him ; while, when the scene is removed
to the area of Parliament, political considerations may enter as they have
before now entered, into the opinions of lawyers upon legal subjects, and may
insensibly affect the judgments of even the greatest and wisest of our judges.
The sanction and safeguard of judicial procedure are removed, and even the
conditions which give the text-book its weight the exclusive devotion to the
legal subject of which it treats, and the calmness with which it is necessarily
prepared may, in many instances, not exist.

[Page 267]

That case is, however, no authority upon the question, for
when in the House of Lords sub nomine Julius v. (oxford ([7]),

In the course of the arguments strong disapprobation was
expressed by the Lord. Chancellor (Earl Cairns) and Lord Selborne of the course
taken by the Court of Appeal in allowing to be cited a speech made by the Lord
Chancellor in the House of Lords

In South-Eastern Railway Company v. The Railway
Commissioners and the Mayor, etc., of Hastings ([8]), Cock-burn C
J had also referred to a speech in the House of Lords, but in that same case ([9]), upon counsel
saying ""The Act cannot be construed by reference to a debate in
Parliament, "" Selborne, Lord Chancellor, said :

That is so. It has been regretted in. the House of Lords that
the Court of Anneal had allowed such a reference to be made in The Queen v.
The Bishop of Oxford. (Ubi supra.)

In the United States the rule seems to be the same.

But in truth, little reliance can or ought to be placed upon
such sources of interpretation of a statute,

says Story J. in 2 Story's Reports, 654 ?

Peckam. J., in the United States Supreme Court, said :

There is a general acquiescence in the doctrine that debates
in Congress are not appropriate sources of information from which to discover
the meaning of the language of a statute passed by that body. The reason is
that it is impossible to determine with certainty what construction was put
upon an Act by the members of a legislative body that passed it by resorting to
the speeches of individual members thereof. Those who did not speak may not
have agreed with those who did, and those who spoke might differ from each
other ; the result being that the only proper way to construe a legislative Act
is from the language used in the Act and, upon occasion, by a resort to the
history of the times when it was passed. United States v. Freight Association (4);

[Page 268]

see also United States v.
Oregon &c. Railroad Co. ([10]) ° though the
public history of the times in which a statute was passed may be referred to,
according to what Taney C. J. says in Aidridge v. Williams ([11]) or what Davis
J. .says in United States v. The Union Pacific Railroad Co., ([12]) and Peckam
J., Ubi supra.

In Lefroy's valuable book, (The Law of Legislative Power in
Canada,) pages I and 21, are collected the judicial opinions wherein the
general rule has been more or less disregarded in the construction of the
British North America Act. The reports of the codifiers of
the Civil Code of Lower Canada are also often referred to in Quebec and in this
court, as also in the Privy Council (see for instance, Symes v. Cuviller, ([13])
but these cannot be put upon the same footing in regard to this rule as are the
debates in Parliament upon a bill.

SEDGEWICK J.
concurred with His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies.

GIROUARD J.
(dissenting.) — I dissent from the majority of the court only as to the meaning
of the word c communication"" in section four of "" The Canada Evidence
Act  1893 ""

At the trial of the appellant for murder, the wife of the
accused was examined and the following incident transpired, as stated by the
trial.judge in the reserved case.

His counsel then asked him (the accused) the following
question :

Q. How can you explain the blood
that was found on the fork of these drawers. How can you explain this 1

A. I will explain it if I am
allowed to do so.

Q. (By the court.) Explain this?

[Page 269]

A. Monday I had intercourse with my
wife and she was unwell.

Q. (By the court.) Is that the only
explanation you wish to give ?

A. * * * *

To contradict this evidence by the
prisoner, the Crown brought up Celestine Labonté, his wife, in rebuttal, and
asked her the following question : 

Q. Now your husband also declared,
yesterday, in the witness-box, that on the twenty-sixth of May in the course of
the morning, i.e., the day after he had gone to Vitaline Marquis's house, he
had sexual intercourse with you ?

This question was objected to on
behalf of the accused as tending to contradict evidence which was illegal and
allowing evidence of privileged communications between husband and wife. Upon
this objection the court decided that, the prisoner having declared that he
explained the presence of blood upon his drawers by the fact that he had sexual
intercourse with his wife in the course of the Monday morning, and this fact
being an important one which had gone to the jury the Crown should be allowed
to contradict it in rebuttal but the court did not decide that such a fact was
a privileged communication between husband and wife mentioned in the Canada
Evidence Act  of 1893. The counsel for the accused then took exception to this
judgment and asked for a reserved case upon this point

This evidence being allowed the
wife answered that she did not remember exactly but, nevertheless, believed
that she had had sexual intercourse with her husband upon this Monday morning,
but that she had no blood upon her at that time

I told the jury that they should
weigh the evidence given by the wife as well as the evidence given by the
husband as to the blood stains.

The Chief Justice Lacoste and Mr. Justice
Ouimet formed the dissenting minority of the Court of Appeal and held that the
witness was not competent to be examined in any manner or form on behalf and at
the request of the Crown.

I am not prepared to go to that extent, but I have no
hesitation in saying that she was not competent to give the above evidence As I
read the fourth section of the "" Canada Evidence Act  1893 "" a wife or
husband is a competent witness in any criminal case and may possibly be
compelled to give evidence, but

[Page 270]

no husband shall
be competent to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their
marriage and no wife shall be competent
to disclose any communication made to her by her husband during their marriage.

What is the meaning of the word ""communication
"" ?

Webster defines it

the act or fact of communicating
intercourse by words, letters or messages. connection, intercourse.

Why depart from this definition in the interpretation of
clause four of the Evidence Act ? For what reason limit it to words of mouth,
messages, conversations, letters or gestures ? Thus limited, the statute would
not protect the whole situation contemplated. I do not believe that the
legislature ever intended such a result. It does not say so and I am not
inclined to add to or take from the ordinary meaning of the expression used. I
think the word ""communication"" is large enough to comprehend all
kinds of relations between husband and wife whether de verbo,
de facto or de corpore Are the sexual
relations between husband and wife to be less sacred than a mere conversation
or message ? It was more than a matter of privllege, which may be waived, it
was illegal to admit the evidence of the wife. The prisoner objected to it, but
even the formal consent of all parties could not cover such an illegality,
which is of public order. The wife was not competent to contradict the evidence
of her husband as to his explanation of the blood stains upon his clothes. For
the same reason, the learned judge should have ruled out the answer given by
the prisoner, whether offered by him or not. He was not, therefore, legally
tried and should have a new trial, not in consequence of his own evidence,
which caused him no possible injury but by reason of the evidence of the wife
which was the occasion of a substantial wrong to him. See section 746 of the
Criminal Code .

[Page 271]

Not only was the trial illegal, it was not even fair. The wife
whose assistance the prisoner was entitled to was kept under close surveillance in the private house of the Chief of Provincial
Police, at the request of the Crown and when his counsel endeavoured to see her
on his behalf he was refused. The trial judge sanctioned this course.

The Crown Attorney can take all necessary measures to secure
the attendance of witnesses, but his refusal to allow the accused or his
counsel to see her and obtain her lawful assistance, if any was available, was
unwarrantable. He was not an outlaw and might even be acquitted, and, if he had
been, what would be the life of the unfortunate couple ?

It is in a case like this that the language of Taylor, quoted by
my brother Davies, should receive its application.
Indeed the peace of families is at stake It is no doubt of great moment to the
community that criminals should be convicted and punished but it is more
important that criminal justice should be properly and legally administered.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal and grant a new trial.

DAVIES J.—The
questions raised on this appeal depend for their solution
upon the construction to be given to the fourth and fifth sections of the
Canada Evidence Act , 1893.

The appellant was tried on an indictment for murder and the
questions arose out of his wife being tendered and giving her evidence as a
witness for the Crown. The trial judge, while being of the opinion that she was
under the statute a competent witness, also thought that it was a matter of
privilege or volition on her part whether she should testify or not, and during
the progress of her examination he so instructed her.

[Page 272]

It was contended for the prisoner that the statute
did not permit the wife to give evidence for the Crown at all; and that, at any
rate, before she gave any evidence she should be instructed by the court
as to her rights and given to understand that if she declined to-give evidence
she would not incur any penalty. The-learned judge, however, left the question
of giving or declining to give evidence to the determination of the wife
herself but reserved the point raised.

Questions were also raised by the prisoner's counsel as to the
admissibility of certain evidence given by the-wife in contradiction of a
statement made in his evidence by the prisoner when, in explanation of certain
blood spots found upon his drawers after the murder, he stated that on the
Monday he had had carnal connection with his wife who at the time was unwell ;
and also another statement made by the wife as to instructions or advice given
to her by the prisoner's counsel as to the washing out of these blood stains.
The learned judge in both cases admitted the evidence and reserved the point.

On the reserved case being argued before the Court of King's
Bench for the Province of Quebec the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice
Ouimet delivered dissenting judgments to the effect that, under a true
construction of the statute the wife of the accused was not a competent witness
for the prosecution, but for the defence
only,

They based their conclusion partly upon the proposition that
to admit the wife of the accused as a witness for the prosecution was opposed
to public policy and order and was inconsistent with the subsection of section
four, which, while preventing comments being made by the judge or counsel for
the prosecution for the failure of the accused or of the wife or the husband of
the accused to give evidence, was silent as to-

[Page 273]

such, comments being made by the counsel for the prisoner.

I am quite unable to concur either in these conclusions or to
follow the reasoning which led the learned judges to adopt them. Our duty is
simply to construe the language of the statute as we find it. Where that language
is plain and unambiguous we are not to speculate as to what was or might, have
been the intention of Parliament or as to the consequences which we may think
impolitic or undesirable which follow from adherence to the plain language of
the statute.

The section under consideration does not say that the wife or
the husband of the accused shall be a competent witness for the defence. Such
a limitation is found in the Imperial statute passed subsequently to that of
Canada, but it is conspicuously absent from the latter. The section under
review makes these parties the accused and the husband or wife of the accused
competent witnesses, but with a definite and specified exception relating to
communications made to each other during marriage. With regard to these latter
the incompetency of the witnesses remains. In all other respects it has been
removed, and they stand on the same plane as other competent witnesses and
liable to answer, when called, all legal questions asked them. To interpolate
the words ""for the defence"" is in my judgment, to do violence to the
language of the section. ""With reference to the argument derived from the
omission of any reference to the counsel for the accused in this section,
forbidding comment in case of failure of the accused or of the husband or wife
of the accused to give evidence, I am unable to appreciate the supposed
inconsistency of the omission. It certainly would be an extreme case which
would call for comment on the part of counsel for the accused that the

[Page 274]

Crown had failed
to call him or her, or his or her wife or husband, as the case might be, to
give evidence» What Parliament was evidently providing for was the protection
of the prisoner from damaging comments either by the court or prosecuting
counsel if, not having been called by the Crown, the prisoner or his wife or
her husband, as the case might be, did not tender himself nor call his consort
for the defence. But in any event, such an omission should not avail to alter
the plain construction of a statute or justify us in imputing to Parliament an
intention which its language in the main section does not bear.

The judgment of the majority of the Court of King's Bench
which was delivered by Mr. Justice
Hall follows that of the trial judge, and limits the competency of the accused
or of the wife or husband of the accused, as the case may be, to give evidence,
to those cases in which they may voluntarily elect to do so. As appears from
what I have already said, I take a wider view of the sections under consideration
than is taken in the judgment appealed from. Apart altogether from
communications made by husband and wife to each other during their marriage, I
hold that their competency as witnesses is by the statute made unrestricted. If
Parliament intended to vest in the accused or in the husband or wife of the
accused, the privilege simply of giving evidence and not the duty, surely it
would have said so and provided as was done in the Imperial statute of 1898,
that the accused

should not be called as a witnesses
except upon his own application, (and that) the wife or husband of the person
charged (should not be so called) except upon the application of the person so
charged.

Before the passing of the Canada Evidence Act  1893 some few
special exceptions had been made to the common law prohibiting an accused party
and the wife or husband, as the case might be, of the accused

[Page 275]

party from giving evidence, either for or against each other.
Secs. 216 and 217 of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, permitted the
accused and his or her wife or husband to give evidence for the prosecution or
in his or her own behalf in actions for common assault or assault and battery.
These sections were repealed by the Criminal Code  on the same day as the Canada
Evidence Act  came into force. Being made by the latter Act c competent
witnesses s on the trial of one or the other for any offence, their
incompetency, which existed under the common law, was removed. No distinction
was attempted to be drawn between their competency for the prosecution or for
the defence No limitation upon this competency was inserted beyond that of
prohibiting the disclosure of marital communications. These were not left to
the whim, election or caprice of the parties. Their incompetency on these
matters was retained. On all others it was removed. Henceforth, except with
respect to martial communications, they stood in the same position as other
witnesses and could not refuse to answer any legal question put to them.
Questions of privilege at no time existed. It was and is solely a question of
competency. By the fifth section of the statute it is declared that :

No person shall be excused from
answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such question may
tend to criminate him etc

and this applies equally to the accused and to his or her wife
or husband when giving evidence, as to any other witnesses.

I fully agree with the Court of King's Bench in failing to
appreciate any grave distinction between calling the accused or his wife or
husband to give evidence for the prosecution or for the defence. In either case
the witness is bound to tell the truth. The whole

[Page 276]

object of the trial is or should be to reach the truth, and it
doubtless was because Parliament believed this object could best be achieved by
removing the incompetency to give evidence under which the parties had
theretofore laboured that the section was passed. The proviso retaining the
sacredness of all marital communications was properly inserted as a matter of public
policy and to preserve, as Mr. Taylor in his book on Evidence says :

that unlimited confidence between
husband and wife upon which the happiness of the married state and the peace of
families depends.

Some argument was advanced at bar on the inference to be
derived from the absence in the statute of the word compellable ; and it was
said that being made a competent witness only and not expressly a compellable
one left in the witness a complete election to testify or not as he or she
pleased and as to such matters as he or she should elect. I cannot yield to
such an argument.

It is true that the word compellable was coupled with the word
competent in Lord Denman's Civil Evidence Act, when introduced in England. But,
as was pointed out by Lord Chancellor Herschell, in giving the judgment of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Kops v. The
Queen, ([14])
compellable "" there means c compellable by process of law. ""

In several of the later statutes amending the law of criminal
evidence in England, the wife and husband of the accused are admitted under
prescribed conditions to give evidence. It had been held, under one of these
statutes by Mr. Justice Wills, (see Phipson on Evidence, 3 ed. p. 415) that a
wife where declared competent is also compellable not only against her husband
but also against her own wish. The authority cited ([15])

[Page 277]

is, of course, not an authorised report, and, on referring to
it I find the learned judge while so holding would, if the prisoner had been
convicted, have reserved a case upon that point,

These conclusions which I have stated determine most of the
questions raised on this appeal. With regard to the others I agree with the
majority judgment of the Court of King's Bench, that the rulings of the learned
trial judgé were correct. The wife being a competent
witness it was not open to her, in my opinion, to refuse to give evidence or to
select the points upon which she should testify ; only as to the disclosure of
marital communications was she incompetent to testify.

The communication between the prisoner's wife and the
prisoner's counsel was not a privileged communication in the sense of being a
communication from her husband. No evidence was offered that he knew of or
authorised. The only point reserved, as I understand the case is with respect
to what the solicitor told her. This statement was certainly not within his
duty and being calculated to further or conceal a criminal act does not come
within the solicitor's privilege. That privilege cannot be invoked to protect
communications which are in themselves parts of a criminal or unlawful proceeding ; Bullivant v. The Attorney-General for
Victoria ([16]);
The Queen v. Cox ([17]).

Nor do I think that the evidence given by the prisoner's wife
came in any way within the statute which retains her incompetency to disclose
any communication made to her by her husband during marriage. The facts to
which she testified were independent facts gained by her own observation and
knowledge and not from any communication from her husband. She saw the blood on
the clothes after her

[Page 278]

husband had. left the house to deliver himself up. She washed
them after that in order to obliterate the blood stains as the solicitor told
her to do and she contradicted her husband as to her being unwell at the time
he swore he had carnal connection with her.

I fully agree with the trial judge and with the Court of
King's Bench that none of this evidence comes within the rule invoked.

As a majority of my colleagues concur in this judgment, the
appeal is dismissed.

MILLS J.
(dissenting.) — In this case Gosselin is charged with having murdered a woman,
and when he was put upon his trial his wife was called by the Crown as a
witness to testify against him. She had been induced by those who were obtaining
evidence on behalf of the Crown to leave her home, to go to the city of Quebec,
and to take up her residence there with the Chief of Police. All this may have
been a most legitimate proceeding, for the purpose of being able to produce her
so far as she. might be legally called upon to give testimony when her husband
was put upon his trial. The counsel who was retained on
behalf of her husband was not permitted to see her, and so was not able to
discuss the charges which were made against her husband with her, and to
ascertain from her the facts which he desired to know in respect to the crime
for which her husband was about to be tried.

It was contended by the counsel for the prisoner before us
that under the Canada Evidence Act , when the husband or wife is accused of
crime, unless in the case of a crime committed by one against the other,
neither is permitted to testify against the other in respect to any matter
which springs out of the marital relations. The law in respect to the husband
and wife giving evidence in a criminal trial other than

[Page 279]

the case of an offence committed by one against the other
depends upon the provisions of the Canada Evidence Act  1893, secs. 3, 4 and 5.
He maintained that the wife of accused was not a competent witness for the
prosecution, that she was not a compellable though a competent witness for the
prisoner, and that the extent to which she might testify, was limited by the
Act because of her marital relations to the accused» He maintained that she was
not before the court as a voluntary witness and that, being very ignorant as to
her rights in this regard and being generally ill-informed, she was under the
impression that she was liable to be committed to prison unless she appeared as
a witness in the case. The Chief of the Provincial Police at Quebec came to her
father's house where she was residing after her husband had been committed to
prison, and while there she was kept under constant surveillance, and was
especially warned not to speak to her husband's counsel.

The prisoner's counsel endeavoured to see her but was not
allowed to do so. He then applied to the court for an order but this was
refused him. Before the witness was heard Mr. Roy, her husbands counsel, asked
the court to instruct her as to her privileges, but she was ordered out of
court before the application was heard, and so kept in ignorance of her right.
I think it is much to be regretted that such á course
was adopted, for I cannot think that it was not a most proper proceeding on the
part of the counsel for the prisoner that he should endeavour to consult with
the prisoner's wife, and I think what she said, notwithstanding the
instructions given by the judge in the witness box, did not make her a
voluntary witness against her husband on the trial, and that while the law made
her competent to a limited extent, it also made her a voluntary witness if a
witness at all. I

[Page 280]

infer from what she said that she did not rightly apprehend
her privilege, and that she was in ignorance of it
notwithstanding what the trial judge said to her.

Under the common law the husband and wife are incompetent to
give evidence for or against each other By ch. 174, secs. 216, 217 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada on a summary trial for common assault, or assault
and battery, the defendant is made a competent witness for the prosecution, or
for himself, and on such a trial the wife or husband of the defendant shall be
a competent witness for the defendant. if another crime is charged, and in the
opinion of the court, it does not amount to more than common assault or assault
and battery, the defendant shall be a competent witness for the prosecution or
on his own behalf, or if the defendant is a woman she shall be a competent
witness in respect to the charge of common assault or assault and battery. By
the following section, no person charged with an indictable offence shall be a
competent or compellable .witness to give evidence for himself, or tending to
criminate himself nor, except as stated above did the Act render a husband
competent or compellable to give evidence for or against his wife, or a wife
competent or compellable to give evidence for or against her husband. These
sections were repealed at the same time that the Canada Evidence Act  came into
force. This Act extended the competency of the husband and wife as witnesses
with regard to each other and, in so far as this was done the common law rule
was restricted but was not wholly superseded. It is well from this point of
view to consider sections 3  4 and 5 of the Evidence Act 1898 as amended by 61
Vict. ch. 53 and 1 Edw. VII ch. 36. Section 3
provides that a person shall not be incompetent to give evidence by reason of
interest or crime.

[Page 281]

4. Every person charged with an
offence and the wife or husband as the case may be, of the person so charged
shall be a competent witness, whether the person so charged is charged solely
or jointly with any other person. Provided, however, that no husband shall be
competent ' to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their
marriage, and no wife shall be competent to disclose any com munication made to
her by her husband during their marriage

2. The failure of the person
charged or of the wife or husband of such person, to testify shall not be made
the subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution in
addressing the jury.

5. No witness shall be excused from
answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such question may
tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil
proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person ; provided, however
that if with respect to any question the witness objects to answer upon the
ground that his answer may tend to criminate him or may tend to establish his
liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person
and if but for this section the witness would there fore have been excused from
answering such question, then, although the witness shall be compelled to
answer, yet the answer so given shall not be used nor received in evidence
against him in any criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him
thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in giving such
evidence.

2. The proviso to s.-s. 1 of this
section shall in like manner apply to the answer of a witness to any question
which, pursuant to any action of the legislature of the province, such witness
is compelled to answer, after having objected so to do upon any ground
mentioned in the said subsection, and which but for that enactment, he would
upon such ground have been excused from answering.

These are the provisions of the law which are thought doubtful
in their meaning, the Crown holding that when the husband or wife is made
competent he or she is also made compellable. The court below proceeded upon
the assumption that though the husband or wife is competent, they are not
compellable, to testify, while the counsel for the prisoner contended before us
that they are only competent to testify for but not against each other. Mr. Justice
Hall in his judgment upon this case in the Court of King's Bench of Quebec,
says :

The
text of the statute makes no distinction between the accused and the husband or
wife of the accused! if offered as a witness for the

[Page 282]

prosecution,
and the strongest argument against the evidence of the wife as a witness for
the prosecution in such a case is that whatever rule be adopted as to her must
be applied to the husband, and that it cannot be contended that Parliament intended
by its Act of 1893 to violate all precedent statutory law, and universal
practice, and authorise the procedure by which the accused could appear as a
witness against himself. Our prejudice such an interprétation arises
from the designation which we improperly make of a witness, as being for the
prosecution or for the defence. A witness, by whichever side produced, is not
sworn to render evidence for the prosecution or for the defence but only to tell the truth and he is called or
tendered as a witness by one side or the other in expectation that his evidence
will support the contentions of that side

But whatever may be the duty of the witness when he is called
he is called for the purpose of supporting the one side or the other and in
this case the statute itself assumes that he is not called by the prosecution
or for the purpose of supporting the prosecution, and so the failure to testify
shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by the counsel for the
prosecution. The statute puts the husband and the wife upon exactly the same
footing. If either appears in the witness box it can only be as a witness not
for the Crown, but for the one which maybe accused, and the failure of either
to avail himself or herself of the privilege which the law gives by making them
competent witnesses shall not be made subject of comment either by the judge or
by the counsel for the prosecution. It makes it very clear that the law of
evidence in this regard was being extended in favour of the prisoner only. Both
husband and wife are by section 4 put upon the same footing ; both are made
competent witnesses for the defence. The law was intended to make either an
available witness for the other ; it is a provision in the interest of the
accused party and was not intended to break down that public policy which has
long protected the marital relations. When we look at the proviso of section 4
we find that the pri-

[Page 283]

vacy of that relation is protected ; the barrier which has
preserved the confidence which exists by reason of it is still allowed to stand
; the confidence which is still essential to the
peace of the family and to the unrestrained confidence which the
well-being of society calls for, is protected ; it is declared that no husband
shall be competent to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during
their marriage, and no wife shall be competent to disclose any communication
made to her by her husband during their marriage. In England, no husband is
compellable to disclose any communication made to him by his wife during their
marriage, and no wife is compellable to disclose any communication made to her
by her husband. This does not simply mean that she may not tell anything which
he has told her but she is not at liberty to disclose anything which she has
learned from him as the result of their marital relations. It is not simply
what she has learned by words spoken to her. This is the view in Doker v.
Hasler ([18]).
In this case a widow was not permitted to disclose conversations between
herself and her late husband in a case in which it was said that an execution
was fraudulently taken out to protect the goods of the debtor against his
assignees, but the Chief Justice, Best, who was presiding would not permit her
to testify as to conversations between herself and her late husband and he said
:

I
remember that in that case (Munroe v. Twisleton ([19]) in
which I was counsel, Lord Alvanley refused to allow a woman after her divorce
to» speak to conversations which had passed between herself and her husband
during the existence of the marriage. I am satisfied with the propriety of that
decision, and I think that the happiness
of the marriage state requires that the confidence between man and wife should
be kept forever inviolate

In Aveson v. Kinaird ([20]) in an action
by the husband upon a policy of insurance on the life of his wife made

[Page 284]

by her when lying in bed, apparently ill, stating the bad
state of* her health at a period of her going to Manchester (whither she went a
few days before in order to be examined by a surgeon, and to get a certificate
from him of good health, preparatory to making an insurance) down to that time,
and her apprehension that she could not live ten days longer, by which time the
policy was to be returned, are admitted in evidence to show her opinión who best knew the fact of the ill state of her
health, at the time of making the policy, which was on a day intervening
between the time of her going to Manchester and the day on
which such declarations were made ; and particularly after the plaintiff had
called the surgeon as a witness, to prove that she was in good state of health
when examined by him at Manchester ; his judgment being formed in part from the
satisfactory answers being given by her to his inquiries. d Lord Ellenborough, in referring to the
evidence, said :

The
admission of the evidence is free from any imputations of breaking in upon the
confidence existing between man and wife. The declaration was upon the subject
of her own health at the time which is a fact of which her own declaration is
evidence ° and that too made unawares before she could provide any answer for
her own advantage and that of her husband ; and therefore falling within the
principle of the case in Skinner, which I have alluded to.

Grose J. said:

The
first question put to the witness was : In what situation she found Mrs. Aveson
when she called ? The answer was in bed. To that there could be no objection.
The next question was : Why was she in bed
1 Now who could possiblv give so good an account of that as the party
herself ? It is not only good evidence but the best evidence which the nature
of the case afforded.

And similar views were expressed by Lawrence J. In this case
testimony was given, not of what passed between the husband and wife, but of
what passed between the wife and several other parties who dis

[Page 285]

Cussed With her the state of her health at the time that
she went to Manchester to obtain the doctor's Certificate.

In The Queen v. Pamenter ([21]), Kelly C.B.
rejected a letter from the prisoner to his wife entrusted to a constable, but
which had been opened by him. And in Scott v. The Commonwealth ([22]),
a similar letter voluntarily surrendered by a wife from a husband was excluded
on the ground that its disclosure was a violation of those confidential
relations between husband and wife which the law protected.

In The king v. Smithies
([23]).
it was held that observations made by a wife to her
husband on a subject which afterwards was a matter of criminal charge against
him, may be opened to the jury by the counsel for the prosecution. Here, the
prisoner was indicted for the murder of Ellen Twamley by setting fire to his
own house. Mr. Adolphus, in opening for the prosecution was about to state some
observations made to the prisoner by his wife, on the subject of the fire, to
whom he made an evasive reply. Clarkson, who appeared for the prisoner, stated
that he was informed that if the wife, who was in court, could be examined she
would contradict the proposed statement, and he submitted under these
circumstances, it was doubtful whether the evidence would be received, and the
statement ought not therefore to be made. But Mr. Justice Gaselee and Mr.
Justice Parke were both of opinion that the statement might be made to a jury ;
and that the circumstance of the observations being stated to be made by the
wife who could not be called as a witness, did not vary the general rule, that
whatever was said to a prisoner on the subject matter of the charge, to which he made no direct answer, was

[Page 286]

receivable as evidence of an implied admission on his part. But
this was not any disclosure by the testimony of the wife but only of what she
had. said to her husband in the hearing of another party.

In the case of The King v. Simions ([24]) A. was a
witness for the prosecution of B. on a charge of arson, but was first examined
by a magistate before any specific charge was made against any person, and his
deposition had been reduced to writing. A. was next accused of the offence and
his statement as a prisoner was also taken down by the magistrate. After this,
B. was charged with the offence, and A. was examined as a witness when A's
statement at that time was taken down. B. being then in custody, the court held
that all these statements of A. ought to have been returned to the judge and not merely the statement made when A. was
committed. What a prisoner is overheard to say to his wife, or what a prisoner
is overheard to say to himself, is receivable in evidence against him on a
charge of felony. In this case, two witnesses who overheard the prisoner did
not understand him alike, and Alderson B. who was presiding said one of these
expressions was widely different from the other. It shows how little reliance
ought to placed on such evidence.

In the case of The King v. Bartlett ([25]), which was
tried before Baron Bolland, the prisoner was indicted for the murder of Mary
Lewis. While he was in custody his wife came into the room. Greaves, who was
acting for the prosecution, was about to ask what she said in his presence,
when Alexander, acting for the prisoner, submitted that it was not receivable,
as the wife could not be examined on oath against the prisoner and so what she
said cannot be used in evidence against him. Mr. Greaves however, main-

[Page 287]

tained that what the wife said to the prisoner was receivable
in evidence although the prisoner might not reply to it, but here the prisoner
did. Bolland B. said the evidence was admissible, and it was proved that the
wife said to her husband "" Oh, Bartlett, how could you do it?"" He
looked steadfastly at her and said, "" Ah, what, you accuse me of the
murder, too ?"" She replied "" I do, Bartlett you are the man who shot
my mother."" The prisoner did not make any reply. She then turned to the
witness and said ""This was done for money."" The judge said, ""
The examination must be read."" It was then put in and read. The witness
here heard what his wife said to the prisoner and so was permitted to testify.
The confidential relation existing between the husband and wife does not
prevent a stranger from testifying to what he heard one of them say to the
other.

A witness cannot be compelled to answer a question or produce
a document, the tendency of which is to expose him or his wife, or if the
witness should be the wife, to expose her or her husband, to any criminal
charge or prosecution. The privilege is based upon the confidential relations
which exist between husband and wife, and which the well-being of society
requires should be carefully guarded. In the case of The Queen v. Thompson,
Danzey and Hide ([26]),
Who were indicted and tried together it was held that the wife of one of them
was not a competent witness for either of the others. In this case Thompson and
Danzey were defended by the same counsel, Hyde was defended by another. They
were indicted and tried for stealing 56 pounds of onions. The counsel for the
two tendered as a witness for his clients the wife of the third. This was
objected to by the counsel for the prosecution on the ground that her evidence 

[Page 288]

in their case must affect the
case of her husband. It was said that the general policy of the law
which rejected the evidence of the wife, for or against her husband in criminal
cases made it necessary for the court to refuse the evidence of the wife on
behalf of the other accused. Boville O.J. said :

We are all of opinion that the wife
of any one of the three prisoners stands in the same ""position with
respect to the admissibility of her evidence as her husband. The prisoners were
charged together, they were tried together, and one of them could not be called
as a witness for the others and the wife stands in the same position as her
husband..

In the case of The Queen v. Payne and others ([27]), it was held
that when two prisoners are indicted and tried together, the one of them is not
competent to be a witness for the other. It was pointed out that 6 and 7 Vict.,
ch. 85, s. 1, abolished in general terms-incapacity from crime or interest, and
that would have admitted the testimony of the parties to any proceeding civil
or criminal, including a prisoner under* such circumstances as the present had
it not been for the proviso which reads

that this Act shall not render
competent any party to any suit, action or proceeding individually named in the
record.

That then 14 & 15 Vict., c. 99, s. i which
repealed. this proviso in the earlier Act and sec. 2 makes the party to any
proceeding competent witnesses, except those that are hereinafter excepted.
Sec. 3 provides that a person charged in any criminal proceeding* shall not be
a witness for or against himself, and that the husband or wife of a party
charged shall not be admissible for or against the wife or husband. The old
incapacity on the ground of interest having been swept away by the earlier Act,
and the excluding proviso in that Act repealed by
sec. 1 of the later Act, and parties expressly made competent by sec. 2, the-

[Page 289]

only witnesses whose testimony is excluded are those excepted
in sec. 3, the prisoner called on his own behalf and the husband or wife of a
prisoner called for or against the wife or husband. Cockburn C.J. said :

We
are all of opinion that the evidence rejected was properly rejected. We are all
agreed that the exception in 14 & 15 Vict. c. 99, s. 3, was introduced to
prevent any possibility of its being thought that the law as it had existed
from the earliest times had been altered by this Act. By that law it was a
distinguishing characteristic of our criminal system that a prisoner on his
trial could neither be examined nor cross-examined. We think it is impossible
to suppose that it could have been intended to change this rule by a mere side
wind by means of this exception.

All the witnesses competent to give evidence are generally
compellable, but this does not under our statute apply to the accused, or to
the wife in case the husband is accused, or to the husband in case the wife is
the accused party. It was held that where a prisoner is competent but not
compellable to give evidence on his own behalf, and did not do so it was not
necessarily wrong for the court to comment upon the fact, as was done in the
case of Kops v.
The Queen. ([28])
But under our statute both the judge and the counsel for the prosecution are
expressly inhibited from doing so. and I take it to be clear from the words of
the statute that neither husband nor wife where one of them is charged with a
crime and put upon trial, can be called as a witness by the Crown. The words
are :

That
their failure to testify shall not be made a subject of comment by the judge or
by the counsel for the prosecution in addressing the jury.

Our legislation has gone a long way in many things, but it has
not yet gone so far as to compel the prisoner to testify against himself, nor
to compel his wife to be a witness for the prosecution, although in this trial
the manner in which the wife was brought into court,

[Page 290]

approaches very closely to such a proceeding. She was kept for
some time in the custody of the Crown, and the counsel for her husband was
denied an opportunity of discussing her husband's case with her, and she
appeared in the court as a witness, not giving her testimony from a sense of
duty, but reluctantly as one in duress, giving her testimony because she
believed that she was under legal compulsion to do so. This is abundantly
shown.by the answers she gave to the questions put by the Court, before her
examination in the case began.

After she was sworn she was asked by the Court : ""Do you
consent to give evidence ? "" Her answer was : "" I would prefer not to
give evidence.""

Q. Do you consent to give evidence
?

A. If I must.

Q. What do you mean by ""if I
must"" ; you have already been heard as a witness, Madam, and you have
declared that you consented to give evidence, and you have given evidence in
this cause?

A Yes.

Q. Now, do you consent to give
evidence ?

A. If I must

Is it possible to doubt that this woman was a witness against
her will, and that she believed herself under legal compulsion ? In my opinion
when she replied to his Lordship's question, and said she would prefer not to
give evidence, she ought to have been discharged From that time she was a
witness under compulsion who had not been sufficiently informed as to her
privileges. She was also a witness testifying to matters which she was not
competent to disclose, and which was in violation of the marital relations
which it is the policy of the law to guard against invasion. 

In the Queen v. Gibson ([29]) decided by
the Court for Crown Oases Reserved, it was held that if in a criminal trial
evidence not legally admissible against the prisoner

[Page 291]

is left to the jury, and they find him guilty, the conviction
is bad. Lord Coleridge C.J. said that when such evidence
goes to a jury a new trial must be granted as a matter of right ; and in this
opinion all the judges concurred. It is said here, that the judge not only
ordered the wife out of the court, that she might not hear what her husband's
counsel was about to say against her being called as a witness, but until after
she was sworn no information was given to her as to her right in the matter.
And the information given her by the court, and which I have quoted, shows that
she still was under the impression that she was obliged to testify in the case.
In my opinion her husband's counsel was entitled to see her and to discuss her
husband's case with her if he so desired and she were willing to see him, and
no one had any right to intervene and prevent this being done.

When her husband's counsel saw her before she was taken to
Quebec he did so as her husband's agent, and in his name, and on his behalf,
and under the protection of the law as to those confidential relations which
exist between husband and wife for the protection of what he said to her, as
much so as if the husband had spoken in person. It is no doubt most desirable
that crime should be punished and that the zeal of public officers in bringing
criminals to justice should not be unduly restricted, but it is of no less
consequence, in the pursuit of this object, to see that every accused party who
is arrested and put upon his trial has a fair trial that justice is so
administered that the public confidence in the fairness of its administration
may be maintained unimpaired. There should be a new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

PRESENT:—Sir Elzéar Taschereau O.J. and Sedgewick, Girouard,
Davies, Mills and Armour JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.

Criminal law—Perjury—Judicial proceeding—De facto
tribunal—Misleading justice —— Jurisdiction—Construction of statute——R. S. Q. arts. 5551, 5561—Criminal Code . sec. 145 .

The hearing of a charge by a magistrate, assuming to act as a
Justice of the Peace having authority to hear it, is a judicial proceeding
within the meaning of section 145  of the Criminal Code  and a person swearing
falsely upon such hearing may be properly convicted of perjury, notwithstanding
that of magistrate had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of
the complaint.

Judgment appealed from (Q. R. 11 K, B1. 477) affirmed, the
Chief Justice and Mills J. dissenting.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal
side ([1]),
on a criminal case reserved affirming the conviction of the appellant for
perjury, and the sentence pronounced against him upon such conviction in the
Court of King's Bench, Crown side, for the District of Beauharnois.

The offence of perjury of which the appellant was convicted
was committed upon the hearing of and information for trespass under article
5551 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, upon lands situate in the County of
Huntingdon in the District of Beauharnois. The information was laid and the
case heard and decided before the Recorder of Valleyfield, who was ex
officio a Justice of the Peace in and for the whole of the

[Page 229]

District of
Beauharnois, but did not reside in the County of Huntingdon where the offence
was charged to have been committed and was therefore without jurisdiction over
the subject matter of the complaint in consequence of the provisions of article
5561 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec limiting the jurisdiction in such
matters to one or more Justices of the Peace residing in the county in which
the offence has been committed.

The questions raised on this appeal are stated in the
judgment, now reported.

Wilson for the appellant.

Duncan McCormick K.C. for the Crown.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).-This
is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench at Montreal
reported in volume 11, at page 477 of the Rapports Judiciaires de
Québec. I would allow it and quash the conviction in question for the
reasons given by Würtéle and Blanchet JJ., loc. cit. which to my mind are irrefutable.

It could not but be conceded as it has been unanimously by the
judges in the court â quo, and by the respondent
(private prosecutor) at bar, that the Recorder had no jurisdiction over the
case wherein the appellant is alleged to have committed perjury. Secs. 24 and
26 of the Quebec Interpretation Act, declaratory of the common law enact that :

When anything is ordered to be done
by or before a judge, magistrate, functionary or public officer, one is
understood whose powers or jurisdiction extend to the place where such thing is
to be done; and

Whenever an oath is ordered to be
taken or received such oath is received by any judge or magistrate authorized
to that effect having jurisdiction in the place where the oath is taken.

Then art 5561 of the Revised Statutes
expressly deprives the recorder of any jurisdiction in the case in question.

[Page 230]

The proceedings before him were not judicial proceedings,
because he was not a judge or magistrate, quoad the case. He was not, it
is admitted, a magistrate de jure. Neither could he
have been at Valleyfield, not being a resident of the County of Huntingdon, a magistrate de facto,
any more than if he had been sitting at Toronto or at Vancouver. A de facto officer's jurisdiction cannot be
territorially more extensive than the de jure one
whose functions he assumes. Where the statute expressly enacts that only the
magistrates residing in the County of Huntington have jurisdiction over the
case there cannot have been outside of that county whether in the same district
or a thousand miles from it, a de facto magistrate
having any reasonable pretence to jurisdiction. The respondent's contention
that a magistrate de facto can exercise
jurisdiction in any case at a place where the statute expressly decrees that
there can be no magistrate de jure in that case is
untenable. A magistrate de facto cannot have more
powers than a magistrate de jure. The proceedings
before the Recorder at Valleyfield were not only voidable but were void of a
nullity of non esse. As is said in the civil law, defectus
potestatis, nullitas nullitatum. No plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois
convict could be based on his decision. No appeal was necessary to set it
aside; Attorney General v. Hotham ([2]); and a writ
of certiorari to have it quashed could have been granted though taken away by
the statute (sec. 5579) if he had had jurisdiction. Had he committed any one
for contempt for not answering his summons as a witness or for refusing to
answer his questions, his warrant would not have been worth the paper it would
have been written upon, besides rendering him liable in damages. Nay under sec.
153 of the Code, he was perhaps guilty of an indictable offence for having
illegally received 

[Page 231]

the appellant's oath. There was, in
law, no oath taken before him, for he had not the power in that case to receive
any. And if there was no oath, no judicial oath, how can there have been
perjury? The respondent's contention that section 145 of the .Act bears the
construction that there may be perjury where there is no judicial
oath is irrational and untenable. Such an incongruity cannot have been
intended by Parliament. In fact that section, as I read it, plainly says that
it is only when the false oath is received by a competent tribunal, or in other
words by a person duly authorized to hold the judicial proceeding in which it
is taken, that it is indictable for perjury. The words upon which the court
below rely to hold the contrary are those of the last part of that sec. 145 
which read as follows :

Or before any person acting as a
court, justice or tribunal, having power to hold such judicial proceeding,
whether duly constituted or not, and whether the proceeding was duly instituted
or not before such court or person so as to authorize it or him to hold the
proceeding, and although such proceeding was held in a wrong place, or was
otherwise invalid.

Now, if the words "" having power to hold such judicial
proceeding "" are read immediately after the word ""person,"" as by
the punctuation they must be, they qualify the rest of the section and the oath
must have been received, in any case, by one having the power to hold the
judicial proceeding. And that they must be so read is rendered free from doubt
by referring to the French version, which is the law just as much as the
English version, though not brought to the attention of the court below nor of
this court.

That reads as follows:

Ou devant une personne agissant
comme cour, juge ou tribunal, autorisée a faire cette procédure judiciaire,
qu'il soit légalement constitué ou non, et que la procédure ait été
régulièrement instituée ou non devant cette cour ou personne de manière à
l'autoriser à faire la

[Page 232]

procédure, et lors même
que la procédure aurait eu lieu dans une localité où elle n'aurait pas dû avoir
lieu, ou qu'elle fût invalide sous d'autres rapports.

There is no ambiguity in these words. It is undoubtedly to an
oath taken before any person having power to hold the judicial proceeding wherein
that oath was taken that the rest of the section exclusively applies, and of
two possible constructions in one of the versions that one which reconciles the
two must be followed. So that the words ""having power to hold such
judicial proceeding"" in the English version must be read as applied to
the word person therein, as the corresponding words in the French
version unquestionably must be. Here, it is conceded, the Recorder had no more
power to hold the judicial proceeding in question than a citizen of the United
States or of China would have had, or than he, himself, would have had if he
had held his court in New York or Pekin.

It is, therefore, still the law that

no oath whatsoever taken before
persons * * * who are legally authorized to administer some kind of oaths, but
not those which happen to be taken before them * * * can ever amount to perjury
in the eye of the law, because they are of no manner of force, but are
altogether idle. 1 Hawk. P. C. Bk. 1, c. 69, s. 4.

Section 145 of the Code must be restricted to voidable, not to
void, proceedings, to judicial, not to extra judicial oaths as this one was.
And an oath administered at a place without his territorial jurisdiction by an
officer authorized to administer oaths is absolutely void.

The court a quo in its formal judgment seems to rely
upon the fact that the appellant's oath in question was taken before a tribunal
of his own selection. I fail to see how that can affect the question of the
Recorder's jurisdiction, and why the appellant could be convicted of perjury if
any other witness in the

[Page 233]

case could not have been. For the
appellant could not either impliedly or expressly confer upon that magistrate a
jurisdiction which the statute exclusively vests in the magistrates of the
County of Huntingdon When it is the jurisdiction of the person that is
deficient a party who invokes the jurisdiction of a court is not thereafter as
a general rule allowed to question it but that is not so when the court has no
jurisdiction over the subject matter, or has no lawful power to act by reason
of the fact that, as in this case, such power is expressly withheld by the
statute, which expressly decrees (sec. 5561 E. S. Q.) that
no other magistrates than those residing in the county where the trespass was
committed, have jurisdiction over it, thereby in unambiguous terms taking away
from this recorder any jurisdiction that he might perhaps otherwise have had
over the case.

SEDGEWICK, GIROUARD
and DAVIES JJ. concurred in the
judgment dismissing the appeal for the reasons given by his Lordship Mr.
Justice Armour.

MILLS J
(dissenting).—My conclusions in this case are so entirely in accord with those
of Mr. Justice Wûrtèle in the court below that I might
have contented myself with concurring in his opinions, and in the reasoning by
which he has supported them. I accept his views of the law applicable to this case, as he has expressed them; but, as I find that
some of my brethren in this court concur in the judgment of the majority of the
court below, I feel it my duty to state with some degree of fulness the
opinions which I entertain upon the subject.

The principles of the common law in respect to perjury have
long been well settled; but some of the decisions in relation to this offence
lie very close to the

[Page 234]

border line which separates
those cases which have been held to be wilful and corrupt perjury from
another class which may be punished as contempts of court or as misdemeanors,
but which cannot be reached under the law relating to perjury.

Some of the cases in which the parties accused have been
convicted of false swearing have been sometimes questioned, because it was
doubted whether the principles of the law of perjury were strictly applicable,
because when analysed, some of the elements which go to make up the crime of
perjury seemed to be wanting There were nevertheless cases in which the parties
had sworn falsely, and for which the presiding judge felt very strongly that
the offender, in the interest of society, deserved punishment; and so a construction
was given to the law in order that the offender might be reached, which seemed
to go beyond the principles which had been before accepted and acted upon, and
its applicability to these cases was sometimes thought open to question. So,
when it was proposed here to codify the Criminal Law, a section was inserted to
embody the law of these cases, and to remove any doubt, if doubt previously
existed, that they lay within the borders of the crime of perjury, and the law
was made clear, where before it might have been regarded, by a thoughtful
student of its principles as doubtful, by including them within the definition
it only requires an examination of these cases, and the provisions of section
145 of the Code, to see that the framers of the section aimed at making the
definition of perjury cover the whole ground embraced within the decisions of
the courts upon the subject.

I think it is only necessary to consider the system of
jurisprudence as the common law made it, and as those cases extended it in
order to obtain a clear view,

[Page 235]

and to form a right appreciation of the interpretation of
section 145 of the Code. We have to consider, in this case, a question of
perjury committed before a tribunal that had no right whatever to try the cause
then before it; that had no more power to adjudicate upon the question of
trespass where it was laid, than a judge of Quebec would have to try a cause in
the Province of Ontario; and it would require a very clear declaration in the
statute to satisfy me that it was the intention of Parliament to clothe a
self-constituted tribunal that had no existence in law, with the dignity, and
surround it with the protection, which attaches to the proceedings of one
properly created under the authority of the State, for the purpose of
discharging important public duties. We have here a magistrate acting as such
in one county, clothed by the law with the necessary power to act in such
matters only in another county and we have a witness before him in this illegal
and void proceeding, which he had no right to institute, charged with perjury,
and put upon his trial for that offence, and convicted, for testimony given
before one who was wholly without judicial authority, sitting as a court which,
in law, had no legal existence. All the importance, and all the protection
which it is the policy of the law to bestow on the proceedings of a judicial
tribunal, clothed with legal authority, has, by the proceeding in this case,
been extended to one that has neither in fact nor in law, any jurisdiction.

Where a limited tribunal whether that limitation is due to the
fact that the power has been generally withheld or whether it is due to the
fact that it is sitting outside of the territorial limits of its jurisdiction,
takes upon itself to exercise judicial functions which do not belong to it its
decision amounts to nothing, its proceedings are void, there can be no appeal
from

[Page 236]

its judgment, and the false testimony given before it does not
constitute the offence of perjury. ([3])
Yet in this case, it has been held that a false oath taken before one who has
assumed judicial functions which he did not possess, instead of being regarded
as an absolutely void proceeding is nevertheless valid so far as to subject the
witness to punishment for perjury. Such a recognition is altogether at variance
with the settled principles of the criminal law for it gives to the proceedings
of an illegal body the same degree of protection and
dignity that it bestows upon a legal tribunal engaged in the discharge of its
public duties.

No appellate court could, in a civil action, recognize such a
tribunal by entertaining an appeal from its judgment, and no more should any
appellate tribunal recognise the proceedings had before a magistrate sitting as
a judge outside of his territorial jurisdiction, and having no authority in law
to investigate and decide the question in respect to which he has ignorantly
usurped judicial authority. ([4])

There are some cases of false swearing which the common law
regards as perjury; there are some cases of false swearing which cannot
be tried and punished as such. The distinction rests upon well settled
principles of jurisprudence which, in this regard, embody the underlying
principles of the system. What is, and what is not, perjury at common law can
be easily traced and clearly ascertained by its students. But at every step we
observe the line of distinction between law and ethics. Law as Lord Stowell has
well observed has embodied and adopted

[Page 237]

the principles of ethics to a
limited, extent ! it travels with them only a certain distance, and stops
there. You are not at liberty to go further and say the general speculation
would support you in a further progress. It is upon this rule that the law has
defined and limited the crime of perjury; and if we were to extend it, so as to
go beyond the requirements of the State, we might convert a salutary provision,
into a means of vexatious persecution. Care must be taken not to sacrifice
restrictions, justified by experience, to what may be regarded as a commendable
desire to restrain falsehood outside of those matters that are being judicially
investigated. Neither the courts of law nor the bar desire to break down the
distinction recognized, between falsehood sworn to in the course of justice in
a case which is being legally investigated and tried, and falsehood in every
other circumstance The distinction is one made by the law and founded upon
reason and experience, and which has given to the common law, to some extent,
its symmetrical features, and makes it capable of being expounded on principles
of right reason, which were said by its votaries to
be the perfection of the law, and I am not prepared to so interpret an Act of
Parliament as to mar those features, without any adequate reason.

The criminal law never undertook to embrace within its
boundaries the whole field of human conduct and to punish every wrong which one
person might do to another as a crime. A large number of offences have been
left with each individual, within the limits of the law, to redress for
himself. He may decline to deal with a cheat, or to have any intercourse with a
man who has wronged him. The law does not undertake to regulate these matters,
because each person has adequate means of punishing the wrongdoer without
recourse to the law at all. And so there may be many

[Page 238]

moral offences which the law does not punish because the best
interests of society would not be advanced by meddling with them as public
offences.

The courts have undertaken, by their decisions, to draw the
line in respect of false swearing and to determine what false oaths should be
punished as perjury, and what kind of false swearing should not fall within the
limits of that offence.

Perjury (as defined by Hawkins), is
a wilful false oath, by one who being lawfully required. to depose to the truth
in any proceeding in the course of justice swears absolutely, in a matter of
some consequence, to the point in question, whether he be believed or not ([5]).

Mr. Bishop in his work on Criminal Law defines perjury to be

the wilful giving under oath, in a judicial proceeding, or
course of justice, of false testimony material to the issue, or point of
inquiry ([6]).

We have to consider the
tribunal before which an oath is taken; the question of materiality of the
evidence to the issue * the testimony as being false; the intent of the
witness and other matters. The common law required that the oath should be
administered in some judicial proceeding, or course of justice, which must be
taken in the way directed by the law, and before an officer who is legally
authorised to administer it. I do not think that section 145 of our Code has
made any alteration in the law of perjury in this particular. It is generally
admitted that where a statute sets out a form of oath required that the statute
is directory, and will be sufficiently complied with when followed in substance
; so that if what is sworn to is not true, it will not exempt the person taking
it from being convicted for perjury. But if the words of the statute are wholly
disregarded no perjury can be assigned, though the oath should be false. The
first thing to be noted is that the oath must be one required in the

[Page 239]

course of justice, or
in some judicial proceeding, and must be taken substantially as directed by the
law, before an officer authorised to administer it If a party in a cause
becomes a witness for himself under circumstances in which his testimony is not
by the law receivable, it has been held that he may nevertheless, commit
perjury, and this seems to be an extension of his responsibility beyond the
limits which a strict adherence to the principle upon which perjury rests would
warrant; and so, where one is not a legal and competent witness in a case, hut
is nevertheless admitted as a witness by the court and testifies wilfully and
corruptly to what is false, he commits perjury ([7]).
In the United States courts, where the principles of the common law in respect
to crime have been followed it has been held that where one swears falsely as
to his residence, in an application for naturalisation it is not perjury
because the Act of Congress expressly provides that the oath of the applicant
shall, in no case, be allowed to prove his residence and so his own testimony
cannot, under the authority of the law, be a legal part of the proceeding ([8]).

The same principle prevails in the English decisions. In the
case of the Reg. v. Stone ([9])
it was held that where a Master in Chancery had no authority to administer
oaths to witnesses before the Court of Admiralty, the conviction for perjury in
an affidavit used in the Court of Admiralty, but sworn to before a Master in
Chancery, could not be supported.

Pollock C. B. said :

The conviction must be quashed. The
affidavit upon which perjury is assigned is sworn before a Master Extraordinary
in Chancery who has no authority by virtue of his commission to administer an
oath before the Court of Admiralty, nor does the practice of the

[Page 240]

Court
of Admiralty, in an action upon an affidavit so sworn, convey any authority

And Parke B. said:

The authority of a Master in
Chancery has relation entirely to matters before the Court of Chancery.
Although the Court of Chancery may have a certain jurisdiction over the Court
of Admiralty, yet the latter court, acting as a Court of Admiralty, is
independent of the Court of Chancery, and a Master. Extraordinary is not a
person having authority to administer oaths in the Admiralty Court. If a man
knowing the practice of the court uses an affidavit sworn in this manner,
knowing it to be false, he is guilty of contempt of court, but it is not
perjury.

In the case of The Queen v. Tyson ([10]) the question
of the materiality of the evidence came before the Court for Crown Cases
Reserved. One Sullivan was tried for robbery. Tyson swore that ¡Sullivan had
lived in a certain house for the last two years and that he had never been
absent from it more than two nights during that time. The Warden at the House
of Correction at Wandsworth was called as a witness in the case and testified
that the ""prisoner Sullivan was in the prison at Wandsworth during twelve
months of the time that Tyson had sworn that he was elsewhere. Kelly C. B. said
:

The real question is whether these
statements were material. We all agree that they were, as they tended to render
more probable the truth of the first allegation,

Bramwell B. said :

The witness was asked his reason
for remembering, and thereupon he proceeded to state those circumstances which
made him competent to swear to the cardinal matter. One of these circumstances
is untrue : why is that not perjury?

Lush J. said :

I was embarrassed at first; but now
I am quite satisfied that the allegations on which the prisoner was convicted
were calculated to make the jury give a readier credit to the substantial part
of his evidence and therefore became material.

[Page 241]

In this case the materiality of what is sworn to does not
depend on its intrinsic importance in respect to the facts of the case, but
upon the purpose for which it was sworn to. ([11])

In the case of the Queen v. Smith, ([12]) reported in
the same volume as Tue Queen v. Tyson ([13]) the prisoner
was convicted for perjury alleged to have been committed on the hearing of an
information before two Justices of the Peace, on an application for an order of
affiliation. The prisoner was tried before Cockburn C. J. at the Leicester
Assizes for perjury which was alleged to have been committed upon the hearing
of an application for an order as stated The information laid by the mother was
duly proved; and it was shown that the putative father appeared before the
Justices, and evidence was given on both sides. The court held that the father
having appeared, and not having made any objections to the summons, it was not
necessary to refer to it, or give any evidence of its existence on the trial
for perjury. It was proved that Mee appeared before
the Justices, and that upon the hearing of the information, the evidence, which
was the subject matter of the indictment, was given by Smith who was called as
a witness by Mee; but the summons was not produced on
the trial of ¡Smith nor was secondary evidence given of its contents, nor was
it proved that such summons had been served on Mee. Kelly
C. B. delivered the judgment of the court. He said :

In this case though there was no summons produced, the
information was put in and proved, and it was shown that, upon the hearing of
the information before the justices evidence on both sides was given, and that
the prisoner gave the evidence which was the subject matter of the indictment
for perjury. Was there any necessity to produce the summons? The original
object of the summons was to bring Mee into court. He
did appear and no objection was then

[Page 242]

made to the summons. There was no necessity at the trial for perjury
to refer to it and, therefore, it was unnecessary to give any evidence of it.

In the same volume the case of the Queen v. Fletcher
([14])
is reported. Here Jane Beswick made a deposition upon oath, and the question
was whether, in order to give the magistrate jurisdiction in the case, there
should be a deposition in writing upon oath. The case had been tried at the
Assizes in the county of Derby, before Cleasby B. In the judgment of the Court
of Crown Cases Reserved, Boville C. J. said :

The
objection now taken is that the summons was irregularly issued, because there
was no sufficient deposition on oath before it was issued. It has been
suggested that under the section in question (7 & 8 Vict. c. 101 s. 3)
there must be a written statement on
oath—in fact an affidavit—by the woman but I think at any rate an oral
statement, taken down in writing in the usual way in which depositions are
taken, must be sufficient» Jervis' Act being later in time, can not apply here,
but certainly more than that Act prescribes cannot be required. The second Act
referred to (8 Vict c 10, s. 1), does not affect the case. That
Act only says that proceedings according to the forms in the schedule or to the
like tenor and effect shall be valid and sufficient; it does not say that these
forms must be used. Then, if all that the Act requires be that the magistrates
shall make a record of the evidence orally given, the summons itself seems to
me very like a writing to the same tenor and effect with a form of deposition
in the schedule of the second Act.

The Chief Justice after referring to the case of the Queen v.
Berry, ([15])
goes on to say :

The
case was therefore precisely the same as the present; and all the judges
composing the court, except my brother Martin, after taking time to consider,
held that the conviction ought to be affirmed? on the ground that the defendant
by appearing and not objecting had waived any irregularity in the issue of the
summons.

And Blackburn J. said, after discussing certain features of
the case *

If
either of these things be omitted, it is an irregularity for which the
magistrate or his clerk is blameable, but it does not oust the jurisdiction I
think if these things were left out
altogether the proceeding on the summons would none the less be good. But however
this

[Page 243]

may be, the irregularity may be and was waived by the dépendant’s appearing and not objecting.

In the case of the Queen
v. Johnson ([16]),
the perjnry alleged was committed by false oaths taken before one Thomas Deane,
who held an inquest as deputy coroner touching* the death of one Owen O'Hanlon.
By 6 & 7 Vict. c. 83, s. 1, it is made lawful for any coroner of any county, city, riding, liberty or division, and he is
thereby directed, by writing under his hand and seal to nominate and appoint,
from time to time, a fit and proper person, such appointment being subject to
the approval of the Lord High Chancellor, Lord keeper, or Lord Commissioners of
the Great Seal, to act for him as his deputy in the holding of inquests; and
all inquests taken and other acts performed by any such deputy coroner, under
or by virtue of any such appointment, shall be deemed, and taken to all intents
and purposes whatsoever to be, the acts and deeds of the coroner by whom such
appointment was made. Provided also that no such deputy shall act for any such
coroner as aforesaid except it were through the illness of the said coroner, or
during his absence from any lawful and reasonable cause. In this case it was
contended, on behalf of the prisoner, that the proceeding before the said
Thomas Deane was coram, non judice, because
it was incumbent on the prosecution, in order to show jurisdiction in a deputy
coroner, to administer an oath, to prove affirmatively that there was lawful
and reasonable cause for the absence of the coroner and that the facts here did
not amount to any evidence of such cause. He also contended that the question
was one for the jury, and not for the judge. The counsel for the Crown argued
that even if the facts proved were insufficient to show that there was lawful
or

[Page 244]

reasonable cause ¡still inasmuch as by section 2 of the same
Act it is provided that the inquisitions are not to be quashed by reason of
their having been taken by deputy, the oath on which perjury was assigned being
an oath on which a good inquisition might have been founded could not be said
to be coram non judice, but
was one legally administered in a judicial proceeding, and, therefore, one on
which perjury could be legally assigned. The first question of law reserved for
the opinion of the court was, whether it was incumbent upon the prosecution to
make out that there was lawful or reasonable
cause for the absence of the coroner from the inquest in question. If not the
conviction would stand.

The second question reserved was whether it was for the judge
or jury to decide the question of reasonable cause. If for the jury the
conviction must be quashed, unless the first question was decided in the
negative. If for the judge, then the third question reserved was whether there
was evidence upon which the learned judge might properly decide as he did. If
so the conviction would stand. If not it must be quashed, unless the first
question was decided in the negative. The court were of opinion that the
conviction should be affirmed. They held that it was clearly for the judge to
determine the question of the existence of reasonable and lawful cause for the
coroner's absence.

In Caudle v Seymour ([17]) a warrant
issued by justices was held bad which did not show any information upon oath
upon which it had been issued. Coleridge J. said, during the argument :

A man has no
right, because he is a magistrate
to order another to be taken for an
offence over which he has jurisdiction without a charge regularly made.

[Page 245]

In the Case of Turner v.
The Postmaster General ([18]),
parties were apprehended, and. brought before a magistrate charged with
setting fire to the letters in the pillar box. On their appearance at the Petty
Sessions to answer the charges after witnesses had been examined, and
cross-examined, they were, at the application of a prosecutor, remanded on bail
for a week. At the adjourned sessions the attorney for the prosecution stated
that he should proceed against the appellants under the statute 24 & 25
Vict. ch. 97 s. 52 and asked their attorneys whether they would plead guilty to
such a charge, or whether further evidence should be offered and supported;
they answered that he must go on and prove his case. He called witnesses, and
when the case for the prosecution was closed the appellants' counsel objected
that no information on oath had been taken, as the statute required, and the
appellants were not found committing the offence, and were not legally in
custody, and therefore the justices had no jurisdiction to convict them for the
offence then charged. The offence with which the appellants were first charged
was a felony; the offence of which they were convicted was punishable on
summary conviction. The court held that the want of information and summons was
cured by the appearance of the appellants before the justices, and that they
had waived the objection that they were not legally in custody on the charge
under section 52, and, therefore, the justices had jurisdiction to convict
them. But on both occasions of their appearance before the justices the facts
alleged against them were the same, . and though they were brought up to
discharge their bail, other circumstances show that they appeared voluntarily
on this charge; the magistrates were, there

[Page 246]

fore, justified in convicting them on the charge which had
been so made and heard. Cockburn C. J. said :

All that they could have asked for
was, that in point of strict form the evidence should have been taken again on
the first charge, and that evidence in support of that charge only should be
received. Practically, that was done. They were irregularly brought before the
magistrate. In strictness, they were entitled to insist that there should be
information and summons, but they waived that, and crossexamined the witnesses
and exercised all their rights as defendants on the first charge; after that,
they can not object that the justice had no jurisdiction to convict them
summarily.

In the cases where there has been a waiver of some irregularity
in the mode of summoning which was used, (it is perhaps hardly correct to
use the expression waiver), a justice can only proceed lawfully where he has
jurisdiction, and the jurisdiction may be given by the appearance of the party,
before the judge, to answer the charge. The jurisdiction may not depend upon
the warrant; this may be improperly issued, but if the accused party appears
before the magistrate without objection, he can hardly after a regular inquiry,
and after an order for his commitment, take objection to the fact by complaining
that he has not been brought regularly before the justices. In the case of the Queen
v. Hughes ([19]),
the charge was made orally that Hughes had sworn falsely and corruptly. The
warrant is not the charge, it is a means of procuring the attendance of Hughes
to answer it. And the want of an information on summons might be cured by the
appearance of Hughes. It is the duty of the magistrate to take all charges, of
whatsoever nature, kind or connection they may be, in writing, and this, Lord
Mansfield says, is an indispensable duty.

In the case of the Queen v. Hughes (1), Lopes J.
thought the warrant was a mere process for bringing the party complained of
before the justices, and had

[Page 247]

nothing to do with the question of their jurisdiction. Hawkins
J. said :

I
have assumed as a fact, from the case taken, that Stanley was arrested and
brought before the justices upon as illegal a warrant as ever was issued. A
warrant signed by a magistrate, not only without any information or oath to
justify it, but without any information at all. It follows that the magistrate
who issued the warrant, and the defendant who with knowledge of its illegality
executed it, were liable for an action for false imprisonment. He was brought
into the presence of a magistrate to answer a charge which, up to that moment,
had never been legally preferred against him. Before those magistrates, and in
his presence, the charge was made, over which, if duly made, they had
jurisdiction. Upon that charge and in support of it it was that the defendant
was sworn and in giving his evidence swore corruptly and falsely * * * They
convicted him of an offence with which he had never legally been charged. In
this, I am of opinion they were wrong; and upon this ground I am strongly
inclined to think the conviction may be quashed,

It would be contrary to the settled rule, recognised in the
interpretation of statutes, to make any alteration in the Common Law further or
otherwise than the Act under consideration expressly declares (1) and I do not think
that section 145  of the Criminal Code  has made so radical a departure in the
common law rule, as to make a false oath in a judicial proceeding, before one
having no authority, wilful and corrupt perjury. This section begins with a
definition of perjury, and it then states the circumstances under which it may
be committed.

By section 145, perjury is defined to be

an
assertion as to a matter of fact, opinion, belief or knowledge, made by a
witness in a judicial proceeding, as a part of his evidence, upon oath or affirmation, whether such evidence is given in open court, or by
affidavit, or otherwise, and whether such evidence is material or not such
assertion being known to such witness to be false, and being intended by him to
mislead the court, jury, or person holding the proceeding.

[Page 248]

Evidence in this section includes
evidence given on the voir dire, and evidence given before a Grand Jury.
This is the first part of the section. It is necessary that the witness be a
witness in a judicial proceeding. There are two departures from the common law
rule; the first is that one may be convicted of perjury on immaterial evidence
and the second relates to the voir dire * the old rule was that an
untrue statement which was not material could not subject the one who gave it
to conviction of perjury and one who is examined on the voir dire could
not be contradicted, as the question of competence was a collateral question.
Subsection 2 of section 145 reads :

That
every person is a witness within the meaning of this section who actually gives
his evidence, whether he is competent to
be a witness or not and. whether his evidence was admissible or not

This subsection does not enlarge the boundaries of the common
law jurisdiction but is in strict accordance with the precedents which embrace
the principle here laid down.

Subsection 3 is as follows :

Every
proceeding is judicial within the meaning of this section which is held in or
under the authority of any Court of Justice, or before a Grand Jury or before
either the Senate or House of Commons in Canada or any Committee of either the
Senate or House of Commons, or before any Legislative Council, Legislative
Assembly, or House of Assembly, or any Committee thereof empowered by law to
administer an oath or before any Justice of the Peace or any Arbitrator or
Umpire or any person or body of persons, authorised by law or by any statute in
force for the time being, to make an inquiry, and take evidence therein on oath
or before any legal tribunal by which any legal right or liability can be
established, or before any person acting as a Court, Justice, or Tribunal,
having power to hold such judicial proceeding, whether duly competent or not,
or whether the proceeding is duly instituted or not, before such Courts or
person, so as to authorise it or him to hold a proceeding, and although such
proceeding was held in a wrong place, or was otherwise invalid.

I omit from consideration the provisions of this subsection
relating to perjury committed before any of

[Page 249]

the legislative bodies or committees thereof, empowered to
take evidence upon oath, and look solely at those provisions relating to perjury committed in respect to evidence taken before the
other parties described in this subsection. Now it will be seen that, leaving out legislative bodies with their committees, the section deals
only with evidence taken in judicial proceedings, before persons legally
competent to hold them, for the purpose for which the proceeding is had. A
definition is given of what a judicial proceeding is within the meaning of this
section * it is a Justice of the Peace Arbitrator, Umpire, or any person or
body of persons, authorised by law or by any statute in force for the time
being, to make inquiry and to take evidence therein upon oath. In other words,
any of the parties mentioned must be authorised by law to exercise jurisdiction
over the subject matter of the inquiry, and to take the evidence of witnesses
upon oath. The proceeding must be a legal proceeding, having the sanction of
the law behind it * but beside these the proceeding may be before any legal
tribunal by which any legal right or liability can be established, or before
any person acting as a court, justice or tribunal, having power to hold such
judicial proceeding. if he has such power, then any irregularity in the
constitution of the court, or any irregularity in the proceedings of the court,
as in the common law cases to which I have referred, will not exempt one who
has been duly sworn and has given false testimony from being convicted of
perjury, but there is nothing in any part of this section which would surround
with like protection the proceedings of one who is not a Justice of the Peace,
or one who is not clothed with judicial authority and who is not authorised to
make an inquiry with the sanctions which attach to the proceedings of a legally
constituted court.

[Page 250]

I, therefore, hold that the decision of the court below should
be reversed and that Drew should he discharged, as not legally guilty of the
crime of perjury for which he stands convicted.

The judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by

ARMOUR J.—The
defendant charged one Benjamin J. Rowe before L. J. Papineau, the
recorder of the Town of Salaberry, of Valleyfield, with having entered upon his
land without his permission contrary to the provision of article 5551 of the
Revised Statutes of Quebec.

This charge was, by article 5561 of the said statutes, made
cognizable before one or more justices of the peace, but such justices should
only have jurisdiction when they resided in the county in which the offence had
been committed.

The offence charged was committed in the County of Huntingdon,
and the recorder, although ex justice of the peace
in and for the district of Beauharnois, in which district the County of
Huntingdon was situate, did not reside in the County of Huntingdon, but in the
County of Beauharnois.

The defendant was convicted of perjury committed by him upon
the hearing of the said charge and the question is whether or not he was
rightly convicted, the recorder not having jurisdiction over the offence
charged.

And this question is determinable by determining whether or no
the hearing of this charge by the recorder was a judicial proceeding within the
meaning of that phrase as used in section 145  of the Criminal Code , which
provides that every proceeding is judicial within the meaning of that section
which is held

[Page 251]

before
any person acting as a court, justice or tribunal having power to hold such
judicial proceeding whether duly constituted or not, and whether the proceeding
was duly instituted or not before such court or person so as to authorise it or him to hold the proceeding and
although such proceeding was held in a wrong place or was otherwise invalid

The recorder was a justice, hut
in hearing the said charge he was not a justice having power to hold such judicial
proceeding, but he was acting as a justice having power to hold such judicial
proceeding and his hearing the said charge was, therefore, a judicial
proceeding within the meaning of that phrase as used in section 145  of the
Criminal Code  and the defendant was rightly convicted.

The provision above quoted was
taken from section 119 of the draft code prepared by the Royal Commissioners
appointed to consider the law relating to indictable offences and with respect
to such section the commissioners said in their report that

in
framing section 119 we have proceeded on the principle that the guilt and
danger of perjury consist in attempting by falsehood to mislead a tribunal de facto exercising judicial
functions. It seems to us not desirable
that a person who has done this should escape from punishment if he
can show some defect in the constitution of the tribunal which he
sought to mislead or some error in the proceedings themselves

And the recorder was, in
hearing the said charge, a tribunal de facto exercising judicial functions.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME
COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Finding of jury—New trial—Principal
and agent—Qualification of juror—Waiver of objection—Written contract—Collateral
agreement by parol.

An agent employed to sell a
mine for a commission failed to effect a sale but brought action based on a
verbal collateral agreement by the owner to pay "" expenses "" or
"" expenses and compensation "" in case of failure. The jury found in
answer to a question by the judge that "" we believe there was a promise of
fair treatment in case of no sale.""

Held, reversing the judgment in appeal (9 B. C Rep. 303),
Taschereau C. J. and Killam J. dissenting, that this finding did not establish
the collatlral agreement but was, if anything, opposed to it and the real issue
not having been passed upon there must be a new trial.

If a juror on the trial of a
cause is allowed without challenge to act as such on a subsequent trial, that
is not per se a ground for setting aside the verdict on the latter.

APPEAL from a decision of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia[1]
refusing to set aside a verdict for the plaintiff and order a new trial.

The plaintiffs, whose action has
been thrice tried, claimed from defendant their expenses and compensation for
endeavouring to sell a coal mine for the latter who by a written agreement
promised them five

[Page 229]

per cent commission. He failed to
effect a sale but based his action on the ground that his failure was caused by
defendant's interference. He obtained a verdict which was set aside and a new
trial ordered on which the claim was amended by adding a claim on an alleged
collateral and verbal contract to pay expenses in case of no sale. This second
trial resulted in a nonsuit which was set aside by the full court and a third
trial ordered[2] which
the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed.[3]. The
third trial resulted in a verdict for plaintiff which the full court sustained
and the defendant appealed.

The principal questions at issue
on this appeal are stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Davies
now reported.

Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper
K.C. for the appellant. We contend
that the fact that one of the jurors sat on a former trial is a good ground for
challenge, and that this can be taken advantage of after verdict, because that
ground of challenge was not known to the defendant at the time of the last
trial. Archbold Q. B. Practice (ed. 1885) p. 619; 1 Coke, Littleton, p. 157b,
"" challenge propter affectum;"" Blackstone (Lewis ed.) vol. 3,
p. 363 ; Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown, vol. 2, p. 577 ; Thompson on Trials, vol.
1, sec. 68 ; Argent v. Darrell[4]
; Bacon's Abridgement, vol. 9, p. 598. There can be no waiver where the party
had no knowledge of the ground of challenge ; Thompson on Trials, sec. 114 (ed.
1399). Herbert v. Shaw[5]
; Earl of Falmouth v. Roberts[6]
; Peermain v. Mackay [7].

The finding of the jury upon the
main point is really a finding in appellant's favour; or if that is too broad a
statement, it is clear that the jury have dis-

[Page 230]

regarded what was the only
evidence they could possibly have found upon. They expressly state that their
verdict is founded upon evidence which did not and could not bear upon the
issue found. They answered: ""In view of concessions made subsequently, we
believe there was a promise of fair treatment in case of no sale."" On this
all-important point they find their verdict, not because they believed the only
real evidence upon the point, but in consequence of "" subsequent
concessions."" The general verdict does not affect the question; the jury
might have declined to answer questions, but they did not, and their answers
are a part of the verdict. They find the general verdict because they have come
to certain conclusions regardless of the evidence.

The special findings are
incomplete, inconclusive and contradictory both to each other and to the
verdict, and upon the findings, the defendant is entitled to have a verdict or
judgment entered for her in spite of the added general verdict in plaintiffs'
favour. The jury only give the plaintiffs compensation for expenses incurred by
them and for nothing else, although they sued also for compensation for work
and labour. The verdict must, therefore, be taken to negative the claim
actually made by the plaintiff Harris in his evidence for work and services,
although according to his evidence his whole claim depended on the one promise.
Cobban Manufacturing Co. v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[8]
; McQuay v. Eastwood[9],
at page 406. They do not find as a fact that there was a distinct agreement by
the defendant to pay compensation made "" some time in the middle of the
year 1890."" The jury did not credit the evidence of the plaintiff Harris,
and a promise of "" fair treatment"" does not impose any legal

[Page 231]

responsibility upon the
defendant. See the remarks of McColl C.J. in this case[10],
at page 513 of the report on the trial, also Taylor v. Brewer[11]
; In re Vince[12]
; Croasdaile v. Hall[13]
; Briggs v. Newswander[14].
Moreover, there is no evidence whatever of any promise of fair treatment. The
evidence of the plaintiff, Harris, was directed to proving a different contract
entirely, and the jury have not seen fit to believe him ; nor is there any
allegation in the pleadings of any such contract. The jury clearly ignore the evidence
of Harris that he was promised compensation for his time spent in endeavouring
to sell the mine. The special findings are not consistent with a general
finding in plaintiffs' favour, and entitle the defendant at least to a new
trial. Where, from their answers it can be seen that the jury proceeded wrongly
in coming to their verdict, or have found without proper or sufficient
evidence, the verdict cannot stand. Yorkshire Banking Co. v. Beatson
& Mycock[15]
, per Denman J., at p. 206, and in 5 C. P. D. 109, at pp. 126, 127 ; Hutchison
v. Bowker[16]
; Gordon v. Denison[17].

The evidence is such that the
jury, viewing the whole of it reasonably could not properly find a verdict for
the plaintiffs, and a verdict for the defendant or judgment for her should have
been entered by the trial judge; or at all events a new trial should be
directed. Metropolitan Ry. Co. v. Wright[18]
; Webster v. Friedeberg[19]
; Ferrand v. Bingley Local Board[20]
; Allcock v. Hall[21]
; Hiddle v. National

[Page 232]

Fire &c. Ins. Co.[22] ; Campbell v. Cole[23]
; Grieve v. Molsons Bank[24].
The right to a new trial is not confined to cases where the jury have been
""perverse"" or have ""misconducted themseves."" Per Morris
L.J. in Jones v. Spencer[25]
at p. 538. This right is not affected by the fact that two juries had found for
plaintiff. Daun v. Simmins[26]
.

The following cases are in point
respecting a mistrial by reason of a juror having sat on a former trial. Barrett
v. Long[27],
at pp. 405, 414-415 ; Bailey v. Macaulay[28]
at page 829.

The rule respecting the Privy
Council interfering with verdicts said to be against the weight of evidence is
referred to in Lambkin v. South Eastern Rway. Co.[29]
; Archambault v. Archambault[30]
; and shews that the two courts referred to are appellate courts, and not the
finding of the trial court and one appellate court. Compare Black v. Walker[31]
; Headford v. McClary Mfg. Co.[32]
; North British Mercantile Insurance Co. v. Tourville[33]
; Lefeunteum v. Beaudoin[34]
; City of Montreal v. Cadieux[35]
; Russell v. Lefrancois[36]
. It is the duty of the final court of appeal to review the decisions of the
lower courts where they turn on proper inferences to be drawn from the evidence
; Arpin v. The Queen[37]
; Hunter v. Corbett[38]
; Sutherland v. Black[39]
; and Smith v. McKay[40]
, at page 613.

Bodwell K.C. for the respondents. As to the juror who sat on the
previous trial, the knowledge of his

[Page 233]

disqualification must be imputed
to the defendant and we must assume that she waived the objection. Brown
v. Sheppard[41]
.

The question at issue was one for
the jury altogether and rested entirelyupon the credibility of the witnesses.
The jury has chosen to believe Harris, and they are the sole judges. Dublin,
Wicklow & Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slatter y[42]
at pages 1201 and 1202 ; Commissioner of Railways v. Brown[43]
; Australian Newspaper Company v. Bennett[44]
; Dunsmuir v. Lowenberg, Harris & Co.[45].
The jury intended to give a general verdict; they answered the questions out of
deference to the expressed opinion of the Judge that they should do so, but it
is clear from all circumstances that they did not intend that these questions
should constitute their verdict. To establish the contention by the other side
that the questions are contradictory, and that the findings shew that the jury
had gone upon the wrong principle, the appellant must shew that the answers are
so framed as to be destructive of the verdict as a matter of law. All the
authorities cited by the appellant when examined establish this. But the
answers are entirely consistent with the general verdict. The answer to the
first question is simply a statement of the process of reasoning by which the
jury arrived at their conclusion, and is, in fact, an adoption by the verdict
of the exact case made by the plaintiff on his evidence. The alleged written
contract was merely a written instruction which contained a statement of the
proposed price and terms, but was intended to be subject to variations by
Harris using his best endeavors to effect a sale, should he be unable to find a
purchaser on those terms.

[Page 234]

Even if the court should think
that a different inference might have been properly drawn by the jury from the
facts in evidence, it should refuse a new trial on the ground that so many
trials have taken place and so many juries have pronounced in the plaintiff's
favor. Wight v. Moody[46]
at pp. 502 and 506; Pender v. War Eagle Con. M. & D. Co.[47].
New trials have been persistently refused against the opinions of the courts
below. The latest of a long series of decisons in this direction being :—
Rowan v. Toronto Ry. Co.[48]
; Fraser v. Drew[49].
The only cases where contrary rulings have been made are easily
distinguishable. They are Hardman v. Putnam[50],
where there was gross misdirection, the judge charging on the question of fraud
which had not been raised in the pleadings; and Griffiths v.
Boscowitz[51]
also a case of misdirection and refusal to make a direction. In Cowans v.
Marshall[52],
there was also a misdirection and the jury failed to make any finding and no
proof was made as to the particular act of negligence charged against the defendant.
In Peters v. Hamilton[53]
the court below was reversed on an order for a new trial and blamed for it.

This court has consistently held
that reversals on mere questions of fact should not be made in the appellate
courts unless there were findings so clearly erroneous as to shock a reasonable
mind. Bellechase Election Case[54]

Montmorency & Charlevois Railway Co. v. Mathieu[71]
; Bowker v. Laumeister[72] ; Bickford
v. Howard[73], and
cases there cited by Taschereau J. Where there is conflicting testimony the
findings of the trial judge are decisive: Grasett v. Carter[74].
In Parker v. Montreal City Passenger Ry. Co.[75],
this court reversed the judgment appealed from and restored the findings of
fact and the judgment of the trial court because such findings ought not to
have been interfered with. This decision was affirmed by the Privy Council
which refused leave to appeal precisely because the issues were upon the
findings as to fact[76]. In
The Santanderino v. VanVert[77],
followed in The Reliance v. Conwell[78],
it was held that even in doubtful cases findings of fact ought not to be
interfered with. In the Village of Granby v. Menard[79],
the evidence was contradictory, and Girouard J., with whom all the judges

[Page 236]

concurred, set out the
jurisprudence very fully. The findings of fact by the trial judge were restored
in the face of adverse holdings by two appellate courts. This case was followed
in The Reliance v. Conwell[80].
In Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Weegar[81]
, all the judges (see texts) held that findings of jury supported on a first
appeal ought not to be disturbed, King J. going so far as to say that the
findings bound this court (at p. 427), and Gwynne J. stating the same thing
practically in his remarks. In Toronto Railway Co. v. Balfour[82]
, this court refused to interfere in a matter of procedure as to whether a
verdict was special or general and refused to disturb a verdict as against
weight of evidence after affirmance by the first court of appeal.

We distinguish the following
cases :— North British and Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Tourville[83]
, was a case of mixed law and fact depending on an inference of fraud to be
drawn from evidence, but the rule as to finality on mere findings of fact is
there specially approved, at page 191 by Taschereau J. Lefeunteum v.
Beaudoin[84],
depended upon the admissibility of evidence and its appreciation. In The
City of Montreal v. Cadieux[85]
an exorbitant rate of remuneration had been allowed based on a corrupt system
previously in vogue and thus it appears a great injustice had been caused to
the ratepayers. It was not a jury case. (See p. 623 of report.) Taschereau J.
very strongly dissented, citing high authority at p 619. See also Bentley v.
Peppard[86].

THE CHIEF JUSTICE dissented from
the judgment allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial.

[Page 237]

SEDGEWICK J.—I agree with the
judgment prepared by my brother Davies, but I wish to add that in my view the
evidence overwhelmingly preponderates in favour of the appellant, and that upon
that ground also the judgment of the court below should be reversed.

DAVIES J.—This was an appeal from
the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia refusing an application
made by the appellant for a new trial. The action was tried before Mr. Justice
Walkem and a special jury who returned a verdict for the respondents for
$9,667.62. The case has been long before the courts and is now for the second
time on appeal before us. This appeal has been twice argued, the second
argument becoming necessary owing to the deaths of two of the judges who sat
during the first hearing. The action was begun in 1894 and was originally
brought to recover damages for the alleged prevention by the appellant of the
sale of her colleries in British Columbia which she had entrusted to Harris, a
member of the plaintiffs' firm to dispose of on certain terms. Large damages
were awarded plaintiffs by the jury, but on appeal the full court set aside the
verdict and ordered a new trial. At the second trial before the late Chief
Justice McColl, and after the plaintiffs' claim as originally formulated had
been amended by adding a claim on the alleged supplemental contract to pay all
expenses in case no sale was effected, a non-suit was entered, but this was
reversed by the full Court of British Columbia and a new trial ordered. . On
appeal to this court by the present appellants it was held that there was legal
and admissible evidence of a parol agreement supplemental to both the
commissions to sell the colleries—to that of the 18th of January, 1892, as well
as that of the 18th September, 1890—making

[Page 238]

provision for a case which the
written agreement did not contemplate. The appeal, therefore, was dismissed and
the order for a new trial confirmed, but upon this one ground alone. The then
Chief Justice who delivered the judgment of this court expressed his own strong
opinion that there was no evidence whatever of the original case made by the
respondents, that of undue interference with them by the appellant in their
efforts to make a sale, and stated that as the order for the new trial in the
court below proceeded upon this ground exclusively, had there been nothing else
in the case the appeal ought to have succeeded.

At the third trial a great mass
of testimony was again given in support of the original case, but the verdict
of the jury was limited to findings in plaintiffs' favour on the alleged
collateral agreement. I am of the opinion that this is the only branch of his
case on which under the evidence the plaintiffs could possibly succeed and I
mention the fact because, if the cause is again tried before a jury, I think
the evidence should be confined to that one branch of the case, and a large
amount of irrelevant evidence bearing on the claim for damages for alleged undue
interference with the respondents in their efforts to make a sale of the
colleries eliminated.

The appellants seek to set aside
the last verdict on several grounds. In the view I take of the case however it
is unnecessary for me to do more than deal with one of them, though I am quite
in accord with the judgment of the full Court of British Columbia in holding
that the fact of one of the jurors at this hearing having also sat on one of
the former trials, is not per se a ground for disturbing the verdict.
Under the practice in British Columbia the appellant had a double opportunity
of challenging this juror and not having exercised her right at the proper time
or given 

[Page 239]

satisfactory reasons for her
neglect cannot now, when the verdict has gone against her, be heard upon the
point.

The main questions in the appeal
however, are, first: Was there any evidence to go to the jury of the collateral
agreement to pay the respondent Harris his ""expenses"" or
""compensation and expenses"" in case there was no sale of the
collieries ? And if so, have the jury found that there was such an agreement ?
I agree that there was evidence on the point which it was the duty of the judge
to submit to the jury and am unable to concur in the contention of the
appellant's counsel that the weight
of the evidence was so strongly against the plaintiff that the defendant was
entitled to have judgment entered for her non obstante veredicto. It is not a question of the preponderance of the
testimony, nor is it a question of how this court would find if the matter was open to them. The conduct
and demeanour of the witnesses and the credibility and weight to be attached to
their statements together with the correspondence and other written testimony,
were matters peculiarly within the exclusive province of the jury, and if they
had found one way or the other upon the issue this court would not, under the circumstances, have entered a judgment against
their finding. But in my opinion there has not been any finding upon the only
substantial issue open to the jury to find upon. The real dispute has not been
tried, or, if tried, has not been passed upon by the jury. The learned judge
told the jury that they could bring in a general verdict, but that he would
leave certain specific questions to them in order the more clearly to determine
the actual facts. The jury were not bound under the laws of British Columbia to
answer these questions, but they acted upon the 

[Page 240]

advice of the judge and did so.
The first question was:

Did the defendant, Mrs.
Dunsmuir, authorize the plaintiff, say in the middle of 1890, to ""do his
best"" to sell her mine, and if so, was any compensation mentioned at the
time ?

Their answer was:

In view of concessions made
subsequently, we believe there was a promise of fair treatment in case of no
sale.

The question might possibly have
been more definite and clear and have asked the jury to answer whether there
was any verbal promise made by Mrs. Dunsmuir to Harris, on either of the
occasions when the written commissions to sell the collieries were given or
after the giving of either of such commissions to pay or allow Harris any and
what compensation in case he failed to effect a sale. That was the vital point
of the case on the answer to which the verdict depended. The onus of proving
any such supplemental contract lay upon the plaintiff. He cannot recover unless
the jury first find that such a supplemental promise or contract was in fact
made. Now reading the answer the jury gave to the question put to them it will be
seen that they carefully refrain from finding the existence of the alleged
supplemental agreement or promise. All they find is a promise of fair treatment
and that finding they base upon certain expressed reasons. Reasons for their
finding they were not bound to give, and indeed it would have been better if
they had not given any, because those they have given have been the subject of
much pertinent criticism. But apart from their reasons which may appear more or
less cogent or relevant, they failed to give either an affirmative or a
negative answer to the question, or indeed any answer from which the court
could properly infer the existence of the agreement or promise relied upon.

[Page 241]

The promise found of "" fair
treatment in case of no sale "" has no evidence whatever to support it, and
strictly speaking if it amounts to anything is a finding against the specific
collateral agreement plaintiff alleged had been come to and which he had either
to prove or in case of failure suffer defeat. Whether there was or was not a
promise of fair treatment in case of no sale was not an issue between the
parties at all. If it was, a serious question which was raised by appellant's
counsel had to be answered, namely, whether such a promise is capable of being
enforced or given effect to. What is fair treatment, and who is to determine it
? Such a question however need not be discussed now. The plaintiff did not
claim, and no evidence whatever pointed to, any such promise. The plaintiff,
Harris, said in one place he was promised his "" expenses and a fair
remuneration "", and in another place "" his expenses ""
in case no sale was effected by him. The plaintiff's evidence was the only
evidence offered in support of the agreement. The defendant denied it Much
collateral evidence was given to shew that such a promise was not and could not
have been made. But the issue was plain and square and the jury were bound to
find one way or the other. They did not do so but on the contrary found the
promise was one of "" fair treatment "" only. As I have already said
neither party contended this was the promise and no evidence supported it. In
fact, in my opinion, the evidence as a whole strongly preponderated in
defendant's favour on the point at issue. The jury's general verdict was a sympathetic
one, but not one which could be upheld on such a special finding as they made.
If the general verdict had stood alone it might be supported possibly on the
ground that the jury had preferred to believe Harris rather than accept the
evidence against him.

[Page 242]

But no such contention can
prevail in the face of the specific finding they have come to.

The real issue not having
therefore been passed upon or found one way or the other, the verdict cannot
stand and there must be a new trial.

In view of the strong expressions
of opinion that we have felt bound to give of the uselessness of the mass of
evidence given with reference to the claim as originally framed, and of the
fact that the issue is a simple and square one, was the promise made by the
defendant to Harris as he alleges in case there was no sale, it is to be hoped
that the evidence on the new trial can be materially lessened.

The learned counsel for the
appellant contended very strenuously that some evidence had been wrongfully
admitted and some excluded, and also that sufficient proof had not been given
by plaintiff of his actual expenditure. It is obvious however that these
questions do not in view of our decision require treatment at our hands now.
They may safely be left to the tribunal, which will now dispose, I hope
finally, of this much litigated dispute. 

The appeal will be allowed with
costs in this Court and in the full Court of British Columbia.

NESBITT J.—I concur with the
judgment prepared by my brother Davies, with the additional observations by my
brother Sedgewick.

KILLAM J.—In my opinion the
appeal should be dismissed.

While a perusal of the printed
report of the case naturally leads one to seriously doubt the correctness of
the verdict, I do not think that the court should interfere with it.

[Page 243]

This court has already decided
that, upon practically the same evidence for the plaintiff, there was a case
for the jury. It was still so after the evidence for the defence was given.

The jury's finding that there was
a promise of fair treatment in case of no sale is, of course, not a finding of
a fact raising a liability by implication of law, but such a promise would
warrant, I think, the inference of an agreement to remunerate, justifying a
verdict for the plaintiff.

In this case, it was not a
question of entering a judgment upon special findings, but there was a verdict
involving the necessary inference.

I am not prepared to say that the
verdict is so clearly unreasonable as to warrant its being set aside.

Appeal allowed with
costs.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Phuong Thu Thi Pham pleaded guilty on the day of her trial to an offence that on 19 May 2008 at Sydney she attempted to possess a substance which had been unlawfully imported, that substance being a border controlled drug, namely cocaine, the quantity being a commercial quantity. She asked that when I sentence her for that matter I take into account an offence on a schedule under s 16BA of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, that offence being attempting to possess a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, that offence being committed on the same day. 2 Those matters arose in the following circumstances. The offender’s cousin Hai Van Nguyen was a resident of Australia. In late September 2007 he set up a company purportedly for the purpose supplying beauty products. He thus leased a warehouse and registered business names. Arrangements were then made for the transport to Australia of products described as foot spas. These were sent by ship, that ship arriving on 2 May 2008.3 In the meantime the offender had left Canada on 23 April 2008, arriving in Melbourne where she met up with Mr Nguyen. Together they travelled to Sydney. Arrangements were then made for the foot spas to be taken to a storage facility at Lansvale. 4 However, upon arrival in Sydney, Australian Customs Service officers detected anomalies within the consignment. AFP officers and Customs officers then conducted physical examination of the foot spas revealing a total of fifty-four blocks wrapped in black tape from the three foot spas. Some of the blocks contained a white powder substance whilst others had a yellow-white crystalline substance. The white powder turned out to be cocaine, the yellow-white crystalline substance turned out to be methylamphetamine. There was a very large quantity of drugs involved. The weight of the cocaine totalled slightly more than twenty-seven kilograms with its total pure weight being thirteen kilograms. The estimated street value of that drug is between fifteen and twenty-four million dollars with a wholesale value of between four and a half million and five and a half million dollars. The methylamphetamine, the subject of the offence on the schedule, was also very valuable, a street value of around eight million dollars and a wholesale value of between two and a half and five million dollars. This was, as those figures demonstrate, a large scale offence.5 Of course, having been detected the authorities took steps. They substituted for the drugs an inert substance, repackaged the consignment and participated in its delivery to the storage facility in Lansvale. 6 Having come up from Melbourne, the offender Mr Nguyen and another female occupied a room at the Lansvale Hotel and Resort. Once arrangements had been made for the delivery to the storage facility of the foot spas, the offender sent a text message to a Canadian telephone number advising that delivery was to occur the following Monday. Further contact between the offender and that telephone number in Canada also led to the offender paying those people who conducted the legitimate business of arranging for the delivery for clearance, warehousing and delivery costs.7 On 19 May, the day referred to in the indictment, the controlled delivery was made. Immediately afterwards Nguyen telephoned the offender and said to her, “I stay over here unloading the stuff and then I’ll head back, all right.” Once the foot spas were finally delivered to their destination the offender, using her mobile telephone sent further text messages to that number in Canada confirming that delivery had occurred. They then left the hotel where they were staying and went to the storage facility. Contained within the storage facility was a listening device that had been put there by the authorities. Once the offender and Mr Nguyen entered that particular storage unit there, authorities were able to hear through the use of the listening device, saw-like sounds as Nguyen and Pham attempted to break through the bases of the foot spas. It is apparent that they had some difficulty doing so because later on Mr Nguyen went to a hardware store and purchased a number of tools. Later, the offender and Nguyen went back to the storage unit and continued to work removing the contents of the foot spas. The offender received instructions as to how the foot spas should be dismantled, following which conversation was recorded in which the offender spoke to Nguyen about where they should be looking within the foot spas for the concealed packages. In that conversation the offender said that she would participate in the work by doing some chiselling. 8 Having removed fifteen of the packages they left the facility and went back to the hotel. Ms Pham, the offender, then sent a text message to a mobile number stating “I hand over 15 all right.” Many other telephone calls and text messages were made relating to the delivery of those packages. At one stage the offender met with someone who was unknown and handed over the 15 substituted packages that had been removed from the consignment.9 Problems were then identified by the various criminals, those problems flowing from the fact that inert substances had been put in place by the authorities. One particular problem was that whilst in the original packaging a layer of scented powdered detergent had been placed, that was no longer there. The offender had a conversation with an unknown female in Canada in which she told that person of those problems. Later on she received a telephone call from an unknown male in which, using coded language, the offender was advised that the packages that had been handed over did not contain any drugs. After that call Ms Pham again telephoned the unknown female in Canada in which she passed on the information that she had received from the unknown male. Shortly thereafter the offender was arrested.10 The authorities then went back to the storage unit and discovered that two of the foot spa units had been damaged and number of the reconstructed substituted narcotic packages had been removed. The fifteen substituted blocks which were supplied have not been recovered. There were twenty-two other packages left in the storage unit.11 The offender thus played a very significant role in this offence. She was responsible for liaising with the Canadian end of the operation about various aspects of the operation, including the payment of money, the deconstruction of the foot spas, the destination of some of the packages, and it was she who communicated with Canada about the problems that were identified when the packages were found not to contain any drugs. She physically assisted with the removal of the packages as well. This is not a case where she simply told someone else what to do, but she did a lot herself and she also delivered fifteen packages of what she thought were drugs to a purchaser. This is offending at the higher end of the range. Both the offence on the indictment and the offence on the schedule involved quantities of drugs many times that which exposes the offender to life imprisonment. Of course the quantity of the drug is but one factor in assessing the objective seriousness of an offence. But when one looks at the offender’s involvement and the role she played and what she actually did it can be seen that she placed herself in a significant position within this criminal enterprise. That is why I say that this is offending at the higher end of the range.12 The offender is now thirty-three years of age. She was thirty-two at the time of this offence and has no prior criminal convictions. She was born in Saigon but left Vietnam in 1993 when she went to Canada. Whilst in Vietnam, her maternal grandparents brought her up after her father was sent to a communist re-education camp. She has two older sisters and two older brothers who also live in Canada. Whilst there she was employed in both a car company and also did some cooking in a restaurant. It was whilst she was at the restaurant that she met the man who asked her to become involved in this offence. When she first met him she did not know that he was involved in sending drugs to Australia, but she did find out that that is what was sent. She said in evidence today that she did not know what the drugs were, but she recognised that they could have been cocaine, could have been methylamphetamine, could have been heroin for that matter. The fact that she did not know precisely what the drugs were is scarcely a matter of mitigation.13 The man she met in Canada whilst working at the restaurant asked her to become involved and offered to pay her, not only to pay for her air fare to Australia but also to provide some money to her although he never told her how much she was going to get. She said that her role was to supervise what her cousin Mr Nguyen was doing. Although one has to be careful not to sentence according to labels, the offender’s involvement extended beyond mere supervision of her cousin. 14 She travelled from Canada to Australia for the specific purpose of committing a serious offence involving drugs. She contacted people in Canada about various aspects of the criminal enterprise. As I have mentioned she attended the storage unit herself and participated physically in the removal of what she thought were drugs, liaising with people in Canada as she did so. It was she who instructed the offender how to extract the drugs based on what she had learnt from the Canadian end, told him how many packages were to be removed, and together with Mr Nguyen, transported fifteen of those packages for the purpose of delivering them to another person. And it was she who received complaints about the standard of the drugs and passed that information back to people in Canada.15 In assessing the offender’s moral culpability it is important to identify the circumstances in which the offender attempted to come into possession of drugs and what it was intended that would happen to the drugs. There was some discussion as to whether I could take into account that the offender was involved in the supply of drugs, Ms Nash ultimately conceding that I was entitled to have regard to the fact that she participated in the delivery of what she thought were drugs. In any case, one does not import twenty-seven kilograms of cocaine for personal use. The offender was fully aware that she was involved in an enterprise which had as its object the distribution within the Australian community of a large quantity of drugs.16 The offender says now that she is sorry. It is difficult to understand what has happened since the offender first agreed to travel to Australia in order to commit this criminal offence, to explain why she would now feel genuinely remorseful about her involvement in this enterprise. In any case, the claim to be remorseful is somewhat inconsistent with the circumstance that the plea of guilty entered in this case was entered on the first day of the trial. I note that despite the lateness of that plea it still did demonstrate a limited willingness to assist in the administration of criminal justice and so I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by about ten per cent to reflect that circumstance.17 It is clear of course that the offender will serve her sentence in a foreign country. She has no family in Australia apart from Mr Nguyen who is serving a sentence of imprisonment. Her English is such that she was assisted by an interpreter during today’s proceedings and so she will do her time in custody harder than a person serving a sentence in his or her home country, able to receive family visits and able to communicate not only with fellow prisoners, but also with officers in charge of the prison. Of course not too much can be made of that fact because after all the offender went into this with her eyes open. She must have known that if she was caught she was going to be spending some time away from her family, in custody, in Australia. But nevertheless she took the risk, presumably because of the financial advantage that she expected to gain.18 The offender made reference to her elderly mother in Canada. I have not been asked to reduce the sentence that I would have otherwise imposed because of hardship to the offender’s mother. Her circumstances are certainly not exceptional and although she may well prefer to stay with the offender, the offender’s mother has four other siblings in Canada, presumably capable and willing of looking after their mother.19 I mentioned before that the quantity of drugs involved was substantial. The offender may not have known the precise quantity of drugs involved, but she must have known that it was significant. A sophisticated operation involving the setting up of an apparently legitimate business, travel to Australia, renting of a storage area, all point to a large quantity of drugs being involved. 20 The quantities of drugs in this case and the related profit that one can make from illicit drug activities emphasise the need for substantial sentences to be imposed as a deterrent to others who may be tempted by the prospect of financial gain, as this offender was. This offender was not involved in the offence to satisfy her own addiction. She was involved in it for money and there are many others who might give consideration to doing what the offender did so that they can profit at the expense of those who are ultimately supplied drugs of this kind. General deterrence is thus of particular importance in sentencing people such as this offender.21 Although I am of course sentencing only for the offence on the indictment, I do have to bear in mind that contained on the schedule is a second very serious offence. It is of such seriousness that were it being dealt with separately, it would justify a lengthy period of imprisonment in its own right. 22 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of seven years to date from 19 May 2008 on which day Ms Pham was taken into custody and I set a head sentence of eleven years. This means that the offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 18 May 2015. 23 Ms Pham I will explain to you what has just happened. I have sentenced you to imprisonment and you must spend at least seven years in gaol. You may be released after seven years, that is on 18 May 2015, but if you are released you will still be serving your sentence until it expires eleven years after it starts, and if you commit another offence during your time on parole you can be returned back into custody.

    3    On 26 November, 1997 the appellant was further indicted on three charges of sexual intercourse (penile/anal intercourse) with his step-son, E.D., who was then also above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years and who was also under the authority of the appellant. 
     
      
    4    These offences were also in contravention of S 66C(2). The offences allegedly occurred between June, 1987 and December, 1988 when the victim was 14 to 15 years of age. 
     
      
    5    To the latter indictment the appellant pleaded not guilty. Following a trial before Acting Judge Coolahan and a jury of twelve in the Newcastle District Court, the appellant was found guilty on all three counts and duly convicted. He was sentenced on 28 November, 1997 to a minimum term of 6 years penal servitude with an additional term of 2 years on each of the six counts in the two indictments upon which he was convicted, all sentences to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    6    The Crown case presented at trial depended entirely upon the jury accepting the evidence of the complainant, who was described as a “slow learner”, in that he was developmentally delayed and had been placed in a slow learners class at high school. 
     
      
    7    The complainant was born on 11 October, 1973. In 1981 some years after the death of his father, his mother married the appellant. Towards the end of 1984 the family, which was then comprised of the complainant, his two sisters, his mother and the appellant, moved to the Newcastle area residing at Wallsend. 
     
      
    8    During the period that the complainant was a student at Wallsend High School, i.e. between 20 July, 1987 and 24 June, 1988, the complainant said that he was punished for running into a trailer and was “grounded”. The complainant was forbidden by the appellant to play or watch TV, and spent most of his time in his bedroom. He was nevertheless attending school. 
     
      
    9    The complainant gave evidence that the appellant offered to take him off the “grounding” if the complainant would permit anal intercourse. Ultimately this took place and the complainant described the event and said that he was, at the time, crying and felt sick. 
     
      
    10    The complainant gave evidence that the appellant threatened that he would hurt the complainant’s mother and his sisters if he told anyone what had occurred. 
     
      
    11    The second incident of anal intercourse occurred whilst the members of the family were living at Woodberry. The offence occurred in a shed in which hay was kept adjacent to a paddock where horses were kept. The complainant was threatened with “grounding” unless he complied with the appellant’s wishes and threats were made concerning the complainant’s mother if the complainant told anyone what had occurred. 
     
      
    12    The third offence allegedly occurred in the family home whilst the complainant was watching television. On this occasion there were also threats of “grounding” if the complainant did not comply with the appellant’s wishes to engage in anal intercourse. 
     
      
    13    The complainant gave evidence that the appellant had engaged in penile/anal intercourse with him on a total of five occasions. He could not recall where the occasions, other than those specifically referred to in the three counts on the indictment, had occurred. 
     
      
    14    The complainant gave evidence that at some time prior to December, 1988 when he left school, the appellant moved out of the family home, as did also the complainant’s two sisters. Just prior to Christmas, the complainant and his mother moved to Mayfield and stayed with friends, Michael and Dianne Jones. The complainant gave evidence that he had not told anyone about what had happened to him because of the threats made by the appellant against his mother and his sisters. 
     
      
    15    The complainant gave evidence that he told Michael and Dianne Jones about what had happened to him a couple of months after he had moved in with them. He thought his mother had been present when he made this disclosure, but could not remember. The complainant gave evidence that he subsequently complained to other people, but at no time did anyone suggest to him that he should go to the police. 
     
      
    16    The complainant gave evidence of having served some time in custody for a break, enter and steal offence in 1993 and upon his release on New Years’ Day in 1994 he went to live with his mother for a brief period before moving into the appellant’s house. He said that he did this because he had nowhere else to go. He said that he was no longer frightened of the appellant because he knew he could stand up for himself. The complainant eventually moved out of the appellant’s house because the appellant had said something which upset him. The day after he moved out, he went to the police because “I didn’t want him to stay out and hurt any other little kids”. This occurred in June 1996. The complainant also gave evidence that he had complained to his sisters about the appellant at around the same time that he went to the police. He had also complained to Professor McConachie saying “My step-dad sexually assaulted me”. 
     
      
    17    Dianne Jones gave evidence that the complainant and his mother stayed at her house at around Christmas 1988. At that time the complainant had told her that he was very upset at the thought of returning to live with the appellant saying that “he touches my Joe”. She said that at that time she did not understand what he meant by use of the word “Joe”. She said that her husband Michael and the complainant’s mother were also present. Her evidence was that between the end of 1989 and the beginning of 1990 she had a further conversation with the complainant and that he used the word “Joe” again in reference to his penis. 
     
      
    18    The complainant’s mother gave evidence that one day “in the last year and so since” the complainant had told her that the appellant used to do things to him which he did not want him to do but which he let him do because he could get off punishment. The complainant had also told her that “when they used to go and feed the horses John used to say ‘I’m going to fuck you’”. 
     
      
    19    The appellant gave evidence and was cross examined. He denied all the allegations made by the complainant and gave evidence of having had a stroke in 1992 which affected his short term memory and mental stability. 
     
      
    20    In cross examination of the complainant, counsel for the appellant sought to establish that the complainant had a motive to make false allegations against the appellant and that the allegations of the complainant were in fact false. The complainant denied these assertions.  
     
      
    21    When the appellant was escorted by the police officer, Senior Constable Heywood, to Newcastle Police Station he denied that he had been sexually involved with the complainant. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - the complaint evidence 
       
      
    22    The Crown led evidence of complaint to Mr and Mrs Jones, Mrs Dougherty, the complainant’s mother, his two sisters and Professor McConachie. 
     
      
    23    Two only of these witnesses gave evidence (Mrs Jones and Mrs Dougherty). The complaint to Mr and Mrs Jones was the most immediate. Mrs Jones gave evidence that this complaint was “before 1988” (T.67.58). 
     
      
    24    It was open to the jury to accept that this complaint was made some two weeks after the end of the period in which the offence alleged in the third count occurred (i.e. between 24 June, 1988 and 14 December, 1988). There is the further inference of contemporaneity available from the use by Mrs Jones of the present tense in saying “he touches my Joe”. 
     
      
    25    The complaint evidence relating to the complainant’s sisters is not capable of being fixed in time, nor was evidence led of what was said by the complainant to his sisters. 
     
      
    26    The evidence of complaint to Professor McConachie was established as being some years after the offences allegedly occurred. 
     
      
    27    The exchange between counsel and the learned trial judge at T.63 makes it plain that the evidence relating to Professor McConachie was adduced to re-establish credibility as a prior consistent statement pursuant to S 108(3) of the Evidence Act, 1995. Counsel for the appellant at trial, it seems to me, accepted that situation. 
     
      
    28    The complaint evidence insofar as it relates to the complainant’s sisters, his mother and to Mr and Mrs Jones is said, on behalf of the appellant, to lack that degree of “freshness” necessary to attract S 66 of the Evidence Act as explained in Graham -v- The Queen (1998) 72 ALR 1491. 
     
      
    29    The point was not taken at the trial (the objection to the evidence as it related to Professor McConachie was on a different point) and leave is required under rule 4 to argue this point. 
     
      
    30    For other reasons, to which I shall shortly make reference, this appeal, in my view, should succeed. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to resolve the issues raised in this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    31    However, it is to be noted that Graham’s case was decided after the trial in the present case concluded and in the light of the assistance now available from what has been said by the High Court, at any new trial further consideration will no doubt be given as to the precise nature of complaint evidence, if any, to be presented at trial and in due course, the use which may be made of it. 
     
      
       
       Ground 2 - evidence of other sexual acts. 
       
      
    32    (i) Evidence which implied or suggested that the accused had committed other offences erroneously was admitted before the jury. 
     
      
    33    (ii) Alternatively, his Honour the learned trial judge failed adequately to direct the jury in relation to the limited basis upon which such evidence was admitted. 
     
      
    34    During the course of the complainant’s evidence in chief, the trial judge granted leave, pursuant to S 409B(3)(b) of the Crimes Act, to lead evidence of the “sexual relationship” between the accused and E.D. in accordance with paragraph 25 of the complainant’s statement of 19 June, 1996 (see judgment 25 November, 1997). The application was opposed by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    35    Pursuant to such leave, the following evidence was led at T.21 (25/11/97):- 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Mr Davison, you’ve told the court about these three times when you were with the accused and you say he put his, to use your expression, his “doodle into your bottom or your backside?” 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he do that to you on any other occasions? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Where were you living when he did it on the other occasions? 
         
        A. I’m not too sure. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. the one you told me about where you’d been grounded and the floodlight was being fixed, was that the first time that it happened? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the one you told me about where when mum was off at the hospital, nursing home at work-- 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. – - was that the last time it happened? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the only two places you lived in that time was either at Wallsend or Woodberry is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to tell me during that time on how many times he would have put his “doodle in your backside” for? 
         
        A. About five. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. About five? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you recall where any of the other occasions occurred? 
         
        A. Can’t remember.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    36    The purpose for which this evidence was led by the Crown was to establish the “sexual relationship” between the accused and E.D. 
     
      
    37    In his judgment Judge Coolahan regarding paragraph 25 of the complainant’s statement said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… what the complainant is talking about is acts of sexual intercourse similar, if not identical to the ones he has already deposed to with the same modus operandi and it seems to me that evidence of this falls squarely within the decision in  
        Chamelos 
         (sic) and that the application should be granted.” 
        
       
      
    38    In his summing up to the jury, the trial judge said, commencing at p 16:- 
     
      
       
        
        ”Now he gave some evidence then that he, that is the accused, had had sexual intercourse with him on other occasions between the first count in the indictment and the last count, and he said as I understand his evidence that the accused had sexual intercourse with him in the same manner about five times in all. The reason that evidence is admissible is to put the Crown case in context, that is to say, if you were to accept that evidence, then it could be capable of showing a guilty passion on the part of the accused towards the complainant, and it puts three counts on the indictment into a slightly different context in the sense that there were more than just three isolated occasions, although in this case it would seem that there were only another two according to the complainant. But of course the accused is not charged with those offences, he is only charged with the three in the indictment. The evidence is simply admitted for the purpose of context and perhaps to show a guilty passion if you think that that is available in this case on the evidence.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    39    The basis upon which the evidence of sexual acts perpetrated upon the complainant by the appellant, in addition to the acts which were the subject of specific charges, was identified in the separate judgment given by the trial judge as “relationship evidence” and “tendency or coincidence evidence”, (“… the same modus operandi”). In the summing up to the jury, it was referred to by the trial judge as “… sexual intercourse with him (the complainant) in the same manner”; “admissible … to put the Crown case in context” and “capable of showing a guilty passion”. 
     
      
    40    The tendency rule is expressed in S 97 of the Evidence Act as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Evidence of the character, reputation or conduct of a person, or a tendency that a person has or had, is not admissible to prove that a person has or had a tendency (whether because of the person’s character or otherwise) to act in a particular way, or to have a particular state of mind, if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Subsection(1) (a) does not apply if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by another party.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    41    Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence, adduced by the prosecution, are to be found in S101, which provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) This section does not apply to tendency evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict tendency evidence adduced by the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) This section does not apply to coincidence evidence that the prosecution adduces to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    42    The course to be adopted in circumstances where there is evidence of conduct with a sexual connotation between an accused and a complainant, other than that which is the subject of the offence or offences charged and admitted for the purposes of throwing light on their relationship, at the time of the events in question, and which may suggest “guilty passion” was considered in Regina -v- AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702 where, commencing at 708, the following is said and warrants repeating:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Prior to the  
        Evidence Act 
         1995 and in  
        R -v- Beserick 
         (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 at 515, this Court held, on the basis of respectable authority, that evidence of conduct with a sexual connotation between the complainant and the accused other than that which is the subject of the offence or offences charged is relevant in two different ways: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the relationship revealed may place the evidence of the events which give rise to a particular charge into their true context as part of the essential background against which the evidence of the complainant and of the accused necessarily fall to be evaluated:  
        B -v- The Queen 
         (1992) 175 CLR 599 at 610 (see also at 602-603); and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the guilty passion of the accused revealed - or, in less inflammatory terms the sexual desire or feeling of the accused for the complainant - is directly relevant to proving that the offence charged was committed:  
        R -v- Ball 
         [1911] AC 47 at 71; see also  
        Pfenning -v- The Queen 
         (1995) 182 CLR 461 at 526. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence - once admissible for either or both of those purposes - will also necessarily make the complainant’s evidence more credible in relation to the events upon which the charges were based. 
        
       
       
        
        Where the Crown introduces the evidence for the former purpose, it is not tendency evidence, and the requirements of s 97 and s 101 are irrelevant:  
        R -v- Harvey 
         (NSWCCA - 11.12.96 - unreported) at 5-6. Once admitted for that purpose, however, the evidence cannot also be used as tendency evidence in the sense that, because the accused had the guilty passion, he did the act in question unless it does comply with those requirements ( 
        Evidence Act 
        , s 95), and the judge should direct the jury that they may not use it in that way unless it does comply. 
        
       
       
        
        Where the Crown does wish to use the evidence of guilty passion as tending to show that the accused did do the act in question (and thus that the complainant’s evidence that the accused did the act in question is more credible), it is tendency evidence and so must comply with s 97 and s 101 before it may be used for that purpose. 
        
       
       
        
        Section 97 requires the Crown to establish that the evidence has significant probative value. That means that its degree of relevance to the events giving rise to the offence charged is important or of consequence:  
        R  
         
        -v- Lockyer 
         (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 459;  
         R -v- Lock 
         (1997) 91 A Crim R 356. In both  
        Harriman -v- The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 597-599 and  
        S -v- The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 266 at 275, Dawson J has said that evidence of guilty passion, although evidence of propensity (or tendency as the  
        Evidence Act 
          
        calls it), has a sufficiently high degree of relevance as to justify its admission: see also  
        B -v- The Queen 
         (at 618) per Dawson J and Gaudron J. If the conduct in question is not remote from the time of the alleged offence, the Crown should usually have little difficulty in establishing that the evidence has importance in establishing the guilt of the accused, and thus that it is of significant probative value. 
        
       
       
        
        Section 101(2) requires the Crown to establish that the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. The prejudicial effect of tendency evidence is that the ordinary person thinks that someone with an established tendency to conduct himself in a certain way whenever a particular opportunity arises will yield to that tendency and so conduct himself in the circumstances of the particular case:  
        Pfennig -v- The Queen 
         (at 488). As such evidence is circumstantial in nature, the Crown must establish that there is no reasonable view of the evidence available which is consistent with the innocence of the accused:  
        Pfennig 
         (at 483-484,485). That is what is required by s 101(2):  
        R -v- Lock 
         (at 363);  
        R -v- Foley 
         (NSWCCA - 5.6.96 - unreported) at 8.” 
        
       
      
    43    In the present case the evidence was admitted pursuant to leave granted under S 409B(3)(b) of the Crimes Act. It is unclear just how the Crown sought to use the evidence in terms of sections 97, 98 and 101 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    44    In summing up to the jury the judge, as indicated above, adverted to the evidence as being admitted “simply … for the purpose of context and perhaps to show a guilty passion if you think that that is available in this case on the evidence” (emphasis added). 
     
      
    45    The evidence that sexual assaults of an identical nature had occurred on five rather than three occasions was patently prejudicial. No direction was given as to the use or the limitations on the use which the jury could make of the evidence in question and no explanation was given to the jury of the contextual limitations of the evidence, or the meaning of the expression “guilty passion” as applied to the evidence. 
     
      
    46    In fairness it must be said that the issue was ventilated in argument before the court in the context of S 409B and no assistance was afforded to the learned trial judge by way of reference to the provisions of the Evidence Act or decided authority, ( R -v- AH was published on 27 November, 1997, i.e. the day on which the summing up was delivered and hence was not available), nevertheless, a significant error in the conduct of the trial has been demonstrated in that the purpose for which the critical evidence was introduced was not made clear and directions to the jury, appropriate to the established purpose for its introduction, were not given. This ground of appeal should be upheld.47    Grounds 3 and 4 are abandoned, except insofar as they lend support to ground 5. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 - the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
      
    48    This ground may be dealt with shortly. The Crown case was wholly dependent on the evidence of the complainant.  
     
      
    49    It was open to the jury, notwithstanding the delay between the events complained of and the preferring of charges, to accept the evidence of the complainant and to reject the denials of the appellant. This is not a case where a review of the evidence discloses discrepancies or displays inadequacies or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead to the conclusion that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted M -v- The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487. 
     
      
    50    This ground is not made out. 
     
      
    51    The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed in respect of the offences to which he pleaded guilty (offences against his step-daughter K), for the reason that those sentences were said in argument to be structured on the basis of totality of criminality which included the offences against the complainant E.D. 
     
      
    52    Such considerations, in my view, should abide the outcome of a new trial to which the appellant is entitled under Ground 2. Reconsideration by the District Court at any prior time would be premature and in any event, may prove otiose. 
     
      
    53    I would propose the following orders:- 
     
      
    54    1. The appeal is allowed. 
     
      
    55    2. The conviction and sentence are quashed. 
     
      
    56    3. A new trial is ordered.

      REGINA v BARRY WILLIAM JOHN RODGERS 
      
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1    LEVINE J: The applicant applies for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Acting Judge Nash in the Sydney District Court on 19 February 1998. 
    2    The application had come on for hearing in this Court constituted by two other judges on 11 November last year. On that occasion the applicant appeared unrepresented as he had apparently been refused legal aid. It appears that as a result of some observations made in the written submissions by the Crown at that time, issues were perceived to arise that warranted the applicant having the benefit of legal representation, thus the delay in the determination of the application. The applicant has had the benefit of Mr Skinner's appearance before this Court today.  
    3    The applicant was sentenced in respect of eleven counts of sexual offences committed between 1 January 1974 and 21 July 1989. Five of the counts being counts one, two, three, four and ten were brought under the then s 81 of the Crimes Act. Counts five, seven, nine and eleven were brought under s 61 D(1). Counts six and eight were brought under s 61 E(1). 
    4    At the time of sentence the applicant sought to have the sentencing judge take into account pursuant to s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act a further eleven offences of a similar nature committed on four of the same victims, being six offences under s 81 and five offences under s 61 E which were encompassed by the same time period of the offences charged. 
    5    In respect of counts one, two, three and four, six, eight and ten the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of penal servitude of two years to commence on 22 April 1997. In respect of counts five, seven and nine the applicant was sentenced to a fixed and concurrent term of penal servitude of five years. In relation to count eleven the applicant was sentenced to a minimum and concurrent term of seven years and six months and an additional term of two years and six months in respect of which count the matters in the Form 2 were taken account and in respect of which the overall sentence of ten years constitutes the maximum applicable for the substantive offence. 
    6    The applicant who is now aged sixty-three had prior convictions in New Zealand in 1962, 1965 and 1996 for various offences of indecent assault. I do not propose to go into the facts to any greater extent than involves the recitation of the sentencing judge’s remarks: 
     
      
       
       “On thirteen occasions you touched and fondled the penises of various victim in homes, at the Speedway and on camps. On seven occasions you sucked the victims’ penises. 
       
      
      
       
       On one occasion you put your penis between a victim’s legs just below his anus and thrust your penis backwards and forwards while your hand was on the boy’s penis. 
       
      
      
       
       On the last occasion you touched, fondled and sucked the victim’s penis and attempted to put his head towards your erect penis”. 
       
      
    7    It appears that a feature of the history of these matters, and one identified as an aggravating feature by the sentencing judge, was that except for the offence committed in 1974 the applicant has committed offences after absconding on bail and did not appear in respect of that 1974 offence on 24th July 1974. In respect of the offences that occurred in the early 1980's, it appears as I understand it he was in a somewhat similar position relating to offences committed in New Zealand for which he was sentenced ultimately in 1996 having absconded from this country and returned to his native land. 
    8    The ages of the victims ranged between at least six and twelve. There were six in number, two of whom were brothers. At the relevant time the applicant was aged between thirty-seven and fifty-one years and at the time of sentence he was sixty-one. His Honour remarked upon the relationship of trust which existed between the applicant and his victims who were in his care and control at the relevant times, generally there placed by their parents and often in their homes, sometimes in the applicant's home and on other occasions on what his Honour described as what should be ""regarded as very enjoyable church camps"". 
    9    The overall gravity of the offences is reflected in his Honour's understanding of the maximum sentences applicable. His Honour specifically remarked upon, to the credit of the applicant, his conduct in relation to the person said by the applicant to be five but now understood really to have been six, to the extent that the applicant volunteered information in relation to that boy.  
    10    His Honour noted the applicant's antecedents and convictions in New Zealand. His Honour took into account the pleas of guilty insofar as the expense of trials was concerned and the trauma for the victims in participating in them was obviated. His Honour expressed doubts as to the remorse the applicant said he felt, but hoped that such as it was, if it was felt upon his release, he would require psychological and psychiatric counselling. His Honour referred to the applicant’s age. His Honour gave ""anxious consideration"" as to the total appropriate overall sentence in respect of the matters.  
    11    His Honour came to the view that had the applicant pleaded not guilty and been convicted, an appropriate total sentence would have been in the order of twelve to thirteen years penal servitude, but taking into account the plea his Honour arrived at the sentence, reflecting his Honour's view of totality, of the ten years to which I have referred. His Honour made a specific finding that there was no anal intercourse. 
    12    As to special circumstances his Honour came to the view that the usual period would be sufficient for the purposes of continuing rehabilitative attention, but otherwise declined to make any special allowance therefor. As I have said in respect of the eleventh count which brought about the effect of the imposition of the maximum penalty, his Honour took into account the eleven other matters. 
    13    By reason of the progress of this matter through the appellate system, the applicant now relies on the position taken by the Crown in its written submissions first lodged to the effect that even allowing for the application of the totality principle it might be argued that it should not result in a maximum sentence which is reserved for the worst category of case. His Honour clearly did not find the applicant's conduct to constitute such a case. There are features which obviously take it below the worst category. The applicant readily admitted his guilt, he confessed to an offence on a victim where there was no other evidence and there was no anal intercourse. 
    14    One issue that has been ventilated, but in my view need not necessarily be resolved in the disposition of this application, is the question of the operation of s 55 of the Interpretation Act. In the context of a period of time between July 1981 and June 1984 where there was an overlap between the existence of s 81 and s 61 E.  
    15    This problem has been referred to in the matter of Regina v Sweeney (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 14 July 1998) and has been the subject of some detailed supplementary submissions on behalf of the Crown. Extraordinarily, one view of the application of that section to the history of amendments to the Crimes Act in this area could lead to the outcome that the maximum sentence for the relevant conduct was in fact four years as opposed to the five relied upon by his Honour, or from another perspective to a maximum of six years. 
    16    The disposition of this appeal in my view does not warrant the resolution of that interesting point, the reason being that that there is a practical vehicle in the sentence imposed for count eleven that can accommodate the consequences of intervention. I say that bearing in mind Mr Skinner's reminder that the sentence imposed for count eleven took into account several offences under s 81 and therefore several offences in respect of which the debate as to the applicable maximum was relevant. 
    17    There are two particular factors which persuade me that there is a basis for intervention. First is the availability of the operation of the principles in Regina v Close (1992) 65 A Crim R 55 in the context of the applicant having been in custody in New Zealand from June to April 1997. 
    18    It is that period of custody that is of significance in accordance with the principle to which I have referred. It not having been the subject of consideration itself leads me to the view that the ultimate penalty reflected in the sentence imposed for count eleven can be viewed as excessive and warranting intervention.  
    19    Further, although his Honour made reference to the applicant's age it appears that it went no further than that and that is a factor that properly could have been taken into account. Finally there is the question of special circumstances generally. His Honour made no allowance by way of additional term for special circumstances. It was open to his Honour so to do and of course having failed to do so does not necessarily mean that error is disclosed. The view I take in the circumstances of this case, its long history and notwithstanding the appalling objective factors is that the circumstances involving the requirement for further rehabilitative attention and that of the pre-existing New Zealand custody would warrant a variation in the usual ratio.  
    20    The applicant by reason of the criminality of his conduct is not deserving of sympathy. It was of course appalling and requires unreserved condemnation and appropriate punishment reflecting general deterrence, retribution and personal deterrence. It is important, as is well known, that subjective considerations should not be permitted to bring about any imbalance that derogates from a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offences. 
    21    For the reasons I have stated however, I am of the view that there are bases for intervention by this Court and that leave to appeal should be granted and that the appeal be allowed in respect of the sentence imposed in respect of count eleven. A total sentence of eight years penal servitude to my mind is appropriate taking into account the factors to which I have referred. A proper consideration of totality and by reason of the special circumstances constituted by the pre-sentence custody, the age of the applicant and I add the nature of the custody he will have to undergo (until administratively if it happens, that custody is ameliorated), warrants that overall term being constituted by a minimum term of five years and six months and an additional term of two years and six months. 
    22    Accordingly I propose that the sentence in relation to count eleven be quashed and in substitution therefor, the appellant be sentenced to a minimum term of five years and six months to commence on 22 April 1997 and to expire on 21 October 2002. An additional term of two years and six months is to commence on 22 October 2002 and to expire 21 April 2005. The date upon which the applicant therefore would be eligible for release to parole being 21 October 2002. 
    23    CARRUTHERS AJ: I agree. 
    24    LEVINE J: The orders will be as I have proposed.

     FRIDAY 17 SEPTEMBER 1999 
      
      
      
      REGINA v. SUNG EUN PARK 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      (Crown's application under s.38 to cross-examine Mina Park on her statement of 7 May 1997 - see p.524 of the transcript) 
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: In my view notwithstanding the objection, the application of s.78 does not preclude the giving of the evidence sought to be elicited.  
    2   In cross-examination evidence has been elicited from the witness as to her beliefs concerning her brother and her knowledge of her brother from which she has given evidence of her opinion of her brother's character, at least in particular respects. There has also been elicited from the witness evidence of her belief that her brother, in the absence of insanity, would not have killed his wife and children or, presumably, been party to a killing of his wife and children (see Evidence Act, ss.78 and 110). 
    3   The evidence the Crown now seeks to elicit is of a statement made, as was pointed out by Mr. Temby in his objection, at an earlier point of time to the ascertainment that they were in fact murdered, prior to the finding of the bodies but after their disappearance. That evidence would go to a number of matters. Firstly, knowledge on the witness' part that her brother was lying when he gave an account that his wife and children had gone to Brisbane; secondly, the witness' belief, expressed in the terms, ""I am in no doubt that he was involved in the disappearance of Susan and the children"", and thirdly, a speculation as to a number of possibilities as to the way in which he might have been so involved. 
    4   As to these, it was one possibility that he might have, with his girlfriend, Demi, taken them far away and threatened that he and she would do something to them in order to liquidate the deceased's possessions, to provide money for he and Demi to go to Korea. They did, in fact, the evidence will show, go to Korea and did seek to obtain her money. 
    5   Another possibility that is raised is that on the way to ""dump them"", this being presumably a reference to taking them far away, the girlfriend or the accused might have hurt one of the kids or Susan, or one of them, in the heat of the moment and that Susan and the kids may be dead or if any had survived they were too frightened to return to Sydney. 
    6   There were other speculations as to prostitution, that is, that Susan had been sold off by the accused for the purpose of prostitution to compensate for gambling debts and that the accused might have enquired about putting the children in some charitable institution, particularly a convent. 
    7   Lastly it is suggested that Susan may have agreed to have the accused take them somewhere remote where they had been abandoned, from which they may not have wished to return, or she may have returned on her own with the kids. The various possibilities are all speculative, but they have a common feature; they all speculate on a basis of the involvement of the accused in the disappearance of his wife and children. 
    8   Mr. Temby raises objection, firstly, on s.78 and, secondly, he invokes my discretion and, as to the last of the possibilities raised, points out that the involvement is not there directly, but proceeds through Susan and the circumstances in which she found herself, her marriage being at an end and her husband being involved with another woman. 
    9   I am of the view that the speculation as to possibilities goes too far for them to be led, in that matters of such particularity are referred to, and hence the prejudice is acute. But I do not consider that, in the light of the cross-examination, it would be proper to restrict the Crown from ascertaining from this witness that, although she is now of the opinion that, absent insanity, her brother would not be involved criminally in the death or disappearance of the deceased, whether there was a point of time at which she held a contrary view. She is as qualified to give that evidence as she was to give the evidence in cross-examination. 
    10   I do not consider, however, that it would be open to the Crown in that regard to seek to obtain from the witness her subjective opinion that her brother had been lying in the story that he gave on the Friday, since the basis for that merely appears to be that the conversations did not make sense. 
    11   It follows that on the application under s.38 it is open to question the witness, by leave, and I so rule, about that prior inconsistent account, but only to the extent I have ruled.

     1     
     GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence following the conviction of the appellant for manslaughter at the Dubbo Supreme Court. 
      
       
      
     2     
     The appellant was there indicted before Dunford J and a jury for murder. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. His Honour sentenced the appellant to a total of eleven years penal servitude, divided into minimum and additional term components of eight years and three years respectively. That division followed a finding by his Honour that there were special circumstances justifying the extension of the additional term beyond the proportion that would have resulted from the application of the formula in s.5(2) of the Sentencing Act. 
      
       
      
     3     
     The circumstances do not require lengthy elaboration. 
      
       
      
     4     
     The applicant was a resident of Lightning Ridge and engaged in opal mining. He became concerned that a young man might have stolen some opal from him. The young man was in fact the grandson of a woman with whom the appellant was involved in a de facto relationship. However, having acquired the suspicion about the opal the appellant took a .22 rifle, loaded it, and did not engage the safety catch. He was well affected by the prior ingestion of intoxicating liquor, including methylated spirits.

     He drove into town to the house where the young man was staying. He sought to remonstrate with him about the alleged theft. That theft was denied. 
      
       
      
     6     
     The victim attempted to depart from the scene but his way was blocked by the appellant. Eventually he sought to escape by running down the street. As he did so the appellant raised the rifle to his shoulder and fired it in his direction. It struck him fatally. 
      
       
      
     7     
     The finding of the jury obviously meant that they were not satisfied that the appellant intended death or grievous bodily harm. Nevertheless, it must be said that to present a lethal weapon without its safety device engaged is of itself a dangerous act of a very high order. 
      
       
      
     8     
     Substantially two matters have been canvassed in the course of this appeal. As I am of a view that the second should be sustained I will deal relatively briefly with the first. 
      
       
      
     9     
     It is contended that his Honour was in error in assessing the circumstances as revealing a most serious category case of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. When his Honour used that expression he was obviously not adverting to the degree of seriousness which gives rise to the application of maximum penalty. In my view his Honour's assessment was not in error. As I have indicated, the facts were that the appellant for the purpose of engaging in an argument arrived armed with a lethal weapon which he had deliberately not rendered safe.  
      
       
      
     10     
     It was argued on his behalf that the findings indicated that the appellant should be treated as if he intended no harm at all. When the circumstances involve the presentation and discharge of a lethal weapon, it is difficult to imagine any circumstances in which harm could be intended which was of a lesser standard than that of intending really serious injury. The essence of the seriousness of those categories of crime which involve the use of such weapons is inherent in the nature of them. 
      
       
      
     11     
     The second matter canvassed in the appeal relates to the negotiations, if I may so describe them, between the appellant's representatives and the Crown prior to arraignment. His Honour noted in his remarks on sentence that it was submitted that he should sentence the prisoner as if he had pleaded guilty (to manslaughter) on arraignment. He noted that he had offered to plead guilty to manslaughter but the Crown would not accept that plea. 
      
       
      
     12     
     His Honour made some observations concerning the course of trial. As I understand his observations(on this sentence application we do not have a full trial transcript) his Honour noted that it was the posture of the appellant that he could only be guilty of manslaughter if, in the circumstances, he had deliberately pulled the trigger. It was concurrent with adopting that posture that the offer to plead guilty to manslaughter had been made. It appears that his Honour ruled, understandably if I may respectfully say, that the appellant could be found guilty of manslaughter by the jury in circumstances other than those involving the deliberate pulling of the trigger of the weapon. 
      
       
      
     13     
     Be that as it may, his Honour went on to make the following remarks, at page 6 of his remarks on sentence: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Although the Crown would not have accepted it, it was still open to the prisoner to plead not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on arraignment. He did not do so but pleaded not guilty simpliciter, thereby putting the Crown to proof of all the elements of the charge of manslaughter, including calling ballistic witnesses to show the gun would not have discharged accidentally"". 
         
        
       
       
         
       
      
     14     
     So far as the last mentioned example is concerned, it has been conceded by counsel for the Crown appearing in the appeal, that it would be expected that in any event upon trial of the indictment for murder the Crown would have called such evidence. 
      
       
      
     15     
     It is true that technically the applicant did not plead guilty to manslaughter and he therefore does not fall within the precise terms of section 439 of the Crimes Act. There has been a long practice, however, in this court and in trial courts to take into account the offer of a plea of guilty which matches the crime for which a person is ultimately convicted. 
      
       
      
     16     
     The offer of that plea of guilty or, in usual circumstances, the actual plea of guilty, is of benefit to the person charged broadly in two ways: It is taken as an indication of remorse and contrition for the offence committed and, second, there is what is described as the utilitarian value of the plea; this includes the relief of the State from having to call witnesses and, indeed, the reliefs to the various witnesses of the burden of having to give evidence and potentially being cross-examined. 
      
       
      
     17     
     In the instant case his Honour found otherwise that the appellant was in any event remorseful. He had demonstrated his remorse almost immediately after the crime had been committed. He was however as a result of his Honour's findings which are implicit in the remarks which I have quoted, deprived of any benefit that he might expect for what I have described as the utilitarian value of the offer of his plea. 
      
       
      
     18     
     In my view the appellant should have been given that benefit. The jurisdiction of this court therefore should be invoked and intervention should take place. This brings me to the question of resentence. 
      
       
      
     19     
     The appellant had an almost clear prior record. He is a man of some 62 years of age. He has been committed to prison on a first occasion. He has demonstrated his remorse, not only by his offer of the plea, but in practical ways which his Honour mentioned elsewhere in his remarks. 
      
       
      
     20     
     Like his Honour, I would also find that there were special circumstances justifying the extension of the additional term component of the total sentence. It is not necessary to repeat his Honour's findings, which I would respectfully adopt. I would therefore propose the following orders: 
      
       
      
     21     
     That the application for leave to appeal be granted, and the appeal allowed. 
      
       
      
     22     
     The sentence imposed below be quashed, and in lieu thereof the appellant be sentenced to a total of nine years penal servitude to comprise a minimum term of six years commencing on 6 November 1996 and expiring on 5 November 2002, together with an additional term of three years commencing on 6 November 2002. The appellant would be eligible for release on parole on 5 November 2002. 
      
       
      
     23     
     SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J, and his reasons. 
      
       
      
     24     
     SULLY J: So do I also agree. 
      
       
      
     25     
     SPIGELMAN CJ: The orders of the court are as indicated by Grove J.

     REGINA v Michael John MITCHELL 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: Michael John Mitchell seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Luland, Queen's Counsel, at Parramatta District Court on 21 October 1998. On that occasion the applicant adhered to earlier pleas of guilty on one count of possessing housebreaking implements under s114(1)(B) of the Crimes Act, 1900. That offence attracts a maximum penalty of seven years penal servitude. The second matter was one count of break and enter with intent to commit a felony under s112(1) of the Act. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years penal servitude.  
    2   His Honour was also asked to take into account a number of matters under two Form 2’s, which were likewise matters of dishonesty including a number of matters of larceny. The offences under the first and second counts were committed on 7 January 1998. The matters on both Form 2’s related to the period 7 January 1998 to 22 April 1998. In relation to the first count, his Honour imposed a fixed term of one year penal servitude to commence on 17 October 1998 and to expire on 16 October 1999. In relation to the second matter, his Honour imposed a minimum term of three years penal servitude to commence on 17 October 1998, and to expire on 16 October 2001. His Honour imposed an additional term of one year penal servitude to commence on 16 October 2002.  
    3   The applicant was born on 15 February 1963, so that at the time he stood for sentence he was 35 years of age. Unhappily he has a long criminal record which appears to have commenced in May 1985. On that occasion he was dealt with in relation to dishonesty offences and using a prohibited drug, heroin. Since that date there is a litany of offences ranging up until the present matter. Some 20 appearances in court over the period of 13 years between 1985 and 1998 are recorded. There is absolutely no doubt that the applicant’s criminal activity is related to his addiction to narcotic substances, and, despite attempts over the years to come to terms with those addictions, he has been unable to do so, and when he has resumed the ingestion of narcotic substances, he has again entered a course of criminal conduct which has inevitably brought him back before the courts. Remarkably he has a very supportive wife who is a university qualified nurse and at those times when the applicant is not serving sentences, he provides her with transport and assists in caring, to a considerable extent, for the young children of the marriage. 
    4   Basically this is an ad misericordiam plea. In other words the applicant has thrown himself on the mercy of the Court and sought the Court, he being unrepresented, to review the sentences imposed by Judge Luland. However there is one specific matter to which attention should be drawn, in written submissions to the court the applicant said: 
     
      
       
       “I would like to ask this court to look at a previous psychiatric report which I was told was going to be presented to the court. I realise that it is from a previous conviction but it is still valid. In it you will see that I have had long periods of abstinence through the help of the methadone program and a supportive family. During this time I have worked and helped raise my family”. 
       
      
    5   That was a reference to a report of Dr Alex Sharah, dated 18 January 1996. Dr Sharah has apparently been treating the applicant for some time, at times with a successful methadone course, and at other times obviously without success. In the report, which was not before Judge Luland, reference is made to the fact that in 1995 the applicant was involved in a very serious motor vehicle accident which, in addition to orthopaedic injuries, caused brain damage to the applicant. The degree of that brain damage is not outlined in the report which of course is now over three years out of date. Nevertheless, it is clear enough that some brain damage was sustained in 1995. However, as I have already said, the applicant’s drug induced criminal record was well established by 1995. The report concludes: 
     
      
       
        
       “He is seeing me, discussing the issues of his life and coping with the stress of his depression and the accident as well as the unchanged relationship with his wife. He will continue to do this as necessary over the next year or two. If necessary also he will again recommence methadone rather than fall back into using the various medications and heroin. I have every confidence in his good sense and good will in treatment”. 
       
      
    6   In the submissions to this Court the applicant has also pointed out that during his most recent sentences he has undertaken drug and alcohol counselling and been to narcotics anonymous meetings. He said that he is now on a stable dose of methadone. He has also started a building studies course by correspondence with TAFE. He thought that he would have been an ideal candidate for the Drug Court at Parramatta. Perhaps this is so. He confirms that he still has the support of his wife and children and seeks an opportunity to return that support and, once more, become a part of their lives. Apart from the devotion of his wife and family, the history of this applicant is one that one sees with monotonous regularity in this Court. However as the presiding judge has pointed out to the applicant, apart from questions of sympathy and concern about the welfare of his family, the burden rests upon him of establishing that there was some error in the sentences imposed by Judge Luland, or in the reasons which he advanced for the imposition of those sentences.  
    7   Indeed when one looks at the applicant’s history of criminal offences, together with the seriousness of the two matters in respect of which he was charged and indicted, together with the serious matters on the Form 2’s, the irresistible conclusion is that Judge Luland, consistent as he had to be to the relevant principles of law, imposed sentences which were at the lower end of the discretionary sentencing range available to him. I am far from convinced that had those representing the applicant before Judge Luland elected to tender Dr Sharah’s report, that the sentences imposed by the judge could have been any more lenient. One suspects from reading the whole of the report, that there were forensic reasons why the election was obviously made not to tender that report. 
    8   One can only hope that during this period of incarceration the applicant can come to terms with his drug addiction, and upon his discharge lead a normal life supported by his wife and family. However on the basis of the material before this court, there is no foundation whatsoever for this Court to interfere with the sentences imposed by Judge Luland. It would be quite wrong to do so, and inconsistent with the well established sentencing principles.  
    9   Accordingly in the circumstances I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
    10   SULLY J: I agree. I think on this occasion we cannot do anything for you Mr Mitchell.

     REGINA v Anthony GIARRATANO 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   CARRUTHERS AJ: Anthony Giarratano seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Luland QC at the Penrith District Court on 23 July 1999. On that occasion his Honour was required to deal with six counts under s300(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900 (the ‘Act’) of making a false instrument. This offence attracts a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. His Honour was further required to deal with eight counts under s300(2) of the Act, of using a false instrument, which offence also attracts a maximum penalty of ten years penal servitude. 
    2   His Honour was then required to deal with 13 counts under s 34 of the Act, of stealing a valuable security, which offence attracts a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. The offences were committed over the period April 1994 to November 1995. 
    3   His Honour was also required to take into account 57 similar matters on a Form 1. 
    4   In relation to the first count, his Honour imposed a minimum term of two years penal servitude, to commence on 20 July 1999 and to expire on 19 July 2001. His Honour fixed an additional term of two years to commence on 20 July 2001 and to expire on 19 July 2003. In relation to counts 2 to 14, his Honour imposed a fixed term of eighteen months penal servitude to commence on 20 July 1999 and to expire on 19 January 2001. In relation to counts 14 to 27, his Honour imposed a fixed term of twelve months penal servitude to commence on 20 July 1999 and to expire on 19 July 2000. 
    5   Very shortly stated, the relevant facts are that the applicant was employed by a company, Combined Shipping Services Pty Limited, as a clerk. He was required to prepare cheques for payment to the company’s creditors. He saw to it that cheques were drawn and marked “Not Negotiable” as against valid invoices. Those cheques were then presented to the appropriate officers of the company who were signatories to cheques drawn by the company. Having obtained the appropriate signature, the applicant then took the cheques to the local Commonwealth Bank, having altered numerous of them by the additional words “Petty Cash”. For some extraordinary reason, bank tellers then handed cash to the applicant, which he used for the purposes of feeding his gambling addiction.  
    6   The amount of money involved by these criminal episodes was $367,000. His Honour was told that that money was repaid, not surprisingly, by the Commonwealth Bank to the company, Combined Shipping Services Pty Limited.  
    7   To say the least, it is almost beyond belief that bank tellers paid these cheques in cash over the counter to the applicant, whether they knew him or not. How it is that this criminal conduct continued for almost two years without the company’s senior officers becoming aware of the conduct is itself beyond belief, but this is the basis upon which the applicant stood for sentence and this is the basis upon which he was sentenced. 
    8   On the material before his Honour, the sentences imposed were so close to the lower end of the discretionary ambit allowed to his Honour that it is surprising that they did not attract Crown appeals. However, that did not happen. 
    9   Mr Giarratano has not appeared before this Court. Certain explanations have been advanced as to why that is so. He said, in written submissions, that he is finding gaol hard and he is missing his wife and three young children, who mean the world to him. He has advanced submissions directed to efforts at rehabilitation which he has made during the course of his incarceration.  
    10   There is no material at all before this Court to indicate that his Honour took into account any matter that he should not have taken into account, or failed to give due weight to the matters which he was required to take into account.  
    11   The application for leave to appeal is completely without foundation and, sympathetic as one must be to the fact that the applicant is separated from his wife and three young children, it is a matter which could not possibly attract leave from this Court to appeal. Accordingly, I would propose that leave to appeal be refused. 
    12   SULLY J: I agree. The order will be as proposed.

     REGINA v Wayne Bradley CAPPER 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1   THE COURT: The applicant has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 3 August 1999 following his guilty plea to one count that, on 19 November 1998, he was knowingly concerned in the importation of not less than a trafficable quantity of the drug colloquially known as ecstasy contrary s 233B (1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). 
    2   There is nothing remarkable about the circumstances of Mr Capper’s offence or the sentence which was imposed. The amount of ecstasy imported was 478.9 grams gross, equivalent to 167.1 grams pure. Under sch 6 of the Customs Act, .5 gram pure ecstasy is a trafficable quantity, and 500 grams pure is a commercial quantity. The maximum custodial sentence for Mr Capper’s offence was imprisonment for 25 years. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years. It was conceded both before this court and the sentencing judge that a custodial sentence was unavoidable. 
    3   In this Court, Mr Capper submitted that he should have received a more lenient sentence for only one reason; namely, that he was at all material times a sole parent of two children whose mother is hospitalised with mental illness, and that his sentence will probably have a serious detrimental effect upon those children, a matter which the sentencing judge was required to take into account under s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Mr Capper has two children, a girl now aged 12 years and a boy now aged 10 years. 
    4   There was evidence before the sentencing judge that Mr Capper was a very good father to the children, which her Honour obviously accepted. There was also evidence before the sentencing judge in the form of a psychologists’ report which pointed out that Mr Capper is the children’s “major source of support and affection” and that their separation from him would have a “deleterious effect” on their welfare. 
    5   One submission made on Mr Capper’s behalf was that the sentencing judge failed to take the probable effect of Mr Capper’s sentence on his children into account. However, that is patently erroneous. The sentencing remarks include the following statement” 
     
      
       
       “Mr Marshall, who appears for Mr Capper, has urged upon me the effect of the prisoner’s incarceration upon his two young children as a factor which would result in the imposition of a sentence significantly less than what would be otherwise be called for in the circumstances of this case. I take into account that hardship under s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914, but such hardship as there may be could not in my view cause me to draw back from imposing a full time custodial sentence in respect of the present offence.” 
       
      
      
     After sentencing Mr Capper, her Honour continued: 
      
      
       
       “Mr Capper, can I just say that your ability to parent these two children under the circumstances in which you have, are a credit to you. It brings me no pleasure to separate you from them and I know that as soon as you are released you will resume that fathering role.” 
       
      
    6   The other principal submission made on behalf on Mr Capper was that the sentencing judge did not give due weight to the probable effect of Mr Capper’s sentence upon his children. It is sufficient to mention two matters. 
    7   Without objection from the prosecution, an additional affidavit was filed in this Court on behalf of Mr Capper. The facts stated by the deponent, who describes herself as Mr Capper’s de facto wife for the last four years, were not contested. After Mr Capper was taken into custody, two respectable friends of an age suitable to care for the children took them “in a foster situation on a temporary basis”. On 10 February 2000, the Campsie Children’s Court declared the children wards under the Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987 until each obtains the age of 18 years. Since that date, the children have resided with the same foster parents at their residence at Manly on a permanent basis. According to statements made to the Children’s Court by a representative from the Department of Community Services, Mr Capper will be able to apply to vary the order declaring the children wards upon his release. 
    8   Subsection 16A(2) of the Crimes Act provides that, in determining the sentence to be passed in respect of any person for a federal offence, the Court must take into account, in addition to any other matters, “such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the Court”. Thirteen matters are specified, including “(p) the probable effect that any sentence … under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants.” Some of the matters specified in subs 16A(2) would, in appropriate circumstances, favour leniency, while others point in the opposite direction. For example, two of the matters referred for in s 16A(2) are: 
     
      
       
       “…. 
       
      
      
       
       (j) The deterrent effect that any sentence … under consideration may have on the person; 
       
      
      
       
       (k) The need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence; 
       
      
      
       
       ……”  
       
      
      
     The diversity of the specified factors and the tension between them emphasise the broad discretionary nature of the sentencing process. As s 16A(1) provides, the court’s function, taking all appropriate matters into account, is to “impose a sentence … that is of a severity appropriate to all the circumstances of the offence.”  
      
    9   There is obviously nothing in the circumstances associated with the length of Mr Capper’s sentence to give cause for speculation that a shorter period of imprisonment was called for because of s16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act. 
    10   The final submission from Mr Capper was that, even where there are no exceptional circumstances, the Court “…can…show some mercy”, a course adopted by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Carmody. (1998) 100 ACrimR 41. See per Tadgellja, with whom Winneke P and, Semble, Calloway JA agreed. 
    11   Assuming, without deciding, that “mercy” in the sense spoken of in Carmody 100 ACrimR 41. is applicable to an exercise of the sentencing power under the Crimes Act (Cth), there is nothing in the circumstances of this case which would justify this Court in reducing Mr Capper’s sentence for that reason. 
    12   For the above reasons, at the end of the hearing Mr Capper was refused leave to appeal.

     Regina v Raymond Gordon Watt 
      
      
      
     Judgment 
    2     HIDDEN J: The appellant, Raymond Gordon Watt, was tried before Woods DCJ, sitting without a jury, upon a charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of methyl-amphetamine. His Honour found him guilty and sentenced him to imprisonment for four years, comprising a minimum term of two and a half years and an additional term of one and a half years. He appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
        
       The Crown case 
        
       
      
    3     On four occasions between 22 January and 5 March 1996, one David Bowman supplied amphetamine to a man who was in fact an undercover police officer. On each occasion, the transaction took place at the car park of a hotel near Ourimbah. It was the Crown case that Bowman was acting on behalf of the appellant, who provided the drug and received the proceeds of the sales. 
     
      
       
      
    4     To link the appellant to Bowman’s activities, the Crown relied upon surveillance evidence and evidence of conversations between Bowman and the undercover officer which, it was said, demonstrated the appellant’s involvement. The undercover officer gave evidence of a number of telephone conversations with Bowman, in some of which there was reference to someone called “Ray”. That person was said to be the appellant, whose first name is Raymond. One could infer from those conversations that “Ray” was the source of the drugs which Bowman supplied to the undercover officer. Conversations between that officer and Bowman when they met at the hotel car park were recorded by a listening device. There was reference to “Ray” in their conversation on the last occasion, 5 March 1996, and the tape recording of that conversation was in evidence.  
     
      
       
      
    5     Evidence of all these conversations was admitted at the trial over objection. However, it appears from his Honour’s reasons for his verdict that, for the purpose of identifying the appellant as the person on whose behalf Bowman was acting, his Honour had regard only to the recorded conversation of 5 March. As he put it, he felt “more satisfied in looking to the objective material which is the tape-recorded material in contrast to what is not recorded”. His Honour then set out what he saw as the relevant part of that conversation. In the passage quoted, “Michael Johnson” is the assumed name of the undercover officer: 
     
      
       
        
         
         DAVID BOWMAN: Yes that’s the thing. 
         
        
        
         
         MICHAEL JOHNSON: Mate, seen Ray this morning? 
         
        
        
         
         DAVID BOWMAN: Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         MICHAEL JOHNSON: He has not got the shits with me has he? 
         
        
        
         
         DAVID BOWMAN: Oh Well…. 
         
        
        
         
         (then there is something indecipherable) 
         
        
        
         
         MICHAEL JOHNSON: Oh that’s the, that’s the man I just fucking, same as before, the only thing me missus was crook that is why I couldn’t fucking do it, you know, why I was going. I could not afford to sort of run away and leave her. That’s why. 
         
        
        
         
         DAVID BOWMAN: If you want more. 
         
        
        
         
         MICHAEL JOHNSON:Yep 
         
        
        
         
         DAVID BOWMAN: He could do another 8 on Thursday…. 
         
        
        
         
         (then there is something which is difficult to hear) 
         
        
        
         
         MICHAEL JOHNSON: Thursday? 
         
        
        
         
         DAVID BOWMAN: Yeah. 
         
        
        
       The tape reveals further references to the possibility of “eight” being supplied on the following Thursday. 
        
       
      
    6     The undercover officer gave evidence but David Bowman did not. There was other evidence implicating the appellant, to which I shall turn later. The appellant himself did not give evidence. However, there was in evidence a recorded interview with police, in which he acknowledged his friendship with David Bowman but denied any knowledge of the supply of drugs to the undercover officer.  
     
      
       
        
       Admissibility of Bowman conversations 
        
       
      
    7     In this Court, counsel for the appellant maintained the argument he had presented at the trial that evidence of the conversations between Bowman and the undercover officer, in so far as they purported to identify the appellant as being involved, were inadmissible. His Honour allowed the evidence by virtue of s87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
         (1) For the purpose of determining whether a previous representation made by a person is also taken to be an admission by a party, the court is to admit the representation if it is reasonably open to find that: 
          
         …… 
          
          (c) the representation was made by the person in furtherance of a common purpose (whether lawful or not) that the person had with the party or one or more persons including the party. 
         
        
       
      
    8     In R v Macraild (CCA, unreported, 3 November 1997), this Court held that s87(1)(c) reproduces the common law relating to the admissibility against an accused of the declarations of other parties to a common purpose or of co-conspirators: Tripodi v The Queen (1961) 104 CLR 1, Ahern v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 94-5. Before the statements of Bowman the subject of this ground could be admitted, there had to be “reasonable evidence of the preconcert” between the appellant and him: Tripodi at 7. His Honour found that there was and that finding was not challenged before us. 
     
      
       
      
    9     However, it was also necessary for the statements to have been made in furtherance of the alleged common purpose. In my view, there were several statements of Bowman in his telephone conversations with the undercover officer which might have fallen into that category. However, as I have said, his Honour ultimately had regard only to the tape recorded conversation of 5 March. On that occasion it was the undercover officer who introduced the appellant into the conversation, and the only statements of Bowman relating the appellant to the supply of drugs were the references to the possibility of arranging “another eight” on the following Thursday.  
     
      
       
      
    10     True it is that those statements tend to identify the appellant as involved with Bowman in the supply of drugs. Nevertheless, the charge against the appellant was of his knowingly taking part in the supply of methyl- amphetamine between 21 January and 6 March 1996 (5 March being the day of the last meeting between Bowman and the undercover officer, and the day of the appellant’s arrest). Statements about the possible supply by the appellant of drugs on a day well outside that period could not be characterised as being in furtherance of the common purpose embraced by the offence charged. 
     
      
       
      
    11     It may well have been unduly favourable to the appellant for his Honour to confine himself to the conversation of 5 March. Nevertheless, what Bowman had to say about the appellant on that occasion was not admissible against him. Accordingly, this ground of appeal is made out but the question remains whether any substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. It is necessary, then, to examine the other grounds of appeal and the other evidence in the case.  
     
      
       
        
       Admissibility of scales 
        
       
      
    12     On 5 March 1996 police searched the appellant’s premises and found, among other things, a set of scales, some glucodin and a number of re-sealable plastic bags. His Honour admitted this evidence on the basis that those items are commonly part of the paraphernalia of a drug dealer: Sultana (1992) 74 ACrim R 27. On appeal, it was contended that the finding of the scales was inadmissible as the evidence could not justify the conclusion that they were in the appellant’s possession. 
     
      
       
      
    13     The appellant conducted a take-away food business at Killarney Vale and lived in a flat above the shop. The scales were found in a small leather carry bag, which was itself contained in a black back-pack on top of a wardrobe in his bedroom. Evidence was also admitted of the finding of certain documents in the wardrobe tending to establish that it was used by him. 
     
      
       
      
    14     A witness was called in the defence case who had worked in the appellant’s shop for about a month prior to his arrest. According to this witness, David Bowman had unrestricted access to the appellant’s flat and on three or four occasions had gone up there to shower and change his clothes. It seems that he had asked the appellant if he could leave some clothes there because he was having marital problems. On one occasion the witness saw Mr Bowman arrive with what was described as a “black haversack”, and leave without it. 
     
      
       
      
    15     It was this evidence which gave rise to the submission that the back-pack in which the scales were found could not adequately be linked to the appellant. An analogy was sought to be drawn with the decision of this Court in Filippetti (1978) 13 ACrim R 335. That, however, was a very different case. The appellant in that case shared a house with five other people, and the cannabis the subject of the charge was found concealed in a chair in a loungeroom to which all of them had access. In the present case, the scales were found in a room which was clearly the appellant’s private domain. Notwithstanding the evidence in the defence case to which I have referred, it was open to his Honour to conclude that the back-pack and its contents were in the appellant’s possession and the evidence was properly admitted. 
     
      
       
        
       Unreasonable verdict 
        
       
      
    16     Finally, it was submitted that his Honour’s verdict was unsupported by the evidence: Fleming v The Queen (1998) 158 ALR 379. In considering this ground, I have put to one side the evidence of the tape recorded conversation of 5 March 1996. However, there was a circumstantial case of the appellant’s involvement from surveillance evidence and the evidence of the police officers who arrested him on that day.  
     
      
       
      
    17     The third occasion on which Bowman supplied drugs to the undercover police officer was on 27 February 1996. The undercover officer paid him a substantial amount in cash. Bowman was under surveillance, and he was observed to drive to a location in Killarney Vale near the appellant’s shop. The appellant was seen to approach the car, carrying a white plastic bag and constantly looking around. He got into the car and emerged about ten minutes later, carrying a black clutch bag. 
     
      
       
      
    18     On 5 March 1996 Bowman was seen to leave the appellant’s shop and get into his car, which was parked in much the same spot where it had been seen on 27 February. He drove to Ourimbah for what was to be his last meeting with the undercover officer, and on that occasion the officer gave him a large amount of cash in a brown paper bag. He was then observed to drive back to Killarney Vale, park near the appellant’s shop and enter that shop from the rear, carrying the brown paper bag. 
     
      
       
      
    19     At this point there appears to be a conflict in the police evidence. According to two officers who arrested Bowman and the appellant, they went to the rear door and were able to see the two men in the back of the shop. The brown paper bag containing the money was on a bench. Bowman was talking to the appellant and appeared to be indicating the bag to him, and the appellant was looking at it. The officers entered the shop and one of them shouted, “Police, get on the ground, on the ground.” Other police were in the front of the shop at the time of the arrest. According to them, the appellant walked from the front of the shop to the rear and, almost immediately, they heard the words shouted by their colleague.  
     
      
       
      
    20     His Honour referred to this evidence in the reasons for his verdict but, it would seem, did not find it necessary to resolve it. It was not in contest that the bag containing the money was in the back of the shop, although in his interview with the police the appellant denied knowledge of it. Whether or not the appellant and Bowman were discussing the money immediately before their arrest, his Honour saw the presence of such a large sum in the shop as significant of itself. As his Honour put it:  
     
      
       
        
         
         …if there was not an arrangement such as the prosecution urges, why in the name of heaven would Mr Bowman bring back a brown paper bag full of $9,000 and put it on the shelf in the back of the shop? That, it seems to me, is the clinching aspect of this entire case, which is not to say other facts are not important.  
         
        
       
      
    21     His Honour’s verdict appears to have been based primarily upon this evidence of police observations of Bowman and the appellant, together with the evidence of the search of the appellant’s premises. I can detect no error in his Honour’s analysis of that evidence or of his assessment of its significance. In my view, it was more than adequate to support a finding of guilt. 
     
      
       
      
    22     For the same reason, I do not consider that the conviction should be set aside because of his Honour’s use of the tape recorded conversation of 5 March, even though I have found it to be in error. That evidence did not loom large in his Honour’s reasons and, in all the circumstances, I am satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
        
       Sentence 
        
       
      
    23     As I have said, his Honour sentenced the appellant to four years imprisonment, comprising a minimum term of two and a half years and an additional term of one and a half years. The offence carries a maximum sentence of twenty years. Bowman was sentenced, after a plea of guilty, to imprisonment for two years and eight months, comprising a minimum term of two years and an additional term of eight months.  
     
      
       
      
    24     His Honour considered the appellant’s involvement to be greater than that of Bowman, although not significantly so. That finding was challenged in this Court but it is one which was clearly open. Certainly, the total sentence passed upon the applicant is considerably higher than Bowman’s, although the difference in their minimum terms is not so marked. On the other hand, we have no information about Bowman’s background and antecedents and, on the limited evidence before us, it does not appear to me that we could intervene on the basis of unjustified disparity.  
     
      
       
      
    25     The total weight of the drugs supplied was about 400gm, the commercial quantity for methyl-amphetamine being 250gm. His Honour noted that the purity of the drug was low, suggesting that this was not a particularly sophisticated criminal enterprise. The appellant is forty-eight years old. His criminal record includes convictions in 1992 on three counts of supplying a prohibited drug, for which he was sentenced to imprisonment, but is otherwise insignificant. 
     
      
       
      
    26     He has three children, although he and his partner have been separated for several years. There was evidence that he is devoted to his children and that he has maintained a good relationship with their mother. He had a good employment record, despite a disturbed childhood and a long history of drug abuse. It was that background which led his Honour to find special circumstances, so as to fix a longer than usual additional term.  
     
      
       
      
    27     It was argued that the appellant was entitled to leniency because of the measure of entrapment involved in the case: R v Taouk (1993) 65 ACrim R 387, per Badgery-Parker J at 393-404. This was not a matter to which his Honour referred at all in his remarks on sentence. It is true that the offences were facilitated by the conduct of the police, although at all times the appellant was at arm’s length from them. It appears that it was Bowman, rather than the appellant, who was the initial target of their investigation. 
     
      
       
      
    28     That said, the evidence establishes that the appellant, for profit, provided drugs to Bowman for the purpose of their being supplied to another. There is nothing to suggest any reluctance on his part to do so. Equally, while the offence was relatively unsophisticated, there is no basis for the conclusion that it would not have been committed but for the overtures of the police. This case is a far cry from cases such as R v N (1999) 106 ACrim R 493, in which Spigelman CJ (at 504) affirmed the sentencing principles expounded by Badgery-Parker J in Taouk. To borrow the words of Badgery-Parker J (Taouk at 404), it cannot be said of the appellant that “in all the circumstances of the case the involvement of the police in the commission of the crime was such as to diminish his culpability”.  
     
      
       
      
    29     It was not argued that the sentence was, in any event, manifestly excessive. I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but would dismiss that appeal also. 
     
      
       
      
    30     Accordingly, I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed. As to sentence, I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     REGINA v. RAYMOND GORDON WATT 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
    31     GREG JAMES, J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden, J. Except with respect to his view that the conversation of 5 March was not admissible, I agree with his reasons for those orders. 
     
      
       
      
    32     In my view, for that conversation to be admissible against this appellant as an admission by him as made by the speaker with his authority, the trial judge merely had to be satisfied that it was made in furtherance of a (not the) common purpose (s.87(1)(c)), and that there was reasonable evidence of pre-concert between them for that purpose (as there was). 
     
      
       
      
    33     In this case, the common purpose charged was that in furtherance of which the statement was made because it included the supply on the charged dates and on others (see Regina v. Macraild (CCA, unreported 3 November 1997 at 7, per Dunford, J.). 
     
      
       
      
    34     For my part, I would regard the conversation as admissible and do not see that it should have been excluded as second-hand hearsay or in discretion.

     TUESDAY 18 JULY 2000 
      
      
      
      REGINA v. DEAN RICHARD LULHAM 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: In the remarks on sentence which I will shortly deliver and in the transcript of these proceedings, reference is made to a person who gave evidence. I order that in the published remarks on sentence and in any published transcript of argument or evidence in these proceedings, that person be referred to by the pseudonym ""DT"". 
    2   I have already sentenced the present offender's co-accused on their respective pleas of guilty for their respective crimes and the roles each of them played in the events which have also given rise to the charge against this offender. 
    3   He was charged that he on 12 November 1998 at Beechwood in the State of New South Wales did murder Robert Christopher Spradbrow. Following those pleas by the others being entered, this offender pleaded guilty to that charge. DT had already pleaded guilty to that charge. 
    4   On that plea the prisoner has challenged to some degree the respective roles in the killing and the asserted culpability of DT and himself. It therefore became necessary to hold a hearing to ascertain the relevant facts. At that hearing a file of documents, Exhibit A, was tendered. The file included a statement of facts as contended for by the Crown, the offender's criminal history, transcripts of electronically recorded interviews with various witnesses, including with the co-accused, DT and two interviews with the offender. 
    5   That statement of facts to which I have referred was prepared by Detective Lysaught. He gave evidence before me on the plea and was cross-examined. That statement (amended to reflect the pseudonym order) reads as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""1. The prisoner is a native of Beechwood, which is a small village west of Wauchope on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. Both communities of Beechwood and Wauchope are small and residents are close knit. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       2. On the afternoon of Thursday 12 November 1998 this prisoner was at a swimming hole on the outskirts of Beechwood, known as Kooree Island. He was there with [DT]. Both were consuming intoxicating liquor. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       3. While both were at the swimming hole the victim, Robert Christopher Spradbrow arrived with his girlfriend, Katie Andrews. The victim and his girlfriend went to one area of the river bank away from the prisoner and [DT]. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       4. The victim was well known to the prisoner and [DT] and both had had prior dealings with the victim over the years. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       5. The prisoner and [DT] discussed their prior involvements with the victim and the prisoner had suggested that [DT] should shoot the victim. The prisoner left the area of the swimming hole and travelled to the nearby dairy farm, where he worked. There he borrowed a .22 rifle and some ammunition from his employer. The prisoner returned to the Kooree Island swimming hole with the rifle. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       6. There further discussions took place in relation to shooting the victim. Other persons were present at the swimming hole and nothing further occurred. The prisoner and [DT] left Kooree Island and went to the home of the prisoner in the main street of Beechwood. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       7. They continued to consume liquor and for a short time were joined by a friend. They continued to discuss the victim and what the victim had done in the past. Whilst [the friend] was there, further mention was made of shooting the victim. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       8. After some time the prisoner and [DT] left the home of the prisoner. They drove to the hotel where [the friend] joined them. At the time [the friend] was intoxicated. The three men travelled back to Kooree Island in a vehicle belonging to the prisoner's employer. Upon arrival at the swimming hole the victim's vehicle was still parked where it had been when the prisoner and [DT] had left earlier in the evening. The victim and Miss Andrews were camping on the river bank and both were asleep on a mattress. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       9. At the insistence of the prisoner, [DT] had walked to where the victim and Miss Andrews were sleeping. At the time [DT] was carrying the .22 calibre rifle in his hands. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       10. [DT] had walked up to the victim, who did not awake. [DT] put the rifle to the head of the victim and pulled the trigger. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       11. [DT] returned to the car and was driven away by the prisoner. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       12. When they were near the Beechwood cemetery the rifle was thrown from the vehicle. The three men returned to the home of the prisoner. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       13. The prisoner retired for the night. [DT] and [the friend] returned to the cemetery in the vehicle of [the woman co-accused]. She was driving. The rifle was recovered and taken to a point at the intersection of Beechwood Road and Pappinbarra Road where the rifle was secreted in long grass. They then returned home. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       14. At about 10.00 p.m. on Friday 13 November 1998 the prisoner and [the woman co-accused] went to the area of Kooree Island. There the prisoner was spoken to by police and accompanied them to the Port Macquarie police station. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       15. At 11.19 p.m. that evening the prisoner entered into an electronically recorded interview with Detective Lysaught. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       16. During that interview the prisoner told the police that he had been at Kooree Island on the evening in question. He denied knowledge of the events leading to the death of the victim. He told the police he had spoken with the victim that night and they had reconciled their differences. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       17. The prisoner was then told he could leave the police station. Whilst being processed he made certain comments as a result of which at 12.25 a.m. on Saturday 14 November 1998 he commenced a second interview with Detective Lysaught. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       18. During this interview the prisoner told the police that he had obtained the gun for the purpose of shooting mullet in the river. He said that he got the gun before the victim had arrived at the swimming hole. He again asserted he had gone over and made his peace with the victim. He told the police that he and [DT] had left the area and returned some time later. He told the police that [DT] had shot the victim but that he did not know that [DT] was going to do that. He asserted he thought [DT] was going over to speak with the victim. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       19. Following the interview the prisoner attempted to show the police where the rifle had been disposed of. It could not be located. He accompanied police to the home of [the woman co-accused] where [DT], [the friend] and [the woman co-accused]were arrested."" 
       
      
    6   The offender was arrested on 14 November 1998 following the interview to which I have referred. He has been in custody continuously ever since. His sentence should therefore date from that day and I take into account in accordance with s. 24 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which Act is now applicable to the sentencing of this offender, the time during which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence. 
    7   When I came to deal with the woman offender and the friend, I deferred passing sentence upon their entering into recognisances consequent upon their pleas to counts of concealing a serious offence. 
    8   On DT's plea of guilty he was convicted and I sentenced him to penal servitude for 16 years, comprising a minimum term of 12 years and an additional term of four years, to date from the date he was taken into custody. 
    9   Subsequent to the plea by the offender DT, the present offender's trial was adjourned and some three days prior to the sentence being passed upon DT, the offender before me pleaded guilty to the murder. That plea was entered and accepted on the basis that he was not the principal in the first degree. He was convicted on that plea. 
    10   In the proceedings on the plea of DT, I reached a number of conclusions having in mind the onus in those proceedings and the evidence there given to which I had regard. 
    11   Certain of those findings are challenged in the present proceedings, most notably the finding I made that DT had been procured to commit the crime by the present offender, and that the present offender had manipulated DT's mind to cause him to kill Mr. Spradbrow. 
    12   It is accepted by the Crown in the present proceedings that this offender and DT should be treated as equally culpable, and by that I understand that the Crown does not contend that any greater culpability than DT's should be found against the present offender in the present proceedings by reason of the assertions made by DT, both in his evidence at his own trial and in his evidence in these proceedings, that this offender had sought that he kill Spradbrow. Indeed, I expressed in my remarks on sentence concerning the account of these events given by DT that I had reservations particularly in respect of this matter. 
    13   I am not satisfied on the evidence before me in the present proceedings that I should make any finding that the role of the offender extended beyond providing the fatal weapon to DT, driving him to the scene at which the crime was committed, realising when he did so that DT would kill the deceased if the deceased was still there and present. 
    14   I accept that there had been earlier discussions including threats to kill the deceased. I accept in relation to this offender, as I did in relation to DT, that there was a real basis believed in by the offender to support the apprehension he had of the deceased and his resentment towards the deceased. It is not necessary for me to consider whether the account of the various events set out in the confession provided by this offender to DT, which became Exhibit 6 and which contains substantial lies, are true in fact. It is sufficient to say that an examination of those matters as therein set out indicate an ample basis for both fear and resentment by the offender of the deceased and the Crown does not challenge that the offender may well have had that belief of the deceased. I accept he did. 
    15   Further, there is material both in the evidence of independent witnesses and in the Probation and Parole report that this offender had on former occasions made statements amounting to threats to kill the deceased. 
    16   When I sentenced DT, I referred to the killing as vicious and cowardly. Not only was the killing by DT vicious and cowardly but the assent to that killing and the role played by this offender in assisting that killing was equally vicious and cowardly. Both offenders were affected severely by alcohol. The idea appears to have floated on a sea of intoxication and it gained substance as the day wore on, but it was the production by this offender of the gun that enabled the intention to crystallise when it did and to be carried out. Nonetheless the role this offender performed was not that of the assassin, even though the aid and assent to the assassination were his. In this respect I do not accept entirely the Crown's submission that both offenders should be treated alike. 
    17   I have mentioned that there are matters in the statement of facts which were challenged. They included that the offender suggested killing the deceased as early as when they were first at the scene. I accept that something to the effect of killing the deceased was said; I am not satisfied that what was said represented some intentional and deliberate proposal to kill. 
    18   It was also challenged that DT had walked to where the victim and Miss Andrews were sleeping and shot the victim at the instance of the offender. The plea of this offender has proceeded on the basis that both the offender and DT at the time at which the deceased was killed had agreed he be killed and that DT killed in accordance with that agreement. I do not find, particularly in the light of the Crown's concession in argument, that DT did anything other than that he had willingly agreed to do. I do not find that he was a puppet or a tool of this offender. I do find that they agreed together that the death should be occasioned and except in relation to that difference in role of an objective kind to which I have referred and will refer to again later, their moral culpability is equal. 
    19   I do not accept, as I have said, the more dominant role DT attributed to this offender in his later interview. I do not accept the offender's denial of knowledge that at the time they returned to the island the deceased would be killed. I do accept the offender's statement to the police that at the time they returned to the island DT was going to kill the deceased and I am satisfied the offender knew then what was going to happen. 
    20   DT not only pleaded guilty, not only gave an undertaking to give evidence against the offender, either on his plea or his trial, but, although I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on certain of the matters, particularly as going to the mitigation of DT's guilt, of which he gave evidence in these proceedings, nonetheless I am satisfied that as between the two, DT has done what he could in that regard and therefore when I came to sentence him I gave a substantial reduction in sentence. 
    21   Following the offender entering the plea of guilty and at a time after which DT had given evidence and been cross-examined, the offender sought to withdraw his plea. This was at a time at which counsel then appearing had informed me of those matters of fact which were then disputed. During the ensuing discussions it became clear that the real crux of this offender's contention was that the idea of killing the deceased, although raised earlier did not crystallise until after the gun and bullets were obtained by the offender, so that the gun, it was said, I could not find was obtained for the specific crystallised purpose of performing the killing. 
    22   In this regard I was referred to the various interviews by the various offenders with the police and the various changes in what was said by the offender and the various matters in his accounts which were later revealed to be lies. I am unable to conclude that there was a real pattern in these lies except as explained by a panic stricken attempt to deny guilt for an appalling episode of criminality carried out while heavily intoxicated. 
    23   I note that at the time in question although the offender had drunk a considerable quantity of liquor, it does not seem to me in this case any more than it seemed in that of DT, that that ingestion of alcohol and the intoxication should be considered as either mitigating or aggravating circumstances. 
    24   On the other hand, insofar as there were attempted lies and deception, there is a limited amount of assistance the offender can derive from them as co-operation and they do not show contrition, since they contain lies either seeking to shift or minimise guilt. 
    25   I note also that the offender's initial interview with the police and his assistance to the police and attempts to locate the murder weapon were such as to be of some assistance, albeit that assistance was not as a result of an unalloyed intent to tell the truth. But it is accepted by the Crown that that assistance was, albeit given in the geographical confines of that small close knit community such as might in the upshot be of limited value, was of some but minimal value. 
    26   The plea on this offender's part was initially delayed, it seems to me not so much because of an unwillingness to accept some involvement in the events, but because of a mistaken view that such a plea might have been inappropriate to enable rebuttal of what this offender considered to be an over-emphasis on his role and culpability. 
    27   In my judgment dismissing the offender's application to withdraw the plea I referred to this matter also. In those proceedings the offender gave short evidence in which he did not condescend to particularity in his assertion he was not guilty of the offence charged. He did not deny any particular matter of fact but merely gave evidence in a form such as to plead the general issue. 
    28   On the hearing of this plea he did not give evidence but thanks to a careful, precise and greatly assisting analysis by the Crown Prosecutor I have been able to deal with the matter, resolving it on the basis that I have set out. 
    29   I note the provision of the information and that information was accompanied by a lack of completeness and by lies. I note that the minimal assistance provided does not indicate any adverse consequences to the offender. I will in those circumstances give some degree of lesser penalty, as is provided by s.22, but again, that lesser penalty will be little. 
    30   It remains further when considering the fact of the withdrawal of the plea to note that although I am required by s.22 to take into account the plea of guilty, in this case there appears no evidence of specific contrition, although there is some evidence of a recognition and regret on his part for his guilt in producing the gun. Although the costs to the community of a trial have been avoided, nonetheless the application for withdrawal of plea has occasioned considerable cost and inconvenience and court time. Nonetheless I do propose to impose a lesser penalty as is referred to in s.22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 although not, in the circumstances, a penalty lesser to any great extent. 
    31   I have already said that I would treat the victim's impact statement of the deceased's mother in accordance with the principles in Previtera v. The Queen (1997) 94 A. Crim. R. 76. 
    32   In considering the offender's circumstances I must also have regard to his prior record. That record indicates an involvement in matters of larceny in 1984 and assault in 1991. There are traffic offences as well but, most importantly, a two-year recognisance was imposed on him on 14 November 1997 at the Port Macquarie Local Court and was current at the time of the commission of this offence. In that respect the offender is in a more serious position than DT. 
    33   It has been submitted by counsel now appearing on his behalf, and in my view appropriately, that I am unable to be satisfied that he was either the instigator or the prime mover, and that I am unable to be satisfied of those matters to which I have referred earlier about which DT gave evidence which seemed to be relied upon to aggravate this offender's culpability above that of DT. 
    34   It is further submitted that that difference in role to which I earlier referred should offset or offset at least to some degree the discount DT had received for his plea and co-operation, and that in these proceedings, and that I should proceed on a parity basis (see Postiglione v. The Queen (1997) 98 A. Crim. R. 134 and Hodges v. The Queen (1997) 95 A. Crim. R. 85)). It was submitted, notwithstanding the change in the sentencing regime as a consequence of the passing of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that I should conclude that the offender should receive the same sentence as DT received. 
    35   The submission impliedly embraced the propositions that when considering the onus and the differing evidence I should in the present proceedings accept that the matters which diminished the sentence that I might otherwise have passed on DT were such as to flow over to the benefit of this offender or that they were equivalent. In relation to this parity submission, since DT had matters proved in evidence in his favour personal to him and more generally to consider this offender's individual position, it is necessary to turn then to subjective considerations. 
    36   This offender is a 35 year old single man. He is 10 years older than DT. However that fact alone does not in my submission warrant on the facts of this case, considering I am not prepared to find that overweening influence to which I have referred, that the offender should be the subject of adverse discrimination. 
    37   The offender has been employed his entire working life as a casual farm hand. He has not responded successfully to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service in respect of an alcohol and drug problem which is of long standing and which affects him grossly. He is an only child of parents who never married, and never lived together. He was raised by his mother and grandfather and has sought to maintain a satisfactory relationship with his mother and his step-brother. 
    38   The family background is characterised by incidents of abuse and alcohol. His father has apparently now given up alcohol. This is noteworthy considering the family background. Excessive alcohol consumption was noted as being prevalent and still prevalent amongst all other family members. 
    39   The offender commenced to work at the age of 16 after a limited educational background. He has had from time to time domestic relationships which have not been a success, although he has a son, aged 14 years. It is not surprising that the alcohol ingestion has produced a dysfunctional social environment, indeed it is conceded that he has a chronic alcohol problem. It is to his credit, however, that his current girlfriend, notwithstanding this, described him as otherwise a loving and caring person when not intoxicated, but one who does revert to statements of a violent kind although not to actual physical violence when drunk. His record, however, refers to instances of physical violence. 
    40   He appears to have been trusted in his employment as a farm hand and notwithstanding the fact of this offence, his employer indicates that there will still be future employment for him. His alcohol consumption was exacerbated by daily marijuana use from an early age and which continued up until his son was born some 14 years ago. 
    41   It is obvious that this is a man who would have to give consideration to entering an appropriate drug and alcohol rehabilitation program if he is to be at liberty. 
    42   As he has referred to in his confession, exhibit 6, the offender told the Probation and Parole Service officer of the previous incidents between himself and the victim, from which I observe that it is clear that he was both apprehensive of the victim and resented him. But to that officer he was entirely vague as to what happened leading to the death of the deceased. He is accepted by the officer as a depressed man who now has some awareness of his behavioural problems and who has had time to reflect, and recognise family problems and personal relationships such as to suggest that there is some hope that an adjustment of behaviour problems could occur given appropriate circumstances and opportunity. 
    43   That report should be considered in the context of a report with which I have been provided by Associate Professor Robyn Tate at the Rehabilitation Studies Unit at the University of Sydney. That report refers to various incidents in which the offender in the past had suffered injury, the most notable of which was when he was bashed on the head with a wheel brace, sustaining some fourteen stitches, in 1996. That incident is notable because I have been informed that the assailant was DT, and that goes some way, albeit not very far, to support the proposition that DT could not be regarded as invariably his puppet. 
    44   That report documents substance abuse of alcohol and drugs, with that alcohol abuse increasing some eight years ago after the mother of his son severed the relationship with him. From that time on apparently the offender has started drinking first thing in the morning, ""that's all I thought about - it was good at first ... I love drinking first thing in the morning."". He was apparently drinking a cask of wine a day. His eating was sporadic, he was losing weight and may well have been suffering from a psychiatric condition. His memory was variable. 
    45   Professor Tate notes that he has difficulties in recollection, he has difficulties in understanding and although he apparently co-operated with the testing psychologist. Professor Tate was able to conclude that he was a man of average intelligence whose performances on psychological assessment ranged from above average down to severely impaired. His attention and speed of cognitive processing was intact but at a lower level. His memory and learning were poor. He scored in the severely impaired range on a non-verbal equivalent assessment. 
    46   The conclusion was that he suffers from brain dysfunction with notable deficits leading to thought processes of a disorganised kind which adversely impacted upon his recall. On testing he became increasingly confused and incompetent in discriminating correct from incorrect information, and his cognitive skills broke down completely. 
    47   These deficits most affected his memory and would impact, so Professor Tate opined, on a broader range of cognitive functions, including his ability to appreciate and process information. He would become easily confused and unable to recall what information was correct. I accept this evidence and find that it provides a valuable context to the formation of the intent to kill and the offender's actions on the day. 
    48   I found this report particularly of assistance in the context of the way in which this plea has proceeded, and the way in which the offender had provided statements to the police. It confirmed the view that I have already expressed, that there was no underlying plan or pattern in the various accounts he gave and in what he has done subsequent to the killing otherwise than is explicable by a panic stricken attempt to avoid full culpability for an appalling crime carried out under the effects of liquor. 
    49   The Crown has submitted that the objective criminality was of the highest order, that the offender was the first to suggest the deceased should be killed. As to this submission, notwithstanding what had been said by the independent witnesses, that it was this offender who first raised the subject, I do not accept that this offender was the first to propose a concrete course that the deceased should be killed. I do accept he was the first that day to raise the subject which both he and DT had referred to on prior occasions. 
    50   The Crown has further submitted that if I am not satisfied as to the truth of DT's assertion that when driven back to the island he walked down to where the deceased and his girlfriend were, and then returned to the offender's car before walking down again to carry out the shooting, I should nonetheless not see the criminality of this offender as reduced. 
    51   I do not accept on the evidence in this case DT's assertion that the offender encouraged him to go back down to where the deceased lay, to kill him. Absent the acceptance of that matter, whether DT made one or two journeys only would be significant for the period of time during which the offender had a crystallised intent that the deceased should be killed. It seems to me that in accord with the intoxication under which they both laboured, and the driving out there in the way described, that I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was more than one journey made. 
    52   However, I accept that the offender drove back with DT with the gun, after a discussion of killing, realised that killing was to occur and assented to it. He provided the gun, he provided the transport to the scene and his assent was to the gun being used. He must have anticipated that the deceased was likely to be present even if he wasn't sure the deceased would be there. 
    53   That assent in itself was at least encouragement. The killing would not have occurred if this offender had not obtained the firearm and ammunition. It would not have occurred if he had not driven DT to the location where the deceased was camped for the night. His assent was in those circumstances borne out by his actions. 
    54   I conclude that there is little to choose between the two offenders, but that although the offender was not the actual assassin, he should not receive such parity as would produce an identical sentence to that imposed upon DT. I have concluded that I should pass upon the offender, having regard to the matters in mitigation to which I have referred, and in particular having regard to the sentence I passed upon DT, a sentence which will also embrace the prospects for rehabilitation referred to in the Probation and Parole Service report. 
    55   I do not consider that there are any special circumstances such as s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 refers to in the context of the sentence I propose. I do not consider that there is a need for a variation of the statutory provisions since then there does not seem to me to be a need for a longer period of supervision than that which would operate by imposition of a sentence reflecting the statutory proportion. 
    56   I propose, having regard to those matters, to sentence the offender to a sentence of 18 years to date from 14 November 1998, and to set a non-parole period, that is a minimum period for which he must be kept in detention in relation to the offence of 13½ years, to date from that day. 
     
     CROWN PROSECUTOR: The sentence will expire on 13 May 2012. That is the day on which he becomes eligible for parole.HIS HONOUR: What is the date upon which the sentence will expire?CROWN PROSECUTOR: 13 November 2016.HIS HONOUR: Mr. Lulham, will you rise? Mr. Lulham, I sentence you to imprisonment for 18 years, that sentence to commence on 14 November 1998. I sent a non-parole period of 13½ years, to commence on that day, 14 November 1998. You will become eligible for release on parole on 13 May 2012. Your sentence will expire on 13 November 2016.

       REGINA v ANTHONY PHILLIP HOCKING 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1    IRELAND AJ: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1912 against the reduced sentence imposed upon the respondent by his Honour Judge Knight at the District Court at Griffith on 11 February 1999. 
     
      
    2    Section 5DA relevantly provides as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking. 
         
         
        (2) On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit. 
         
         
        (3) … 
        
       
      
    3    On 1 February 1999, the respondent was indicted before Knight DCJ on one count of robbery in company pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act, 1900. The maximum penalty for an offence in contravention of this section is 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4    At the time of the commission of the offence, the respondent was on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for 2 years, imposed on 12 September 1996 at Narrandera Local Court, for an offence of break, enter and steal. On 11 February 1999, his Honour sentenced the respondent to a minimum term of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 16 January 1999 and expiring on 15 January 2001 and an additional term of 12 months commencing on 16 January 2001 and expiring on 15 January 2002. 
     
      
    5    The sentence imposed on the respondent was made cumulative to six concurrent sentences of 9 months imprisonment for unrelated offences, including assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault, imposed on 14 August 1998 at Narrandera Local Court. 
     
      
    6    Knight DCJ recommended that no further action be taken in relation to the breach of recognisance. 
     
      
    7    In structuring the sentence to be imposed, his Honour indicated that, pursuant to s 442B of the Crimes Act, 1900, he would take into account the respondent's assistance and offer of assistance in relation to his co-offenders, Neville Bamblett and DB, both of whom had not, at that stage, been dealt with by the courts. The respondent had made a statement to police on 1 February 1999 concerning the involvement of both of those individuals in the offence. This statement was tendered and became Exhibit H. 
     
      
    8    On 11 February 1999, the respondent gave evidence before Knight DCJ during the proceedings on sentence. He identified his statement, Exhibit H, and was asked the following series of questions and gave the following answers:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. In the statement you told the police about the part you played in the crime that's now before the Court? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you also told the police about the part that a Mr Bamblett and a  
        (DB)  
        played, is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You're aware are you Mr Hocking that the judge when sentencing you may well take into account the fact that you have assisted the authorities? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And he may reflect that assistance in his sentence? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you tell his Honour on oath, that you, if required by the Crown, will give evidence at the trial of Mr Bamblett and  
        (DB)  
        in relation to this crime? 
         
        A. Yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you tell his Honour on oath that the evidence you will give at that trial will be in accordance with the statement that you have made on 1 February 1999? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You are aware, are you not, Mr Hocking that should you fail to honour the undertaking that you've just given his Honour then the Crown would appeal the sentence that his Honour will impose, are you aware of that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. To the Court of Criminal Appeal and they will then re-sentence you because you have not stood by your undertaking, do you understand that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But understanding that you do tell his Honour that you do propose giving evidence? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you propose giving it in accordance with this statement? 
         
        A. Yes.""  
        (T 10-11) 
        
       
      
    9    In cross-examination, at that time, the respondent was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""FOX: Q. Mr Hocking, you understand that it would require your attendance at any Court proceedings in relation to  
        (DB)  
        or Mr Bamblett? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that may include committal proceedings, that is at the magistrate's court? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And also maybe later in a District Court such as this? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you are aware of the fact that the Crown can appeal - Mr Ritchie just asked you briefly before, the Crown can appeal any sentence you get on this matter if you fail to give the assistance that you have sworn that you will give? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you will give your assistance in accordance with the statement you've given to the police? 
         
        A. Yes."" 
         (T 11) 
        
       
      
    10    In passing sentence, Knight DCJ, at pp 6-7 of his remarks on sentence, said this:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The next matter that I wish to deal with is that you have chosen to make a statement to the police, which is exhibit H before me, dated 1 February 1999, which in effect has enabled the police to charge the other two persons who were with you the night that this robbery was committed, and who participated in it. It is apparent that on the information which was otherwise before the police, there would have been insufficient material in order to charge Mr Bamblett and DB. I understand that they are now to be charged, or indeed in at least one case may have already been charged since the information you gave. I take into account also the fact you have said before me that you will give evidence for the Crown in relation to the participation of those other two men in this offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Pursuant to s 442B of the Crimes Act I take that offer of assistance into account and indeed the assistance that you have already given into account. I am required to form an opinion as to the significance and usefulness of your assistance. In my opinion, provided that you continue to give evidence in support of the Crown, and in accordance with the substance of the statement that you made on 1 February 1999, which is exhibit H, that assistance will be very considerable and without in any way precisely quantifying it I think I should indicate that had it not been for that assistance the sentence that I am about to impose on you, both in terms of minimum term and in terms of the overall sentence, would have been considerably longer."" 
        
       
      
    11    His Honour went on to take into account the contrition and remorse which he considered a concomitant of the assistance which was given and proposed to be given to police and the consequence that such assistance would necessitate the respondent's sentence being served in protective custody. 
     
      
    12    All these aspects being taken into account, a sentence of 3 years imprisonment was imposed with a non-parole period (minimum term) of 2 years, to commence on 16 January 1999 and to expire on 15 January 2001. 
     
      
    13    Neville Bamblett was committed for trial on 11 November 1999, at which stage the statement made by the respondent on 1 February 1999 was handed up to the magistrate. These proceedings are still on foot with no hearing date as yet having been allocated. 
     
      
    14    On 13 April 2000, at Narrandera Children's Court, the respondent was called to give evidence in the committal proceedings against DB. 
     
      
    15    In contrast to the matters set out in his statement, Exhibit H, the respondent said that, on 19 February 1998 (the date of the offence), he had been in a park with several people but he was unable to name them. He was asked the following questions and gave the following answers:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Do you recall sitting in a park? 
         
        A. Vaguely. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know who you were in the park with? 
         
        A. Several people. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to name any of those people? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you know the defendant now before the Court? 
         
        A. Yeah, my cousin. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to say anything about him being anywhere on that night? 
         
        A. No, I don't recall. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you able to tell us what you did after you'd been in the park? 
         
        A. No, I can't remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember making a statement to the police on 1 February 1999? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Your memory was okay when you made that statement? 
         
        A. No actually it wasn't. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Have a look at this document? 
         
        A. I don't want to see it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry? 
         
        A. I don't want to see it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well just bear with me a minute, and I'll show it to you? 
         
        A. Do I have to see this? If I don't want to see it do I have to see it? 
        
       
       
        
        BENCH: Q. Just have a look at it, I mean that's all you're being asked to do at this stage. 
        
       
       
        
        HALL: Q. That's a photocopy isn't it? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you see your signature on there, copy of a signature? 
         
        A. Yeah there's several there actually, yeah I see one, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Does that - is that your signature -- 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. -- copy of it? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Just take a moment, you can read okay I suppose can you? 
         
        A. No, I'm illiterate. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If I was to get someone to read that over to you, and then I can ask you some more questions, okay? 
         
        A. No I don't wish to answer any more of your questions. I'm pretty sure I made that clear when you come and seen me in the cells there. I didn't want to answer any of your questions, I didn't want to be here, right, so that's it, you know what I mean. As far as I'm concerned I'm not answering any more of your questions. Do what you've got to do, because that's it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don't want someone to read that statement over to you? 
         
        A. No I don't. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you tell the Court today, you tell his Worship that you can't recall what went on, on or about 19 February 1998? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. After you were in the park? 
         
        A. No I don't. I've been seeing psychs and all that there so do you think I'm all there. I'm pretty scattered around the head, so you know half the shit I don't want to remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Might I remind you of your evidence you gave his Honour Judge Knight, you remember that don't you? 
         
        A. Pardon. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Might I remind you of the evidence you gave Judge Knight? 
         
        A. There was no evidence there to Judge Knight. All Judge Knight asked me, if I do recall, which I don't think I do, but anyway he just said 'If I return back to Court do such and such, if not we re-sentence you' or whatever. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you're aware of what he told you? 
         
        A. Yeah I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that doesn't assist your memory at all today? 
         
        A. No it don't. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. So you tell the Court apart from what, being in the park, you've got no memory of anything after that? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And looking at that document's not going to help you? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you don't want anyone to read it over to you? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If it was read over to you do you think it might help you? 
         
        A. I just said 'No' to you, you know what I mean, I don't want it read to me, I don't want to remember anything, you know what I mean. I've finally got myself settled where I am, you know what I mean. I've finally forgot about the past. You're going to drag me back here and bring it up, I don't want to know about the past, you know what I mean. Last two and a half fucking years of my life I've been sitting in a correctional centre being treated like a fucking animal. Do you think I'm going to come here now and have you speak to me, you know what I mean, tell me this, tell me that. I've already told you 'No that's it', right, you know what I mean. All my life I've had people treat me like I'm some fucking animal, you know what I mean. Then youse wonder why people act like animals, you know what I mean. So just accept my word 'No' and please either do what you're going to do, or let me go back to the gaol where I feel more comfortable please."" 
        
       
      
    16    DB was subsequently discharged. 
     
      
    17    The facts relating to the offence upon which the respondent pleaded guilty and was sentenced may be briefly summarised as follows. 
     
      
    18    The victim who was 56 years of age, on 19 February 1998 at about 10.30pm, was walking to his motel near Narrandera Park, where the respondent and a number of others, including Neville Bamblett and DB, were drinking moselle. 
     
      
    19    Neville Bamblett followed the victim along the road. DB was observed to whisper in the respondent's ear. These two men then ran off in the direction which Neville Bamblett had taken. 
     
      
    20    The victim recalled being asked for a cigarette by a fit-looking male aged between 18 and 20 years. He sensed that something was wrong when he saw another person close by. The victim was unable to recall anything else. 
     
      
    21    The victim was robbed of his wallet containing $10 or $20 as well as other personal items and cards. He was later found by a passer-by gurgling on the side of the road. 
     
      
    22    The victim was treated in hospital for various injuries, which included extensive facial fractures and compression of the airways. He remained in hospital for ten days following surgery. 
     
      
    23    The respondent was also hospitalised on the night of the attack after a car accident. Blood on the toe area of his right boot matched the DNA profile of the victim's blood. 
     
      
    24    The respondent said that he saw the victim on the ground being kicked in the head by Neville Bamblett and in the rib area by DB. 
     
      
    25    The respondent pushed Neville Bamblett away and told him, ""That's enough, just grab the wallet and let's go"". The respondent grabbed the victim's wallet, despite the victim putting his hand back to stop this happening. 
     
      
    26    The three men, at the suggestion of the respondent, later drove a car from the backyard of someone known to the respondent. This car was involved in an accident. 
     
      
    27    The respondent denied kicking the victim and he could not say how blood came to be on his right boot.  
     
      
    28    There were no other witnesses to the offence. 
     
      
    29    Subjectively, the respondent is of Aboriginal descent and was born on 3 January 1974. He has an extensive criminal history which includes eleven offences of break, enter and steal dating from 1985, one of which is an offence of aggravated break and enter and commit felony in company. There are a number of other violent offences, including numerous offences of assault and four offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. On 2 April 1992, the respondent was sentenced for an offence of assault and robbery in company, to a minimum term of 6 months imprisonment and an additional term of 6 months. He has also been convicted several times of malicious damage and stealing. 
     
      
    30    A report of a senior psychologist, Dr Roger Blake, dated 5 February 1999, discloses that the respondent has a long history of poly-drug abuse. He has no definite employment history and his relationship with his de facto wife and two young children is apparently over. In Dr Blake's view, the respondent has a ""rather poor prognosis"". He is described as ""… a typical recidivistic individual who has little interest in addressing his offending behaviour whilst he has been in custody"". Dr Blake observed the respondent to be someone who ""may be prone to violent and impulsive outbursts with little thought of consequence"". He expressed the opinion that the respondent is ""an institutionalised individual"". 
     
      
    31    Whilst Dr Blake was of the opinion that the respondent did not have any psychiatric indicators, he noted that it was likely that the respondent fell within the ""aggressive and anti-social personality disorder range"". A minimal level of alcohol related brain damage was also foreseen due to the respondent's dependence on alcohol. 
     
      
    32    Where a person undertakes to assist the authorities by giving evidence for the Crown at a pending trial and is treated leniently on sentence in consequence but fails to give such evidence, s 5DA has application. 
     
      
    33    The purpose of the section is not punitive but is directed towards enabling this Court in an appropriate case, and to an appropriate extent, to intervene to adjust or correct a sentence where a sentencing process can be seen, with benefit of hindsight, to have miscarried by reason of the circumstances set out in the section: see R v David Robert O'Brien (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 June 1993, per Gleeson CJ). 
     
      
    34    The evidence given by the respondent, at the time of sentence, makes plain his awareness of the consequences, should he fail to give evidence in accordance with his statement as undertaken by him before Knight DCJ. His evidence before Magistrate O'Donaghoe, in the Children's Court at Narrandera on 13 April 2000, equally makes plain that the respondent is not prepared to honour his undertaking, regardless of the consequences which he clearly recognised to be his re-sentencing. 
     
      
    35    Although proceedings against Neville Bamblett remain extant, there can be little doubt that the respondent will maintain his present attitude and this has been confirmed by his counsel in proceedings before us today. Even if he does not, the sworn evidence he has given in the Children's Court, as to his memory loss and claimed inability to recall the names of any persons or any events associated with the offence in question, would render any future testimony he may give virtually valueless. 
     
      
    36    The enactment of s 442B of the Crimes Act, 1900, and its successor, s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, has provided an important tool in the administration of justice. This Court should be vigilant to ensure the imposition of a sentence which, so far as possible, excises the discount which the respondent received. 
     
      
    37    In the present case, there is an element of discount related to past assistance given by the respondent which I assume to be the identification of the assailants. However, even this assistance is valueless when the respondent fails to give his evidence as promised. 
     
      
    38    I would propose the following orders:- 
     
      
       
      1. The appeal be allowed. 
       
       
      2. Pursuant to s 5DA, the sentence imposed on the respondent by Knight DCJ, on 11 February 1999, is varied by increasing the sentence to 4 years imprisonment deemed to have commenced on 16 January 1999 and to expire on 15 January 2003. 
       
       
      3. There will be a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months imprisonment expiring on 15 October 2001, upon which date the respondent will be eligible for release on parole. 
       
      
    39    BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Ireland AJ. 
     
      
    40    SMART AJ: I agree with Ireland AJ.

       REGINA v Robert George FITZSIMMONS 
        
        
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1    MASON P: The appellant was tried in the District Court on an indictment containing two counts: sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 10 years (Crimes Act 1900, s66A) and indecent assault (Crimes Act, s61L). 
     2    The case presented to the jury was that the two incidents occurred in that sequence and on the same occasion, involving the same complainant who was an eight year old girl at the time. 
     3    The appellant was found not guilty on the first count and guilty on the second. He was sentenced to perform community service for three hundred hours.4    The Crown case depended essentially upon the testimony of the complainant. She was a couple of months short of her 16th birthday when she gave evidence at trial. The events in question had occurred in July 1992, shortly after her eighth birthday. The complainant had given her first statement to the police in September 1996 and her second in November 1996. 
     5    The complainant lived with her parents in Sadlier. She was friendly with another young girl, Carrie, who lived nearby. Carrie lived with her mother Barbara L and her de facto husband, the appellant. 
     6    The complainant said that one Friday or Saturday night in a period between June and July 1992 she spent the night at Carrie’s house. They watched video movies on a video recorder machine. The following morning she and the appellant were sitting watching television in the lounge room. She thought that Carrie was still in bed and that Carrie’s mother was out shopping at the time. 
     7    The complainant said that the appellant told her to get changed because they were going to play a game. She started to do so, but while she still had her t-shirt on, he told her to lie down. She told him that she had to finish getting changed, but he shook her and she lay down. She was asked what then happened and said: 
      
       
        
        And then I lied down and he was on top of me with his pants up and then he was going up and down on me and then after that he undid his pants and …. 
        
       
       
     8    She then gave evidence of penile sexual intercourse inside her vagina. After a while, and during sexual intercourse, he said “we will keep on playing the game for a little while”. She said “No I don’t like this game” and he got off her. She then ran home and had a shower. 
     9    It was put to the complainant that she had never stayed overnight at her friend’s house and that no events such as alleged ever occurred.  
     10    In cross examination, the complainant was challenged as to a number of details about her evidence concerning the sexual intercourse. She generally adhered to her evidence. In particular, she was confronted with the impossibility of her earlier evidence that intercourse occurred with the appellant’s head adjacent to her head, having regard to the comparative sizes of the two people in 1992. She was also challenged on her evidence that sexual intercourse occurred for ten or fifteen minutes, leaving her sore for about half an hour. The acquittal of the appellant on the first count means that this challenge has continuing relevance only in so far as it reflects upon the complainant as a credible or accurate witness. I shall come back to various matters raised in this regard. 
     11    It is however the evidence relating to the second count that needs careful scrutiny in this appeal. The Crown case was always to the effect that the appellant zipped up his pants after the act of sexual intercourse, and then rubbed her indecently with his pants as he lay on top of her. This was the offence, and the only offence, that went to the jury on the second count of the indictment (see Summing up p14). 
     12    The complainant’s evidence in relation to the indecent assault charge was most unsatisfactory. Whatever the reason, she evidently did not “come up to proof”. In her evidence in chief she said that the appellant was on top of her with his pants up “and then he was going up and down on me and then after that he undid his pants ….” (see also her evidence in cross examination at Tr p20 line 14 and in re-examination at Tr p30 line 31). To the extent that this was evidence of an indecent assault independent of the act of sexual intercourse, it was not the assault charged. 
     13    Later, in her evidence in chief, the complainant repeatedly said that she could not remember anything happening between the appellant finishing having sex and the complainant running home (Tr p8 line 14, p9 line 51, p10 line 25). 
     14    The Crown Prosecutor evidently tried to repair matters in re-examination. By that stage the complainant had been shown the two statements which she had given the police in late 1996. The following was the totality of the complainant’s evidence given in re-examination (Tr p30). 
      
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. You have been shown various statements and asked questions? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Two statements in fact. You were asked by my learned friend that, he reminded you of the fact that you said in your earlier evidence that after the sexual intercourse had finished and that you had run off home? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In between that time nothing else had happened? 
         
        A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now after my friend has referred you to your statement is that still your answer? 
         
        A. Yes, I think so, I don’t understand properly. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said that you don’t have a memory --- 
         
        A. Oh yes --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Of anything, or something might have happened, I think that’s what you said to my friend, after he finished having sexual intercourse and before you ran off home? 
         
        A. Yes I thought --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now do you --- 
         
        A. Yes now I know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What happened in between? 
         
        A. In between after he finished and me running home, he was on top of me with his pants done up, but I thought that was before. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was he doing with his pants done up on top of you? 
         
        A. He was just rubbing up and down on top of me. 
        
       
       
     15    In convicting the appellant on the second count, the jury must have regarded this evidence, the last two questions in particular, as amounting to an assertion by the complainant that the indecent assault occurred after the intercourse. 
     16    In my view the jury ought not to have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the second count was established. This conclusion is based upon the complainant’s evidence as recounted above. The balance of the evidence at trial only strengthens my doubts about guilt having been established to the proper standard. There was a good deal of other evidence led at the trial, but none of it had the effect of strengthening the Crown case in relation to the second count, rather the reverse. 
     17    When he had been interviewed by the police the appellant denied any wrongdoing. The record of interview was put before the jury. The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. 
     18    The complainant’s father gave evidence that in 1992 the family lived in Sadlier and that as a result he knew the appellant, the appellant’s wife “Barbie” and her daughter Carrie. He said that Barbie asked him if the complainant could stay overnight. It was on a weekend. He agreed she could and he was certain that she did. He added that his other daughter, Rebecca, could well have stayed over that same evening. Rebecca was closer to Carrie’s age. (However, the complainant herself stated that Rebecca had not been present on the night in question.) 
     19    The Crown called Carrie, who said that the complainant had never come inside her house. She agreed that she had played with the complainant and her older sister Rebecca, but never inside the house. 
     20    The appellant’s de facto wife, Barbara, was also called as a Crown witness. Sometime in the 1980s she had suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. Her memory had been affected and it had progressively worsened. Aspects of her testimony corroborate that she was suffering difficulties of recall. Nevertheless, it was her evidence that the complainant had never stayed over at her house. She said that she was positive about this because her daughter was at a different age level and her friends were in a different category to the complainant. Mrs L also gave evidence to the effect that the family’s first VCR was acquired in 1993, ie a year after the date of the offences charged. A “rent to own contract” dated 25 August 1993 was put into evidence.  
     21    No complaint is made about the careful summing up of Judge Keleman SC nor does the appellant contend that Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 applies in the sense that the two verdicts cannot stand together. It is accepted that there were specific difficulties with the complainant’s evidence as regards the sexual intercourse count.  
     22    It is, nevertheless, submitted that the jury should have been all the readier to acquit on the second count in light of the specific problems facing the Crown case on the first count, being problems that depended essentially upon acceptance of the complainant as a credible witness. (By “credible” I am not confining myself to the complainant’s honesty. The jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that her evidence was accurate as well as honest.) 
     23    Among the matters relied upon as casting reasonable doubt about the acceptability of the complainant’s evidence generally were: 
      
      • In 1996 the complainant told the police that the appellant had an eagle tattoo on his shoulder or the top of one of his arms. The appellant has no such tattoo. 
       
      • In 1996 the complainant told the police that the house where she was sexually assaulted had two bathrooms: it is accepted that this was never the case in relation to the appellant’s house at Sadlier. 
       
       
      • In 1996 the complainant told the police that the appellant took his shoes off before the alleged sexual acts took place. At trial she said she had no memory of this occurring. More significantly, there was evidence from the appellant’s de facto wife that he had never been allowed to wear his shoes inside the house. 
       
       
      • The evidence raising a doubt about whether the appellant’s family had a VCR in 1992 has already been mentioned. 
       
       
      • The absence of any medical evidence that might have lent support to the complainant’s evidence about prolonged and painful sexual intercourse is also a relevant matter. 
       
     24    As indicated, the first complaint was made in the latter part of 1996, ie over four years after the matters charged. There was evidence explaining the delay in complaint and the jury were given an appropriate direction accordingly. The jury were also properly given a strong Longman warning about the dangers of convicting an accused person based upon an allegation of this nature after a considerable lapse of time. In the present case these difficulties were not just theoretical. This was a case based upon of a single set of events occurring on a weekend morning when the appellant’s de facto wife was said to be out shopping and her daughter Carrie still sleeping. True, each of those witnesses denied in general terms that the complainant had been to the house. But the lapse of time may well have blotted out more specific memories of relevance to the appellant’s case. Particularly is this so in relation to the appellant’s de facto wife who had genuine and demonstrable memory difficulties. 
     25    The Crown case depended essentially upon the evidence of the complainant. Her father’s evidence (general though it was) supported the complainant’s evidence that she had stayed overnight, but contradicted it as to whether her older sister accompanied her. The other two major witnesses called by the Crown contradicted the complainant’s evidence in several matters which, though ultimately peripheral to the specific charges, should have sowed significant seeds of doubt. 
     26    Viewing the evidence as a whole I am of the view that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt in relation to the second count. Accordingly I would uphold the appeal, quash the conviction and enter a verdict of acquittal. 
     27    GILES JA: I agree with Mason P. 
     28    WHEALY J: I agree with the reasons of Mason P and the order that he proposes.

       REGINA (COMMONWEALTH) V. Saviour BUGEJA 
       
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
     1   HODGSON JA: On 6 October 2000, the applicant in this matter pleaded guilty before a magistrate to two charges. 
     2   The first was a charge pursuant to s.233B(1)(c) of the Customs Act 1901 that he, on the 11th day of August 2000, at Penrith in the State of New South Wales, did without reasonable excuse have in his possession prohibited imports to which s.233B of the Customs Act applied, to wit narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin being not less than the trafficable quantity applicable to heroin. 
     3   The second was a charge brought pursuant to s.25(1) of the Drugs (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985 (NSW) that he, on about 11 August 2000, did supply a prohibited drug, to wit methylamphetamine. 
     4   The applicant adhered to those guilty pleas on 27 October 2000 in the District Court before Judge Williams, and on 31 October 2000 the applicant was sentenced by his Honour.  
     5   On the first charge, relating to the Commonwealth offence, his Honour sentenced the applicant to nine years imprisonment, with a non parole period of six and a half years, both to date from 11 August 2000, the date of the applicant's arrest. 
     6   On the second charge, relating to the State offence, his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for the Commonwealth offence. His Honour declined to set a non parole period, having regard to the non parole period already set for the Commonwealth charge. 
     7   We are dealing with an application for leave to appeal from those sentences. The facts can be briefly stated.  
     8   On the evening of 10 August 2000, the police intercepted a telephone conversation involving the applicant, which suggested the presence of drugs at his home in Sydney.  
     9   On 11 August 2000, Australian Federal Police executed a search warrant on the applicant's home in Penrith. There they found, in a key combination safe, a clip-seal bag containing a quantity of heroin in powder form; in the top drawer of a dresser in the front bedroom, a clip-seal bag with a silver foil containing 0.5 grams of heroin; inside a cylinder on a shelf in a garage, 24 small clip-seal bags containing heroin in powder and in rock form; in a kitchen cupboard above the stove, a small clip-seal bag containing two pieces of heroin; and in the same kitchen cupboard, a set of scales, a plastic food container, a funnel, a Breville coffee and spice grinder, and numerous clip-seal bags. Traces of white powder were found on these items; and in the same cupboard, there was also a package containing five ultra-fine syringes. 
     10   In the safe in which the police found the heroin, they also found a quantity of methylamphetamine mixed with pseudoephedrine. Cash totalling A$15,000 and US$20, and a large amount of gold jewellery, were also found in the safe. 
     11   The same day, the applicant was arrested. He declined to take part in a record of interview.  
     12   In his luggage, police found amongst other things a key and a piece of paper, on which were written a safe combination, both of which were later used to open the safe previously found at the Penrith house.  
     13   A total of eight individual lots of heroin were found, which together weighed 288.1 grams. The average purity of the eight lots was 44 per cent, and accordingly, for the purposes of sentencing under the Customs Act, the pure weight of heroin was 139.8 grams. 
     14   I note that under the Customs Act, the trafficable quantity of heroin is two grams and the commercial quantity of heroin is 1.5 kilograms. If the applicant had had no prior relevant conviction, the maximum sentence for an offence under s.233B of the Customs Act involving this quantity of heroin would have been twenty-five years imprisonment and/or a $100,000 fine. However, the appellant did have prior convictions, including a conviction in 1992 for an offence under section 233B, so that s.235 of the Customs Act had the effect that the maximum penalty in this case was imprisonment for life. 
     15   The weight of the methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine mixture found in the safe was 21.6 grams. Under the relevant New South Wales Act, an indictable quantity of amphetamine is five grams and a commercial quantity is 250 grams. The applicable penalty in this case was fifteen years imprisonment and/or 2000 penalty units. 
     16   In his remarks on sentence, the sentencing Judge noted, in relation to the Commonwealth offence, that this was a repeat offence, which was objectively serious and committed for commercial gain. His Honour concluded that the applicant was actively involved in supplying drugs within the community, and accordingly did not equate with someone of the stature of a courier as low down in an organisation, as referred to in Wong and Leung (1999) 108 A Crim R 531. 
     17   His Honour noted that the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity in the Local Court, and that, in accordance with Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 395, he was entitled to a greater discount for this plea than if it had been made later. He noted that the guidelines in R. v. Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 were not expressed to apply to Commonwealth offences; but also noted that the general statement of principles would presumably apply, though perhaps the level of discounts may not. His Honour remarked that the plea of guilty had to be seen in the light of the strong Crown case. 
     18   In relation to the Commonwealth offence, having applied a reduction in accordance with s.16G of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and taking into account all the matters referred to in s.16A of that Act, his Honour arrived at a head sentence of nine years. In relation to the non parole period, his Honour noted that these were repeat offences, and that there was little or no prospect of rehabilitation. His Honour fixed a non parole period of six and a half years. 
     19   In relation to the State offence, his Honour took into account Thomson and Houlton; but expressed the view that the applicant was not entitled to a discount for the early guilty plea of twenty-five per cent. His Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         A discount of 25 per cent on a sentence would be considered in a case of a first offender whose plea is of significant utilitarian value but in my view repeat serious drug offenders are not entitled to a significant discount on a plea of guilty no matter how utilitarian their plea might be. 
         
        
       
     20   In the result, in relation to the State offence, his Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment for three years, and noted that he allowed a ten per cent deduction for the plea of guilty. 
     21   The first ground of the application for leave to appeal was that the sentencing Judge erred in fixing, in respect of a Commonwealth offence, a non parole period which, as a proportion of the head sentence, substantially exceeded sixty-six per cent. In fact, the proportion in this case was around seventy-two per cent. 
     22   That ground was elaborated on, to the effect that the sentencing Judge was also in error in fixing the non parole period by reference to a motive of commercial gain and by reference to the circumstance that these were repeat offences. On this aspect, the submission was in substance that the sentencing Judge had already taken those matters into account in relation to the fixing of the head sentence and, in those circumstances, it was double counting and wrong to take them into account in also fixing a non parole period of higher percentage than the usual range of around sixty to sixty-six per cent. It was submitted that a non parole period of seventy-five per cent was reserved for the worst type of case, and this was very far from the worst type of case. 
     23   The second ground of the application was that the sentencing Judge erred in his reasons concerning what is called the utilitarian discount for an early plea of guilty, and had made an insufficient discount, particularly in relation to the Commonwealth offence. It was submitted that the statement which I quoted earlier was an error, and contrary to the principles set out in Thomson and Houlton. 
     24   I will deal first with the second ground to which I have referred. In my opinion, although the case of Thomson and Houlton and the guidelines set out in that case are said not to apply to Commonwealth offences, it seems clear that this is essentially because of the non participation of Commonwealth authorities in that case, and the view being taken that it was, accordingly, not appropriate to purport to set out guidelines to be applicable to all Commonwealth cases. However, in my opinion the general principles stated in that case are applicable to Commonwealth offences, and should generally be applied to Commonwealth offences. 
     25   The principles which I have in mind as relevant to this case are the principles that a plea of guilty should generally be taken into account having regard to the advantages to the administration of justice and the saving of resources that are involved in such a plea, and that pleas of guilty, and particularly early pleas of guilty, should be encouraged by discounts for that reason alone. Of course, pleas of guilty may be relevant in other ways to the determination of appropriate sentences, for example as indicating remorse, and as being relevant to the need for individual deterrence. However, Thomson and Houlton makes it clear that, quite apart from those matters, the utilitarian aspect, as it is called, of the plea should be taken into account.  Thomson and Houlton also indicates that it is generally appropriate to make it clear that such a utilitarian discount is being given, and to express the amount of that discount. 
     26   There are authorities to the effect that in general terms there should not be specified particular discounts for particular aspects of the case relevant to sentencing, but that the Court should generally make a global assessment, taking into account all relevant matters. However, in relation to the particular aspect of the utilitarian discount for pleas of guilty, Thomson and Houlton is authority for the proposition that that particular aspect should generally be considered separately, and given a separate articulation in terms of a quantum of discount to further the purpose of encouraging pleas of guilty. 
     27   The other relevant principle that in my opinion emerges from Thomson and Houlton is that, in relation to that particular aspect of a plea of guilty, the predominant consideration as to the amount of the discount is the timing of the plea. Whereas such matters as the strength of the Crown case and the question of whether the plea indicates remorse are highly relevant to other aspects of the relevance of the plea of guilty, Thomson and Houlton indicates that they are not of great significance in relation to the utilitarian discount. For that reason, in my opinion, the statement of principle by the learned trial Judge which I have quoted was incorrect. 
     28   The range of discount suggested by Thomson and Houlton on this utilitarian basis is ten to twenty-five per cent. Although that range is not expressed as applying to Commonwealth offences in general terms, it seems to me that it is a reasonable range to adopt. 
     29   In the present case there was an early plea of guilty, although not an earlier statement admitting guilt made to the police; and it seems to me that an appropriate utilitarian discount would be in the order of twenty per cent. The sentencing Judge did not make explicit what discount was allowed in this case in relation to the Commonwealth offence. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that the discount which he allowed was a similar discount to that allowed in relation to the State offence, that is, ten per cent.  
     30   In my opinion, therefor, there was an insufficient utilitarian discount for the plea of guilty to the Commonwealth offence; and this would now justify a reduction of the head sentence from nine years to eight years. 
     31   Turning to the first ground of appeal, in my opinion no error is shown in the reasons of the trial Judge. In my opinion, there is no error in taking into account the circumstance that the offence being dealt with is a repeat offence in setting the head sentence, and taking it into account again in determining the proportion that should be adopted for a non parole period. As the trial Judge said, the purpose, or certainly a predominant purpose, of the non parole period is to allow a period of rehabilitation within the community. In my opinion the circumstance that the offence is a repeat offence, and a conclusion by the sentencing Judge that the prospects of rehabilitation are small, are relevant factors in fixing the proportion for the non parole period. In my opinion a sentencing judge is not precluded from taking those matters into account in fixing the proportion, simply because they have also been taken into account in fixing the head sentence. 
     32   The percentage arrived at of seventy-two per cent is high but, to my mind, it is not so high as to indicate error which would justify interference by this Court, if this Court was not otherwise reassessing the sentence. However, the Court is reassessing the sentence; and in my view, having set a head sentence of eight years, it is appropriate to fix a non parole period of five years and three months, which is approximately two-thirds of the head sentence. 
     33   GREG JAMES J: I agree with what his Honour has said concerning the error into which the trial Judge fell in failing to afford to the applicant the utilitarian value of his plea. 
     34   For myself, I would have inclined to the view that his Honour had also fallen into error in the way in which his Honour came to assess the non parole period, perhaps because his Honour appears, arguably, to have increased both the non parole period and the head sentence because the applicant was a repeat offender. However, since I share the view of the presiding Judge that his Honour has fallen into error on the question of the utilitarian value of the plea, and in that regard it falls to this Court to re-sentence, and I share the view of the presiding Judge as to the appropriate sentence, it is not necessary for me to consider further whether further error has been made out. I share his Honour's views and would propose that the applicant be sentenced as his Honour has proposed. 
     35   ADAMS J: I agree with the result which the learned presiding Judge has proposed and with his Honour's observations concerning the significance of the plea of guilty in the circumstances of this case. I wish, however, to make some observations about the setting of a non parole period with regard to prospects of rehabilitation. 
     36   So far as setting a non parole period is concerned, there can be little doubt that his Honour imposed a term whose relationship with the head sentence was well within the upper range. That head sentence had already been set with regard to the need for personal deterrence being demonstrated by the offenders' earlier convictions. Thus, if the non parole period were to be set by reference to the conventional two-thirds relationship with the head sentence the need to deal with the issue of personal deterrence was already catered for. 
     37   On this basis, while there might theoretically be cases where the application of the conventional relationship would produce a non parole period that was too low having regard to the objectives of sentencing law, there would be very few where this was so and the circumstances justifying a significant departure from the usual proportion would need to be comprehensively set out. 
     38   If application of the conventional ratio produced a sentence that reflected an appropriate measure of denunciation, retribution and general and personal deterrence, it would be wrong, in principle, to increase it because the prospects of rehabilitation were doubtful or even non existent. 
     39   It seems obvious that the fundamental purpose of rehabilitation is that the offender will no longer offend. That is precisely the same purpose as punishment to deter the offender from committing further offences. For sentencing purposes, there is no difference in substance between the element of personal deterrence and the element of rehabilitation, when properly analysed. Accordingly, where personal deterrence is already factored into the non parole period, to increase it further because of scepticism that the offender will not re-offend is to double up. 
     40   If the conventional proportion does not produce a sentence which deals appropriately with denunciation, retribution and general and personal deterrence, then, of course, it should be adjusted to do so. If these factors have been adequately reflected in the sentence, having regard to the principle that the lowest sentence should be imposed which fairly accommodates the sentencing elements I have mentioned, it is a fundamental error, in my view, to increase that sentence because the offender is seen as unlikely to be rehabilitated. 
     41   The statutory proportion in New South Wales is not set on the basis of any particular assumptions about rehabilitation. No more can be said about it, in my view, than that the Parliament considered that part of a sentence should ordinarily be served in custody, and part under sanctions of a different kind, and unless there are circumstances justifying a variation the statutory ratio should apply. 
     42   What I have called the conventional ratio which operates in Commonwealth cases does not, to my mind, reflect any calculation or assumptions about rehabilitation, except to the extent that it is one of a number of relevant factors. Accordingly, what I have said about the approach to the New South Wales provisions applies, by and large, to the Commonwealth sentencing structure, with some adjustment being necessary, having regard to the applicable statutory regime. 
     43   In my respectful view, the reasons stated by his Honour for differing from the conventional proportion to such a significant degree in this case, when his Honour set the non parole period, do not adequately explain the reason for so doing. In particular, in light of the matter identified by his Honour as requiring such a variation, there should have been some advertence to the extent to which the non parole period conventionally appropriate did not provide adequate and sufficient personal deterrence and did not reflect the other purposes of sentencing law to which I have adverted. 
     44   At all events, it is very important that sentencing Judges avoid, so far as they can, the appearance of double counting, and some further explication of the result was, in my view, required in the circumstances of this case. 
     45   Otherwise I agree with the judgment of the learned presiding Judge. 
     46   HODGSON JA: The orders are these: 
      
      In relation to the sentence in respect of the offence under the

      REGINA v. CHOI KIA TANG 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
     1   SPIGELMAN, CJ: I agree with Greg James, J. 
     2   WOOD, CJ. at CL: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Greg James, J. I agree with his reasons and the orders he proposes. 
     3   GREG JAMES, J: The appellant, Choi Kia Tang, was convicted of murder after a trial in this court before the Honourable Justice Hidden and a jury of 12. 
     4   The appellant was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment comprising a minimum term of 11 years imprisonment and an additional term of four years imprisonment. The sentence was to date from 23 March 1997, the date upon which the appellant was arrested, he having been refused bail. 
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
     5   Two grounds of appeal are asserted. They are:- 
      
       
        
        ""1. A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence of fresh evidence at the trial. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Statements made by the appellant to the police were inadmissible by reason of the operation of s.13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987."" 
        
       
     6   Section 13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 provides as follows:- 
      
       
        
         
        ""(1) Any statement, confession, admission or information made or given to a member of the police force by a child who is a party to criminal proceedings shall not be admitted in evidence in those proceedings unless:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) there was present at the place where, and throughout the period of time during which, it was made or given:- 
        
       
       
        
         (i) a person responsible for the child, 
        
       
       
        
         (ii) an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the person responsible for the child, 
        
       
       
        
         (iii) in the case of a child who is of or above the age of 16 years an adult (other than a member of the police force) who was present with the consent of the child, or 
        
       
       
        
         (iv) a barrister or solicitor of the child's own choosing, or 
        
       
       
        
         (b) the person acting judicially in those proceedings:- 
        
       
       
        
         (i) is satisfied that there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such an adult from the place where, or throughout the period of time during which, the statement, confession, admission or information was made or given, and 
        
       
       
        
         (ii) considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the statement, confession, admission or information should be admitted in evidence in those proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) In this section:- 
        
       
       
        
         (a) a reference to a person acting judicially includes a reference to a person making a determination as to the admissibility of evidence in committal proceedings, and 
        
       
       
        
         (b) a reference to criminal proceedings is a reference to any criminal proceedings in which a person is alleged to have committed an offence while a child or which arise out of any other criminal proceedings in which a person is alleged to have committed an offence while a child. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Nothing in this section limits or affects the admissibility in evidence in any criminal proceedings against a child of any statement or information that the child is required to make or give by virtue of the provisions of any Act or law."" 
        
       
     7   The first of the grounds of appeal relates both to the admission into evidence at the trial of an electronically recorded interview, Exhibit N, and a recorded ""walk through"" interview, Exhibit Q, between the police and the appellant notwithstanding s.13 may have been applicable and to matters it is said the appellant refrained from referring to when he gave evidence at the trial and which he did not speak about in those interviews. Those matters, in particular, were that it was another boy who had a knife and stabbed the deceased. In those interviews the appellant answered important questions in a non-committal way which was a course he now says he took in order to avoid revealing the activities of the other boy. It is said that he answered, typically, ""no comment"" to avoid revealing the other boy's crime out of fear. 
      
       
      The fresh evidence 
       
     8   The fresh evidence includes a number of affidavits tendered on the appeal. They may conveniently be considered as referring to two different categories of evidence. The first is evidence tendered to prove that, at the time of the appellant's interview by police, he was under 18 (although he believed that he was over that age) and that persons who might have accompanied him in the interview situation would have advised him not to speak, at least until proper advice had been received and evidence from him that he would not have spoken; also, that his counsel at trial, not knowing that there was a question of the appellant's age, had failed to object to the admissibility of the exhibits as in the circumstances he otherwise would have done. 
     9   In response to the evidence tendered by the applicant of his age, there were filed by the respondent, affidavits from Chief Inspector Williams and Mr. Erris Shields, formerly a Detective Sergeant, the officer in charge of the investigation, dealing with the appellant's assertions of his age. That latter affidavit included reference by the former Detective Sergeant to having approached the appellant's mother some 10 days prior to the appellant's interview and arrest seeking to ascertain the appellant's birth date.  
     10   The second body of evidence relates to the matters not referred to at trial and includes the appellant's denial of the offence, his account of the events, the assertion of the guilt of the other boy, his decision out of fear to avoid inculpating the other boys in the interviews and why it was he came to give evidence at the trial as he did. There was also some evidence of a prior consistent statement of the appellant's version of the events made by him to a family friend. 
     11   The respondent submitted that the fresh evidence had to be considered with the evidence at the trial. In addition to reliance on the evidence of the three boys as showing a powerful Crown case, it was submitted that there were two particularly significant aspects of the evidence which supported the prosecution's contention. The first being the substantial body of evidence that the appellant had gone into hiding almost immediately after the killing and had given a false name, address and date of birth to the police. On any view of the case, offences had been committed by the boys or at least there was a basis for belief they were likely to be suspected. Thus one could not relate that activity of the appellant exclusively to an hypothesis that he had been the killer. Further, it was submitted that a cut green mango had been found near the scene of the killing. The injury to the mango was consistent with it having been cut with a knife. The appellant had said in evidence he had been eating a green mango prior to the incident. He had denied using a knife to cut it. This matter in itself, does not seem to me to add such weight to the Crown case as would require rejection of a significant possibility of acquittal.  
      
       
      Crown submissions of legal test 
       
     12   On the hearing of the appeal the learned Solicitor-Genera, who appeared for the respondent, made submissions that the appeal, at least as far as ground two was concerned, should be dealt with on a particular basis. He accepted that the applicant was not accompanied by any such person as s.13 refers to and made no submission there had been any attempt by the police to procure the presence of such a person. He submitted, however, that the appeal should be dealt with on that ground on the bases that the appellant's date of birth was 10 September 1979 and hence he was 17½ at the time of the relevant interviews; and that the appellant had not knowingly misled the police but had, on a number of occasions, told them, in effect, that he was over 18.  
     13   In the light of those matters, he put to us that the appropriate test to be applied to decide the appeal on that ground was that it was both necessary and sufficient for the appellant to show, in the light of those matters, that there was a significant possibility that the evidence of the interviews would not have been admitted had the appellant's true age been known and that if the evidence had been excluded, there would have been a significant possibility of an acquittal. That test was apparently derived from that proposed in this court in Regina v. Stackelroth (CCA, unreported 3 April 1996). 
     14   Although in the written submissions and orally, there was some discussion of whether the issue raised involved the not unusual question of evidence said to have been wrongly admitted below and the consequent consideration of the proviso to s.6 involving, as it does, the consideration of whether there had been a substantial miscarriage of justice, or whether the issue required an examination of the application of the principles referred to in Mickelberg v. The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 and other decisions on fresh evidence, having regard to the acquiescence of the appellant's counsel in the test proposed by the learned Solicitor-General and because it seems to me it fairly embraces the crucial question to be considered in this case, I am content to deal with the appeal on the basis advanced. 
     15   I am therefore relieved from having to refer specifically to so much of the affidavit evidence as related to the appellant's age. There seems to be no suggestion that there would not have been an objection to the evidence by counsel had he been aware of the true position as to the appellant's age. The test proposed by the Crown appears to accept that objection would have been taken. Further, there was no factual challenge to the balance of the evidence relevant to that ground, that is, that the appellant would have been advised not to speak and would not have spoken as he did to the police. The appeal, indeed, proceeded on that basis, although there remained a submission by the respondent that there was no significant possibility a judge would have rejected the evidence as such a judge would have been satisfied there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of an adult (s.13(1)(b)(i)) in the appellant's conceded mis-statement of his age to police and that such a judge would consider, in the particular circumstances, the evidence should be admitted (s.13(1)(b)(ii)). As well, there was the ultimate submission that even if the evidence should have been excluded, the evidence against the appellant and the appellant's evidence at the trial were such that there was no significant possibility of an acquittal. 
     16   As to the evidence in the second category, it was simply contended this evidence did not meet the fresh evidence principles such as to be properly admissible before us and such as to warrant the grant in itself of a new trial. 
     17   I turn then, to ground two and to that aspect of the first ground which relates to the admissibility of the evidence, the admissibility of which is directly raised by ground two. 
      
       
      The evidence of the appellant's statements of his age 
       
     18   I note that in the first interview the appellant told the police that he was born on 1 January 1979. In passing, I note that that date appears to have been selected on the appellant's arrival in Australia by an immigration official and placed upon the family's travel documents. There was evidence the appellant had told the police at the police station the previous night his birth date was 25 February 1979 and that he had earlier been approached by a police officer in Haymarket and, when asked for his name, had given a false name and address and the date of birth of 25 February 1979. 
     19   I will turn first to that aspect of the first ground which relates to the admissibility of Exhibits N and Q. The admissibility of those exhibits is directly raised by ground two. The interview was conducted on 23 March 1997. No person as would have been required to be present by s.13(1)(a)(i)-(iv) had the appellant been over 18, attended. The appellant told the police during that interview that he was born on 1 January 1979. The fresh evidence referred to is material that raises that he was in fact born on 10 September 1979. He had, apparently, told the police at the police station the previous night that his birth date was 25 February 1979. 
     20   He had earlier been approached by a police officer in Haymarket and asked for his name. He gave a false name and address and the date of birth of 25 February 1979. This is the date he later admitted was untrue. 
     21   At the conclusion of the interview, to which I have referred, he confirmed his birth date as being 1 January 1979 to the senior officer who asked him the usual questions concerning the propriety of the conduct of the of interview. 
     22   An earlier police database reference had shown his birth date as 10 October 1979, although a statement asserted to have been obtained from his mother some 10 days before his arrest asserted his birth date was 1 January 1979. 
      
       
      The nature of the case 
       
     23   To set the context for the submissions on this ground, it is convenient to set out the nature of the case made at trial and the content of the interviews. 
     24   It was the prosecution case at the trial that the appellant, with three other boys all about 16 years old, were in the vicinity of the home of the deceased in Berala. The appellant entered the deceased's premises to steal mangos from a mango tree in the front yard, throwing some mangos over the fence to the other boys. Whilst the theft was in progress, the deceased confronted the boys and the appellant jumped the fence and ran away with the other boys. The deceased householder chased and caught one of the other boys and thereafter a struggle ensued, the remaining boys going to the assistance of the apprehended boy. 
     25   In the struggle the householder was stabbed some seven times as well as punched and kicked. It was the prosecution case that it was the appellant who had produced a knife and stabbed the householder. 
     26   Following the stabbing, the boys absconded and attempted to wash away the blood that had affected them as well as to dispose of certain of their clothing. 
     27   The deceased died some hours later in hospital from massive blood loss. 
     28   The appellant was arrested by the senior interviewing officer on the day of the interview, 23 March 1997.  
      
       
      The appellant's interviews 
       
     29   I take the following account of what he said in the first interview from the Crown submissions:- 
      
       
        
        ""During the course of the ERISP, the appellant was cautioned. The appellant said that around 10.00 pm on the night of the fight, he had met Andrew (Marfia), LS, Jason (Ingamells) and another friend of his (who'd later gone home) at a park. He had caught a train to the park. He and the other three boys walked to Marfia's house so Marfia could drop off his bumbag, and he waited outside with LS. Later, Ingamells, who had gone somewhere, arrived. They then decided to walk around and look for fruit. Prior to reaching Berala Street, they stopped at a mango tree, picked a mango and ate it together. When asked if anyone had cut the mango, the appellant said that they just took a bite of it. Subsequently, they walked passed (sic) another mango tree. Someone pulled it out, and they left it under a tree with the intention of returning to collect it. They continued walking and noticed a mango tree behind a fence. The appellant jumped over the fence, picked mangos off the tree and threw them over the fence. The appellant was asked to describe what had happened after this, but he did not wish to comment. 
        
       
       
        
        Various allegations were put to the appellant during the ERISP, including the deceased coming outside; the deceased being kicked by the boys; the boys, including the appellant, running away; the appellant subsequently producing a knife and telling the others that he had stabbed the deceased; the appellant having blood on his clothing; and the boys washing off blood at a tap. He declined to comment. When asked what he and the other boys had done to the deceased, he also declined to comment. He also declined to comment on whether or not he had seen any injuries on the other three boys that night. He said that he had not been injured. He declined to comment on what he had been wearing. Although police had searched his mother's house and unit connected with him, and found no clothing belonging to the appellant, he denied that he was deliberately hiding his clothes from the police. 
        
       
       
        
        It was put to the appellant that the deceased was stabbed, and he was asked if he could comment on who caused the deceased's injuries and if he had seen the deceased being stabbed. He declined to comment. He did say, however, that he had seen blood on the deceased, and at the time he was one to three metres away. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant denied producing a knife at the park. He told police that he had not seen a knife at any stage on the night of the fight. He also denied owning or carrying around a mobile phone that night. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant said that he had last seen the three boys on the night of the fight. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant explained that he had given police a false name, address and date of birth because he had not wanted any trouble."" 
        
       
     30   The second interview is summarised in the Crown submissions as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""The appellant subsequently accompanied police on a video-taped walk-through of the murder scene. The appellant said that when he was in the backyard he saw a man (the deceased) in his underwear grabbing Marfia. Marfia punched the deceased who then grabbed the appellant and 'whacked' him in the head. The appellant's shirt was then torn. The appellant then saw Ingamells and LS on the deceased, and he joined in, and a brawl erupted, which included the appellant kicking and punching the deceased. When the appellant stopped he saw the deceased stand up and then fall down again. The appellant told police during the walk-through that he had had blood on his clothes (including a 'Hang Ten' top, which he had thrown away). He firstly said that he had not washed anything at the tap, but later said that he had washed his face and had a drink. Later, as he was running away with Ingamells, he had told Ingamells to throw away his top because it was full of blood. In fact, all the boys had blood on them. Again the appellant told police that he had not seen a knife."" 
        
       
     31   The interviews were video taped and recorded on audio tape. The video tapes, the audio tapes and a transcript were admitted into evidence and the video tapes were played for the jury, all without objection. 
      
       
      The evidence of the other boys 
       
     32   At the trial the three other boys gave evidence against the appellant. The first, JI, gave evidence that the appellant showed him a knife that the appellant had in his possession prior to the events at Berala and that during the scuffle he could see the appellant in contact with the deceased but could not see what he was doing. He did not see the appellant with a knife during the fight but saw the appellant with the same knife he had earlier seen, after the fight on an occasion when they sought to wash their clothing and witnessed the appellant admitting to the other boys that he had stabbed the deceased three times. He, himself, had been in possession of a knife that night but it was a ""skinny butterfly knife"". One of the other boys, AM, had given it to him earlier in the evening. He admitted that he had not told the police about it but asserted that this was because they had not asked him about it. He had attempted to give false information to the police concerning the boys other than the appellant. 
     33   In cross-examination, he agreed that he had findings recorded against him of a number of charges for assault occasioning actual bodily injury. 
     34   AM gave evidence that he was one of the boys and that he had not seen any of the boys holding anything in their hands at the park. He had, he said, not seen a knife at any stage. He had seen the fight and the contact between the appellant and the deceased. He referred to both JI and himself fighting the deceased and that LS had also run to the deceased and started to kick him. When they went to the tap he saw that the appellant had blood on his pants. 
     35   It was his evidence that he did not have a knife on the night of the fight nor had he seen anyone with a knife during the fight. He also denied handing the butterfly knife, or any knife, to JI. He did say, however, that he thought ""one of them was holding a knife"" when they had split up after being at the tap and that he believed that it was the appellant. He based this belief, he said, on the reflection in the light of an object. He agreed in his evidence that he had told police in his interview that he had seen the appellant bending over the deceased and ""he might have stabbed him at that place"". He said that the appellant was ""going crazy"" and that he had seen the deceased bleeding before LS and JI joined in the fight. 
     36   In cross-examination he referred to a discussion with LS in which LS had asserted the appellant had stabbed the deceased. He had told the police ""the Chinese bloke did stab him as a matter of fact, 'cause he told me"" but in cross-examination said this was not based on an admission but an assumption by him. He agreed that he merely accepted LS' story about who had had the knife and had nominated the appellant to police as being that person even though he had had no first hand knowledge about this. He denied having agreed with LS and JI to concoct a story. 
     37   LS gave evidence that he had not seen anyone with a knife at the park and did not see AM hand JI anything. He gave evidence that he had not seen anyone with a knife at any time. 
     38   He referred to AM and the deceased in a fight after the appellant had entered the deceased's premises and was throwing mangos over the fence. The appellant ran towards them to join in as did JI. He saw the other boys kicking and hitting the deceased but could not see what the appellant, who was on the opposite side of the deceased, was doing. He said that he heard someone ask subsequently, ""Did you stab him?"", and someone else, who sounded like the appellant, say, ""Yeah, three times"". 
     39   He told the police that he had heard the appellant say he needed to wash the knife but could not recall this when he gave evidence. He said, however, he had seen the appellant with a knife in his hand when they stopped at the tap. He denied that he and JI had discussed a common story to tell police. 
      
       
      The appellant's evidence 
       
     40   When the appellant came to give evidence, he was vigorously cross-examined. In particular, he was asked to explain why he had answered ""no comment"" to a number of questions which were put during the interview. The effect of his answers was that he so responded either because he did not know the answers to the questions he was being asked or because the propositions on which he was asked to comment were, in fact, not true. 
     41   He had answered ""no comment"" to the question concerning his involvement in the attack on the deceased because he was involved but was not sure at that time of what he had done to the deceased, although he was sure of the role he had played at the time of giving his evidence. 
     42   When questioned in the interview, he had answered ""no comment"" to the propositions he had produced the knife and had told the other boys that he had stabbed the deceased. In his evidence he said that his answer was intended to reflect the fact that he had not had a knife and he had not stabbed the deceased. He said he did not know why he had said ""no comment"" when asked by police if he could say who had caused injuries to the deceased. 
     43   In cross-examination he said that he did not see any of the other three boys with a knife or stab the deceased. On my reading of it, the cross-examination was devastating in effect 
     44   In addition, there was some evidence of the appellant's good character. 
      
       
      The summing-up 
       
     45   The trial judge, in his summing up after giving the jury preliminary directions and short directions on legal issues, took the jury immediately to the accused's walk-through interview, Exhibit Q and the transcript of that interview for its relevance to any possible defence of self-defence or defence of others. 
     46   On the issue, which his Honour expressed to the jury as the central issue in the case, that is, whether the accused stabbed the deceased, his Honour took the jury to the evidence of the three boys, to the accused's account given at the trial and, in addition, evidence that the accused had vacated his flat, tried to break his lease and other matters which it was said went to consciousness of guilt. 
     47   The jury's attention was directed to the evidence of the appellant's lies as to false particulars and his date of birth. 
     48   His Honour said, concerning the ""no comment"" answers in the first recorded interview with the accused, Exhibit N:- 
      
       
        
        ""Now in evidence here he told you that on a number of occasions he didn't mean 'I don't want to answer that question'. What he meant by 'no comment' was a responsive answer to the question, either accepting what was put to him or denying what was put to him or conveying the effect that he could not give an accurate answer because he did not remember or did not observe something. 
        
       
       
        
        Now you remember the Crown's cross-examination about that and his submissions to you about that. He submits that you would not accept that evidence and that it bears ill on the accused's credibility generally."" 
        
       
     49   His Honour gave the jury a direction of the customary form that they were not to draw any inference adverse to the accused from the accused having declined to answer any question in the interview but, of course, in the light of his Honour's directions I have set out, it would be clear to the jury such a direction did not extend to the replies, ""no comment"". 
     50   His Honour made it very clear to the jury that the case depended on a conflict of credit between the evidence of the three boys and the evidence of the appellant and that matter was to be resolved on the basis of the evidence to which he had referred and which I have set out. 
      
       
      The significance of the interviews 
       
     51   It can therefore be seen that although the first interview does not include explicit confession of the appellant's guilt, it does contain significant admissions. It contains statements which are capable of casting a most adverse light on the appellant's credibility and was thus capable of bearing heavily upon how the jury might regard the credibility of the appellant at trial, thereby having considerable significance for the result of a trial in which the appellant's credibility would come to be weighed against the credibility of the other boy's giving evidence in the Crown case. 
     52   The second interview contains significant admissions also and, although not containing an explicit confession, but rather a denial of the appellant having used or seen a knife, again contains material which might bear heavily upon how a jury would regard the appellant's credibility at trial. Unless the jury were to reject the accused's evidence, he had to be acquitted. Those interviews, bearing heavily on his credibility, may well have resulted in that rejection. Without them, a jury may not have decided the same way.  
     53   Dealing then with the Crown's ultimate submission, for my part, I cannot conceive that if the interviews had been rejected and the cross-examination that I have referred to was thereby unavailable to the Crown, that it can be argued successfully that there was no significant possibility an acquittal would have resulted. 
     54   Indeed, it was the interviews that were the only material independent of that supplied by the other boys in support of the Crown case and for use to attack the account given by the appellant. His inability to explain the matters on which he was challenged and about which he had answered ""no comment"" must have been of considerable importance to the jury's rejection of his denial of having committed the crime at trial. 
     55   The cross-examination of the other boys could not be said to be such as to have entirely failed to raise credit questions for consideration by the jury. Particularly having regard to the onus and standard of proof, I would be of the view that the absence of the interviews would leave a significant possibility of a different result. 
      
       
      The inadmissibility of the interviews 
       
     56   I turn to the question of the inadmissibility of the interviews. 
     57   Section 13 provides for the general case that such statements, confessions, admissions or information made or given shall not be admitted in evidence in proceedings against a child who has provided that material to a member of the police force. It also provides for exceptions to that general case where there is a person as prescribed by s.13(1)(a) present, alternatively, where the person acting judicially in those proceedings is satisfied that there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such a person and in addition considers that in the particular circumstances of the case the evidence should be admitted. 
     58   It can be seen from the structure of the provision that it lays the onus entirely upon the Crown, should it seek to tender the material. The section, by providing the exceptions, provides circumstances in the absence of which the evidence must be, in law, rejected. Other provisions, eg., those in Part 3.4 of the Evidence Act 1995 make further provision for the admissibility and inadmissibility of such material. My view of s.13 is that for the appellant to satisfy this court that, in the admitted absence of such a person as s.13(1)(as) refers to, there was a significant possibility the evidence would be rejected, merely requires the appellant to satisfy us that there is a significant possibility, notwithstanding that the police were misinformed as to his birth date, that a judge would still reject the evidence. The judge is required to do that unless, even if satisfied there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such an adult, only if that judge considers that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the evidence should be admitted. On consideration of such a matter, a judge would have regard to the history of provisions of this kind (see Regina v. Aquilina (1978) 1 NSWLR 358; Regina v. Warren (1982) 2 NSWLR 360; McKellar & Booth v. Smith (1982) 2 NSWLR 950; Regina v. Cotton (1990) 19 NSWLR 593; Regina v. Dunn (CCA, unreported 15 April 1992); Regina v. H (1996) 85 A. Crim. R. 481; Regina v. Phung & Huynh (Wood, CJ. at CL, unreported 26 February 2001). 
     59   In Phung & Huynh (supra), Wood, CJ. at CL. set out the principles as follows:- 
      
       
        
        ""It may be accepted that the purpose of the legislative regime, that now applies to the interview of children, and particularly those in custody following arrest, is to protect them from any disadvantage inherent in their age, as well as to protect them from any form of police impropriety. As to the former, what is required is compliance with the procedure laid down so as to prevent the young or vulnerable accused from being overawed by the occasion of being interviewed, at a police station, by detectives who are likely to be considerably older and more experienced than they are. 
        
       
       
        
        This principle derives from what was said by Lee, J in  
        Regina v. Warren  
        (1982) 2 NSWLR 360; by Roden, J. in 
         Regina v 
        .  
        Williams 
         (unreported 9 August 1982); by Hunt, J. in 
         Regina v. 
          
        Cotton 
         (1990) 19 NSWLR 593; by Carruthers, J. in 
         Regina v. Dunn 
         (CCA, unreported 15 April 1992; and also by Hidden, J. in  
        H 
         (supra). 
        
       
       
        
        The role of the support person is to act as a check upon possible unfair or oppressive behaviour; to assist a child, particularly one who is timid, inarticulate, immature, or inexperienced in matters of law enforcement, who appears to be out of his or her depth, or in need of advice; and also to provide the comfort that accompanies knowledge that there is an independent person present during the interview. That role cannot be satisfactorily fulfilled if the support person is himself or herself immature, inexperienced, unfamiliar with the English language, or otherwise unsuitable for the task expected, that is, to intervene if any situation of apparent unfairness or oppression arises, and to give appropriate advice if it appears the child needs assistance in understanding his or her rights. 
        
       
       
        
        That position is reinforced by the requirements of the regulations so far as they apply in relation to vulnerable persons, of which a child is one. In particular Regulation 20 requires the custody manager to assist a vulnerable person in exercising that person's rights, and Regulation 26 requires the custody manager to explain to a support person that his or her role is not confined to acting merely as an observer, but also extends to doing the other things specified. 
        
       
       
        
        It is important that police officers appreciate that the regime now established is designed to secure ethical and fair investigations, as well as the protection of individual rights, of some significance, which attach in particular to children. Those rights, obviously, are of great importance when a child is facing a charge as serious as murder or armed robbery.  
        
       
       
        
        The provisions need to be faithfully implemented and not merely given lip service or imperfectly observed. The consequences of any failure to give proper regard to them is to risk the exclusion of any ERISP, or the product of an investigative procedure, which is undertaken in circumstances where there has not been proper compliance with the law."" 
        
       
     60   It must be noted that the law not only requires the affording of an opportunity to a child during an interrogation to exercise on proper advice the option to speak or remain silent, but to have that advice so as to give consideration as to whether, in speaking, they might produce an account which does not do justice to their position. 
     61   Here it was clear that the police sought to ascertain the appellant's age, prior to arrest, from his mother. That enquiry was so specific it would seem that it was made with a view to interviewing the appellant in the absence of any such person as is referred to in s.13. 
     62   There would seem to be no good reason why, even if the appellant were over the age of 18, there should not have been an accompanying person permitted. Indeed, the special position of vulnerability referred to by the High Court in McKinney v. The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 468 at 478 and the considerations to which that court adverted in Foster v. The Queen (1993) 113 ALR 1 would plainly raise the advisability of giving consideration to such a course. There was no evidence before us of any consideration of any such course. 
     63   Having regard to those principles and considerations, I am unable to see that any matter has been advanced which would have the effect of precluding a trial judge from rejecting the interviews when tendered in evidence arising from the particular circumstances of the case, even if such a judge were to hold that there was proper and sufficient reason for the absence of such a person as is referred to in s.13. For my part, I would conclude that the significant possibility test proposed by the Crown for the exclusion of the evidence has been met and I would further conclude, as I have already said, that in the event of exclusion, there was, in my view, a significant possibility that there would have been a different result. 
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
     64   Having regard to those matters, I am of the view that ground two is made out.  
     65   Since the submission concerning the fresh evidence of what the appellant would now have wished to have said, that he refrained from saying in his interview and at trial would result in, even if successful, at best an order for a new trial and I am of the view that the appropriate course, ground two having succeeded, is that there be an order for a new trial. I need not consider that submission any further. 
     66   For these reasons I am of the view that the appeal should be upheld, the conviction and sentence quashed and a new trial ordered.

      R v Chun Hing LAW 
      
     JUDGMENT1   MEAGHER JA: I will ask Newman AJ to give the first judgment. 
     2   NEWMAN AJ: This is an appeal against a conviction for conspiring to import not less than a commercial quantity of heroin into Australia contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act 1901. Accompanying the appeal is an application for leave to appeal against the life sentence passed on the appellant following his conviction. 
     3   A number of grounds of appeal were taken by the appellant. However, in view of the conclusion I have reached in respect of one of these grounds, it is unnecessary for me to deal with those other grounds. The ground I refer to his Ground 4, which is stated as follow: 
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried by reason of the trial judge’s comments on the failure of the accused to give evidence in the circumstances of the trial."" 
        
       
     4   Because of the conclusion I have reached as to the fate of this ground, it is also not essential for me to recount in detail the case brought by the Crown against the appellant, albeit, let me observe, a very strong case. It will suffice for the purpose of these reasons to summarise the Crown case in a pithy form. 
     5   The Crown case alleged that the appellant was a co-conspirator in five importations of heroin into Australia. Those importations were alleged to have taken place first in January 1994, second in July 1994, third in August 1994, fourth in November 1994 and the fifth one in January of 1995. The other co-conspirators in the operation involving the importations were alleged to be, amongst others, one Alan Tam Yu Wah (whom I shall hereafter refer to as Tam); Mao Huang Tung (whom I shall refer to as Mao); Brian Kuan (whom I shall refer to as Brian); Kevin Ho (whom I shall refer to as Ho); Yu Tit Hoi (whom I shall refer to as Hoi); and a Joseph Law Ling (whom I shall refer to as Ling). 
     6   Prior to the trial of the appellant all of the co-conspirators, with the exception of Joseph Ling Law whose whereabouts were at the time of the appellant’s trial and, as I understand from the Crown today, still are unknown, were indicted for trial on a variety of charges relating to the alleged importation. After a series of forensic manoeuvres Mao, Tam and Yu ultimately pleaded guilty and were duly sentenced. Ho, who seemed to wish to defend the matter, also ultimately pleaded guilty and was also sentenced. He had not, as I understand the matter, been finally dealt with at the time of the appellant’s trial. Kuan was found guilty by a jury following a plea of not guilty and he too was, accordingly, sentenced. 
     7   It was the Crown case that the first four importations evaded the attention of the authorities and were thus successful. It was the interception of the fifth importation which led to the trial of the appellant and his alleged co-conspirators. 
     8   The means by which the importations were arranged were, on the Crown case, strikingly similar. In each importation crates containing oriental objects d’art were airfreighted into this country. Not only did the crates contain the objects d’art but also heroin secreted within the legitimate cargo. The crates on each occasion were consigned to a number of addresses in inner suburban Sydney, then transferred to another address for repacking (called a “safe house” in evidence) and then the heroin was distributed into the community. 
     9   To carry out the conspiracy a number of real estate leases were entered into by the conspirators and various mobile phones and pagers were hired. Funds were transferred between this country and Hong Kong and other places. 
     10   As against the appellant it was alleged that he leased the premises used for the first delivery of the contraband for the second, third and fourth importations. He was not in Australia when the fifth consignment entered this country because of legal problems he had encountered in Hong Kong where he was occasionally resident. I say “occasionally” because his residential address was in Toronto, Canada. 
     11   The Crown case also alleged that the appellant took part in the transfer of funds between Australia and Hong Kong as one of the facets of the conspiracy. 
     12   As I have already observed, the Crown case mounted against the appellant can be correctly described as being a strong one. Not only was the appellant implicated by documentation and the evidence of observation which implicated him in the conspiracy but also one of his alleged co-conspirators, Tam, gave evidence in the trial which strongly implicated him. Furthermore, evidence was led which was probative of the appellant lying to police on his apprehension, which could give rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt. 
     13   In the face of this very strong Crown case the appellant did not give evidence. It was a reference to the appellant’s failure to give evidence in the learned trial judge’s summing-up which founds Ground 4 of the appeal. 
     14   The impugned passages in the summing-up are as follows (appeal book p 74): 
      
       
        
         
        “I said I would return to the direction I gave you that the accused is entitled to say nothing at all in his defence and still ask you to find that some element, or elements, in the Crown case have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, and that that is what the accused has done in this case and the fact that he has placed no material before you, does not constitute any kind of admission of guilt. There may be reasons, of which we are unaware why an accused person does not give evidence.” 
        
       
     15   At appeal book p 75: 
      
       
        
        “That is not in any way to place an onus of proof upon the accused, the onus of proof rests with the Crown and remains there throughout.” 
        
       
     16   At appeal book p 83: 
      
       
        
        “The next thing I wanted to say to you is this; that with respect to the facts that the accused didn’t give evidence at the trial or call evidence on behalf of the defence other than the tendering of a small number of documents that will be before you, that the failure to give evidence cannot be presumed as an admission of his guilt and that in fact a failure to contradict or explain incriminating evidence in circumstances where it would be reasonable to expect it to be in the power of an accused to do so may make it easier to accept or draw inferences from evidence relied upon by the Crown.” 
        
       
     17   Following their retirement the jury asked the following question: 
      
       
        
        “Are the jury able to use the fact that the accused did not mount a defence in any way to support proof of guilt?” 
        
       
     18   His Honour directed the jury in the following manner (appeal book p 116): 
      
       
        
        “The accused is entitled to say nothing at all in his defence and still ask you to find that some element, or elements, of the Crown case have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt and that is what the accused has done in this case and the fact that he has placed no material before you, does not constitute any kind of admission of guilt. There may be reasons of which we are unaware why an accused person does not give evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand, he has not denied or sought to explain any particular piece of evidence in the prosecution case and it is proper to have in mind that it is usually easier to accept uncontradicted evidence than evidence which is actively disputed. Similarly, an inference adverse to the accused may more readily be inferred in the absence of an explanation. An hypothesis consistent with innocence may cease to rational or reasonable (sic) in the absence of evidence to support it, when that evidence, if it exists, might be within the knowledge of the accused. The onus of proof rests with the Crown and remains there throughout.” 
        
       
     19   His Honour’s summing-up and his response to the jury’s question took place in April of 1998. In my view, his Honour’s directions were on all fours with the law which had fallen in particular from Brennan and Toohey JJ in the High Court in Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217. Weissensteiner preceded the passage of the Evidence Act 1995 and, in particular s 20(2) of that Act which reads: 
      
       
        
         
        “The judge or any party (other than the prosecutor) may comment on the failure of the defendant to give evidence. However, unless the comment is made by another defendant in the proceeding, the comment must not suggest that the defendant failed to give evidence because the defendant was, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence concerned.” 
        
       
     20   Also since April of 1998 the High Court has reconsidered the law in relation to the appropriate directions to be given in a criminal case where an accused person has not given evidence: see RPS v The Queen (2000) HCA 3 and, more importantly, in Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) HCA 25. There the majority of the High Court, consisting of Gaudron, Kirby, Gummow and Hayne JJ had these observations to make (p 19): 
      
       
        
         
        “Another important matter to be noted with respect to  
        Weissensteiner  
        is that, as mentioned above, that case was decided in a context in which there was no prohibition on judicial comment with respect to an accused’s failure to give evidence. That is not the case with s 20(2) of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . That sub-section enables comment to be made but it contains a prohibition against suggesting that the accused failed to give evidence because he or she is, or believes that he or she is, guilt of the offence charged. 
        
       
       
        
        There may be cases involving circumstances such that the reasoning in  
        Weissensteiner  
        will justify some comment. However, that will be so only if there is a basis for concluding that, if there are additional facts which would explain or contradict the inference which the prosecution seeks to have the jury draw, and they are facts which (if they exist) would be peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, that a comment on the accused’s failure to provide evidence of those facts may be made. The facts which it is suggested could have been, but were not, revealed by evidence from the accused must be additional to those already given in evidence by the witnesses who were called. The fact that the accused could have contradicted evidence already given will not suffice. Mere contradiction would not be evidence of any additional fact. In an accusatorial trial, an accused is not required to explain or contradict matters which are already the subject of evidence at trial. These matters must be assessed by the jury against the requisite standard of proof, without regard to the fact that the accused did not give evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        RPS 
        , McHugh J expressed the view that, if the circumstances of a case are such that some comment is permissible, the preferable course is for comment to be made in terms of a failure to offer an explanation, rather than a failure to give evidence. That was the approach that Gaudron J and his Honour endorsed in  
        Weissensteiner 
        , saying: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘it is the failure to provide an “explanation or answer ... as might be expected if the truth were consistent with innocence” ... which is of evidentiary significance and not the failure to give evidence as such. In many cases, an explanation can be offered without the giving of evidence ... Accordingly, directions should be given in terms of the unexplained facts, rather than in terms of the failure to give evidence or to meet the prosecution case ... or the failure to answer questions from investigating police.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Weissensteiner 
        , Gaudron and McHugh JJ were in dissent. Subject to one important qualification, however, the approach taken by their Honours in that case is one that conforms to s 20(2) of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . More to the point, to refer to the failure of an accused to give evidence, rather than his or her failure to offer an explanation is to risk contravention of the prohibition in s 20(2) against suggesting that the accused failed to give evidence because he or she was guilty or believed himself or herself to be so. 
        
       
       
        
        The qualification to which reference has just been made is this: as already explained, a judge may comment on evidence, not give directions with respect to the evidence. If the circumstances are such as to permit a comment with respect to the failure to offer an explanation, it should be made plain that it is a comment which the jury are free to disregard. If made, it should be placed in its proper context. That requires identifying the facts which are said to call for an explanation and giving adequate directions to the jury about the onus of proof, the absence of any obligation on the accused to give evidence, and the fact that the accused does not give evidence is not an admission, does not fill gaps in the prosecution’s proofs and is not to be used as a make-weight. And the comment should not go beyond that made in  
        Weissensteiner 
        , as adapted to refer to the failure to offer an explanation rather than the failure to give evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        It is to be emphasised that cases in which a judge may comment on the failure of an accused to offer an explanation will be both rare and exceptional. They will occur only if the evidence is capable of explanation by disclosure of additional facts known only to the accused. A comment will never be warranted merely because the accused has failed to contradict some aspect of the prosecution case. Once that is appreciated, the supposed tension between  
        Weissensteiner 
         and  
        RPS  
        disappears. In  
        Weissensteiner 
        , the comment related to the absence of evidence of additional facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused; in  
        RPS 
        , there was no question of any additional fact known only to the accused merely the failure to contradict aspects of the prosecution case.” 
        
       
     21   In essence, what the majority held was that observations in a summing-up in a criminal case which conform with that which fell from Brennan and Toohey JJ in Weissensteiner can only be made as matters of comment and identified by the trial judge as such, which comment the jury can disregard, but not to be given as a direction which the jury must follow. Here the impugned verbiage used by his Honour was that of direction, the very matter which the majority in Azzopardi held to constitute error. 
     22   The Crown submitted that a fair reading of the summing-up demonstrates that his Honour’s were not in error. It was put that such was the nature and extent of the Crown case that the appellant, being the only person who could explain certain matters which ex facie implicated him in the conspiracy was such that a direction of the Weissensteiner type was appropriate. 
     23   However, as I have said, an observation in line with what fell from the High Court in Weissensteiner cannot be given as a matter of direction, only as a matter of comment. It follows that the impugned direction contravenes the law as explained by the majority in Azzopardi. The legal fiction that the law has always been as last determined by the Court of ultimate authority applies. 
     24   Accordingly, Ground 4, in my view, is made out.  
     25   In the light of the strength of the Crown case, I have considered the question of whether or not the proviso should apply. In determining whether the proviso should apply I have considered whether the misdirection did not deprive the appellant of a chance of acquittal. It has to be particularly borne in mind that the last of the misdirections, that given in response to the jury’s question, arose late in the deliberations of the jury. 
     26   In these circumstances, I am driven to the conclusion that the proviso cannot be applied in this case because, in the circumstances of the case, it cannot be said that the misdirection did not deprive the appellant of a chance of acquittal. 
     27   As I have indicated earlier in these reasons, having concluded that Ground 4 must succeed, it is not necessary for me to consider the other grounds of appeal raised in the application for leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     28   The orders I propose are as follows: 
     1. Appeal upheld.2. Conviction and sentence quashed.3. The appellant is to have a new trial at a date and place to be fixed. 
      
       
        
       
     29   MEAGHER JA: I quite agree. In my view, on the current state of the authorities, a trial judge in his summing-up to the jury would be well advised never to refer to the silence of the accused, much less give directions on the topic. 
     30   KIRBY J: I also agree. 
     31   MEAGHER JA: The orders of the Court, therefore, are the orders proposed by Newman AJ.

        REGINA v AARON PENMAN 
       
        
       
       JUDGMENT 
       
        
     1   WOOD CJ AT CL: On 26 October 2000 the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of larceny and to one count of take a conveyance without consent of its owner. He was sentenced by O'Reilly DCJ on 12 December 2000, in relation to each count, to imprisonment for 16 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. A pre-sentence period of custody of 23 days was taken into account in his favour. The sentence and non parole period were each specified to date from 20 November 2000. 
     2   The offences of which the applicant was convicted occurred on 1 September 1999 and involved the taking of a truck, and the theft of the furniture which it contained. When initially interviewed by police, following discovery at his home of some of the stolen furniture, the applicant offered an explanation along the lines that, while walking home, he had been approached by a man who had offered the furniture to him for $300. 
     3   On 20 December 1999 he was, at his own request, reinterviewed by police. On that occasion he admitted to having stolen the truck and furniture, it being his account that along with three other men he had come upon the truck parked by the side of the road and finding the keys in it, they had driven it away. Some of the furniture he acknowledged had been sold before the truck was abandoned. 
     4   It was upon the basis of those agreed facts that he was sentenced and it is upon the basis of those facts that it is necessary for this court to re-examine the matter. In that regard, it is necessary for us to re-examine the matter for the reason that, regrettably, the Court Reporting tape of the Reasons for Sentence has been lost, so that we do not have the benefit of knowing precisely how it was that his Honour approached the sentencing of the applicant, beyond so much as is discernible from the bare sentencing order, and from a brief note provided by his Honour as to what he recalled of the matter. That recollection, his Honour admitted, was imperfect. 
     5   The application is brought to this court upon two bases: First, that the sentence was manifestly excessive and secondly, that special circumstances should have been found justifying a departure from the 75 percent ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence. 
     6   I shall deal with these grounds in terms. 
      
       
      S 
      entence manifestly excessive. 
       
     7   The maximum available penalty for each of the two offences charged was imprisonment for five years (see ss 117 and 154A of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW). 
     8   Although it would appear that the offences were spontaneous and although the truck was not taken with any intention of permanently retaining it or selling it, the offences were serious. The plea was offered early and assistance was provided, both insofar as the applicant volunteered himself for re-interview and insofar as he identified his co-offenders. Together those factors, which additionally show a degree of contrition on his part, were such as to justify the discount, in the order of 20 percent, which appears to have been given in the case. 
     9   The applicant was young, being 18 years of age at the time of the offences. By the time he appeared for sentence it appears, upon the material before his Honour, that he had undergone a significant change for the better and had abandoned the bad company into which he had fallen. An earlier stage of his life, during which he had associated with those persons, had seen him acquire convictions as a juvenile for offences of robbery, larceny and steal from a person, as well as a similar offence of take and drive a conveyance without consent of the owner. 
     10   The first series of offences involving robbery, larceny and steal from a person, attracted recognisances for two years which were still current, at the time of the present offences. That was a circumstance of considerable aggravation calling for the imposition of a custodial sentence of some severity. (See Richards (1981) 2 NSWLR 464; Daridis, NSW CCA 18 December 1986 and Tran (1999) NSWCCA 109.) 
     11   As an adult, the applicant had committed one offence of larceny and one offence of shoplifting before the present offences. The offence of shoplifting had attracted a Community Service order, while the sentence for larceny had attracted a fixed term of imprisonment for seven days. That matter went on appeal and as a consequence, although the offence of larceny had preceded the present offence, it was not until 26 November 1999 that the fixed term of seven days imprisonment was actually served. A further offence of shoplifting was outstanding at the time when the applicant appeared for sentence, however it occurred after the present offences. 
     12   In the light of that record, taking into account that there were two distinct aspects of criminality in the offences charged, and making full allowance for the applicant's youth and the recent improvement in his attitude, I am not persuaded that the overall terms were manifestly excessive. On the contrary, I consider them to have been well within range. 
     13   In this regard, the nature of the offences and the applicant's record were such as to require a sentence that reflected a significant element of general and specific deterrence. In particular his continuing disobedience to the law prior to the time when he appeared for sentence, meant that the fact of his youth could not be regarded as a barrier against the imposition of a sentence otherwise appropriate for his subjective and objective circumstances. This ground of appeal is therefore not made good. 
      
       
      B. Special Circumstances.  
       
     14   It is evident from the sentencing order that his Honour did not find special circumstances. It is not however evident, in the absence of the Reasons, why that conclusion was reached.  
     15   In my view, there was material available to his Honour which did constitute special circumstances. They related to: 
      
       
      a) the age of the applicant and the fact that this would be a first occasion of significant imprisonment for him, it always being important to bear in mind the significance of the first clanging of the gaol door for a young person;  
       
       
      b) the clear evidence from his mother and stepfather that, following the period of 18 months during which he had fallen into trouble when associated with bad company, he had come to his senses, had resumed living at home and had been working; 
       
       
      c) the somewhat neutral terms of the pre-sentence report, which did support the parents’ assessment that there did seem to be favourable prospects for his future, although naturally that was somewhat guarded, having regard to his past record. 
       
     16   The case was one where the interest of the rehabilitation of a young person was of considerable importance. It was also one where both the applicant and the community stood to benefit from an extended period of supervision on parole. This justified a departure from the proportion between the head sentence and non-parole period otherwise required by S 44(2) of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal. 
     17   The additional material placed before the court can therefore be taken into account. It shows firstly, that the applicant has behaved responsibly while in custody, having been entrusted with the job of Head Sweeper in 5 Wing of the Malabar Special Program Centre. That position he has managed, according to the report provided, ""exceptionally well"". In addition, there was evidence to the effect that the applicant is a Type 1 insulin dependent diabetic who has suffered a number of hypoglycaemic episodes while in custody requiring, on occasions, his hospitalisation. As is well-known, diabetes is a condition that requires access to food and exercise in circumstances that are not well catered for within the prison environment. It is also a condition which can have significant complications if hypoglycaemic episodes and associated convulsions are not readily and adequately managed. 
     18   It may also be taken into account in the present case, that his experience of a period in custody and of the associated hardship, will be something which will stand as a significant personal deterrent for him. It is a matter which I also consider could be profitably and well addressed during a period of post-release supervision, so as to bring home to him the consequences for him in the future if he should reoffend. 
     19   In all of these circumstances, I am of the view that this court should intervene and reduce the non-parole period to one of nine months to date from 20 November 2000 and to expire on 19 August 2001, that is, in almost one week's time. 
     20   I accordingly propose that leave to appeal be granted, that the non-parole period be quashed and in lieu thereof a non-parole period be imposed of nine months to date from 20 November 2000 and to expire on 20 August 2001. The applicant is to be released on parole on 20 August 2001, subject to such conditions as the Parole Board may specify. 
     21   SPERLING J: I agree 
     22   WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the court will therefore be as I have proposed.

    - 1 -IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALWOOD CJ at CLSPERLING J Wednesday 15 August 200160172/01 Regina v Yee Fang KohJudgment1    WOOD CJ at CL: I ask Sperling J to deliver the judgment to the Court. 
      
       
        
       
     2    SPERLING J: The applicant was charged with the common law offence of conspiracy to cheat and defraud. He pleaded guilty to the offence and was sentenced in the District Court on 21 March 2001. The indictment to which he pleaded was as follows: 
      
       
        
         
          
          ""That he between 30 March 1998 and 18 September 1999 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did with Yeoh Ah Thin, Xue Quing and others, conspired amongst themselves to cheat and defraud American Express, MasterCard, Visa International and other financial institutions of divers large sums of money."" 
          
         
        
       
     3    The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for six years to date from 7 September 1999 and expire on 16 September 2005. The sentencing judge set a non-parole period of four years and two months to date from the commencement of the sentence and to expire on 16 March 2004. His Honour did not find special circumstances. 
      
       
        
       
     4    The applicant seeks leave to appeal in relation to the sentence. The sentencing hearing extended over a number of days and over a considerable period of time in total. It appears that this, together with the absence of transcript, may have contributed to what occurred. It should not be inferred from anything that I am now about to say that criticism is to be levelled at anyone in particular in relation to the outcome. 
      
       
        
       
     5    It has become apparent, having regard to what the Court is told today, that there is considerable doubt as to what was admitted into evidence before his Honour the sentencing judge. In order to provide the context to that problem, it is necessary to mention that the charge arose out of what appears to have been a conspiracy in which a large number of persons participated intending to defraud financial institutions by the use, among other things, of counterfeit credit cards. The cards were presented to retailers by persons who came to be called ""shoppers"". Goods were fraudulently obtained and the goods were subsequently disposed of for profit. 
      
       
        
       
     6    There is no question but that the applicant took part in that conspiracy. So much is established by his plea of guilty. However, for the purpose of sentencing, there are two aspects of the facts which are of importance. One is the overall extent of the conspiracy in terms of the amount of money that was illegally obtained; and, second, the role in the enterprise that was played by the applicant. 
      
       
        
       
     7    It seems that the applicant was, at first, employed in the conspiracy as a shopper but afterwards took up a role that was somewhat different and involved the recording of some, at least, of the goods that were obtained. Whether his role in that regard was more extensive than what might be described as an office clerk is a matter of contention. 
      
       
        
       
     8    The extent of the conspiracy, in terms of the amount of money that was actually involved, is also a matter of contention. Whether the applicant was involved in a practical way in the conspiracy as a whole, or only in what might be called a cell of it, is a matter of contention. 
      
       
        
       
     9    In the course of the sentencing hearing, there were two bodies of evidence tendered to the Court, but what they were and whether, in one respect at least, they actually went into evidence is a matter for doubt by reference to the Court record. 
      
       
        
       
     10    At page 1 of the transcript of 13 September 2000, it is recorded that materials, including a record of interview and a statement of facts, were tendered. The material was not given an exhibit identifier. His Honour was invited to read the material, but it is at least questionable whether the material was admitted into evidence at that time. Certainly, it is questionable as to whether the solicitor appearing for the applicant consented to the tender. It is known that the material included an ERISP. The Court was informed by counsel today that, in his judgment, parts of the record of interview are objectionable. In other respects, it is not possible to identify with certainty what was contained in that body of material. 
      
       
        
       
     11    The second body of material, which is referred to at page 15 of the transcript of 15 September 2000, was given exhibit identifiers as Exhibits A, B and C in the proceedings. However, it is not possible to know with any reliability what was contained in Exhibit A which is described as a white folder. It might have been the material tendered earlier. That is not known. 
      
       
        
       
     12    In these circumstances it is impossible to know what was before the court on the sentencing hearing in the form of documentary evidence relevant to the two matters of importance to which I have referred, namely, the overall value of the conspiracy and the role of the applicant in it. 
      
       
        
       
     13    In those circumstances, there is no way that this Court can decide whether any error occurred in the determination made by the trial judge on materials properly before him, such as they may have been. 
      
       
        
       
     14    The Crown, very properly, does not oppose the position adopted on behalf of the applicant, namely, that, in the circumstances that have occurred, the matter should be remitted to the District Court for redetermination of the applicant's sentence. 
      
       
        
       
     15    The orders I propose are: 
      
       
        
         
          
          1. The sentence is quashed. 
          
         
         
          
          2. The matter is remitted to the District Court for redetermination of the sentence. 
          
         
        
       
     16    WOOD CJ at CL: I agree. The order of the Court will be as Sperling J has proposed. We do note that, in accordance with the usual practice, it would be proper for the matter to be heard by some judge other than the original sentencing judge.

        TRACEY MARIE HUTTON v SOUTHERN PATHOLOGY SERVICES PTY LIMITED 
         
         
        JUDGMENT 
        
       
     1    BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Davies AJA. 
      
       
     2    DAVIES AJA: This is an appeal by leave from the judgment of a judge of the District Court of New South Wales, his Honour Judge J B Phelan. His Honour dismissed a claim for negligence brought by the appellant, Tracey Marie Hutton, against the respondent, Southern Pathology Services Pty Limited (""Southern Pathology""). His Honour was satisfied that no breach of duty on the part of Southern Pathology had been established. 
      
       
     3    The appellant qualified as a registered nurse in 1983. In the course of her career, she worked in a nursing home with the elderly, in a pathology practice in Wollongong, in the Intensive Care Unit at Port Kembla Hospital and for radiologists. In a letter which is in evidence, the appellant referred to working in a pathology practice in Sydney, which specialised in venipuncture. However, this was not mentioned in oral evidence. The appellant last worked as a blood collector in 1986-1987. The appellant moved to Ulladulla in 1990 and obtained employment with Southern Pathology, which carried on a pathology practice at Nowra. 
      
       
     4    The appellant worked for four to six weeks before the accident occurred on 18 May 1990. When she first joined the practice, the appellant was given supervision for the first two days or so by Mrs Barbara Cannon, the chief collector at the time, who was described by another witness as the person who trained all the staff. Mrs Cannon died prior to the trial. The appellant agreed, in cross-examination, that she was an experienced nursing sister, that she had had seven years' experience and that she had taken blood from and given injections to people on thousands and thousands of occasions. It was put to her that she was somebody who would be regarded, in 1990, as a very experienced collector. The appellant said, ""I was known as a good collector"". She agreed that she knew what to do. 
      
       
     5    The evidence shows that, in collecting blood, there were a number of procedures that were standard. The blood specimen was collected, labelled and put into a flexible plastic bag which was sent to the laboratory. Contaminated waste was placed in another bag and put into a container for appropriate disposal. Sharp instruments, such as needles, were dropped into containers described as ""sharps containers"", which, when full, were appropriately disposed of. 
      
       
     6    On the evidence of Sister M C Rooney, who was second in charge of collecting at Nowra at the time when the accident occurred, there were at least two types of sharps containers, one for ordinary needles and like objects, and the other, which had a wider neck, for the disposal of butterfly needles. The containers for ordinary needles, which were shaped like a milk bottle, were supplied by the Health Department. The containers used by Southern Pathology for the disposal of butterfly needles were urine specimen containers which had a lid on top. The neck of these containers was large enough to permit the butterfly needles to be dropped in.  
      
       
     7    Senior counsel for the appellant described the use of the specimen containers as a peculiar practice of Southern Pathology. However, there was no evidence supporting this comment. Butterfly needles were a common instrument used in the collection of blood in difficult cases. As they could not be readily dropped into the ordinary sharps containers, which had a narrow neck, the assumption may be made that it was common practice to provide containers with a wider neck, such as specimen containers, for the disposal of butterfly needles. The evidence before the Court did not show that the specimen containers were inappropriate for their purpose or that such containers were not standard equipment in pathology practices. 
      
       
     8    Sister Rooney gave evidence that the larger containers were in plentiful supply, that each collector had a desk and drawers and that the containers and all other necessary stores were kept in those drawers. 
      
       
     9    The appellant gave this evidence concerning the containers:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Isn't it the fact that the containers that were in existence at the time didn't have a wide enough aperture for the purpose of dropping in these butterfly needles because of the fact they're spread out, do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah, I can't actually recall the containers. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. It wasn't actually a Dairy Farmers milk container, was it? 
          
         A. Well, I can't recall a hundred per cent what it was like because I'm trying to think of something that was ten years ago but it was like an old cut out plastic thing or a, I can't remember if they had those or a bottle with just a -- 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I'm suggesting that you're right in that there was a container which was in a similar shape and size to a milk container that they used for disposing of needles, right, we agree on that. But the aperture at the top of it wasn't clear, it was easy to drop a normal sheath needle through? 
          
         A. Right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But not a butterfly needle because of the wings on the butterfly. So in order to dispose of butterfly needles it was common use to use specimen tubes, plastic, cylindrical specimen tubes, you know what I mean by that, don't you? 
          
         A. It's just a blood collection tube? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes - well, no, not a blood collection tube, they're long and thin. I'm talking about a urine specimen jar which are I think about 2 or 3 centimetres tall, they're the same width at the top as the bottom and they had a screw top lid, you know the type I mean, don't you? 
          
         A. I know the jar you mean, but I've never disposed of a butterfly needle in that manner, ever."" 
         
        
        
       It will be noted that the appellant's memory was such that she could not actually recall what either the ordinary or the larger containers were like. This may have been due, in part, to the severe psychological problems she suffered as a result of the accident. 
        
       
     10    Although the appellant did not recall the containers used for butterfly needles, she did agree in evidence that she had used butterfly needles before. The appellant later gave this evidence, in cross-examination:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. On previous occasions that you had handled butterfly needles, how did you dispose of them then, at this place? 
          
         A. We would put them in the, the milk bottle container. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You would put them in there? 
          
         A. Or the container supplied on your desk. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You just dropped them in did you? 
          
         A. As I remember yes."" 
         
        
       
     11    The appellant did not say in her evidence that she was not familiar with the use and disposal of butterfly needles, nor did she say that the accident occurred because she was unaware of the normal means of disposing of butterfly needles. 
      
       
     12    The accident occurred when the appellant took blood from a patient who was a known HIV sufferer. She was aware of the risk of infection. On the appellant's evidence, with which Sister Rooney did not agree, she called in Sister Rooney to assist her to find a vein, which in an HIV patient can be difficult. The evidence is not clear as to whether the appellant, Sister Rooney or the patient took the blood. The trial Judge made no finding on this point but held that the patient remained the appellant's patient and that it was the appellant who had the task of packaging the blood, the needle and so on. A butterfly needle was used. 
      
       
     13    The appellant checked the manual, with which she had been provided, so as to ensure that all proper procedures were followed. She had earlier read this manual when she commenced to work in the practice. 
      
       
     14    The manual provided, inter alia, concerning collecting procedures in relation to AIDS:- 
      
       
        
         
         "" 
         COLLECTING PROCEDURES 
         
        
        
         
         1. If for HTLV III virus - 2mls blood plain tube 
          
          
         2. Gloves (special  
         fine gloves 
          supplied) to be worn in all collections for blood, semen, urine, faeces, saliva, pus, H.V.S., Cervical swabs etc. 
          
          
         3. Tubes to be labelled - Sticker labelled 'Infections Risk'. 
          
          
         4. Specimens may be separated in rooms but be careful of spillage. 
          
          
         5. Place in  
         specimen bag marked 'Infectious Risk' 
          and transport to laboratory. 
          
          
         6.

         7. Place all contaminated items in large tin container marked 'Highly Contaminated'. 
          
          
         8.  
         Wash hands using soap pads 
          (Iodophor if available, unless skin problems)."" 
         
        
       
     15    After reading the manual, the appellant did not follow the standard practice of disposing of the butterfly needle into a sharps container. She placed the specimen of blood into a specimen bag. She labelled the bag and marked it ""Infectious Risk"". The appellant knew that that bag had to be transported to the laboratory. She then placed the butterfly needle in another specimen bag. She was in the process of labelling the bag ""Infectious Risk"" or of closing the bag when she was accidentally pricked by the needle. 
      
       
     16    The appellant gave evidence that she understood the manual to require that the butterfly needle and contaminated waste be placed in a specimen bag, marked ""Infectious Risk"", and transported to the laboratory. 
      
       
     17    It may be seen that, in the course of conscientiously performing her duty, the appellant misread the manual. Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the manual dealt with the blood specimen and required no unusual step to be taken other than to label the bag ""Infectious Risk"". The appellant had and used such a label. Clause 6 dealt with the needles. It required that the needles not be resheathed. This direction accorded with standard practice. Clause 6 did not specifically mention the means of disposal. Clause 7 dealt with other contaminated items and the means of their disposal. 
      
       
     18    In her evidence, the appellant said that she placed the butterfly needle in the specimen bag because she considered that the manual required her to do so. She said that she never previously came across a contaminated patient. She gave this evidence:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. But you'd been working there for some weeks and you'd been working in that industry for some years, you knew, didn't you that a plastic bag wasn't the way of disposing of a needle? 
          
         A. One, I'd never come across a contaminated patient before, and two, I'd follow the procedure in the manual, I did what the company had told me to do to dispose of that infectious needle, and that's the first infected patient of any kind, hepatitis or AIDS or whatever I'd ever come across and had to dispose of. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But isn't there a standard way in which you dispose of any waste after a blood collection? 
          
         A. In a non infectious patient you just, you put it in your sharps container on your table which in those days if I remember correctly used to be like a cut up milk bottle thing, a plastic milk container or various other things they had in those days. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You don't recall, okay, that's all right. You see, the bag was for the specimen, wasn't it, not for the waste? 
          
         A. The specimen was to go in a bag and then that was to go to the laboratory and then the waste, the infectious waste was supposed to go in the bag and to the laboratory. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well, as I interpreted the manual, like it says, you transport the bag to the laboratory. 
         
        
        
         
         [Q.] 
          In the whole time you've worked there you've never had to carry needles, used needles from one room to another, had you? 
          
         A. Infectious ones, no. Because I'd never come across an infectious one. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. I'm sorry? 
          
         A. I'd never come across an infected needle before …"" 
         
        
       
     19    The appellant's evidence that she had never previously come across an infectious patient or an infected needle was, of course, wrong. Sister Rooney gave evidence that it was standard practice to treat all blood as potentially infectious. Although the evidence did not say so, the purpose of taking blood on many occasions was to test for infection. 
      
       
     20    There were three factors which appear to have contributed to the accident. The first was that the appellant may have become flustered when she had to deal with an HIV patient. The appellant's evidence was replete with references to the fact that she had never previously had to deal with an infectious patient. This cannot be correct. Perhaps she meant that she had not previously dealt with an HIV patient. The appellant must commonly have taken blood from patients who carried infections. All blood should have been treated as potentially infectious. That was the reason why such care was taken for the disposal of needles and other sharp instruments in sharps containers. The appellant, apparently, had not previously taken blood from a known HIV patient. She did not, however, tell Sister Rooney of this fact nor ask Sister Rooney, or any other person in the practice, for advice as to the procedures to be undertaken. 
      
       
     21    The second was that the appellant did not adopt what Sister Rooney said was proper practice, namely, to set out on the desk before taking the blood, all the instruments and articles that would be needed. Sister Rooney said that these should be set out on the desk so that they were ready for use when required. 
      
       
     22    The third was that the appellant read the manual whilst she was undertaking the finishing tasks, not before she commenced to take the blood. 
      
       
     23    Because she misread the manual, the appellant failed to follow what was the standard procedure, namely, to dispose of the needle into a sharps container. She took the steps she did because she considered that she was required to do so by the manual. The manual did not so require and, in my opinion, was not misleading. It is surprising that the appellant thought either that the butterfly needle had to be sent to the laboratory or that it had to be sent in a plastic specimen bag rather than placed in a sharps container for disposal. However, that is what occurred. 
      
       
     24    Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the accident occurred because no adequate provision was made for the disposal of butterfly needles and because the appellant was uncertain as to how to dispose of the butterfly needle which had been used. However, the appellant did not give evidence to that effect. She did not give evidence that she looked at the manual because she was uncertain as to how butterfly needles were disposed of. The appellant said that she disposed of the butterfly needle as she did because the manual so required. For example, she gave this evidence:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. You had used butterfly needles before, hadn't you? 
          
         A. Yes, not that often, but yes I had, on difficult patients, but I was good at taking blood and I could usually get it with a normal, a plain needle. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But this was the first time you had ever disposed of one in a bag? 
          
         A. Yes, because of the infectious risk policy in the manual."" 
         
        
       
     25    The appellant said that she examined the manual because she wanted to check the correct procedures when dealing with an HIV patient. The appellant also gave this evidence:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. What I was going to suggest to you is this, you didn't have recourse to any container that day because you believe that this needle had to be put into a bag, isn't that right? 
          
         A. Well yes, I followed what I have read in the manual for infectious waste. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I just want a yes or no answer to this question. You believe it didn't matter what container was there because you believed that this needle had to be placed in a bag labelled and sealed, isn't that right? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: You mean exhibit 3? 
         
        
        
         
         GILBERT: Q. Exhibit 3? 
          
         A. Yes, that's what I believed as I read."" 
         
        
       
     26    Counsel for the appellant submitted that Southern Pathology had failed to provide a safe system for the disposal of butterfly needles or had failed to communicate that system. Counsel submitted that the accident occurred because nobody had told the appellant what system should be adopted. 
      
       
     27    However, the trial Judge was not satisfied that Southern Pathology had failed to institute a safe system. He was not satisfied that the appellant lacked any essential equipment. He was not satisfied that Southern Pathology had failed to give adequate information to the appellant as to the system to be followed. 
      
       
     28    I see no error in the trial Judge's findings in this respect. The manual was not misleading. Nor was there any matter which had to be specifically communicated in relation to the disposal of needles used in the taking of blood from an HIV patient, save perhaps for the labelling. The appellant had the appropriate labels and used them. 
      
       
     29    The trial Judge took the view that the accident occurred because the appellant misread the manual. The trial Judge found that the appellant, ""did not have recourse to any container on 18 May 1990 because she believed from reading the manual that the needle had to be put in a plastic bag"". His Honour said that the construction which the appellant put upon the manual did not make sense. His Honour concluded that the appellant had misread the manual in a manner which was not reasonably foreseeable on the employer's part. The trial Judge added:- 
      
       
        
         
         ""This was because the instruction was clear in its terms, was a practice that applied where contamination was assumed to be always possible and in circumstances where to conclude as the plaintiff did was positively dangerous and unreasonable."" 
         
        
        
       I see no error in the view taken by the trial Judge. 
        
       
     30    In giving consideration of the principle enunciated by Mason, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ in McLean v Tedman (1984) 155 CLR 306 at 311-312 that, ""an employer is bound to have regard to any risk of injury that may occur by reason of an employee's inadvertence, inattention or misjudgment in performing his allotted task"", the trial Judge, relevantly, took into account that the appellant was a person of professional status and experienced in her profession. 
      
       
     31    The trial Judge was entitled to take that view. The appellant had put herself forward as a qualified nurse and an experienced and good collector. She had been supervised when she first joined Southern Pathology. She had been found to be competent in her work. Southern Pathology was entitled to act on the basis that she knew the standard procedures. Those procedures were safe procedures. In relation to an HIV patient, the procedure to be adopted for the disposal of a needle was the standard procedure. No expert tuition or supervision was required. Unfortunately, this is a case where a person, who was well qualified, acted inexplicably. 
      
       
     32    In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.  
      
       
     33    GROVE J: I agree with Davies AJA.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 WOOD CJ AT CL: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Black QC in the District Court at Bourke on 1 November 2000, following his plea of guilty to an offence of armed robbery (s 97(2) Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty imprisonment for twenty years). When sentencing the applicant his Honour took into account, on a form 1, a further offence of take and drive a conveyance, an offence for which the maximum penalty under s 154A of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for five years. The sentence imposed was one of imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. Each was back dated to 12 August 2000 to take into account the time spent in custody. 
      
       
       Facts: 
       
     2 On the evening of 7 February 2000 the victim, Tim Spora, was at his place of work with a woolbroking company in Bathurst Street, Brewarrina. At about 8.45 p.m. the applicant's younger brother, Paul Boney, entered these premises. He was carrying a screwdriver behind his back and he asked the victim whether he had $2. Mr Spora replied in the negative. The applicant, who had followed Paul Boney into the premises, took the screwdriver from him, and threatened to stab Mr Spora. The latter opened his wallet, took out $35 and handed it over. Paul Boney thereafter took the wallet and searched it for further money. While that was happening the applicant asked the victim several times where the safe and money bag were. When informed that there was no safe and that he did not know if there was a money bag, the applicant required Mr Spora to enter a small room in the office. While he there he managed to seize the applicant's wrist which appeared to have the effect of calming him down. Shortly afterwards, after having shut and locked the front door, Paul Boney came into the room and instructed Mr Spora to remain there. Both men then left the shop, although not before the applicant apologised to the victim. Paul Boney picked up the keys to his four wheel drive vehicle. Under the control of the applicant they then drove this vehicle away from the premises. It was located later that night near the saleyards in a damaged condition, consistent with it having been driven through the scrub.  
      
       
     3 When initially spoken to by police, the applicant and his co-offender declined to be interviewed. Each subsequently pleaded guilty to the offence. The co-offender was dealt with in the Brewarrina Children's Court on 6 June 2000 for this and other offences. He received, in relation to those offences, concurrent sentences of one hundred hours community service. This was after taking into account a period of four months detention pending sentence.  
      
       
     4 It is not entirely clear whether his Honour had fully placed before him the breadth and nature of those offences. They are, however, of some importance having regard to the submissions addressed to us today. In substance, it appears that they include, first of all, offences of take and drive a conveyance and enter enclosed land in respect of the charge dated 15 December 1999.  
      
       
     5 Additionally, apart from the matters with which the present applicant was charged, they included an offence of break and enter with intent for which the charge date was 11 March 2000. There were other charges which had been withdrawn.  
      
       
     6 The sole ground of appeal raised that of parity, it being submitted that when the sentence of the co-offender was taken into account the applicant was left with a ""justifiable sense of grievance"" as that expression has been explained in Lowe v. The Queen 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v. The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295.  
      
       
     7 In relation to that aspect of the case his Honour had observed: 
      
       
        
         
         ""Reference has been made to the case of Govinden. Suffice it to say that in my judgment this is not a Govinden case."" 
          
         
        
       
     8 As Sully J (with whom Newman J agreed) said in Regina v. Doggett NSW CCA 24 March 1996, in order to succeed, on appeal, on this ground: 
      
       
        
         
         ""What has to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the grounds of parity is not that he feels aggrieved but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the offender's grievance is justified."" 
          
         
        
       
     9 That sense of grievance is said here to be engendered by the circumstances that:  
      
       
        
         
         (a) the applicant, who was aged eighteen years six months and one week, at the time of the offence, as only eighteen months older than the co-offender (who was aged seventeen years and two weeks at the time of the offence);  
          
          
         (b) their objective criminality was similar;  
          
          
         (c) although the applicant had a longer criminal history than his co-offender the record of the latter was also not without blemish and he had similarly abused the opportunity of conditional liberty, in that the subject offence of armed robbery, was committed at a time when he was on bail for the December 1999 matters and, in fact, had absconded in relation to that;  
          
          
         (d) the co-offender was being dealt with for the several other offences which I have already mentioned;  
          
          
         (e) each of the offenders was of Aboriginal descent from a similarly deprived background in the course of which they had been exposed to violence between the parties and to substance abuse by their mother.  
          
         
        
       
     10 Standing alone, as Mr Button has readily conceded, the sentence imposed upon the applicant could not possibly have been challenged, having regard to the guideline judgment in R v. Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Each of the criteria there specified was present, so that the applicant could properly have expected a sentence, at least, in the range of imprisonment for four to five years. I say ""At least"" because there was an additional circumstance of considerable aggravation present in that the applicant was upon parole for an offence of robbery in company. This also has, however, a significance in relation to the parity, since the co-offender had similarly been dealt with for an offence of robbery in company for which he had received 150 hours of community service.  
      
       
     11 The applicant did have a criminal history which could also be properly classified as more than a little history. That is something in excess of that which was contemplated in the guideline judgment. His record included multiple convictions dating back to 1993 for: break, enter and steal, stealing, receiving, goods in custody, steal motor vehicle, carrying firearm or cutting weapon, possession of implements for house-breaking or stealing motor vehicles, assault police and resist arrest, robbery in company, common assault, malicious damage, use and possess prohibited drugs and various other offences which had been dealt with by control orders, probation and community service.  
      
       
     12 Most recently, that is on 7 March 2000, a date following the offence but preceding the date on which he appeared for sentence, the applicant had been sentenced to fix terms of imprisonment for one month and three months in relation to the offences of assault and malicious damage. 
      
       
     13 In the light of that history, the sentences imposed were, if anything, lenient, even allowing for the fact that the armed robbery was unplanned and had been committed by the applicant following his use of a drug and trying to acquire more drugs.  
      
       
     14 However, that is not the end of the matter, it being necessary in order to consider the parity argument to take into account a number of other factors as follows: 
      
       
        (a) There is no longer an inflexible rule that there is no utility in comparing sentences imposed upon co-offenders who are separately dealt with: one in the Children's Court and the other as an adult. See  
       Regina v.Govinden 
        (1999) 106 A Crim R 314 and  
       R v. Colgan 
        (1999) NSW CCA 292. 
        
        
       While it is true that there are different sentencing objectives and considerations applicable in the Children's Court, which do limit the worth of any such comparison, it would have been appropriate for his Honour to have paid some regard to that sentence. 
        
       (b) While the applicant's record was worse than that of the co-offender his record, as I have previously observed, was not without blemish and did include, significantly, the prior offence of robbery in company. 
        
       (c) While the applicant committed the offence at the time when he was subject to parole the co-offender was similarly subject to conditional liberty.  
        
       (d) While it was the applicant who menaced the victim with a screwdriver and became aggressive when seeking money additional to the $35 which the victim handed over, the co-offender was also not entirely passive and, indeed, he was the person who made the first demand on the victim. 
        
       (e) While the applicant had a longstanding history of substance abuse, the co-offender similarly had a minor history of recreational use.  
        
       (f) An age difference of eighteen months in the late teens is not particularly great, although in the current situation, as an elder brother, the applicant might have been expected to have shown a better example to the co-offender. 
        
       (g) Apart from the four months spent in custody by the co-offender the sentence of community service which he received for the variety of offences before the court was, to say the least, a very lenient sentence. 
        
       
     15 Two further matters of sentencing principle do arise for consideration and application in this case. Firstly, where there is a degree of disparity as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for this Court to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved. In that regard, Simpson J said in Regina v. Steel NSW CCA 17 April 1997: 
      
       
        
         
         ""The frequently cited passage from the judgment of Mason J ( 
         Lowe 
         ) is not authority for the proposition that, in any case where such disparity is shown, a Court of Criminal Appeal must reduce a co-offender's sentence to one which is inadequate. It is authority for the proposition that, in an appropriate case, taking into account all of the circumstances, including the existence of a justifiable sense of grievance in the more heavily sentenced co-offender, the appellate court has a discretion to do so."" 
          
         
        
       
     16 The second relevant principle is that a stage can be reached at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so great that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one. See the observations to that effect by Hunt CJ at CL in Regina v. Diamond NSW CCA 18 February 1993. Further, as was made plain, for example, in Hopper NSW CCA 19 November 1998: 
      
       
        
         
         “Where a co-accused has received a comparatively more lenient sentence than the applicant a Court may exercise its discretion by declining to interfere because it does not wish to duplicate what seems to have been gross error in the sentencing of the applicant's co-offender."" 
          
         
        
       
     17 Taking all those matters into account and also taking into account the circumstances, it appears to me that the position in relation to the Children's Court proceedings may not have been properly placed before his Honour - I am of the view that it is appropriate to intervene to a limited extent. 
      
       
     18 It may also be noted that Mr Button of counsel accepts that whatever sentence is imposed it must significantly reflect the objective and subjective criminality here involved. He does not invite the imposition of a sentence comparable to that imposed upon the co-offender. That is a sentence of community service. He recognises that the sentence must properly be one of full time custody. 
      
       
     19 The orders which I propose, therefore, are: 
      
       
       1. That the sentenced below be quashed and taking into account the matter in the form 1, the applicant should be sentenced for the offence on the indictment to a term of imprisonment for two and a half years to date from 12 August 2000 and to expire on 11 February 2003. 
        
       2. I would specify a non-parole period of one year three months, similarly, to date from 12 August 2000 and to expire on 11 November 2001.  
        
       3. I would direct the release of the applicant upon parole upon expiry of the non-parole period. 
       
     20 GROVE J: I agree.21 WOOD CJ AT CL: The order of the Court, therefore, will be as I have proposed.

      Daniel John BEZZINA v Kathleen TAYLOR 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 STEIN JA: The Court is of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs and that it does not raise any question of general principle pursuant to s 45(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1970.  
      
       
     2 The Court's reasons in short form will follow. Before embarking on those reasons it should be noted that upon the dismissal of the appeal, it is agreed between the parties that the verdict sum should be amended because of an arithmetical error made by his Honour in relation to the Fox v Wood component of the damages. In due course, the judgment will be varied.  
      
       
     3 The respondent was injured in a motor vehicle accident which occurred at Lisarow in 1996. Her motor car came into collision with a truck being driven by the appellant on a bend of the roadway. 
      
       
     4 At and before the time of impact the respondent was driving on her correct side of the road, which was a fairly narrow one, and with a dirt surface. At and before the time of impact the appellant was driving partly on his incorrect side of the road.  
      
       
     5 Prior to the collision occurring, both parties applied their brakes and skidded. His Honour found that the defendant was negligent. In my opinion, this was a conclusion that was completely open on the evidence. 
      
       
     6 The appellant submits that there was evidence that overhanging vegetation on the roadway prior to the curve where the accident occurred meant that he had to be on his incorrect side of the road. It may be mentioned that his Honour acknowledged the vegetation at the side of the road in giving his reasons for judgment.  
      
       
     7 When the relevant evidence about the overhanging vegetation is examined, it will be seen that it is equivocal and insufficient to establish what the appellant seeks to establish from it. There is, of course, no doubt that in the curve, where the accident occurred, the roadway was wide enough for both vehicles, that is the respondent's motor car and the appellant's truck, to pass on their correct sides of the road.  
      
       
     8 Indeed, the defendant's evidence was that he was in fact on his correct side of the road for 15m or so prior to the accident, although this evidence was clearly incorrect. It is however indicative, as well as other evidence, that the defendant had enough space to move over onto his correct side of the road prior to the impact.  
      
       
     9 It must be kept in mind also that the defendant did not have to get the whole of the length of his truck past the last overhanging tree. Once the front portion of his truck was past the last overhanging tree, he could commence to move completely onto his correct side of the road.  
      
       
     10 In my opinion, his Honour was entitled to find as he did, and, indeed, I would agree with his conclusion. 
      
       
     11 Contributory negligence was pleaded. However, in giving his reasons for judgment his Honour did not mention this subject. Nevertheless, it is clear from his Honour's findings about the plaintiff driving on her correct side of the road at all relevant points of time and the finding concerning the plaintiff's speed of 50kph or less, both findings which were open to his Honour, that there was no contributory negligence by the plaintiff.  
      
       
     12 His Honour's assessment of damages is also attacked. It is submitted that his Honour's assessment of non economic loss was excessive. Bearing in mind the plaintiff's evidence and his Honour's assessment of her evidence, together with the medical evidence which was extensively canvassed by his Honour, the percentage determined by his Honour was within the range. 
      
       
     13 His Honour's assessment of economic loss is also challenged. However, I am of the view that his Honour's findings and conclusions on this issue were open to him on the evidence.  
      
       
     14 I can discern no error in his Honour's judgment which would lead to the appeal being upheld. 
      
       
     15 In my opinion the following orders should be made: 
      
       
       
       1. Appeal dismissed with costs. 
        
        
       2. By consent verdict and judgment below varied by increasing  
        
       judgment for the plaintiff/respondent to $253,183. 
        
       
     16 GILES JA: I agree.17 ROLFE AJA: I also agree. 18 STEIN JA: Accordingly the orders of the Court are as I have just announced. 
      
       
     19 Mr Hislop submitted that there were offers of compromise served and that in each matter the verdict exceeded the amount of the offer and he, accordingly asked for costs on a solicitor/client basis from the date of the initial offer of compromise, 29 March 2000.  
      
       
       
        Discussion ensued. 
       
     20 STEIN JA: In the circumstances the orders we will make as to costs are:  
      
       
       That in relation to the order for costs of the District Court proceedings, the appellant be ordered to pay the respondent's costs on a solicitor/client basis. In relation to the appeal the appellant is to pay the respondent's costs of the appeal, including as from 21 September 2001 on an indemnity basis.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Hidden J. 
      
       
     2 HULME J: I agree with Hidden J. 
      
       
     3 HIDDEN J: The respondents, Paul and Bradley Bowman, are brothers. They are awaiting trial in the District Court upon a charge, brought against them jointly, of supplying a large commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine. On 10 September 2001 a judge of the District Court ordered that they be tried separately. The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against that decision under s5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and the trial has been stood over for call-over at the end of this month. 
      
       
     4 Put shortly, it is the Crown case that in the early hours of 2 February 2000 in the Gymea area police searched a car owned and driven by Paul Bowman, in which Bradley Bowman was a passenger. In the boot and in the interior of the car police found a quantity of white powder, which proved to be pseudoephedrine, together with items of laboratory equipment. Pseudoephedrine is an ingredient in the manufacture of methylamphetamine. The fingerprints of each respondent were on some of these articles.  
      
       
     5 The respondents were arrested. Paul Bowman declined to be interviewed. However, Bradley Bowman took part in an electronically recorded interview in which he denied knowledge of the drug or of any of the other items. In the course of the interview, he was asked whether he was affiliated with any “motor cycle gang”, in particular, the club known as the “Nomads”. He said that he was not. He was asked whether Paul Bowman was affiliated with the Nomads and he said that he thought he was. Asked whether Paul Bowman was a member of that club, he replied, “I don’t know because I don’t really talk about it … he just does his own thing.” 
      
       
     6 The application for separate trials was argued on the day that the matter was listed for trial. The Crown and each of the respondents were represented by counsel other than those who appeared in this Court. As it happens, there had been newspaper publicity the day before about the involvement of bikers’ clubs in the manufacture and distribution of amphetamines, the Nomads being named as one of them. Counsel for Paul Bowman sought a separate trial on the basis that the answers in Bradley Bowman’s interview to which I have referred, together with that recent publicity, would cause his client impermissible prejudice in a joint trial. He also relied upon the fact that Bradley Bowman intended to raise his good character, which Paul Bowman was not able to do, a matter which had been foreshadowed in a notice of motion for a separate trial and an affidavit in support which had been filed on behalf of Paul Bowman a few days earlier. Counsel for Bradley Bowman supported the application, indicating that his client was prepared to proceed to trial immediately. 
      
       
     7 In the course of argument, the Crown Prosecutor said that it was not the Crown’s intention to rely on the relevant part of Bradley Bowman’s interview “as part of its case against Mr Bowman”. It is not entirely clear to which of the respondents he was then referring. Obviously, the evidence was not admissible against Paul Bowman and, presumably, he was expressing his intention not to use it against Bradley Bowman. However that may be, counsel for Bradley Bowman responded that he wished to rely upon it in his client’s case. The argument appears then to have continued upon the basis that the evidence would be before the jury in a joint trial. 
      
       
     8 Counsel for Bradley Bowman confirmed that his client’s case was that he had no knowledge of the drug and the other articles. He submitted that evidence that Paul Bowman was associated with the Nomads might lead the jury to conclude that, of the two men, he was the more likely to have been in possession of them. He sought a separate trial on the basis also that his client would be prejudiced by a joint trial because, he argued, the Crown case against Bradley Bowman was weaker than that against Paul Bowman: cf R v Middis (Hunt J, unreported NSWSC 27 March 1991).  
      
       
     9 The Crown prosecutor opposed the applications, submitting that there was no significant difference in the weight of the evidence against the two respondents and that any prejudice to Paul Bowman in a joint trial, on either of the bases contended for by his counsel, could be cured by appropriate directions to the jury.  
      
       
     10 It appears that no one raised the possibility of adjourning the joint trial until the effect of the publicity of the previous day had dissipated. Accordingly, the matter was argued upon the bases that the trial of one or both of the respondents would proceed that day and, as I have said, that the relevant part of Bradley Bowman’s recorded interview would be in evidence. It is not surprising, then, that his Honour ruled as he did. He concluded that there was “a real risk of prejudice” to Paul Bowman if the joint trial should proceed, given the offending material in Bradley Bowman’s interview and the newspaper article. He directed that the two men be tried separately and that Bradley Bowman’s trial should proceed immediately. However, he acceded to an application by the Crown prosecutor to adjourn both trials after he was informed that the Crown wished to bring the present appeal. 
      
       
     11 Given his approach to the matter, it was not necessary for his Honour to consider the prejudice to Paul Bowman arising from the fact that Bradley Bowman would raise his character, or the proposition advanced by counsel for Bradley Bowman that the Crown case against his client was weaker than that against Paul Bowman. On appeal, it was not suggested that the order for separate trials should be affirmed on either of those bases. Argument for the respondents was confined to the reasons which his Honour gave.  
      
       
     12 Contrary to the position adopted by his predecessor, the Crown prosecutor in this Court submitted that what Bradley Bowman had to say in his interview about his brother’s possible association with the Nomads was irrelevant in the trial of Bradley Bowman himself and was inadmissible, whether tendered by the Crown or the respondent. That being so, he argued, Paul Bowman could not be prejudiced by a joint trial in the manner his Honour had found.  
      
       
     13 Before us, Paul Bowman was represented by Mr Odgers SC, whose submissions were adopted by Mr Johnston, counsel for Bradley Bowman. Mr Odgers argued that the evidence was relevant in Bradley Bowman’s defence on the same basis as was urged in the District Court, but also for another reason. He contended that the very fact that Bradley Bowman was prepared to volunteer that information about his brother, given the implication of the police officer’s question, could suggest that he had not been acting in concert with him and could cast a different light on other answers in the interview which might be seen as attempting to protect him.  
      
       
     14 While I can see the force of Mr Odgers’ argument, it appears to me to face two obstacles. Firstly, Bradley Bowman’s answers in the relevant part of the interview fall far short of a confident assertion of Paul Bowman’s affiliation with the Nomads. Secondly, and more importantly, evidence that Paul Bowman did have that association would be irrelevant in the absence of evidence that the Nomads were indeed involved in the manufacture and distribution of amphetamines. Whether evidence to that effect would be admissible would depend upon its form and content and would require consideration of relevant provisions, particularly s 97, of the Evidence Act. Counsel for Bradley Bowman in the District Court spoke of his intention to introduce the newspaper article “in evidence through a police officer …”. What he meant by that is unclear. Obviously, the newspaper article itself would not be admissible. 
      
       
     15 Accordingly, it was not suggested before his Honour that there would be positive evidence of Paul Bowman’s association with the Nomads. Nor was it contended that there was admissible evidence of the Nomads’ involvement in drug trafficking of the kind referred to in the newspaper article. On the material before his Honour, the most that could be established was Bradley Bowman’s assertion of his belief that his brother had a connection with that bikers’ club. Even that would assume significance only if there were evidence that the Nomads were criminally involved in drugs. It may be that Bradley Bowman’s belief that they were so involved would be sufficient to make the evidence relevant on the second of the bases urged by Mr Odgers, but it was not put to his Honour (or, indeed, to this Court) that there would be evidence to that effect. 
      
       
     16 It follows that the central argument of the Crown prosecutor in this Court is made good. His Honour’s order for separate trials was discretionary but I am satisfied that the exercise of that discretion miscarried, albeit in the light of a proposition which was not argued in the District Court. The respondents are alleged to have been involved in a joint criminal enterprise and, as his Honour acknowledged, the case is one which would ordinarily call for a joint trial in accordance with the authorities reviewed by this Court in R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66 at pars 199–211. 
      
       
     17 This is not to deny that another application for separate trials might be considered if further material were able to be presented in support of it. However, I would allow this appeal and set aside the present order.

    SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  On 13 June 2001 Joseph Allan Ladd (“the prisoner”) was indicted before me on a charge that between 21 and 27 April 1999 at Albury he murdered Karl D’Helin-Lawrie (“the deceased”). To that charge the prisoner pleaded not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and the Crown accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. On 13 June, on the application of the prisoner’s legal representative, I adjourned the proceedings on sentence to 17 August 2001, so that a pre-sentence report could be obtained. On 17 August there was an application for a further adjournment, on the grounds that the senior counsel by whom the prisoner wished to be represented was unavailable and the proceedings were stood over to 26 October. On 26 October a substantial number of documents were tendered and the hearing of the proceedings on sentence was concluded. The prisoner did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. I reserved my sentencing decision, so that I could read the documents which had been admitted into evidence and give consideration to what sentence should be imposed on the prisoner. 
     
      
    2 In the proceedings on sentence a statement of agreed facts was tendered and admitted. This statement of agreed facts is consistent with other documents which were tendered and admitted in the proceedings on sentence, including a statement by an investigating police officer to which a chronological event chart and a summary of evidence were attached, and a transcript of an interview of the prisoner by police on 30 June 1999. The following statement of the facts of the offence is taken from the statement of agreed facts, supplemented, in a few minor respects, by other documents admitted in the proceedings on sentence. 
     
      
    3 In February 1999 the prisoner, who had no fixed place of residence and who had been travelling in rural New South Wales and Victoria with his son Conan, then aged nine, set up a camp in a State forest in Victoria. 
     
      
    4 The deceased, after the breakdown of his marriage, had moved to Albury, where he lived alone in a house.  
     
      
    5 At some time prior to February 1999 the prisoner had become acquainted with the deceased. On 20 February 1999 the prisoner provided the deceased’s address in Albury to Centre Link as being his place of residence. In late February 1999 the prisoner and Conan lived with the deceased in his house at Albury for two or three days.  
     
      
    6 Subsequently, the prisoner and Conan lived in a caravan park in Victoria. The prisoner obtained casual employment, working for a man named Richard Plant on a property called “Iona”.  
     
      
    7 After living in the caravan park for about a month, the prisoner and Conan, just after Easter (Easter Monday in 1999 was 5 April) began living with the deceased in his house in Albury. The prisoner continued to work at Iona.  
     
      
    8 On Thursday 22 April 1999 Mr Plant picked up the prisoner and Conan in Albury and drove them to Iona, where the prisoner worked during the day. That evening Mr Plant drove the prisoner and Conan back to Albury, where they arrived at about half past eight.  
     
      
    9 When the prisoner and Conan arrived at the deceased’s house, the deceased and another man named Barry Ryan were in the house.  
     
      
    10 Barry Ryan drove the prisoner and the deceased to a hotel in Albury. This particular hotel was patronised, although not exclusively, by homosexual men and women. The deceased was known to have had a number of homosexual relationships with other patrons of the hotel.  
     
      
    11 When the prisoner and the deceased went to the hotel, Conan was left alone in the house. While the prisoner and Conan had been living at the deceased’s house, the sleeping arrangements had been that the prisoner and Conan shared a double bed and the deceased slept in a single bed in the same room.  
     
      
    12 At the hotel the prisoner and the deceased played pool. The deceased left the hotel between half past nine and ten o’clock and returned to his home. The prisoner remained at the hotel.  
     
      
    13 After the deceased had returned home, he drank some wine from a wine cask. According to what Conan told police in a statement, which I accept, the deceased then came into the bedroom and told Conan that he would sleep on the other side of the double bed from Conan for a couple of hours, before returning to the hotel. According to what Conan told police, which I accept, Conan was fully dressed and there was a doona separating him from the deceased. 
     
      
    14 The prisoner had remained at the hotel, playing pool. At the hotel he drank beer and wine. He became concerned about Conan. When later interviewed by police the prisoner said, “well, I think I was in control of my facilities (sic). I knew that it was time to go home. I was worried about Conan because Karl had disappeared”. 
     
      
    15 I accept that the prisoner was worried about Conan. While the prisoner and Conan had been living in the same house as the deceased, the prisoner had observed the deceased cuddling and touching Conan. The prisoner knew that the deceased was upset about losing access to his own children through the breakdown of his marriage and thought that this might explain the deceased’s conduct towards Conan. 
     
      
    16 Some time after about a quarter to eleven the prisoner took a taxi to the deceased’s home. He took with him from the hotel a full bottle of Ginger Wine of a type which he had been drinking at the hotel. On entering the bedroom of the deceased’s house, the prisoner saw the deceased and Conan in the bed. He threw the wine bottle at the deceased and the bottle struck the deceased on the head. The prisoner then struck the deceased around his head with his hand or fist. When later interviewed by the police, the prisoner said, “I sort of spun out a little. I freaked out”. I accept that the prisoner lost his self-control. When interviewed by police, the prisoner claimed that he did not remember hitting the deceased with his hand or fist more than once. In the light of evidence from a forensic pathologist to which I will refer later in these remarks, I do not accept that the prisoner hit the deceased only once. 
     
      
    17 The following questions and answers occurred in the interview of the prisoner by the police on 30 June 1999. All these questions and answers are included in the agreed statement of facts. 
     
      
       
        
        A.187 …”when I came back Carl was in bed with Conan and I’ve just walked through the door and spat it, because he had no right to be whereabouts he was. And, and I had a bottle of Stone’s in me hand and I threw the bottle of Stone’s at him, I grabbed Conan out of the other side of the bed, give him (the deceased) a smack in the head on the way out and then sort of sat with Conan for the night…”  
        
       
       
        
        Q.188 And what did you actually see when you got to the bedroom? 
         
        A. I seen Carl in bed with Conan. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.189 Were they asleep or were they awake? 
         
        A. Well, he was, they were moving, so, well, one of ‘em moved anyhow, and I just, with my fears of earlier and seeing Carl in bed I just seen red. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.190 Did you, was Carl doing anything to Conan when you walked in? 
         
        A. Mate, I have no idea. All right. I just seen him in the bed with Conan and just let fly. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.191 So you wouldn’t know if they were asleep or awake? 
         
        A. Well, it seemed to me that Carl was moving back from Conan’s side of the bed, because I, I move around fairly quietly. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.193 When you pulled Conan out of the bed, was he dressed? 
         
        A. No, Conan was in a T-shirt and no pants, and normally when Conan goes to bed he, he wears pants and a shirt of some sort, that’s just something that I’ve brought him up to do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.201 When you pulled Conan out of bed, what happened then? 
         
        A. I showered Conan, I sat and talked with him all night. 
        
       
       
        
        Q.202 Did he tell you anything about what had occurred in there? 
         
        A. Not a great deal, he, he was, he was sort of spun out a bit, I guess”. 
        
       
      
    18 Asked if Conan had ever told him what had happened, the prisoner said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He (Conan) he just, he reckons that Carl got into bed and was cuddling him and, and that there was nothing going on, but Carl was running his hands over, over his body and, and that he was, when he got into bed he said he was only gunna be there for a couple of hours and Conan took it for granted that that was O.K. I dunno he was pretty spun 
        
       
      
    19 In another part of the interview the prisoner said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “….I never went near him (the deceased) again until the next morning. And when I did I walked into the room and, mate, I, I seen him and I’ve just thought, shit, and I kind of spun out a bit… And I figured that he was still breathing and, and that someone would come along and find him, because he always had people in and out of the house”. 
        
       
      
    20 On the morning of 23 April 1999 Mr Plant collected the prisoner and Conan to take them to Iona. The prisoner told Mr Plant, “I give a bloke a real bad flogging last night. I caught a bloke in bed with Conan. It was Karl, the bloke I live with”. Mr Plant told the prisoner that he did not want to hear any more. The prisoner later told Mr Plant that he had hurt the deceased “pretty bad” but the deceased had still been breathing when the prisoner left.  
     
      
    21 On the evening of 23 April 1999 the prisoner stayed at the home of a friend Annette Mullinder at Chiltern. The prisoner said to Annette Mullinder;- 
     
      
       
        
        “Last night I went to the pub and there was a pool comp. Karl left and I thought there was something wrong because Conan was asleep in (bed) at his house, it was something about Karl’s manner. A bit later I went back to Karl’s and found him in bed with Conan”. 
        
       
      
    22 The prisoner told Ms Mullinder that he had “messed (the deceased) up pretty bad”. 
     
      
    23 On the morning of Monday 26 April the dead body of the deceased was discovered in his home. The deceased had clothing on the lower half of his body, but no clothing on the upper half of his body. His body was covered by a doona up to the upper part of his back. Police formed the view that the deceased’s head was on or close to the pillow on the bed, at the time the injuries to his head were inflicted and that there had been minimal movement of the deceased’s body from the time the injuries were inflicted. I accept these opinions formed by the police. 
     
      
    24 The prisoner had continued staying with Ms Mullinder and working for Mr Plant. A report of the deceased’s death appeared in a local newspaper on 27 April 1999. On 27 April 1999 the prisoner telephoned Mr Plant about work arrangements. Mr Plant, who had read the newspaper, advised the prisoner to read the newspaper and then telephone Mr Plant. The prisoner read the newspaper and told Ms Mullinder that he would have to leave. 
     
      
    25 When later interviewed by the police, the prisoner claimed that on reading the report of the deceased’s death in the newspaper he had felt stressed and not pleased. He claimed that he had felt remorse. I accept that, on reading the report in the newspaper of the deceased’s death, the prisoner felt stressed. However, I am not satisfied that he felt any remorse. 
     
      
    26 The prisoner, Conan and Ms Mullinder left Ms Mullinder’s home at Chiltern and travelled together through various parts of rural Victoria. During these travels the prisoner told a friend, a man named Diggle, “I’m in a bit of trouble. A bloke tried to molest my son and I biffed him pretty bad and I’ve had to get out”. The prisoner asked Mr Diggle whether he could stay with him but Mr Diggle refused. 
     
      
    27 The prisoner and Conan separated from Ms Mullinder and the prisoner and Conan went to South Australia. The prisoner later returned to Victoria and on 23 June 1999 he against contacted Mr Diggle. While they were in a car together, Mr Diggle asked the prisoner what had happened and the prisoner replied:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I was drinking with the guy at the pub and playing pool with him. He left early to go home, I became suspicious because I had heard a lot of talk going around about this guy and his ex-wife and that he was messing around with young boys. I was carrying a bottle which I was drinking out of (I think he said it was Stones Green Ginger Wine) and I hit him over the head with the bottle. I got Conan out of bed and went and sat outside with him and we both went to sleep. Later on I went back inside and saw that he was still alive and that there was (blood) everywhere. I had already made arrangements to stay with my girlfriend for the weekend so we both left”. 
        
       
      
    28 Mr Diggle informed the Victorian police and the prisoner was arrested on 30 June 1999. On the same day the prisoner was interviewed by police and made extensive admissions.  
     
      
    29 An autopsy on the dead body of the deceased was performed by forensic pathologist Dr Paul Botterill on 27 April 1999.  
     
      
    30 In Dr Botterill’s opinion the deceased had died on “approximately 25-26 April”.  
     
      
    31 In his report Dr Botterill said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In plain terms, autopsy findings included a broken skull with blood over the surface of the brain, evidence of inhaled and swallowed blood. At the time of autopsy, the cause of death was believed to be head injury of blunt force type. It was not clear at the time of autopsy what weapon was used, but the distribution of bruising and the severity of fracturing was in keeping with multiple blows. The relative possible contribution of the relatively thin skull was difficult to quantitate. Examination of the brain showed extensive cortical contusion and lacerations, haemorrhages of pons, corpus callosum, cerebellum, ventricles, subarachnoid & subdural spaces..’ 
        
       
      
    32 Dr Botterill observed a number of abrasions on the head and swelling and bruising on the bridge of the nose and in the right orbit. 
     
      
    33 Dr Botterill found:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There was a complicated array of fractures over the right temporal and parietal skull, with extension across the midline to involve the left parietal skull and extension into the petrous temporal bone and to the right occipital bone. An approximately 60 mm diameter depressed fracture defect was noted over the right parietal skull..”. 
        
       
      
    34 In the proceedings on sentence counsel for the Crown said that the Crown had accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter, on the basis that the prisoner’s offence was reduced from murder to manslaughter by reason of provocation. 
     
      
    35 It is part of my function as the sentencing judge to determine on what basis the prisoner should be regarded as guilty of manslaughter, but, after considering the matter for myself, I agree that the prisoner should be regarded as guilty of manslaughter, on the basis that the prisoner’s acts causing the death of the deceased were done under provocation.  
     
      
    36 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner had an intent sufficient for the crime of murder. Although I am not satisfied that he had an intent to kill the deceased, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased. However, I accept that the prisoner, already suspecting that the deceased might be touching his nine year old son in a sexual way, on seeing the deceased in the same bed as his son believed that the deceased had been molesting his son, lost his self-control and with the intention of inflicting really serious bodily injury immediately did the acts of violently striking the deceased on the head which caused the death of the deceased, while he was deprived of his self-control. What the prisoner believed was the conduct of the deceased towards his nine year old son was conduct affecting the prisoner, within the meaning of that expression in s 23 of the Crimes Act dealing with provocation. It is not necessary to determine, and it is not possible for me to determine, whether there had in fact been any improper conduct by the deceased towards Conan. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoner punched the deceased a number of times on the head with considerable force, while the deceased was immobile in the bed. The deceased did not die immediately and was still alive when the prisoner left the house the following morning. 
     
      
    37 As I have already noted, the prisoner did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence. Some of the subjective circumstances of the prisoner appear in the pre-sentence report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service.  
     
      
    38 The prisoner was born on 6 February 1958 and was, accordingly, forty-one years old, at the time of committing the offence and is now forty-three years old. 
     
      
    39 The prisoner told the author of the report that he would not be fully forthcoming about details of his life because “he considers that authorities are prone to ‘twisting’ the truth of information which is provided to them”. The author of the report noted that very little of the information in the report had been independently verified. According to the prisoner, he had lived a nomadic life since he was about fifteen years old. The prisoner would not nominate anybody who could confirm what he said about his background. 
     
      
    40 The pre-sentence report does record that the prisoner was born in New South Wales in the Hay area, that his parents separated when he was seven years old, that he was raised by his father, that he left school when he was fourteen or fifteen years old, that he subsequently lived a nomadic life working in various unskilled positions, that, apart from Conan, he has a daughter now aged seventeen from an earlier de facto relationship and that, while in prison in Western Australia, he completed two and a half years of a science degree by correspondence but did not complete the course after he was released from custody. The prisoner is a binge drinker and most of his offending has been alcohol related.  
     
      
    41 The author of the pre-sentence report says in the report:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Ladd accepted responsibility for his offending in the context of provocation. He did not consider that he was in need of any assistance or professional intervention for any problems or issues in his life including alcohol, anger or violence or any factors relevant to his offending behaviour. This Service remains concerned over the issue of violence and Mr Ladd’s failure to recognise the impact and relevance to himself and others. He clearly indicated that he does not wish to be supervised on parole upon his release. He advised that upon his eventual release he will resume his nomadic lifestyle”. 
        
       
      
    42 There is some, but not much, additional information about the prisoner’s subjective circumstances in a report by a clinical psychologist. I have taken all of this report into account. 
     
      
    43 The prisoner has a criminal history in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. In that criminal history there are three convictions which are particularly relevant to the sentencing of the prisoner for the present offence. 
     
      
    44 On 26 October 1999 the prisoner was sentenced in the Queanbeyan District Court, for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed on 12 November 1998, to a fixed term of imprisonment of four months to date from 30 June 1999 and, for an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm committed on 25 November 1998, to a term of imprisonment for three years with a minimum term or non-parole period of eighteen months commencing on 30 October 1999 and expiring on 29 April 2001. The victim of both offences was a thirty-four year old woman with whom the prisoner had become acquainted. On 12 November 1998 the prisoner, who had been drinking, accused the victim of making fun of him. He struck her across the face and grabbed her by the throat. A little later the same day the prisoner struck the victim on the head with a whiskey bottle, breaking the bottle and rendering the victim unconscious. As a result of these assaults the victim suffered cuts to her head, lips and mouth and bruising to her jaw, throat and ears. On 25 November 1998, after the prisoner had been drinking, an argument developed between the prisoner and the victim. The prisoner struck the victim on the head with a heavy torch breaking her nose. The victim fell to the ground and the prisoner kicked her in the back and ribs. The prisoner then struck the victim on the back of her head with an iron bar and then struck her several times around the legs with the iron bar. The victim suffered a broken nose, a fractured skull, lacerations to the back of her head and bruising to her feet and legs. 
     
      
    45 However, the most serious previous offence committed by the prisoner was an offence of murder committed in Western Australia on or about 29 May 1977. A man who had been with the prisoner at the time the murder was committed reported the offence to police and the following account of the facts of the offence is taken from a statement this man made to the police, which was admitted into evidence in the present proceedings on sentence.  
     
      
    46 The prisoner and the other man met an aboriginal woman in a hotel in a remote part of Western Australia. The woman agreed to have sexual relations with the prisoner and the other man. The three of them left the hotel together and went into some bushland. The prisoner and then the other man had sexual intercourse with the woman. The prisoner physically assaulted the woman and then had sexual intercourse with her again. Subsequently, the prisoner grabbed the woman, forced her to the ground and strangled her with his bare hands. The prisoner and the other man dug a shallow grave and buried the woman’s body. After the other man had reported what had happened to the police, the prisoner was arrested and confessed to having committed the offence. 
     
      
    47 On 11 November 1977 the prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder. Under the law then in force in Western Australia the only sentence which could have been imposed on the prisoner was imprisonment for life. 
     
      
    48 According to a report by the Western Australian Parole Board of 20 February 1982 and a submission made by the Western Australian Attorney-General to the Western Australian Cabinet on 12 January 1983, which was largely based on the report by the Parole Board, the prisoner had made very good progress while in prison. According to the report and the submission, the prisoner seemed to have succeeded in gaining some control over his aggressive tendencies. While in custody he had pursued academic studies and in a period of about three years had progressed from receiving remedial tuition in mathematics to gaining university entrance in mathematics. According to the report from the Parole Board, the prisoner had presented no management problems and had been a model prisoner. 
     
      
    49 The prisoner was released on parole in Western Australia in May 1985. 
     
      
    50 In determining what sentence should be imposed, it is necessary, as counsel for the Crown submitted and as counsel for the prisoner accepted, to have regard to the principles stated by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No.2) (1987-88) 164 CLR 465 at 477. 
     
      
    51 According to those principles, it is necessary to keep in mind that the prisoner has already been punished for the murder he committed in Western Australia in 1977 and for the offences involving physical violence which he committed in November 1998. He is not to receive any further penalty for those offences. He is not, by reason of having committed those offences, to receive a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the present offence. However, the prisoner’s antecedent criminal history, even allowing for the time which has elapsed since the commission of the murder in Western Australia, is relevant as showing a continuing dangerous propensity to serious violence on the part of the prisoner. Considerations of retribution and protection of society and, even though the present offence was committed under provocation, deterrence, all indicate that a more severe penalty should be imposed, than would be warranted by the facts of the present offence, if the offence had been committed by a person without any criminal history. 
     
      
    52 As I have already noted, the prisoner pleaded guilty to having committed manslaughter. The Crown accepted that there should be some discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. The plea of guilty was an early plea of guilty, in the sense that it was entered shortly after the Crown had notified the prisoner that it would accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter. Counsel for the Crown estimated that, if the prisoner had not pleaded guilty and had stood trial, the trial would have lasted about four weeks. I consider that I should allow a discount of about twenty per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    53 Apart from pleading guilty in June 2001, the prisoner, on being arrested on 30 June 1999, co-operated with police investigating the death of the deceased and, on the same day as he was arrested, the prisoner participated in a long electronically recorded interview, in which he made extensive admissions. As against this co-operation by the prisoner after he had been arrested, the prisoner had not on 22 or 23 April 1999 reported that the deceased had been assaulted and the prisoner had left Albury as soon as he became aware of the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    54 I do not consider that the prisoner, despite occasional assertions by him, feels much contrition for killing the deceased. On the morning of 23 April 1999 the prisoner left the deceased’s house, knowing that the deceased had been seriously injured and knowing that the deceased was still alive but did nothing to notify anyone in authority of the deceased’s plight. I accept that the prisoner believed that someone would probably come to the deceased’s house and discover the deceased, while the deceased was still alive.  
     
      
    55 I turn to the prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation and to the related question of whether I should find special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The prisoner is a person with potential. He performed well when he was in custody in Western Australia between 1997 and 1985. I infer that Mr Plant, who took the trouble to transport the prisoner between Albury and Iona, found him to be a satisfactory worker. 
     
      
    56 However, the prisoner has serious problems arising from his abuse of alcohol, his inability to control his anger and his propensity to engage in physical violence. As I have already indicated, the author of the pre-sentence report was of the opinion that the prisoner refuses to acknowledge that he has any of these problems and would be unwilling to submit to any supervision on parole after he is released from custody. 
     
      
    57 However, it is possible that during a further lengthy term of imprisonment such as I will be imposing the prisoner may acquire some insight into his problems and into his need for assistance in dealing with them. I am prepared to find that the prisoner has some prospects of rehabilitation. I am also prepared to find special circumstances, on the basis that the prisoner could benefit from an extended period of conditional liberty, if he acknowledges his problems relating to his abuse of alcohol, his inability to control his anger and his propensity to engage in physical violence and submits to counselling for these problems. 
     
      
    58 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for twenty-five years. It is a truism that sentences for manslaughter vary more than the sentences for almost any other offence, because the circumstances in which the offence of manslaughter is committed vary so much. 
     
      
    59 In the proceedings on sentence counsel for the prisoner said that he had not been able to find any case closely comparable to the present. Counsel for the prisoner suggested that an appropriate sentence might be a sentence in which the non-parole period was in the order of eight years. However, he submitted that the commencement of the sentence should be backdated to 30 June 1999, the date on which the prisoner was arrested. Counsel conceded that the prisoner’s custody between 30 June 1999 and 29 April 2001 was not solely referable to the offence for which I am sentencing him and, on ordinary principles, the commencement of the sentence should not be backdated to 30 June 1999. However, it was submitted that, if, after being arrested on 30 June 1999, the prisoner had been sentenced at the same time for both the offence of manslaughter for which he is presently being sentenced and the two offences for which he was sentenced in Queanbeyan District Court on 26 October 1999, the sentence for manslaughter, as being the sentence for the most serious offence, would have been the longest sentence and the sentences for the other two offences would have been shorter and would have been made fully concurrent with the non-parole period of the sentence for manslaughter. What in fact had happened was that the prisoner was sentenced first for the two less serious offences. 
     
      
    60 Counsel for the Crown in the proceedings on sentence submitted that a somewhat higher sentence than the sentence suggested by counsel for the prisoner would be appropriate.  
     
      
    61 Although there is some force in the submission made by counsel for the prisoner, I do not consider that I should backdate the commencement of the sentence for manslaughter to 30 June 1999. The two offences for which the prisoner was sentenced in Queanbeyan District Court on 25 October 1999 were themselves serious offences and were quite distinct from the offence of manslaughter for which I am sentencing the prisoner and the prisoner’s custody up to 29 April 2001 was referable to the sentences for those two offences. I will make the sentence I impose commence from 29 April 2001. However, under the sentencing principle of totality or a similar principle, I take into account those other two sentences and the fact that the sentence I impose will be cumulative on those other two sentences. 
     
      
    62 Mr Ladd I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of ten years. I set a non-parole period of seven years. The sentence will have commenced on 29 April 2001. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 29 April 2008.

      REGINA v Thomas Joseph SEWELL 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 IPP AJA: This is an appeal against conviction and an application for leave to appeal against sentence. I shall deal first with the appeal against conviction.  
      
       
     2 On 10 May 2000 during the course of a hearing before Price DCJ the appellant pleaded guilty to seven counts of contravening s 300(2)) of the Crimes Act. Each of the seven counts averred that the appellant had used a false instrument knowing it to be false with intent to induce Westpac to accept it as genuine and thereby credit to the appellant’s account a specified sum of money to the prejudice of the appellant’s employer, Westbus Pty Limited. 
      
       
     3 At the same time the appellant acknowledged his guilt in respect of ten like counts that were specified pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in the prescribed form (Form 1) to that Act. However, the appellant was not asked by Price DCJ, pursuant to s 33 of the Act, whether he wished the 10 Form 1 matters to be taken into account when dealing with the seven counts on the indictment.  
      
       
     4 After the pleas to the seven counts in the indictment had been entered, the matter was adjourned as the appellant was not ready to proceed with the sentencing process.  
      
       
     5 The pleas were entered pursuant to an agreement between the Crown and the appellant as to the counts that were to be brought against him in respect of which he would plead guilty. I shall later refer in greater detail to that agreement. It is sufficient at this stage to say that the seven counts on the indictment and the 10 Form 1 counts constituted the counts that the parties had agreed were the counts to which the appellant would plead guilty.  
      
       
     6 Later, the appellant decided to resile from the agreement and plead not guilty to the 10 Form 1 counts. I shall return to the circumstances under which this occurred. 
      
       
     7 The appellant argues that this court, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction, should allow the appellant to withdraw his pleas of guilty to the seven counts on the indictment (see Maxwell v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 501). The appellant contends that, as he had not complied with the agreement he had arrived at with the Crown, it would be unjust to allow the pleas of guilty to stand. The curious aspect of this argument is that it rests on the proposition that the appellant should be allowed to withdraw his pleas of guilty by reason of his own conduct in resiling from the agreement.  
      
       
     8 Alternatively, the appellant argues that McGuire DCJ, the sentencing judge, erred in omitting, immediately prior to sentencing the appellant, to ask him whether he adhered to the pleas of guilty to the 7 counts. 
      
       
     9 I return now to the sequence of events. On 27 July 2000, after the matter had been adjourned for sentencing, the appellant filed a notice of motion seeking to withdraw his pleas of guilty. He did not then rest his argument on the grounds presently relied on. The hearing of that motion was stood over to 10 November 2000. On that day the appellant withdrew the motion and it was dismissed.  
      
       
     10 Eventually, the matter was listed for mention on 1 March 2001 to fix a hearing date for sentence. On that day the appellant again applied for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. Again, the appellant did not seek to rely on the grounds now being agitated. That motion stood over to 26 March 2001 and it was listed for hearing before Gibson DCJ on 10 May 2001. His Honour refused the appellant’s application and set a sentence hearing for 29 June 2001. 
      
       
     11 The appellant then sought leave to appeal to this Court. By judgment delivered 10 August 2001 (R v Sewell, (2001) NSWCCA 299) the appellant’s application for leave to appeal was dismissed. 
      
       
     12 On 16 August 2001 the appellant filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against the decision of this Court delivered on 10 August 2001.  
      
       
     13 On 4 October 2001 the appellant applied to Blanch CJDC for an order staying the sentence proceedings pending the determination of the High Court special leave application. This application was dismissed.  
      
       
     14 On 18 October 2001 McHugh J refused the appellant’s application for an order staying the sentence proceedings pending determination of the High Court special leave application.  
      
       
     15 On 19 October 2001 the appellant applied to McGuire DCJ for an order staying the sentencing proceedings. The application was dismissed. In the course of his reasons McGuire DCJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have been informed that when the matter came before Price DCJ an indictment containing seven counts was presented to which pleas of guilty were entered. A Form 1 was also presented. It is signed by both the Crown and [the appellant] however, the requirements of s 33 of the  
         Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
          were not complied with, in that [the appellant] was not asked by the judge whether he wanted the matter set out on the Form 1 to be taken into account when dealing with him for the offences set out in the indictment. 
         
        
        
         
         I am now told that [the appellant] does not want those matters taken into account. I will formally ask him and if he declines I will not deal with them. 
         
        
        
         
         I am informed by the Crown that if those matters that is to say the ten matters on the Form 1 are not taken into account this day that a further prosecution will be instituted to include those. This should be carefully considered by [the appellant] [the appellant] is this day represented by [counsel] and a solicitor.”. 
         
        
       
     16 Mr Papayanni, who together with Mr Leary represented the appellant in this appeal, appeared for the appellant in the sentencing proceedings before McGuire DCJ. Mr Papayanni informed this Court that some mention was made to McGuire DCJ of the fact that the appellant wished to withdraw his pleas of guilty. The transcript, however, makes no mention of this (although it appears to be incomplete), no evidence has been put before the court in this connection, and the judgment of McGuire DCJ is inconsistent with such a matter having been raised. Dr Power, who appeared for the Crown (but who did not appear before McGuire DCJ), did not concede that, at the hearing before McGuire DCJ, the appellant sought to withdraw his pleas of guilty. In the circumstances, I proceed on the basis that nothing was said to McGuire DCJ in this respect.  
      
       
     17 After delivering his judgment on the adjournment, McGuire DCJ went to great pains to establish that the appellant appreciated that, if the counts on the Form 1 were not taken into account, the Crown intended to proceed against the appellant in relation to them. This can be seen from the following exchanges:  
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour: Mr Papayani does your client appreciate that if the matters on the Form 1 are not taken into account that the Crown intends to proceed against him in relation to them? 
         
        
        
         
         PAPAYANNI: I haven’t spoken to him about the forty-four charges in relation to that your Honour but I won’t be doing the sentending matter. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: You might not be doing the sentencing matter but what I want to know is does your client understand what’s going to happen or what is highly likely to happen if he doesn’t ask that those ten matters be taken into account. As to whether he does or he doesn’t is entirely a matter for him. No consequence as far as I’m concerned. 
         
        
        
         
         PAPAYANNI: I understand that your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: All right, will you seek specific instructions from him? 
         
        
        
         
         PAPAYANNI: Yes your Honour.. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         PAPAYANNI: Your Honour I’ve been explaining to Mr Sewell the full implication of pleading guilty and not pleading guilty to those ten counts and what would happen in relation to it and he wishes to plead not guilty to the matters on the schedule your Honour. I assured him that your Honour would not take into account the fact that he has been charged with another forty-four counts and he understands that also. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I will formally ask Mr Sewell. Mr Sewell you did sign a document dated 10 May in which you indicated that you wished ten matters to be taken into account when you were to be sentenced for the matters contained in the indictment. I am told by Mr Papayanni that you no longer wish those matters to be taken into account. Is that so? 
         
        
        
         
         OFFENDER: Yes your Honour. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: All right then, they will not be taken into account. You appreciate as you have heard me mention to Mr Papayanni that those matters will almost certainly be proceeded with on some other indictment the Crown intends to present.” 
         
        
       
     18 On 24 October 2001 McGuire DCJ sentenced the appellant in regard to the seven counts in the indictment. He imposed concurrent terms of imprisonment of four years expiring on 23 October 2005 with non-parole periods of one year five months expiring on 23 March 2003.  
      
       
     19 On 23 November 2001 the appellant’s application for special leave to appeal was dismissed by the High Court. 
      
       
     20 I now turn to what is said by the appellant to be the terms of the agreement between the appellant and the Crown in regard to the number of charges that were to be brought against the appellant. This requires some explanation. 
      
       
     21 The appellant was first arrested and charged on 29 January 1996. On 20 November 1998 he pleaded guilty in the District Court to 20 counts of using a false instrument contrary to s 300(2) of the Crimes Act. On 26 February 1999 Karpin DCJ imposed various sentences on the appellant, the majority of which involved full time custodial imprisonment. 
      
       
     22 The appellant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against both conviction and sentence. He sought to withdraw his pleas of guilty on the basis that he was entitled to raise a claim of right in answer to each charge, that is to claim an honest belief in his entitlement to act in the way he did notwithstanding that objectively such belief appeared to be unreasonable. On 27 September 1999 the convictions were quashed and a retrial was ordered. 
      
       
     23 On 8 May 2000 the appellant was indicted in the District Court on 44 counts of using a false instrument. The trial aborted and a fresh trial commenced on 9 May 2000 before another judge. 
      
       
     24 In the course of the trial it became apparent that evidence was available that was capable of establishing the claim of right, at least to a limited and as yet undetermined degree. This resulted in the nature of the case changing and required new investigations to be made. In consequence the jury was discharged and the matter was adjourned for mention on 10 May 2000. 
      
       
     25 On 9 and 10 May 2000 discussions ensued between representatives of the Crown and the appellant. These led to the agreement between the Crown and the appellant. What occurred was set out by Smart AJ in the course of his reasons in R v Sewell [2001] NSWCCA 299 as follows:  
      
       
        
         
         “(g) During the course of the afternoon of 9 May 2000 and the morning of 10 May 2000 extensive discussions took place. As a result of discussions the Crown Prosecutor had with her instructing solicitor, Mr Ash and Det Compton on the afternoon of 9 May 2000 the Crown accepted that the accused had a possible claim of right to slightly less than $31,000. The Crown Prosecutor and her instructing solicitor conferred with the counsel and solicitor for Mr Sewell and the Prosecutor outlined the extent of the claim of right which would be accepted by the Crown and how the figure was calculated. She offered to accept a plea of guilty to 17 counts of using a false instrument from the original indictment which contained 20 counts. Here counts totalling $32,290.70 were removed from the indictment. The remaining 17 counts were divided into an indictment containing 7 counts and a Form 1 containing 10 counts. Counsel and the solicitor for Mr Sewell conferred with him. Just prior to luncheon on 10 May 2000 the Prosecutor was informed that the accused would plead guilty to the 7 counts in the indictment, acknowledge his guilt as to the 10 counts on Form 1 and ask that they be taken into account.” 
         
        
       
     26 As I have mentioned, pursuant to the agreement that had so been arrived at, when the matter came on before Price DCJ in the afternoon of 10 May 2000 the appellant entered pleas of guilty to the seven counts on the indictment and acknowledged his guilt in respect of the 10 Form 1 counts.  
      
       
     27 Before this Court, the appellant argued that the agreement entered into on 10 May 2000 was to the advantage of the Crown (as well as to the appellant) and, once it was no longer implemented, albeit at the instance of the appellant himself, it should be regarded in effect as a nullity. It was said that to hold the appellant to the agreement once he had elected not to abide by it, would give rise to a miscarriage of justice.  
      
       
     28 Cardinal to these arguments is the proposition that the appellant was induced to come to the agreement by his belief that he would receive lesser sentences for the 10 Form 1 counts - were those sentences to be imposed together with the seven charges on the indictment (rather than in separate sentencing proceedings). He submits that by reason of the fact that sentencing proceeded on the seven counts in the indictment alone, he lost the benefit that would otherwise have accrued to him. 
      
       
     29 It was also submitted that, in terms of the agreement, the Crown undertook not to bring any further charges against the appellant (other than the 17 counts, the subject of the agreement). The evidence before the Court, however, did not support this submission.  
      
       
     30 I have pointed out that McGuire DCJ took great care to ensure that the appellant understood the consequences of his decision to depart from the terms of his agreement with the Crown and to plead not guilty to the 10 Form 1 counts. Nevertheless, the appellant deliberately, on a fully informed basis, resiled from the terms of the agreement. In these circumstances, how it could be said that it would be a miscarriage of justice if the appellant were to be held to the agreement, escapes me. 
      
       
     31 It is, in any event, helpful in regard to the argument advanced, to have regard to a document signed by the appellant on 10 May 2000 that was witnessed by his solicitor. The document was in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “THOMAS JOSEPH SEWELL 
         
        
        
         
         10 May 2000 PARRAMATTA DISTRICT COURT 
         
        
        
         
         On Tuesday 9 May a jury trial commenced before Price DCJ & a jury of twelve. I had pleaded not guilty to 44 counts under section 300(2) of the Crimes Act. This trial was terminated following an application by my counsel when the Crown sought to introduce fresh evidence not previously raised. Subsequent to the trial aborting I understand the Crown are prepared to offer a different indictment which contains 7 counts and 10 matters on a Form 1. My counsel has explained to me that if I plead guilty to these counts that I do so having abandoned my defence of ‘Claim of Right’ to all counts. I have been informed that by pleading guilty I am admitting all relevant elements of the offence – which includes I acted consciously to obtain the money alleged for my own purposes to the prejudice of Westbus without any entitlement to this money on my own part. I have been informed that the Crown will indicate that periodic detention as a sentence would be inappropriate having already served a previous sentence of this type. My counsel has informed me that because of my record it is highly probable that I will be again sentenced to a period of full time custody”. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     32 In R v Sewell Smart AJ (with whom the other members of the court agreed) commented on this document as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “These are unusually detailed instructions and easy to understand. There is an explicit acknowledgment by Mr Sewell that he had no entitlement to any of the moneys the subject of the seven counts in the indictment and the subject of the 10 counts in Form 1”. 
         
        
       
       
       His Honour also pointed out that Gibson DCJ held that at the time the appellant entered his pleas of guilty on 10 May 2000 “he did have a genuine understanding of his own guilt and that the plea was an expression of that guilt”. Smart AJ observed: 
        
        
         
         “The findings of fact made by the judge were reasonably open on the evidence”. 
         
        
        
       And remarked: 
        
        
         
         “The judge has not failed to apply and follow correct principles in refusing to grant leave. His assessment of Mr Sewell’s evidence and findings of fact preclude a conclusion that Mr Sewell did not fully appreciate what he was doing and the effect of what he was doing.” 
         
        
       
     33 These findings are to the effect that the appellant’s guilty pleas were unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that they were not true admissions of guilt. 
      
       
     34 Mr Papayanni relied on American authority relating to plea bargaining. This authority has to be treated with caution as the plea bargaining regime in the United States is different to the law and practice in this State. The principal authority on which Mr Payayanni relied was a work entitled “American Jurisprudence: 2d: Vol. 21, published 1998 by West Group. Mr Papayanni referred to paragraph 702 of the work where it is stated: 
      
       
        
         
         “A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to the enforcement of a plea bargain; …. In other words, when a plea rests in any significant degree on the promise or agreement of a prosecutor, so that the promise can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration for the plea, that promise must be fulfilled in order to maintain the integrity of the plea”. 
         
        
       
     35 Paragraph 702, however, is not relevant in the present circumstances. That paragraph forms part of a section of the text dealing with a failure by the prosecution to fulfil a plea bargaining agreement. Different rules apply when the defendant fails to fulfil a plea bargaining agreement. According to paragraph 709: 
      
       
        
         
         “A promise made in a plea agreement is binding on the defendant”. 
         
        
       
       
       The work says nothing about the consequences that follow from a defendant resiling from part of a plea bargaining agreement, as did the appellant in this case. Moreover, the tenor of the material does not assist the appellant. Generally, the authority relied on is not helpful in the present circumstances. 
        
       
     36 Mr Papayanni submitted that Pantorno v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 466 stood for the proposition that once a case was conducted by the Crown and the accused on a certain footing, the judge would not be entitled to accept a plea or sentence on another footing. In my view, however, Pantorno does not assist the appellant. There was no change in the “footing” on which the case against the appellant was conducted. It was always the Crown case that the appellant was guilty of the seven counts in the indictment and the appellant, by his pleas, confessed to this. His own conduct in later pleading not guilty to the 10 Form 1 counts has nothing to do with the way in which the “case” in respect of the seven counts on the indictment was “conducted”. 
      
       
     37 Mr Papayanni referred to R v Chiron (1980) 1 NSWLR 218. In this case the defendant, after pleading not guilty, changed his plea to guilty once the trial judge had allowed inadmissible evidence to be led which was highly prejudicial to the defendant’s chances of acquittal. Street CJ held that, as the erroneous decision to admit the evidence was the predominating factor causing the defendant to change his plea, the plea had to be regarded as tainted. It was not a free and voluntary confession.  
      
       
        
       In my opinion, the facts in  
       R v 
         
       Chiron  
       are entirely different to those in the present case. In  
       R v Chiron 
        the defendant was led to believe that by reason of an error of law on the part of the trial judge he would be found guilty when, but for that error, he had a good chance of being acquitted. In the present case there is no factor that caused the appellant to believe that there was a prospect of him being wrongly convicted of the seven counts on the indictment. On the contrary, the appellant had a genuine understanding of his own guilty and his pleas of guilt were an expression of that guilt.  
        
       
     38 There were tactical reasons that led to the appellant pleading guilty to the seven counts on the indictment and the 10 Form 1 counts. See in this regard R v KCH [2001] NSWCCA 273. Nevertheless, his pleas of guilty were made unconditionally, with full knowledge of what they entailed. As I mentioned at [94] in R v KCH: 
      
       
        
         
         “As long as the decision to plead guilty was made freely and voluntarily, the decision stands. This is the necessary corollary of the principle laid down in  
         Maxwell v The Queen 
          at 511 that if the plea of guilty is genuine, and the accused person knows what he is doing, he may, for ‘whatever reason’ insist on pleading guilty”. 
         
        
       
     39 In my view, no improper pressure was put on the appellant to plead guilty, he was not misled and his pleas of guilty were entirely voluntary. Nothing in the agreement entered into between the Crown and the appellant bore upon the appellant’s innocence in respect of the seven counts. Even now the appellant has not attempted to establish (and has not asserted) that he is innocent of those counts. 
      
       
     40 In my view, the appellant’s own conduct in resiling from the agreement that he arrived at with the Crown cannot give rise to an entitlement on his part to withdraw the pleas of guilty he made deliberately, voluntarily, and with full knowledge in open court. 
      
       
     41 In any event, the appellant’s real complaint is not in respect of the seven counts, the subject of this appeal, but in regard to what might transpire with respect to the 10 Form 1 counts and any other additional counts that might be brought. It will be open to the appellant to present appropriate arguments in regard to sentence in relation to the ten Form 1 counts (if and when sentence is imposed) and to make whatever submissions he thinks appropriate in regard to any additional counts that may be brought (should that in fact occur). After all, the appellant might be acquitted in respect of the 10 Form 1 counts and the Crown may not proceed with additional charges. Arguments of the kind raised by the appellant are for another day and do not relate to the seven counts on the indictment.  
      
       
     42 I do not accept that there is any substance in the argument that McGuire DCJ should have asked the appellant before sentencing him whether he adhered to his plea of guilty. 
      
       
     43 The appellant was represented at the sentencing proceedings by experienced counsel and understood full well what the consequences of his actions were. The inference is that he intended his pleas of guilty to stand. In my view, by his conduct, the appellant, before McGuire DCJ, implicitly or tacitly adhered to his pleas of guilty to the 7 counts on the indictment. 
      
       
     44 The appellant also contended that Blanch CJDC erred on 19 October 2001 when refusing the appellant’s application to adjourn the sentencing proceedings until after the special leave application was heard on 23 November 2001. 
      
       
     45 The argument advanced on the appellant’s behalf was that he was compelled to plead not guilty to the Form 1 counts as, otherwise, his application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against the order refusing him leave to withdraw his pleas of guilty to the seven counts on the indictment would be prejudiced. It was said that, had he pleaded guilty to the Form 1 counts, “it could be said that he had waived the fact that he was innocent in further proceedings”.  
      
       
     46 I do not accept this submission. On 10 May 2000 the appellant had acknowledged his guilt in respect of the 10 Form 1 counts. There could be no prejudice to him in maintaining that attitude were he still to be of the view that the acknowledgment had correctly been made. The 10 Form 1 counts were different to the seven counts on the indictment. The sole defence raised to all the counts was a claim of right. The amount of the claim of right was uncertain. The claim of right may well have covered some counts and not others. A plea of guilty to the 10 counts would not necessarily have involved a tacit acceptance of guilt in respect of the other counts.  
      
       
     47 Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
      
       
     48 I turn now to the application for leave to appeal against sentence 
      
       
     49 The first argument raised orally by Mr Papayanni was that McGuire DCJ did not give credit for the fact that, since 1993, the appellant had been employed by others in a managerial capacity and ad been meticulous in his honesty. 
      
       
     50 McGuire DCJ in his sentencing remarks said that he had taken into account character evidence from a number of prominent executives in the transport industry. Two of them, whilst aware of the prisoner's conviction, visited him in gaol. His Honour said the three witnesses he heard from in this respect regarded the appellant as industrious and innovative and considered that he enjoyed a genuinely good reputation throughout the industry. These remarks show that McGuire DCJ did indeed take into account the matters referred to by counsel.  
      
       
     51 Mr Papayanni submitted that McGuire DCJ wrongly failed to take into account that the appellant had rehabilitated himself since committing the offences. It is implicit in the remarks made by the judge concerning the evidence of the executives in the transport industry that his Honour accepted that the appellant had, to a degree, rehabilitated himself. 
      
       
     52 McGuire DCJ held that he should not take into account the delay between the appellant's offences and the imposition of the sentence. Mr Papayanni submitted that his Honour erred in this respect. His Honour said that, although there had been a delay, a substantial part of that delay was directly attributable to the conduct of the appellant. In my view his Honour was correct in that finding. Between 1993 and 1996 the delay that occurred resulted from the inability of police to ascertain the appellant's whereabouts even though the appellant, as McGuire DCJ pointed out, well knew that the police wished to interview him. Much of the delay that occurred subsequently was due to procedural problems, for which the appellant carries responsibility, and other procedural steps taken by the appellant himself.  
      
       
     53 Mr Papayanni submitted that McGuire DCJ wrongly held that the appellant was entitled to no more than the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty. The Judge went into some detail in explaining why he had come to this particular conclusion. In essence, the appellant did not plead guilty at the earliest opportunity; his plea of guilty was made at a relatively late stage. In my opinion his Honour was entitled to come to the view that he did in this respect. 
      
       
     54 It is also to be borne in mind that the Crown case was very strong and a conviction was virtually inevitable: R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 633; R v Bishop (unreported, CCA, 23 December 1996). 
      
       
     55 The appellant contended that McGuire DCJ had wrongly found that he felt no remorse or contrition. His Honour said in this respect: 
      
       
        
         
         “As to remorse and contrition [the appellant] continues to maintain in effect that he was entitled to take the moneys, the subject of the offences which concern me.” 
         
        
       
       
       This observation was unexceptionable, notwithstanding the fact that the appellant had offered to pay compensation of $60,000 at $5,000 a month. 
        
       
     56 The next point made in regard to sentence was that his Honour had found incorrectly that the applicant had no claim of right. 
      
       
     57 In the course of his reasons, McGuire DCJ pointed out the difficulty he had in quantifying exactly what the appellant claimed was his entitlement. His Honour observed that the appellant's claims were denied by his employer. I have also noted that in the document signed by the appellant on 10 May 2000 he expressly acknowledged that he had no entitlement to any of the moneys the subject of the seven counts in the indictment and the subject of the 10 counts in Form 1. 
      
       
     58 The observation made by McGuire DCJ on this particular issue was: 
      
       
        
         
         “I simply do not accept the [appellant's] claims that he acted under some colour of right.” 
         
        
       
       
       In my view, on the evidence, his Honour was entitled to come to this view. 
        
       
     59 Mr Papayanni drew attention to the appellant’s frailty and the fact that he has a serious medical problem. His Honour had expressed his views in regard to the appellant's state of health and nothing said by his Honour departed from the principles applicable to this issue: See R v L (unreported, CCA, 17 June 1996). 
      
       
     60 Mr Papayanni drew attention to the evidence as to the appellant's age, character and reputation and the fact that he had already served seven months in gaol. Against these must be weighed the fact that the appellant had a criminal history involving like offences, a matter taken into account by McGuire DCJ. 
      
       
     61 I conclude that having regard to the criminality evinced by the appellant and all the relevant circumstances the sentence imposed by his Honour was within his discretion. I would dismiss the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
      
       
     62 GROVE J: I agree with Ipp AJA. 
      
       
     63 DOWD J: I also agree. 
      
       
     64 IPP AJA: The orders of the Court will therefore be that the appeal against conviction is dismissed and the application for leave to appeal against sentence is also dismissed.

      REGINA v Steven HASSEN 
       
       
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 KIRBY J: Mr Hassen stood trial before Shadbolt DCJ and a jury. He was charged with one count of an offence commonly referred to as break, enter and steal (s112(1) Crimes Act 1900). He was found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years with a non parole period of three years. His Honour declined to make a finding of special circumstances. 
      
       
     2 Mr Hassen seeks leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence. On this appeal he has appeared for himself.  
      
       
        
       The Offence 
       
     3 The circumstances giving rise to the charge were unremarkable. The issue was one of identification. A house was broken into by removing a glass window at the rear. Property was stolen (two television sets, one video recorder, head phones, dolls and ear rings). An eye witness gave evidence for the Crown. He said he knew Mr Hassen. He recognised him, amongst other things, because of his “ginger hair”. He knew where he lived. He also knew his wife, a person described as being of Aboriginal descent.  
      
       
     4 The witness said he saw Mr Hassen walk across the backyard of the dwelling from which the property was stolen. He watched him pass a television set to his wife over the rear fence. The observations were made over a number of minutes, although Mr Hassen was not aware that he was being watched. It is unsurprising, in these circumstances, that Mr Hassen should have been convicted. 
      
       
        
       The Appeal 
       
     5 The complaints made by Mr Hassen on this appeal are set out in a letter addressed to the court. Fundamentally, they raise three issues:· First, that his Honour failed to make a finding of remorse and take account of remorse;· Secondly, that his Honour ought to have found special circumstances;· Thirdly, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
      
       
     6 I will deal with each matter in turn.  
      
       
        
       The Finding of No Remorse 
       
     7 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “He has shown not the slightest contrition and none of the property has been returned”. 
         
        
       
     8 Mr Hassen pleaded not guilty. He did not give evidence on sentence. He told a probation officer after conviction that he was innocent. The finding by his Honour was, in my view, entirely warranted. There was, accordingly, no error by his Honour. 
      
       
        
       Special Circumstances 
       
     9 His Honour was urged to find special circumstances under s44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, thereby justifying a shorter non parole period than might otherwise be imposed under the statute. His Honour declined to do so. The relevant part of his Honour’s remarks on sentence were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “I have considered special circumstances. On his behalf the following have been submitted: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Firstly that he has a family and he should maintain ties with them. Secondly he is mildly depressed. Thirdly he had a background in which both parents drank, perhaps to excess. Fourthly, there is need for time for rehabilitation from drugs outside the prison. 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         None of these places his circumstances out of the ordinary. Neither individually nor collectively could they be regarded as special unless that word is to lose all meaning. If every mildly depressed prisoner with a wife and child, who had himself parents of slightly less than perfect quality could claim special circumstances, then, indeed, every prisoner has them”. 
         
        
       
     10 Mr Hassen submitted that his Honour paid insufficient regard to the decline in the frequency of convictions in the past five years, compared to the decade or so before 1996. He has not been convicted of a significant crime of dishonesty since 1996, though he has been convicted of other offences. Moreover, he successfully completed a sentence of periodic detention between 1996 and 1998. These matters, in his submission, ought to have been taken into account when determining his prospects of rehabilitation.  
      
       
     11 However, his Honour specifically noted the change in the pattern of his convictions. He said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “Really the only matter in favour of the prisoner is that his criminality seems, as far as frequency is concerned, to be on the wane.” 
         
        
       
     12 I do not believe, therefore, that there is substance in Mr Hassen’s complaint. The only matter which is troubling is whether his Honour’s was suggesting that the matters he identified were incapable of being regarded as special circumstances, either because they were not unusual in themselves or unique to Mr Hassen. Certainly some of the matters listed by his Honour were capable of being regarded as special circumstances, especially Mr Hassen’s association with drugs. His early criminal history can no doubt be explained by that association. He was addicted to heroin. Since the age of 25 (he now being 33) he has been taking methadone. 
      
       
     13 Whilst some Judges may have regarded that history as justifying, in the interests of rehabilitation, a longer than usual period of supervision, the issue is whether his Honour’s refusal to do so caused the sentencing process to miscarry? The approach of an appellate court to such an issue has recently been restated by this court in Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534 where the Chief Justice said this, referring to the issue of special circumstances: 
      
       
        
         
         “The decision is first one of fact – to identify the circumstances – and, secondly, one of judgment – to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character” 
         
        
       
     14 In the same case, Spigelman CJ, with whom other members of the Court agreed, repeated with approval the following passage from Regina v GDR (1994) 35 NSWLR 376 at 378 in paragraph 51: 
      
       
        
         
         “The features of the present case which were said to constitute special circumstances were as follows. First, the applicant will serve his sentence in protective custody. Secondly, this is his first term of imprisonment. Thirdly, the applicant surrendered himself to the police, fully admitted his guilt, and in due course pleaded guilty. 
         
        
        
         
         It would have been open to the sentencing Judge, in the exercise of his discretion, to regard those circumstances, in combination, as special circumstances within the meaning of s5(2). However, his Honour was not bound to do so, or to respond to the circumstances by setting an additional term which was in excess of one-third of the minimum term”. 
         
        
       
     15 Here, his Honour was not bound to regard the circumstances which he identified as amounting to special circumstances. In my view, therefore, no error has been established. 
      
       
        
       The Sentence was Manifestly Excessive 
       
     16 Mr Hassen’s real complaint is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. He was convicted on a single count. The value of the goods stolen was about $1,000. The decision of the CCA in Regina v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 identified a number of matters which may affect the seriousness of a charge under s112(1) of the Crimes Act. There were two such matters in the case of Mr Hassen. First, he had, as his Honour remarked, a truly appalling criminal history which began when he was thirteen years old. That history mainly involved repeated offences of dishonesty. Shadbolt DCJ said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “He has in the last two decades been sentenced in all to thirteen and a half years imprisonment with hard labour and two years three months of periodic detention, none of which has deterred him”. 
         
        
       
     17 Secondly, at the time of the offence, that is, 23 July 1999, Mr Hassen was subject to a two year recognisance imposed by the Local Court on 30 July 1998. 
      
       
     18 The Crown’s submissions included statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission in respect of this sort of offence. The offenders in the sample of cases were of a similar age to Mr Hassen and had prior convictions. The sentence imposed upon Mr Hassen, according to these statistics, is within the range of sentencing discretion, though at the upper end of that range. This was a case, as his Honour remarked, in which not only general deterrence but special deterrence, aimed at Mr Hassen himself, was important. His Honour said this: 
      
       
        
         
         “Submissions have been made for alternatives to full time imprisonment. I have heard from Miss Mitchell and I have seen and read her report. However, the court is of the view that the prisoner’s record is such that only full time imprisonment would serve the community’s interest, and only such a sentence as would impress upon the prisoner that from now on sentences of such length, or longer, will consume the next two decades if he continues to commit these kinds of crimes with this kind of frequency as he has in the past” 
         
        
       
     19 The sentence which was imposed by his Honour, although high, even towards the top of the range, was not, in my view, outside the discretion which his Honour had.  
      
       
        
       Order 
       
     20 I would therefore propose: 
      
       
       
       1. That leave to appeal should be granted. 
        
        
       2. That the appeal should be dismissed. 
        
       
     21 BUDDIN J: I agree. 
      
       
     22 KIRBY J: The order of the Court will therefore be as proposed by me.

    The respondent pleaded guilty in the District Court to a count of aggravated breaking and entering with intent to steal. He and a co-offender modified a truck and were using it in an attempt to make off with an automatic teller machine. Police were aware of their plans and a tactical unit was positioned to arrest them. The offenders were heavily armed with automatic weapons. The respondent attempted to escape and was restrained in a violent confrontation during which he attempted to access a pistol concealed in his clothing. The co-offender was younger and had no prior convictions. The respondent was found to be the prime motivator of the crime. He had multiple convictions for firearms offences. It was argued that, if the court came to resentence, it should be mitigated because the arresting police had used excessive violence and injured the respondent in the course of arrest.HELD: The sentence of four and a half years imprisonment with three years non parole period was manifestly inadequate. On resentence restraint was appropriate in particular having regard to the mild sentence received by the co-offender of two years and nine months imprisonment with twelve months non-parole period in respect of which no Crown appeal was instituted. The evidence did not sustain the allegation that the respondent had been subjected to some form of punishment at the hands of arresting police. Resentenced to six years and six months imprisonment with four years and six months non-parole period.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
        
        
       
     1 SHELLER JA: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons for judgment prepared by Grove J. The respondent was charged with a serious indictable offence for which the maximum penalty is twenty years imprisonment. The events and circumstances which Grove J has described, taking account of those factors relied upon by the respondent in mitigation of sentence, leave me in no doubt that the sentence imposed of four and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years is manifestly inadequate. I find it difficult, if not impossible, to understand how it could have been arrived at. Grove J has observed that the sentence he has proposed is considerably less than he would regard as appropriate at first instance. My view is the same. 
      
       
     2 A significant factor in re-sentencing is the sentence imposed upon the co-offender against which the Crown has not appealed. I say no more than that it strikes me as having been surprisingly light. I would emphasise that Courts have a duty to ensure that sentences reflect the seriousness of the crime as well as properly taking account of matters in mitigation of sentence. Manifestly inadequate sentences, such as that imposed in this case, understandably attract criticism of the administration of the criminal justice system. 
      
       
     3 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s5D of the Criminal Appeal Act alleging inadequacy of sentence. The respondent pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a count of specially aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely stealing and was sentenced by Coolahan DCJ at Newcastle District Court to four and half years imprisonment with a non parole period of three years. At the time of sentence there were taken into account two offences on a Form 1, both of possessing a firearm without authorization, in each case a .762 self loading assault rifle of Chinese manufacture. The special circumstance of aggravation was the respondent’s being armed at the time of offence with a .357 calibre magnum pistol. The respondent had a considerable prior record including multiple offences against firearms laws.  
      
       
     4 By early February 2001 police had become suspicious of the activities of the respondent and a co-offender O’Shea. Such activity included surveillance by them of shopping or business centres equipped with automatic teller machines. Inter alia, warrants were obtained and telephone calls participated in by the offenders were intercepted.  
      
       
     5 On 28 January 2001 the offenders acquired a Ford F250 tabletop utility which they modified to fit a cable and winch to the rear section and they added specifically designed and manufactured aluminium rear ramps. As events turned out, the obvious purpose of these modifications was to enable the forcible extraction and removal of an automatic teller machine and its contents.  
      
       
     6 In the early hours of the morning of Saturday 10 February 2001 the respondent and his co-offender arrived outside the office of the Greater Newcastle Building Society, Morisset and reversed the utility in front of a teller machine. Each of them was wearing dark clothing and gloves and had disguised his face with a balaclava. However, police were in position as a result of their investigative and surveillance efforts and specialist police, a tactical operations unit of the State Protection Group, were present.  
      
       
     7 The respondent commenced to smash the glass near the teller machine and O’Shea then brought a hook at the end of a cable towards it. The machine contained over $90,000 at the time.  
      
       
     8 Police made their presence known and called upon them to surrender. The respondent returned to the vehicle and attempted to drive away. He was prevented from effecting such an escape by the firing of two shots of chemical reagent into the windscreen of the vehicle. This broke the windscreen and otherwise obscured it. 
      
       
     9 The respondent resisted arrest and a violent struggle took place. He was observed trying to remove something from inside of his trousers. After he was subdued search revealed the magnum pistol in his waistband and as well he had an additional amount of loose ammunition for it in his pockets. The assault weapons located in the cabin of the vehicle were fitted with magazines loaded with live ammunition, in one thirty cartridges and the other, twenty nine. An additional four “spare” loaded magazines were also found there. 
      
       
     10 O’Shea pleaded guilty to similar charges and was dealt with by Coolahan DCJ prior to his dealing with the respondent. O’Shea was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and nine months with a non parole period of twelve months. At the time O’Shea appeared for sentence he was twenty years of age and had no prior convictions. The respondent was twenty seven years of age. The learned sentencing judge adverted to this matter and expressed a conclusion, “That no real issues of parity arise between the two”. 
      
       
     11 There is no doubt that, as a subjective matter the respondent had a grossly disadvantaged background. He was a victim of sexual and other assaults by a violent father. An attempt to escape this violence from both his father and stepmother by fleeing to his mother was thwarted by intervention on the part of authorities and return to the custody of his father. He attempted to avoid this by jumping from a height and at least causing himself harm if not a more drastic consequence. However, his fall was cushioned by landing in lantana. Be that as it may, given his age at the time of this offence the respondent was well clear of any further interference from his father. The respondent was not the only victim of his depradations and there was information before the District Court that the father had been sentenced to imprisonment for offences of sexual assault. 
      
       
     12 The learned sentencing judge recited at length material from two psychiatrists Dr White and Dr Delaforce and a psychologist Mr Andeasen. It should be noted that the reports of Dr Delaforce and Mr Andeasen were prepared in 1994. It is not necessary to recite again the content of those reports. It is disturbing to note however that as long ago as 1994 Dr Delaforce had reported “Unfortunately he seems to be more than just a collector of guns and may well have used firearms to intimidate people”. And further, “The indications are that he has been violent and generally speaking dangerous. Consequently the risk of future dangerousness persists.”  
      
       
     13 In November 1994 at Lismore District Court the respondent was placed on recognizance to be of good behaviour on fourteen counts of possessing unlicensed firearms. In October 1996 at Sydney District Court he was sentenced to concurrent two years imprisonment (minimum term twelve months) on charges of possessing an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, possessing a prohibited weapon, using a prohibited weapon, possessing an unlicensed firearm (two counts), possessing a shortened firearm (two counts) and using a firearm without licence. 
      
       
     14 His Honour stated that he was discounting the sentence to be imposed by 20 percent in the context of a reference to it being entered in the face of an overwhelmingly strong Crown case but the avoidance of a lengthy trial. Whilst such an amelioration of sentence probably needs now to be viewed in terms of the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice in distinction from the pragmatic and objective ground that the plea has saved the community the expense of a trial: Cameron v The Queen [2002] HCA 6 I would not find that it was erroneous for his Honour to conclude that discount was appropriate. The Crown submitted however that the quantification at 20 percent of sentence was excessive in the circumstances. 
      
       
     15 The primary question is whether the jurisdiction of this Court to intervene has been enlivened. In my view it has. The maximum penalty specified by Parliament for this offence is twenty years imprisonment. A sentence of less than a quarter of that maximum for an offender with a substantial prior record and for an offence in which the special aggravation relates to dangerous and loaded weaponry fails to reflect the objective criminality of the offence by such a margin as requires it to be categorized as manifestly inadequate. It is a coordinate conclusion that his Honour must have given too great weight to subjective matters affecting the respondent. Acknowledging the appropriateness of reference to the respondent’s background it is difficult to place into context his Honour’s observation that the respondent and his co-offender “could have been killed” bearing in mind, as his Honour had observed, that it was they who had instituted an extremely dangerous and volatile situation by bringing into the situation a small arsenal of loaded weapons. A reference to an emphasis by the respondent when speaking to Dr White that he planned the robbery to occur at a time when no one was around and that he was robbing a machine which would have been insured is difficult to reconcile with the carrying of that extravagant armament. Neither of the matters adverted to were in my opinion capable of contributing towards mitigation in favour of the respondent. I agree, however, with his Honour’s observation that the fact that no money was obtained did not attract mitigation of punishment for this offence.  
      
       
     16 The offence was one which involved considerable planning, reconnaissance as well as the vehicle modification and these amount to attributes of major criminal activity. In addition, a scanner was acquired for the purpose of monitoring police transmissions. There was no spur of the moment decision to lapse into offending. This planned and organized crime necessitated the inclusion of a manifest element of general deterrence in the assessment of appropriate sentence.  
      
       
     17 In my view a proper starting point for consideration of appropriate sentence is in the order of at least half of the maximum specified by Parliament.  
      
       
     18 There are however considerations which lead me to propose some restraint. There is the issue of double jeopardy, as it is frequently referred to, when sentences are imposed in this Court following a successful Crown appeal. Second, there are the subjective factors operating in the respondent’s background which were recited by the learned sentencing judge and I need not repeat. Third, I am of a view that the respondent’s plea of guilty before the magistrate, being prompt, should be assessed as evidence of a willingness on his part to facilitate the course of justice. Fourth, there is the sentence imposed upon the co-offender O’Shea. His Honour found that their participation in the offence was equal and that is a finding which I would endorse. I have already referred to his remark concerning the absence of issues of parity and I would further endorse the correctness of his finding that it was the respondent who was the motivating force behind the decision to commit the offence and its planning and execution and as well the notation that O’Shea was a much younger man with no prior criminal history. Nevertheless the equivalence of their participation in the offence cannot wholly be ignored and given that we have been informed that the Crown has not appealed against the apparently remarkably light sentence received by O’Shea, although there must be some disparity between the sentences received there is, as I have said, some cause for restraint. 
      
       
     19 Finally, there is a particular issue raised by counsel on behalf of the respondent. At the sentence hearing at first instance a series of photographs taken shortly after arrest were tendered. In respect of them his Honour commented: 
      
       
        
         
         “These show that he was injured and had two black eyes, however the extent of the injuries could not be ascertained from the photographs and there was no other material tendered in relation to them. I am not sure as to the relevance of the photographs. If the injuries were sustained during the course of his arrest, no complaint had been raised by the offender in this regard, at least so far as this Court is concerned. In any event, bearing in mind the information that the police had from the previous telephone intercepts, it is obvious that they had to act swiftly in performing the arrest of the offender and it would in my view not be surprising that some degree of force was required and justified. Accordingly, I do not regard the photographs tendered as having any relevance in any way in this sentencing exercise.” 
         
        
       
     20 It was submitted that his Honour apparently did not appreciate the purpose of the tender which was to demonstrate that the respondent’s injuries were beyond those which would be expected in the circumstances surrounding his arrest. The photographs were said to show that the respondent had been subjected to a severe beating. 
      
       
     21 The respondent was arrested at about 2.40 am. At 6.20 am he was interviewed by Detectives Taylor and Rogan and this interview was video recorded. A transcript was tendered in the District Court proceedings and included was this exchange: 
      
       
        
         
         “Constable Taylor (after referring to the arrest and remarking that the respondent was ‘obviously in a bit of pain’): Would you like to tell me about that matter? 
         
        
        
         
         Respondent: On legal advice I got nothing to say regarding anything like that. What I do wanna do is present myself as I am, smashed to pieces after I was handcuffed, laid on the ground, had my head caved in. Mate, as you can see my wrists have been cut, my face has been trampled on. Mate, I believe I’ve got concussion, probably a cracked, a cracked skull. Mate, I thought I had a broken jaw before. Mate ….. mate, inhumane is not, not the word, you know, like in handcuffs and I had the shit kicked out of me by several, several of your Police officers. Uhmm mate, as one can see, mate, I’ve still not been to a hospital to get X-rays taken, my head I think was cracked. I’ve been taken all my clothes off me. ………” 
         
        
       
     22 On the basis that it may be used if this Court came to resentence, the Crown did not object and we have viewed the video and listened to its sound track. In addition, and on the same basis, we have received into evidence a copy discharge letter and CT report from the John Hunter Hospital to which the respondent was taken by police. He arrived there at 10.40 am.  
      
       
     23 As I understood the submission by counsel, it was that his client had already been subjected to some form of punishment at the hands of arresting police (by subjecting him to excessive violence) and that this should be taken into consideration as a mitigating factor in the assessment of any resentence. No authority was cited for the proposition that inflicted extra-judicial punishment should be reflected in that fashion in judicial determination of sentence. However, if any such circumstances were shown it would not seem repugnant to principle to conclude, for example, that the need for an element for personal deterrence in sentence assessment had to some extent already been fulfilled.  
      
       
     24 Neither did counsel for the Crown advert to any authority on this topic as it was his submission that there was no evidence that the respondent was injured other than in the course of arrest and there was no evidence of application by the police of excessive force. 
      
       
     25 The respondent gave no evidence in either proceedings and was content to rely upon the material which I have described, his complaint being articulated in the interview with the detectives. This complaint was obviously focussed upon the tactical operations unit police rather than the detectives. 
      
       
     26 It is true that the respondent appears battered and bruised in the photographs and in the video. The statements tendered in the proceedings did not disguise the circumstance that the arrest was effected in the course of a very violent struggle. I have already mentioned that the respondent was armed with a loaded pistol concealed in his clothing, to which he was clearly seeking access when police sought to detain him. It is a reasonable inference that the removal of his clothing was to obviate the risk of the presence of any other concealed weapon. 
      
       
     27 The documents from the John Hunter Hospital do not corroborate the extent of injury claimed by the respondent. Diagnosis was recorded as simply “facial injury – soft tissue”. The CT scan excluded fractures of any facial or skull bones, indeed no fracture of any sort was reported. The respondent had complained of a possibly broken jaw at the scene but an ambulance officer’s examination, correctly as it turned out, was negative. It is of passing interest that the CT revealed nothing of recent origin other than soft tissue swelling over the scalp but it did report: 
      
       
        
         
         “There is evidence of metallic particles in the left mandible. The appearance of these particles suggest previous gunshot injury.” 
         
        
       
     28 The Crown material tendered in the sentence proceedings made mention that the police had taken a video recording of the actual arrest. Neither there nor in this Court was that video sought to be shown. Bearing in mind that the arrest was at 2.40 am, it may be that the quality of any picture is low but whatever it is capable of showing remains speculative. 
      
       
     29 The hospital reports do not suggest any presentation of the respondent with injuries beyond what might be expected to result from an arrest taking place in the circumstances described. Nor in my opinion is this Court in a position to diagnose that the respondent was a victim of excessive force simply from his complaints and the still and video photography.  
      
       
     30 I would reject the respondent’s submission that penalty should be mitigated because he had been punished in some way by the arresting police.  
      
       
     31 I would assess a resentence of eight years imprisonment, taking into account the matters which I have mentioned save the reflection of the plea of guilty for which reason I would reduce that term to six years and six months. 
      
       
     32 The sentencing judge found that there were special circumstances justifying a departure from the proportion of non parole period to head sentence specified in s44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the basis for this was expressed in the absence in the past of any provision in a significant way of counselling psychological or psychiatric advice and treatment to the respondent. With some hesitation I would make a similar finding, although I would not apply the same proportion. 
      
       
     33 I would emphasize that the sentence which I propose is considerably less than I would regard as appropriate at first instance but is mitigated for the reasons of restraint that I have mentioned in resentence after a successful Crown appeal. 
      
       
     34 I propose the following orders: 
      
       
        
       (1) Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      (2) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
      
       
       (3) In lieu thereof and taking into account the two matters on Form 1 I would sentence the respondent to imprisonment for six and half years commencing on 10 February 2001 with a non parole period of four years and six months commencing on the same date.

      Judgment 
       
      
      
       
     1 HEYDON JA: This is a Crown appeal purportedly from an order of Hosking DCJ, SC, made on 23 October 2001 discharging the accused. 
      
       
     2 This matter has been before the courts on many occasions but it is not necessary to set out any part of the chronology except the following.  
      
       
     3 On 16 February 1997 a dwelling at 1A Tara St Woollahra was damaged following an explosion. The Crown alleged that the accused and one Max Gibson deliberately caused the explosion. The accused was arrested on that day. Initially bail was refused but later granted on conditions. 
      
       
     4 On 4 June 2001, after several attempts to start a trial had failed, a trial commenced before Judge Stewart in the District Court. There were two counts. The first was: 
      
       
        
         
         “On 16 February 1997 at Woollahra in the State of New South 
           
         Wales the accused Thomas Anthony Vincent did maliciously 
          damage a dwelling the property of Cascade Holdings Pty Ltd and Drulara Pty Ltd by means of fire”. 
         
        
        
       The second, which was an alternative to the first, was: 
        
         
         “On 16 February 1997 at Woollahra in the State of New South Wales the accused Thomas Anthony Vincent did maliciously damage a dwelling the property of Cascade Holdings Pty Ltd and Drulara Pty Ltd”. 
         
        
        
       
     5 On 21 June 2001 Stewart ADCJ, QC, directed the jury to acquit on the second count, which they did, on the ground that there was no evidence that the accused or Gibson “acting in concert intended to cause damage to these premises other than by fire”. 
      
       
     6 On 25 June 2001 the jury announced that they were in disagreement on the first count. 
      
       
     7 On 27 July 2001 the trial was fixed to commence again on 22 October 2001. On that day it seems that a document was prepared indicating that it was “the present intention of the Crown to present an indictment in the following form”; the old count one was set out, with the new count two having been crossed out.  
      
       
     8 On 17 October 2001 the accused filed a notice of motion supported in due course by three affidavits. The notice of motion sought “An order permanently staying these proceedings against the accused”. The affidavits set out a history of delay and of the prejudice allegedly caused to the accused, his wife and his children. 
      
       
     9 At the hearing before the primary judge the application was treated apparently by consent as “an application for the special plea in bar of autrefois acquit” or “a plea in bar in the nature of autrefois acquit”. The primary judge concluded that the accused was entitled to maintain either of those two pleas and hence he did not decide whether or not to grant a permanent stay. 
      
       
     10 When the appeal was called on this morning the court invited attention to the question of its jurisdiction to hear the appeal. That jurisdiction can only depend on statute.  
      
       
     11 Mr P Ingram, who appeared for the Crown and whose submissions displayed admirable frankness and a sense of relevance, was asked which statutory provision he relied on. He said that only s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 was relied on. The relevant provision in that section is subsection (2): 
      
       
        
         
         “The Attorney General or Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies”.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
       There is no doubt that these are proceedings to which the section applies. 
        
       
     12 On being invited to identify what interlocutory judgment or order was the subject of the appeal counsel representing the Crown said that it was the concluding observation of the primary judge, “I discharge the accused”.  
      
       
     13 There was some debate about what the primary judge intended, after he said: “I vacate the trial date of Monday 29 October 2001”, by saying: 
      
       
        
         
         “I will list the matter in the arraignment list on Friday 7 December 2001 at this court at 10am”. 
         
        
       
     14 The Crown did not take any point to the effect that that listing in the arraignment list in any way qualified whatever flowed from the words “I discharge the accused”. It seems that the primary judge had been informed that whatever the outcome of the argument before him the loser would appeal to this court and he was intending to preserve control over the matter in order to see whether any further steps needed to be taken in light of the outcome of the appeal. 
      
       
     15 It is not necessary to decide this but in my opinion strictly it would have been more desirable not to have listed the matter in the arraignment list because had this court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal and had the court been prepared to allow the appeal the matter would have returned to District Court to be dealt with in due course without the necessity of the listing made by his Honour. The discharge of the accused for the reason that he had successfully invoked the pleas was an unconditional discharge, terminating any connection between him and the District Court in relation to the matter.  
      
       
     16 Returning to the central issue, the question arises: what did the words “I discharge the accused” mean? Counsel appearing for the Crown said that the words “I discharge the accused” meant that the accused was discharged on the indictment. Counsel indicated that there was a possible distinction between “acquittal” and “discharge” on the indictment. Counsel said that he had no instructions to take any such point today in view of the way the matter has proceeded in the past and in view of the fact that the point had not been developed in written submissions. 17 I should say in fairness to both parties that the lack of development of any relevant point on this jurisdictional question in written submissions is occasioned by the fact that at a mention last Wednesday 27 March 2002 the possible absence of jurisdiction in the court was drawn to the attention of the parties for the first time. It was not a point which the accused had up to that point taken though the point has been taken in written submissions received this morning. 
      
       
     18 In short the Crown does not today wish to contend that there is any distinction between a discharge and an acquittal. The Crown accepts that the words “I discharge the accused” constituted an order reflecting successful reliance on the plea of autrefois acquit or a plea in the nature of autrefois acquit, and that, in substance, that order amounted to an acquittal. 
      
       
     19 It is to be noted the back of the indictment is blank. A more satisfactory course of proceeding would perhaps have been for the primary judge to have ensured that the precise order intended appeared opposite or under the words “Verdict” or ”Judgment”. That was not done. However, as indicated, the position of the Crown is that the substance of the primary judge’s reasoning together with what he said taken with the other background circumstances are such that it is not intended to contend that what has happened is anything other than a verdict of acquittal. 
      
       
     20 An acquittal is a final order. There can be no appeal from it without statutory warrant. Since no statutory provision is relied on apart from s 5F, and since s 5F only applies to interlocutory orders, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.  
      
       
     21 In the circumstances the appeal should be dismissed. It is not necessary to consider the arguments of the parties on whether in substance the primary judge was correct in accepting the contentions of the accused that either the plea of autrefois acquit or a plea in the nature of autrefois acquit would have been accepted. Nor is it necessary to say anything about the accused’s application to the primary judge which was not decided by the primary judge for a permanent stay, except that the background circumstances are regrettable. I, for my part, see considerable sense in the following observation of the primary judge:  
      
       
        
         
         “If the point has not been reached where further continuation of the proceedings would constitute an abuse of the court’s process, then at least that point cannot be much further away”.  
         
        
       
      
      
       
       In view of the outcome of the appeal it is not necessary to say anything further on that subject. 
        
       
     22 Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
      
       
     23 STUDDERT J:  I agree. 
      
       
     24 LEVINE J: I agree. 
      
       
     25 HEYDON JA: The appeal is dismissed.

      Judgment 
       
      
      
       
     1 HEYDON JA: The appellant appeals against his convictions by a jury after a trial before Keleman DCJ, QC, lasting eight days, on 27 March 2000 on the following four counts: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. For that he in about September 1977, at Iluka in the State of New South Wales, did assault a female … and at the time did commit an act of indecency upon her, she being then under the age of sixteen years. 
         
        
        
         
         2. Further, that between about 22 February 1979 and 23 February 1981, at Iluka in the State of New South Wales, did attempt to carnally know [a female], she then being under the age of ten years. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Further, that between about 22 February 1982 and 23 February 1984, at Iluka in the State of New South Wales, did assault [a female] and at the time did commit an act of indecency upon her, she being then under the age of sixteen years. 
         
        
        
         
         5. Further, that between about 1 December 1984 and 1 February 1985, at Iluka in the State of New South Wales, did assault [a female] and at the time did commit an act of indecency upon her, she being then under the age of sixteen years.” 
         
        
       
     2 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The sentences were as follows. On count 2 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years and six months commencing on 18 August 2000 with a non-parole period of one year expiring on 17 August 2001. On count 1 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for one year commencing on 18 August 2000. On counts 4 and 5 he was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of six months commencing on 18 August 2000.  
      
       
        
       Background 
        
       
     3 The trial judge in his remarks on sentence said he was satisfied of the following facts. 
      
       
        
         
         “Each of the counts involved sexual acts committed upon the prisoner’s granddaughter when she visited her grandparents who resided in a northern New South Wales coastal town. The offences were committed over a period of about seven and a half years commencing in September 1977 when the complainant was about four and a half years of age, and concluding in the Christmas holidays at the end of 1984, when she was eleven years of age.  
         
        
        
         
         The offences charged were not isolated occurrences but were committed against a background of other sexual acts committed by the prisoner on the complainant whenever she visited her grandparents at least once per year over this period of some seven years. 
         
        
        
         
         The first count involved an indecent assault on the complainant when she was four and a half years old. This was the first occasion the prisoner committed a sexual act upon the complainant. The complainant was visiting her grandparents with her older sister while her parents were overseas. They were all out in the backyard when she followed the prisoner into the rumpus room where the prisoner, while the complainant stood on a chair or lounge, placed his hand inside her shorts and underpants and rubbed her vagina. The prisoner then sat her down and placed his penis into her mouth and then rubbed her vagina again. The prisoner did not move his penis while it was inside her mouth. However it remained there for a few minutes. 
         
        
        
         
         The second count of attempt carnal knowledge related to an incident when the complainant was six or seven. She was standing on one of the chairs in the rumpus room and the prisoner rubbed her vagina. He then took his penis out and started rubbing his penis on her vagina and tried to push his penis into her vagina while her feet were apart and her shorts and underpants were pulled forward and slightly down. When the complainant whimpered because of the pain he desisted and then rubbed her vagina again with his penis. While I am not satisfied to the requisite standard that the prisoner intended to insert his penis fully or to a substantial extent into the complainant’s vagina, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, consistently with the jury’s verdict that in pushing his penis against the complainant’s vagina, while he did not penetrate the complainant’s vagina, the prisoner was intending to insert his penis at least to some extent into the complainant’s vagina.  
         
        
        
         
         The fourth count involved an indecent assault on the complainant when she was nine or ten in the Christmas holidays when she was visiting her grandparents with her family and other relatives. The whole extended family went on a walk after dinner one night and as they were walking back and close to home the prisoner said quietly to the complainant ‘Let’s beat everyone back’ and then more loudly ‘Come on, I will race you home’. The complainant and the prisoner then ran ahead of the group who continued to walk. When the prisoner and complainant reached the house they went into the rumpus room and while the complainant was on a chair the prisoner put his hands down her shorts and underpants, pulled his penis out of his shorts and rubbed it near her vagina. The prisoner stopped doing this when they heard the others returning and the prisoner and the complainant hid behind a wall and surprised her father as he came into the house. 
         
        
        
         
         The fifth count involved an indecent assault on the complainant when she was 11. She was sitting on a stool near the bar in the rumpus room packing some of her personal items when the prisoner came into the rumpus room from the backyard and said to the complainant ‘Last time before you go’. The prisoner then put his hand inside her shorts and underpants and rubbed her vagina while he leaned against her leg rubbing his unexposed penis against it. This incident lasted for five minutes. The complainant and her family left her grandparents home that afternoon or the next day and that was the last occasion the complainant ever visited her grandparents. 
         
        
        
         
         The complainant went to police in November 1996 and in a recorded interview with police in May 1997, the prisoner denied each of the allegations made by the complainant and he denied committing any sexual acts upon the complainant. The prisoner gave evidence in the trial and made similar denials. The jury clearly rejected those denials.”

         “There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the learned trial judge’s failure to adequately warn the jury of the danger in convicting the appellant on the evidence of the complainant, in that: 
         
        
        
         
         a) The trial judge failed to warn of the danger of mistaken recollection; and 
         
        
        
         
         b) The trial judge failed to adequately instruct the jury as to forensic disadvantage suffered by the appellant due to the delay.” 
         
        
       
     5 The part of the summing up which the appellant criticises is as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “As there is no other evidence either from the Crown witnesses or from any other source including the accused’s record of interview that is capable in law of confirming the truthfulness of the complainant’s evidence in respect of the five charges in the indictment, and given the circumstances that are relevant to the evaluation of the complainant’s evidence, I am required to give you a warning, that the evidence of the complainant may be unreliable and it would be dangerous to convict the accused on the complainant’s evidence unless you, the jury, after scrutinising the evidence of the complainant with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and paying heed to this warning were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth and accuracy of the complainant’s evidence in respect of each of the charges in the indictment. The circumstances relevant to the evaluation of the complainant’s evidence include: 
         
        
        
         
         1) The absence of evidence of complaint, and although there may be good reasons why a victim of sexual assault may hesitate or refrain from making a complaint, the absence of complaint might in the circumstances indicate the complainant’s allegations are false. 
         
        
        
         
         2) The complainant did not disclose to police the allegations against the accused until 1996. The accused was not interviewed by police until May 1997, some 20 years after the first allegation in time and some 12 years after the last allegation in time. This delay has caused the accused great difficulties in the conduct of his defence. After such a long period of time it would be impossible for him to identify the particular day and the time of day the sexual conduct alleged against him is alleged to have occurred and obtain evidence that nothing untoward happened. The incidents are alleged to have occurred in areas that were accessible to others and when others were nearby. In addition the accused after such a long period of time, and further because of his age, could hardly be expected to remember his movements on particular days and what happened on those days. The accused has been deprived because of a lapse of such a long period of time of being able to support his evidence with adequate details and witnesses. The accused would accordingly experience great difficulty in defending himself and may not be able to adequately defend himself by reason of this delay.” 
         
        
       
     6 Those remarks were made very near the end of the summing up. At the end of it the trial judge asked counsel if there were any matters of fact or law which called for further directions. Each counsel said there was not.  
      
       
     7 In Crampton v R (2000) 176 ALR 369 the majority, after quoting passages from the judgments of the majority, of Deane J and of McHugh J in Longman v R (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 90-1, 95-6 and 108-9, said that in Crampton v R a direction should have been given to the jury along the lines indicated by the majority in Longman v R and also said that the trial judge should have drawn attention to the additional considerations mentioned by Deane and McHugh JJ in Longman v R. Those additional considerations were summarised as including “the fragility of youthful recollection, the absence of a timely complaint (subject to any reasonable explanation therefor) and the possibility of distortion.” The majority in Crampton v R had earlier said (at [42]) that it was not necessary in that case to explore the significance of any differences that there were between the reasoning of the majority, of Deane J and of McHugh J. 
      
       
     8 There were broad factual similarities between Crampton v R and the present case: the complainant there was also very young (in year 6) at the time of the alleged offences, the first complaint was about 19 years later, the trial took place about 20 years later, and there was no independent confirmation of the complainant’s evidence.  
      
       
     9 The appellant relies on the reasoning of the majority in Crampton v R and their adoption of the reasoning of Deane J and McHugh J in Longman v R.  
      
       
     10 The appellant submits, first, that the trial judge should have warned the jury of “the fragility of youthful recollection” and “the possibility of distortion”. The appellant points out that the complainant was approximately 4½ years old at the time of the alleged events relating to the first count, between 5 and 8 at the time of the alleged events relating to counts 2 and 3, between 8 and 11 at the time of the alleged events relating to the fourth count, and 11 at the time of the alleged events relating to the last count. She was 27 at the time of the trial. The delay from the time of the first count was over 22 years. The delay from the time of the last count was 15 years. The appellant submitted that the cross-examination of counsel for the Crown appearing at the trial, and the summing up, posed the issue as to whether the complainant was deliberately not telling the truth or not: questions of innocent mistake were excluded.  
      
       
     11 It was common ground that the circumstances called for a Longman warning. However, the Crown submitted that any difficulties to do with the recollection of the complainant and its possible distortion had been the subject of adequate directions in the summing up in places other than that quoted above. At page 8 the trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “You will next have to consider how well that observation or hearing has been retained by the witness between then and now. Some witnesses have better recollections than others. The passage of time may diminish a witness’s recollection. Some things we see or hear are of such a nature that we are likely to retain an accurate recollection of them throughout the rest of our lives. At the other extreme some things are so trivial or at the time so unimportant to us, that we are unlikely to remember them accurately for very long at all.” 
         
        
        
       At page 11 he said: 
        
        
         
         “One final comment I make in this regard, and when you think about it, it is self evident. It is that anyone may be thoroughly and absolutely honest, but be nonetheless at the same time totally wrong.” 
         
        
        
       At page 22 he said: 
        
        
         
         “The Crown case in respect of each of the five charges in the indictment depends entirely upon the evidence of the complainant. There is no other evidence either from Crown witnesses or any other source that is capable of confirming or providing independent support for the evidence of the complainant in respect of the particular conduct relied upon to constitute each of the five charges alleged against the accused. The accused denied that any acts of a sexual nature occurred between himself and the complainant, accordingly you must approach the complainant’s evidence with considerable caution and you should scrutinise her evidence with the greatest of care.” 
         
        
       
     12 The Crown submitted that those words identified the substance of the points made by Deane J and McHugh J in Longman v R as required by Crampton v R.  
      
       
     13 The Crown submitted that the jury would have listened to that direction and interpreted it as applicable to the particular circumstances of the complainant, being then a twenty-seven year old dealing with events up to twenty-two years earlier. The Crown submitted that the jury would have been able to gather from the trial judge’s direction that there was a particular problem in relation to the possible fragility of the recollection of the complainant when giving evidence of those events. 
      
       
     14 In R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60, after a detailed analysis of the authorities, Sully J at [95](3)(d) said that in framing the substance of a Longman direction it was necessary to keep in mind the matters referred to by Deane J and McHugh J. If those matters are to be kept in mind, it follows that normally the direction should refer to the specific dangers identified. The trial judge referred to the impact on recollection of the passing of time, but he did not refer specifically to the fact that “the recollection of events occurring in childhood … is frequently erroneous and liable to distortion by reason of various factors”, to use the words of McHugh J in Longman v R (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 108 (the emphasis is added). For that shortly stated reason the summing up was defective. 
      
       
     15 That conclusion is not intended to be critical of either trial counsel or the trial judge. His summing up is extremely difficult to criticise in the light of the law as it stood at the time of the trial which was before Crampton v R was decided. At that time, it was not unreasonable to perceive the point of view expounded by McHugh J as having been a minority one. The summing up represented an earnest attempt to apply the majority reasoning in Longman v R, and to do so in the stark terms of a warning required by law with the authority of the judicial office behind it, as called for by the latest High Court cases. The trial judge’s task was not made easier by the fact that neither counsel asked for any corrected direction corresponding with McHugh J’s reasoning. The fact that they did not do so indicates that their opinion of what the law then required corresponded with that of the trial judge. The failure of counsel for the appellant to have asked for the direction which it is now said ought to have been given means that leave is needed under rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, but it must be granted in view of the importance ascribed by the High Court to compliance with Longman v R, in view of the fact that there was obviously no tactical reason why the warning was not sought and in view of the fact that it is reasonably possible that the warning which was not given could have caused the jury to experience a reasonable doubt. This is an example of a case which reveals the difficulties for trial counsel and trial judges when there is a change in the law, or at least in particular emphases in the law, after the trial but before an appeal.  
      
       
     16 The appellant also submitted that the trial judge failed adequately to direct the jury as to the forensic disadvantages suffered by the appellant due to the delay and in particular failed adequately to deal with the difficulties of testing the complainant’s allegations by cross-examination. The merits of that contention are questionable, but in view of the appellant’s success in relation to the first point raised it is not necessary to consider them. 
      
       
        
       Balance of grounds 
        
       
     17 Since Ground 1 succeeds, it is not necessary to consider Grounds 2 and 3, or the application for leave to appeal against sentence. The Crown made no submission that the proviso should be applied. 
      
       
        
       New trial? 
        
       
     18 The trial miscarried by reason of an error in directions. Often an error of that kind will not justify an acquittal and will only lead to a new trial. The appellant submits that there ought not to be a new trial and makes the following points. Twenty one and a half months have passed since the appellant was sentenced to thirty months’ imprisonment. He served three months of the sentence before appealing. I interpolate that the Crown submits that service by the appellant of about three months of a thirty month sentence could not be regarded as service of a significant portion of his sentence. The Crown argues that the case is not comparable to one where an appellant has served the vast bulk of whatever sentence was imposed. The argument of counsel for the appellant continued along the following lines. The period spent by the appellant on bail after being granted bail pending the hearing of this appeal was a more difficult time for him than would have been the time spent at liberty had he served the first twelve months of his sentence and then gone on parole. Throughout the period from about November 2000, he has had the uncertainty of his fate hanging over him. It is pointed out that the prospect of re-offending is non-existent. The Court’s attention was drawn by reference to what the trial judge said in his sentencing remarks. He set out various respects in which the appellant, who was then aged 77, was in bad health. Some of these were physical – cardiac difficulties, cerebral difficulties and severe dermatitis. Some were mental – dementia and depression. In addition, the trial judge noted that if the appellant were separated from his wife she would suffer hardship in several ways.  
      
       
     19 Two medical reports of recent date were tendered on the hearing of the appeal. 
      
       
     20 One report states that the appellant is not cognitively fit to instruct legal representatives. The other states that the appellant suffers from giddiness, poor short term memory, dementia, poor frontal lobe function, paranoia and hallucinations. His painful dermatitis continues. He has diverticulitis, reflux, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and depression.  
      
       
     21 The factors pointed to by the appellant, particularly the stress which he would have been under even after the time when bail was granted, and the medical matters, are powerful discretionary reasons against ordering a new trial and are in favour of an order of acquittal and in those circumstances a new trial should not be ordered. 
      
       
        
       Orders 
        
       
     22 The following orders are proposed. 
      
       
        
       1. The convictions and sentences are quashed. 
        
        
       2. In lieu of the convictions, verdicts of acquittal on charges 1, 2, 4 and 5 are substituted. 
        
       
     23 HIDDEN J: I agree. 
      
       
     24 BLANCH J: I also agree. 
      
       
     25 HEYDON JA:  The orders are as I proposed.

      DECISION 
       
      [2002] NSWIRComm 225 
     1 This matter was originally listed for arbitration before Tabbaa C in Cootamundra commencing on 12 October 2001. The arbitration did not proceed and the matter subsequently came before a Full Bench of the Commission in November 2001. The Full Bench published a statement on 18 December 2001 which dealt with the exercise of the rights of a party, pursuant to s173 of the Act, to have another member of the Commission arbitrate an unfair dismissal claim where conciliation before a member of the Commission has been unsuccessful (see Humphries and Cootamundra Ex-Services and Citizens Memorial Club Ltd, Matter IRC1852 of 2000, Statement of Full Bench, 18 December 2001).2 The merits of the matter were not agitated before the Full Bench. As a result, the application was remitted to me for determination pursuant to the arbitration powers of the Commission under Pt 6 ch 2 of the Industrial Relations  Act 1996 (""the Act"").BACKGROUND3 Joy Maree Humphries (""the applicant"") was dismissed on 8 April 2000 from her position as a bar attendant employed by the Cootamundra Ex-Services and Citizens Memorial Club Ltd (""the respondent"").4 The applicant commenced employment on 29 September 1997 as a part time employee engaged on various duties including bar steward, Keno operator and poker machine attendant. The applicant worked at the Club on a voluntary basis for six months before commencing paid employment under the terms of the Club Employees (State) Award (319 IG 589). There was no evidence of any complaint about her work performance, behaviour or attitude.5 In early 2000, the respondent discovered that over many months there were unusual refund transactions involving packaged beer. The police were informed and an investigation commenced.6 On 15 March 2000, the applicant was interviewed by the police. She was later charged with seventy counts of obtaining money by deception between 1 October 1999 and 8 January 2000. The specific allegations were that the applicant falsely refunded multiple items of packaged beer on numerous occasions over a number of months and stole the money. The loss to the respondent was said to be between $8,000 and $9,000. 7 After the police interview on 15 March the applicant attended for work. She was met in the Club's car park by Mr Kent, the Secretary/Manager and Mr Loiterton, a Bar Supervisor. Mr Kent asked if she had been interviewed by the police. She replied that she had and that she denied any involvement in the unusual transactions. Mr Kent informed the applicant she was to be stood down without pay until further notice.8 Soon after, the applicant contacted her Union and spoke to the Secretary, Mrs Susan McGrath. Mrs McGrath made representations to the respondent in accordance with the Award provisions which do not allow for suspension without pay. The applicant's pay was restored while she remained on suspension. Mrs McGrath made arrangements for the Union delegate, Mr Geoffrey Ticehurst, to be present with the applicant at any disciplinary meetings convened by the respondent.9 On 7 April 2000, the applicant attended a disciplinary meeting at the Club with her Union delegate, Mr Ticehurst. Present at the meeting were the Club's President, Mr Gordon Vesperman, Mr Kent and a representative from Clubs New South Wales, Mr Martin Sainsbury.10 Mr Kent sought an explanation from the applicant of the cash handling discrepancies. The applicant denied any wrongdoing. She said the tills were often hundreds of dollars over and that excess monies were handed to the supervisor on duty. When asked which supervisors, she named eight persons. The applicant also said she may have pressed the wrong button on the till.11 The meeting was adjourned. That afternoon, Mr Vesperman, Mr Kent and Mr Sainsbury met with Detective Steve Mooney. While not being provided with the evidence obtained by the police, the respondent was informed the case against the applicant was strong. Detective Mooney advised the respondent not to speak to any staff about the matter as it may compromise the police investigation. The respondent complied with the police request. The respondent's representatives returned to the Club and decided that the applicant should be dismissed. 12 The next day, 8 April, the meeting with the applicant was reconvened. She was informed that her employment was to be terminated. Mr Ticehurst sought details of the suspect till transactions. He was told that this data would be provided after checking with the police. The applicant was provided with a termination letter and Employment Separation Certificate which disclosed the reason for termination as ""failure to account"".13 On 27 April 2000, the applicant's Union, the Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, Liquor and Hospitality Division, New South Wales Branch (""the Union"") filed a claim of alleged unfair dismissal pursuant to Pt 6 ch 2 of the Act.14 The criminal proceedings were conducted over four days and concluded on 20 February 2001 when his Worship, Mr P Moon, dismissed all charges against the applicant. It is pertinent to quote his Worship's concluding comments from the extract of his Bench Summary (Ex""4""): 
      
       
        
        Of course these are serious criminal allegations and the prosecution bears the heavy onus throughout the case to prove each and every element of each offence beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the defendant to prove anything. She has pleaded not guilty to each of the offences. She made no admissions to the police relating to the charges. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Of course the prosecution case in this matter is a circumstantial one. They rely on the defendant being present at the club on the days of deficiencies that have been recorded. The prosecution case is that the defendant was the common factor in all the matters. The prosecution rely on her presence at the club at the time of each deficiency being recorded. The Crown case is that she was the only person present on each occasion that the transactions were recorded and that there was no return of alcohol as recorded on the till. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Of course the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she and only she was responsible for the deficiencies. Evidence given to the Court clearly shows a system existing at the Cootamundra Ex-Servicemens Club which was fraught with dangers. The system of balancing the tills, the mixing of funds and the accountability of the till operators certainly left the club vulnerable to losses. Many, including the defendant, would have had access to the tills and the club's monies to incur the losses that have been complained of. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        The system in place at the time of these alleged offences makes it impossible to find with any certainty who caused the deficiencies. Any one of a number of persons, including the defendant, had the opportunity to commit the offences but I have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant committed the offences as charged. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        I certainly have some doubts as to what the defendant's role was and some suspicion but, as has been stated, suspicion is not sufficient to satisfy the Court beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed each or any of the offences as charged and EACH OF THE INFORMATIONS WILL BE DISMISSED. 
        
       
     15 Despite the dismissal of the criminal charges, the respondent maintained its view that the applicant was responsible for the cash discrepancies and refused to reinstate her.16 The Union seeks the applicant's full reinstatement without loss of continuity and with payment for all income lost from the date of dismissal to reinstatement.THE EVIDENCE17 The applicant provided affidavit and oral evidence. It is fair to say that she has consistently and strenuously pleaded her innocence of any wrongdoing.18 The applicant said that when she was interviewed by the police on 15 March 2000, she believed the police were wanting to speak to her about a break-in at the Club on the previous weekend. When the police told her that thousands of dollars had been stolen from the Club by refunding cartons of packaged beer, she said she was shocked.19 The applicant gave evidence that all employees would count the till takings. She had explained to the police that on occasions ""hundreds of dollars"" (sometimes up to $500) would be over at the end of the night and these excesses were given to the supervisor on duty. She gave the police the names of the supervisors and acting supervisors. The excesses would not be sent to the office, but would be used to ""balance up"" in other areas of the Club. She had been directed to do this, but was concerned she may have been doing something wrong. On one occasion she had been criticised by a supervisor, Mr Ray Loiterton, for sending excess monies to the office.20 The applicant said the Police had not accused her of stealing money - rather that the unusual refunds had something to do with the hundreds of dollars over after each shift.21 There were four tills (three in the bar and one in the bistro area) all linked to one computer system. The tills had pre-set functions. The applicant gave evidence that staff members were given ten minutes training when the new computer till system was introduced. In the course of training, nothing had been said about the refund function on the till. The applicant said no employee had their own access number to the tills. Five or six employees might all be using the one till on a single shift. She and other staff had a few problems with the new tills. When she complained to Mr Kent about the problems nothing was done.22 The applicant said she had never issued a refund, never used the refund button and had never seen a refund done. She said that approval was necessary from a supervisor if a refund was requested by a customer.23 The applicant made a number of allegations about other staff and supervisors. She alleged that one supervisor, Lynne Cudmore, (also the Union co-delegate) manipulated the rosters by favouring employees she liked. Ms Cudmore allowed staff to drink while on duty. She drank on duty and cashed personal cheques at the Club in order to play the poker machines herself.24 The applicant believed other staff were responsible for the missing money. She couldn't say who, nor had she seen anybody taking money from the tills. She gave evidence that bistro staff often came behind the bar and no one monitored or observed their movements.25 The supervisors named by the applicant were called by the prosecution in the criminal proceedings. The applicant claimed that the supervisors had lied to the police over the large amounts of money over each night and later ""changed their story"" in the local court. The applicant said when she found out the supervisors were lying, she believed she had been ""put in a corner"". The applicant wanted to expose them for drinking behind the bar. She accepted that her allegations were ""damaging"" to those she accused of lying. 26 All the persons named by the applicant were still employed by the respondent. She now hoped the Club's cash handling practices had been corrected. In seeking reinstatement, the applicant said she could work with the people she had made serious allegations about. 27 The applicant claimed that the respondent's practices made it easy for money to be stolen, as had happened in the Keno area. She claimed money was missing from everywhere and cited $11,000 as missing from the wine and spirits stock. She said the till monies never balanced and the till takings were distributed across all sections. No one checked the computerised records or matched packaged beer sales with the stock held. Management was never on duty at night or on weekends. The respondent did not issue till floats to individual employees. There was no verification or counting of the till takings when another employee took over the shift.28 The applicant deposed that Mr Kent would come in to the Club maybe two out of four weekends. In cross examination, the applicant said Mr Kent would drink every day after work (from around 5.30pm) and be in and out of the Club all night. The respondent's board members had condoned Mr Kent's embarrassing behaviour. 
      
      The applicant claimed that Mr Kent regularly came behind the bar when he was off duty. He was often intoxicated and "" 
      mucked around with the cash register 
      "". She said other staff had "" 
      chipped him for it 
      "". 
     29 The applicant said she tolerated these conditions because there was no other employment in town. The Dismissal30 The applicant gave evidence of a meeting with Mr Kent and Mr Loiterton in the car park on the day she was interviewed by the police. Mr Kent told her that she was not welcome at work and that he had told the police she had stolen the money. If he was wrong, he said he would ""give you my deepest apology"".31 The applicant professed her innocence, complained she had bills and a car to pay off and said she would sue the Club. Mr Loiterton had said he was not involved and was ""just sitting with John"" (Mr Kent). 32 In cross examination, the applicant said that Mr Kent made no mention of suspension or dismissal. She was shocked by what Mr Kent had said, but didn't believe her employment was in jeopardy. 33 The applicant said she spoke to Mrs McGrath on many occasions after her suspension on 15 March 2000. Mrs McGrath had fixed the problem of her being suspended without pay. This was in breach of the Award. The applicant said she had not approached Mr Ticehurst to assist her, as he was on sick leave at the time. 34 The applicant described her version of the conversation at the disciplinary meeting on 7 April 2000.35 The applicant had explained that the tills were generally over by large amounts. These amounts would be used to balance the tills in other areas. If not used, the excess monies would be placed in Lynne's (Cudmore) drawer. The applicant said she didn't know what was then done with the monies.36 The applicant said that when Mr Ticehurst asked to see documentation relevant to the allegations, Mr Kent refused to provide it. The applicant accused Mr Kent of hiding the documentation behind his back. She was not provided with details of the dates or times the transactions were said to have occurred. However, Mr Vesperman said he felt the data could be provided to her at a later date. 37 After a short adjournment, the applicant was informed that the respondent was intending to speak to other staff and the police.38 At the end of the meeting, the respondent gave no indication that the applicant was to be dismissed.39 At another meeting the next day the applicant said that Mr Vesperman (it was in fact Mr Kent) told her that he had spoken to other staff and the Police. The applicant said she later learnt that the management had not spoken to the staff - only the police. Mr Kent said he had no alternative but to dismiss her from employment. No documents or statements from other employees were provided at this meeting as had been requested by Mr Ticehurst.40 The applicant said it was never explained to her what ""failure to account"" meant on her separation certificate.41 In cross examination, the applicant was shown the roster book filled in with her own handwriting (Ex""B"") and refund printouts (Ex's ""C"",""D"",""E"",""F"",""G"",""H"" and ""I"").42 The applicant described the roster book as an ""honesty book"". It was not always filled in on the same day. The applicant said that the roster book was inaccurate as employees would write in their hours and breaks at a later time. The actual times taken for breaks would often be different to those in the roster book. She described the procedure as ""guesswork"".43 The applicant confirmed various entries in the book as times she was at work. She confirmed that these times matched entries on the refund printouts when refunds of multiple packaged beer occurred. She confirmed that when she was on annual leave there were no refunds of packaged beer. The applicant claimed that the unusual refunds ceased before she went on leave. She was unable to say if they resumed after her leave. The evidence was that they had.44 When asked if she could explain why the respondent's records read this way, she said that she must have been pressing the wrong buttons. In any event, hundreds of dollars had been handed to the supervisors at the end of each shift. 45 The applicant said she had applied for a couple of jobs since being dismissed over two years ago. She had not undertaken any retraining. However, she had registered with every employment agency in the region. She believed her name had been tainted by the accusations against her and this contributed to the difficulty in obtaining work. As her family lived in the area, and it was not easy to pack up and move to another town.46 At the time of the applicant's dismissal, Mrs Susan McGrath was the Divisional Secretary of the Union. Mrs McGrath deposed that on, or about 22 March 2000, she was contacted by the applicant concerning her suspension by the respondent. The applicant had told Mrs McGrath of the circumstances of her suspension, that the police were involved, but no charges had yet been laid. Mrs McGrath described the applicant as being ""distraught and distressed"".47 Mrs McGrath made phone representations to Mr Kent that suspension, without pay, was in breach of the Award. The applicant's pay was resumed. She had not discussed the reasons for the applicant's suspension with Mr Kent. However, she told him that a union official would be attending any disciplinary meetings. Mr Kent seemed happy with this outcome. She said Mr Kent had not mentioned the missing money. Mrs McGrath had expressed concerns to Mr Kent about the respondent's investigation of the matter.48 Mrs McGrath said she had a number of phone conversations with the applicant and Mr Ticehurst. On 6 April, Mr Ticehurst advised her of the meeting to be held the next day. Mrs McGrath advised him to attend. After the meeting Mr Ticehurst informed her that the respondent refused to provide all the documentation it had in respect to the allegations against the applicant. Mrs McGrath believed there was no discussion of dismissal at this stage. There was to be an investigation into a serious matter.49 Late on 7 April, Mr Ticehurst phoned Mrs McGrath to advise of a second meeting the next day. He requested a Union official be present. However, as this could not be arranged, Mrs McGrath asked him to attend with the applicant. After this meeting, Mr Ticehurst informed Mrs McGrath that the applicant had been dismissed for ""failing to account"".50 Mr Geoffrey Ticehurst was employed by the respondent as a supervisor. He had twenty-five years' service and retired on 7 April 2000. Mr Ticehurst had been the Union delegate from 1978 until his retirement.51 Mr Ticehurst deposed that Mr Kent would often be observed drinking in the Club after his knock off time. At times, Mr Kent would come behind the bar. He said he was always on duty and was just ""checking up"".52 Mr Ticehurst described the respondent's practice of balancing the till takings by transferring monies between tills and floats. Generally, this would occur at the end of the night shift. Previously, the practice had been to count the takings twice a day. Mr Ticehurst said the bar tills were often over hundreds of dollars at a time.53 Mr Ticehurst gave evidence of the lack of training when the new tills were introduced. Employees were not provided with an operator's manual. He said when the new tills were installed, four or five employees were taught for half a day or so. They then trained the other employees. 54 Mr Ticehurst said he was first informed of the applicant's suspension on 6 April by Mr Loiterton. He had not spoken to the applicant until the meeting on 7 April. He was unaware that charges had been laid against her at that time.55 Mr Ticehurst said that at the meeting on 7 April 2000, he took exception to the way the applicant was refused entry to the Club. He believed that such serious matters should not be discussed in the Club car park.56 Mr Ticehurst sought copies of the till rolls, computer printouts and stocktake sheets. This was refused. No specific times and dates were identified by Mr Kent. Mr Vesperman overruled Mr Kent and agreed to provide the documents. They were never provided. Mr Ticehurst sought the documents in order to establish if there were any deficiencies. He said that he had, at one time, been accused of taking money from the respondent, but when documents were provided, the accusations were unable to be proven.57 Mr Ticehurst said Mr Kent had referred to the unusual refunds on cartons of beer. Mr Ticehurst said in twenty-five years, he hadn't conducted a refund of packaged beer and wouldn't know how to. Mr Kent had said that the applicant was on duty on each occasion the refunds had occurred. Mr Ticehurst said he had spoken to other employees. They had told him they had never seen anybody take any money from the tills.58 At the end of the meeting Mr Kent had said that Management wished to speak to other staff and the police. The respondent would get back to the applicant to arrange another meeting. Mr Ticehurst had the impression the matter was still under investigation. There was no indication the applicant's employment was in jeopardy. Mr Ticehurst said that neither he, nor the applicant, were involved in any further meetings with other staff or the police.59 At the next day's meeting Mr Kent said the respondent had conducted its own investigation and had no hesitation in dismissing the applicant. 
      
      Mr Ticehurst said there was no new information offered by the respondent since the day before except the Club had been to the police. Mr Ticehurst asked again for relevant documentation. No explanation was provided as to why it couldn't be provided.  
     60 Soon after, Mr Ticehurst advised Mrs McGrath of the applicant's dismissal. He believed Mrs McGrath contacted the Club and unsuccessfully sought the applicant's reinstatement. The Inspection61 During the proceedings, the Commission requested an opportunity to view the operation of the tills in the Club's bar area. During the inspection the Commission was informed that packaged beer is not stored in the bar area. If a sale is made across the bar, the item must be obtained from the cellar.62 The till operation was explained and demonstrated by the new Secretary Manager, Mel Irvine. The inspection revealed that, at the time of the unusual transactions in 1999/2000, there was no override code to engage a refund. (It now requires a special code). Any operator could perform the function by a series of key strokes. This resulted in the till takings being reduced for the amount of the false refunds. At all times, when a refund is conducted, the till will open. 63 Ms Irvine demonstrated it was possible to refund ten non-existent items by using nine keystrokes and the code number. 64 Ms Irvine said the refund reports are generated and printed in the office. However, the actual transaction cannot be performed in the office.Respondent's Evidence65 Mr Martin Sainsbury was previously employed by the Registered Clubs Association of New South Wales as an Industrial Relations Officer. He had advised the respondent in respect to the applicant's suspension and dismissal. 66 Mr Sainsbury attended the 7 April meeting. He said Mr Kent informed the applicant that the meeting was to determine her future and that the police were involved. Mr Sainsbury said that the applicant was informed of the unusual number of refunds of packaged beer and that she was the only employee present on all occasions the refunds occurred. She was asked to provide an explanation. She had said it may have been that she had made errors with the computerised till system. The applicant had said the tills were always over and that the surplus monies were usually given to the supervisors. She had named the supervisors.67 After a short adjournment in order for the respondent to consider the applicant's explanations, the applicant repeated that the excess monies were handed to the supervisor on duty. She said she had never taken any money. Mr Kent ended the meeting by advising the applicant the respondent needed more time to investigate the matter. She would remain suspended on pay. Mr Sainsbury said that no decision had, at that time, been made to dismiss the applicant.68 That afternoon, Mr Sainsbury accompanied Mr Kent and Mr Vesperman to the Police Station. There they met Detective Steve Mooney. Detective Mooney informed them that the police evidence pointed to the applicant as the only employee involved in the suspect transactions and he felt quite sure the charges could be proven. The evidence was confidential and could not be shown to the respondent's representatives. Detective Mooney told them that the Club should not speak to any other employee as it could jeopardise the investigation. Mr Sainsbury agreed the police provided no physical evidence of the applicant's involvement.69 On returning to the Club, it was decided the applicant was responsible for all the unusual refunds and she should be dismissed. Mr Sainsbury said, at no stage prior to this decision, had any decision been made to dismiss the applicant. Mr Sainsbury advised Mr Kent to advise the applicant the next day of her dismissal.70 In cross examination, Mr Sainsbury was asked about the disciplinary procedures under the Award. He agreed that an employee or his/her representative should be provided with all relevant material when faced with serious allegations. Mr Sainsbury deposed that documents were available for review during the 7 April meeting, but not provided directly to the applicant or Mr Ticehurst. However, the documents were not an exhaustive list of incidents. Mr Sainsbury believed the respondent complied with all of its obligations under the Award.71 Mr Sainsbury agreed he had not personally viewed all the records relied upon by the respondent. He was unaware that the roster documents were not completely accurate. However, he said he would not have changed his opinion of the matter even if he had known this. Mr Sainsbury agreed there were no statements from other employees. He had relied on the police investigation.72 Mr Jason Baldock has been employed by the respondent as a Supervisor, Bar Attendant and Cellarman. He had worked a number of shifts with the applicant (about two a week). He said when the money was counted at the end of each shift, the applicant would often seem curious about whether the tills were over and by how much. However, Mr Baldock agreed that at no time had he seen the applicant use the refund button or act in an inappropriate or suspicious manner.73 Mr Baldock referred to an incident on 8 January 2000 when the back till was ""ridiculously over"" by an amount of $180.00. The applicant had asked a number of times about the till. He recalled this incident because, having worked at the Club for five years, he had never known the tills to be over so much as that night. The usual over amount was $40 or less. He had told the police of this incident when questioned.74 Mr Baldock deposed that the bistro staff did not need to walk past the tills in order to collect their floats from the safe. 75 Mr Baldock said on 21 October he worked with Rodney Crowe, Ned Miller, Roy Loiterton and the applicant. Mr Baldock had conducted no refunds and had no knowledge of how to refund cartons of packaged beer. He had never seen it happen. Mr Baldock added that all staff knew how to refund for staff coffees.76 Mr Baldock deposed that he filled in his own start and finish times and breaks in the roster book. He accepted that the recorded times were not precisely accurate.77 Mr Baldock said he received about twenty-five minutes training when the new tills were introduced. 78 In cross examination, Mr Baldock expressed reservations about sharing tills with the applicant if she was reinstated. He believed there remained some doubt, notwithstanding the outcome of the criminal proceedings. He couldn't say if there would be any operational difficulties if the applicant was reinstated. 79 Mr Rodney Crowe had been employed by the Club as a Supervisor, Cellarman and Bar Attendant. Mr Crowe provided affidavit evidence. He was unavailable, for personal reasons, to give oral evidence.80 Mr Crowe had been interviewed by the police. He told the police he had not worked in the bar for some months and was working in the cellar on day shift. The police told him he was the acting supervisor with the applicant on two occasions when the suspect refunds were made. 81 Up to this time, Mr Crowe had not suspected the applicant. However, as only he and the applicant were able to do refunds on these occasions and he wasn't involved, the applicant could be the only person responsible. He was extremely disappointed as he regarded the applicant as a mate.82 After the applicant was barred from the Club, she had told Mr Crowe she had been accused of stealing money involving refunds of cartons of beer. She said it may have been a mistake. Mr Crowe advised her to get a solicitor. 83 Mr Crowe deposed that he had never seen a refund for packaged beer - not even from the cellar. He said it was rare for the tills to be over. However, if the tills were over, it was usually only by a small amount.84 Mr Raymond Loiterton was employed by the respondent for twenty-eight years. He resigned as a supervisor, for medical reasons, on 10 April 2002.85 Mr Loiterton accompanied Mr Kent on the day the applicant was suspended from employment. He was to be a witness. He deposed that the applicant reacted ""quite badly"" to her suspension. He said she was ""very, very upset"". She told Mr Kent she told the police she had not stolen money from the Club. The applicant had told Mr Loiterton that she would have thought he had more trust in her. Mr Loiterton said he was not involved and was ""just there with John"" (Kent).86 Mr Loiterton prepared a report of the applicant's suspension (Ex""6""). The report was prepared twelve months after the event. In the report Mr Loiterton referred to this incident as ""the day of termination"". In oral evidence, Mr Loiterton said Mr Kent had told him that the applicant was to be suspended.87 Mr Loiterton was interviewed by the police. He identified two shifts in October and November 1999 when the suspect refunds of packaged beer had occurred. He said he had not conducted any refunds or witnessed anyone else doing so. On the many occasions he worked with the applicant, he had never seen her refund packaged beer or remove money from the till in a suspicious manner. He had never seen her using seventy keystrokes on the till at the one time. However, Mr Loiterton said that when the applicant counted the till takings, she would often do so at the back bar area instead of the Keno area.88 Mr Loiterton confirmed that employees recorded their own times in the time book. He said rosters were posted a fortnight in advance. The rosters were a ""guideline"" only. The supervisor was responsible for when employees took their breaks according to how busy the bar was at the time. The time books were therefore not completely accurate. No one checked the accuracy of the entries made by the employees themselves.89 Mr Loiterton deposed that he received about half an hour's training when the new tills were introduced. There were occasional difficulties in using the tills and he had only experienced problems with the tills on two or three occasions. He had never pressed the till ten times to make a correction. Mr Loiterton deposed that all staff knew how to conduct refunds for staff coffees. However,to his knowledge, no-one knew how to refund packaged beer.90 In response to how often Mr Kent would be in the Club on weekends, Mr Loiterton deposed that Mr Kent would go home to Canberra every weekend he had the opportunity to do so.91 Mr Loiterton said, to his knowledge, no one was employed to replace the applicant. Her shifts were shared by other employees.92 At the time of the applicant's dismissal, Mr Gordon Vesperman was President of the Club. He had been informed by Mr Kent in early 2000 of a problem with missing monies made through the ringing up of refunds for packaged beer. Mr Vesperman said this had never happened in fifty years.93 Mr Vesperman asked Mr Kent to investigate the matter. After comparing the unusual refunds with the employees' rosters, Mr Kent established that the applicant was the common staff member on duty when they occurred. However, Mr Vesperman said he was not provided with any statements from staff or patrons. He later became aware that the applicant had been interviewed by the police and charged.94 Mr Vesperman was involved in meeting with Mr Kent and Mr Sainsbury on 7 April 2000. Mr Kent had said the losses could be as high as $10 - $15,000. Evidence obtained by the police highlighted losses of $7 - $8,000. Mr Vesperman was shown the till printouts (Ex""F"") and rosters for the same period. He said that while he did not have direct knowledge as to how the roster worked, he believed the rosters to be correct.95 Later that day, Mr Vesperman attended the meeting with the applicant. He said Mr Kent put an outline of the cash discrepancies and asked the applicant for an explanation. Mr Kent had referred to certain documents. He did not provide the documents to the applicant. The applicant denied making refunds and said she had no need to do so. 96 When it was pointed out that she was on duty on all occasions of the transactions, the applicant said she may have been pressing too many buttons. Mr Kent explained that this would lead to the tills being over - but they always balanced. The applicant had said that the tills were always over and the excess monies were handed over to the supervisors. Mr Vesperman said the correct procedure was to place a note in the till which would then be checked by the Secretary/Manager or Mrs Armstrong or Mrs Selwin (supervisors). 97 After a short adjournment the meeting reconvened. Mr Kent asked for further explanations. The applicant repeated that excess monies were handed to supervisors. She said maybe she had done something wrong - but she had never taken any money. Mr Kent advised that the Club required further time to consider her explanation and further investigate the matter. She would remain on paid suspension.98 After the meeting, the management decided that they would speak to the police. Later that day Mr Vesperman, Mr Kent and Mr Sainsbury met Detective Mooney. Detective Mooney had said there was no evidence of the involvement of any persons other than the applicant. He believed the criminal charges against the applicant would be proven. Management asked to see the evidence. However, Detective Mooney said it was confidential. He asked the respondent not to speak to any staff as it may compromise the police case.99 Mr Vesperman, Mr Kent and Mr Sainsbury discussed the situation on returning to the Club. It was decided the applicant's explanation was unacceptable and that she should be dismissed. Mr Vesperman said a board meeting was not necessary for this purpose100 Mr Vesperman said the decision was made on the police advice of a strong case against the applicant and the respondent's own investigation that the applicant was the common staff member involved in all the suspect transactions. 101 Mr Vesperman acknowledged, however, that he had never observed the applicant performing a number of multiple keystrokes or removing money from the till in a suspicious manner. He was at the Club on most days.102 The next day, Mr Vesperman attended the meeting at which the applicant was informed of her dismissal. Mr Vesperman agreed there was no fresh or additional information put to the applicant at this meeting. 103 Notwithstanding the dismissal of the criminal charges, Mr Vesperman still genuinely believed that the applicant had created the refunds and taken the money.104 In cross examination, Mr Vesperman was shown board minutes from June 1999 to March 2000 which considered monthly reporting from Mr Kent of the till ""overs and unders"". Despite Mr Vesperman being told about the refunds in late 1999, there is no reference in the minutes to the refunds of packaged beer The stocktaker had flagged the discrepancies in packaged beer stocks some months before the police were involved. Mr Kent had disagreed with these reports and provided explanations for the discrepancies. The Board accepted his assurances. Other discrepancies were identified in the stock levels for wine and spirits.105 Mr Vesperman was most annoyed that he was not informed of the refunds for several weeks and that it appeared to have been happening over an eight or nine month period. Mr Vesperman attached some fault to Mr Kent and wanted to dismiss him. However, the Board would not agree to do so.106 Mr Vesperman believed that reinstating the applicant would create an ""invidious position"" for the staff. 107 Mr Clive Miller has worked as a casual bar attendant at the Club since 1967. Mr Miller deposed that his training on the new tills was five to ten minutes. 108 He further deposed that it was very rare for a carton of beer to be returned for a refund. He was not aware of the refund button and had never used it. The pre-coded staff coffee button had nothing to do with the refund button. 109 Mr Miller further deposed that he worked with the applicant probably twice a week. He had never seen the applicant remove money in a suspicious manner, operate the refund button or use up to seventy keystrokes at one time.110 Mr Miller said he worked a shift with the applicant, Mr Baldock, Mr Loiterton and Mr Crowe on 21 October 1999. Mr Miller had not conducted any refunds for packaged beer, nor was he aware of any cartons returned.111 Mr Miller described the staff roster as a ""guide"". He gave an example of his previous night shift when his break was scheduled for 7.30pm. He actually took the break at 8.00pm because the bar was busy. Mr Miller said the information in the time book is left to the individual to fill in from the roster sheets. He added that discrepancies related only to break times and not start and finish times.112 Mr Miller said that prior to the applicant's dismissal he had no reason to doubt her honesty. However, if she was reinstated it would be a ""difficult situation"". However, Mr Miller agreed reinstatement wouldn't affect the Club's trade or membership levels. SUBMISSIONSFor the Applicant113 Mr Acev submitted that the dismissal of the applicant was substantively and procedurally unfair. He put the following matters as demonstrating the applicant was denied procedural fairness: 
      
      1) The applicant was suspended without pay in breach of the Award. 
       
       
      2) At the disciplinary meetings on 7 and 8 April 2000, the applicant was denied access to all the data and information held by the respondent. As a result, she could only profess her innocence and make no admissions. 
       
       
      3) The applicant was not informed of what the police had told the respondent. Obviously, she could not respond to what she was not told. 
      
      
      4) The respondent did not conduct a full and thorough investigation of the allegations. It had not even interviewed it's own staff.  
     114 Mr Acev cited Rich River Golf Club (ACN 001 357 071) v Lynette Anne Power (unreported) Full Bench, Matter IRC640 of 1995, 12 May 1995, and Antonakopoulos v State Bank of New South Wales (1999) 91 IR 385 in support of his submissions on procedural unfairness.115 Mr Acev referred to the specifics of the allegation against the applicant. He said the applicant and all the employee witnesses had given evidence that instruction on the new till operations was only ten to twenty minutes. The instruction did not involve how to utilise the refund button. All the witnesses said they had never refunded packaged beer.116 The inspection of the till operation had demonstrated that to conduct a refund function for ten items of packaged beer required ten key strokes. From the computer refund records, multiple refunds would require some fifty continuous key strokes in a few minutes. Mr Acev highlighted the evidence which demonstrated that no one ever saw the applicant operate the till in this manner. No one saw her remove money from the till in a suspicious manner.117 Mr Acev submitted that Mr Kent's investigation was inadequate. Mr Kent compared the suspicious transactions against the employee rosters and deduced that the applicant was the common denominator. However, the evidence was that the rosters were only a guide and did not accurately reflect the actual hours worked. Moreover, the rosters were not the same as the times recorded in the wages book. Employees would often write their times at a later time from memory. Mr Kent's assumption was, therefore, unreliable.118 Mr Acev put that the other common denominator was Mr Kent himself. The evidence was that Mr Kent was always at the Club and operated the tills. Mr Kent was not available to give evidence in his own defence.119 The evidence was that in respect to cash handling there was no procedure for allocating particular tills to individual staff. There was a practice of distributing monies at the end of a shift to ""balance up"" the total takings from all areas. There was no requirement for monies to be tallied when one employee handed over to another at the conclusion of a shift.120 These practices were strongly criticised by Mr Vesperman. Mr Vesperman was equally critical of Mr Kent's failure to take prompt and appropriate action. The loss to the Club could not be exactly established. It was estimated at between $8,000 and $9,000.121 Mr Acev relied on Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers' Union, NSW Branch (on behalf of Maree Ploner) and Westport Bowling Club Limited [2001] NSWIRComm 205 as disclosing circumstances not dissimilar from those in this case.122 Mr Acev dealt with the relevant law applicable to this matter.123 He submitted that the respondent had not discharged the onus of proving the allegations against the applicant. See Pastrycooks Employees, Biscuit Makers Employees & Flour and Sugar Goods Workers Union (NSW) v Gartrell White No 3, 35 IR 70. Mr Acev accepted that, although this case is to be determined on the civil standard of proof (Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336), the Magistrate's decision was soundly based. His decision throws doubt on whether the applicant's termination was lawful.124 Mr Acev sought the applicant's reinstatement without loss of continuity and with full remuneration from the date of dismissal. The evidence was that her job still existed and that, despite some reservations, other employees would be willing to work with her (see Perkins v Grace Worldwide (Aust) Pty Ltd, 72 IR 186).For the Respondent125 Mr Schmitke, opened his submissions by referring to the meaning of the words ""harsh, unreasonable and unjust"" (see Davey v Enacon Parking (unreported) Connor C, Matter IRC 1866 of 1995, 13 December 1995) and the civil standard of proof in unfair dismissal proceedings. He submitted that, on the balance of probabilities, the applicant was involved in the misappropriation of monies to an extent serious enough to warrant her dismissal. The dismissal of the criminal charges would have no impact on this Commission's decision. See Australian Workers' Union, New South Wales Branch v Colgate Palmolive, 27 IR 420.126 The ninety-five transactions from late September 1999 to March 2000 involved five hundred and three cartons of packaged beer with a value in excess of $12,000. Twenty cartons had been refunded on a single day. 127 In relation to the inspection of the till operation, Mr Schmitke said it revealed that was indeed possible to conduct a refund for six cartons of beer with thirteen key strokes in less than thirty seconds.128 Mr Schmitke said the respondent had sufficient information upon which to base its decision to dismiss the applicant. Despite Mr Vesperman's confusion over rosters and time books, Mr Schmitke put that it was the comparison of the time book which linked the applicant to the packaged beer refunds. There were no unusual refund transactions when the applicant was not engaged to work or she was on leave.129 Mr Schmitke said Mr Kent was not always at the Club when the multiple transactions occurred - he was often in Canberra on weekends. Thirty-four of the multiple transactions occurred over five consecutive weekends. Twenty-three unusual transactions occurred at night after 10.00pm.130 Mr Schmitke contended that other issues raised by Mr Acev, such as lack of training, till variations and the failure to create refund reports does not answer the clear evidence that links the applicant - and only her - to every unusual transaction.131 Mr Schmitke submitted that the applicant was not denied procedural fairness (see Byrne & Anor v Australian Airlines (1985) 185 CLR 10 and Loty & Holloway and Australian Workers Union (1971) AR NSW 95). She knew the allegations against her. The applicant had been interviewed by the respondent three weeks after the police had spoken to her. That meeting was attended by a union delegate, Mr Ticehurst. He was also well aware of the nature of the allegations against the applicant.132 Mr Schmitke submitted that it was reasonable that the respondent was asked by the police not to talk to other staff members. However, the respondent had sufficient documentary evidence to justify its decision. Moreover, Mr Schmitke submitted that Magistrate Moon had doubts and suspicions about the applicant's denials of involvement in the fraud.133 Mr Schmitke said that Mr Kent had not been called to give evidence because he couldn't be located and was unlikely to attend.134 The respondent's submission was that the applicant's claim should be dismissed. However, if the Commission was to intervene, Mr Schmitke said that reinstatement or re-employment was not practical. Concern had been expressed by other employees if the applicant was to return. Mr Schmitke referred to the applicant's evidence of accusations against other staff and supervisors. It would be impossible for her to work with them in light of these accusations. There was a loss of trust and the length of time (two years) since dismissal would create disruption if the applicant was reinstated. 135 Mr Schmitke put that the delay in the proceedings was brought about largely by the applicant and her union. The respondent therefore should not be forced to pay any back pay. In any event, Mr Schmitke said, the applicant has only applied for three jobs in two years and has not sought to mitigate her loss.136 Mr Schmitke relied on the authority of Bi Lo Pty Ltd v Hooper, 53 IR 224, as being analogous to the circumstances in this case.137 In reply, Mr Acev said that the respondent had only relied on ""presumptions""(sic). There was no tangible link between the applicant and the unusual transactions.138 Mr Acev put that the respondent allowed the situation to fester from September 1999 to March 2000 and did nothing to warn employees about the improper use of the refund button. Mr Acev emphasised that there were occasions when the applicant was on duty when no unusual transactions occurred.139 Mr Acev submitted that the respondent's own characterisation of the misconduct - ""failure to account"" - properly reflected the applicant's mistakes. It didn't reflect or acknowledge the allegation of theft.140 Mr Acev said the delay in these proceedings was largely brought about by the criminal proceedings.CONSIDERATIONThe Principles141 It appears to me that the principles discussed by the Full Bench in Wang and Others v Crestell Industries Pty Ltd and Another, 73 IR 454, have relevant application to these proceedings. One of the applicants in Wang had been charged with theft. Criminal charges were later dismissed by a Magistrate. Mr Wang and two others (who were not charged) were alleged to be involved in the theft of company property. All three were dismissed for serious misconduct. At first instance Connor C found, on the balance of probabilities, that the allegations were proven and declined to intervene in the employees' dismissals. 142 The Full Bench dismissed the appeal against Connor C's decision and referred to the principles the Commissioner had correctly applied: 
      
       
        
        The principle applicable in relation to the onus and standard of proof in a reinstatement case concerning summary dismissal for serious misconduct involving criminal activity by the employee is that the employer must establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Commission, that the employee was guilty of the misconduct alleged. The onus of proof in such a case is on the employer and the standard of proof must be such as to enable a positive finding that the misconduct occurred. The standard is, of course, the civil and not the criminal one, but the requisite degree of satisfaction must have regard to the seriousness of the alleged conduct and the gravity of the consequences of the finding. The satisfaction must be such as to warrant a positive finding of the type referred to by the High Court of Australia in  
        M v M  
        (1988) 63 ALJR 108 and by Dixon J in  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw  
        (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362. See also  
        Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association, NSW Branch v Jewel Food Stores  
        (1987) 22 IR 1 and  
        Coles Myer Ltd v Shop, Distributive & Allied Employees Association (NSW)  
        (1989) 27 IR 299. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        We should further observe that the evidence in a reinstatement case involving criminal activity may well establish that the employee was guilty of conduct which, whilst falling short of criminal conduct, nevertheless constitutes serious and wilful misconduct justifying dismissal and refusal of reinstatement. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        We are satisfied that the commissioner applied the correct principles in relation to both the onus of proof and the standard thereof applicable in the circumstances of this case. 
        
       
     143 Watson J in Australian Workers Union, NSW Branch v Colgate-Palmolive Pty Ltd, 27 IR 420, usefully summarised the notion that acquittal of a criminal charge does not automatically result in an order for reinstatement. At p427 his Honour said: 
      
       
        
        It is not unusual for events which lead to the dismissal of an employee to involve criminal proceedings. It has been held that an acquittal does not necessarily result in an order for reinstatement. The conclusion of the commissioner could in no way be relevant in deciding the police charge. Similarly the conclusion of the magistrate does not determine the event in this appeal ( 
        BHP v Plumbers' Union: Re Nemecek 
         (143 IG 252)). 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        That is correct even though, as in this case, the primary basis for dismissal was the same circumstance as was for all practical purposes the very charge dismissed by the magistrate. Notwithstanding that and that it is a proceeding with a different onus of proof involved, it is clear that if the decision of the magistrate in this case is soundly based, it is a factor which would throw considerable doubt on the decision under appeal. 
        
       
     144 In my view, this case pointedly demonstrates the dichotomy between the standard of proof in criminal and civil proceedings. The standard of proof in civil proceedings is embodied in s140 of the Evidence Act 1995: 
      
       
        
        140. Civil proceedings: standard of proof  
         
          
         
        (1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities.  
         
         
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: 
         
         
          
          (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence, and  
           
           
          (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and  
           
           
          (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.  
          
         
        
       
      
      
       
        
       
     145 The approach which the Commission must adopt in Pt 6 ch 2 proceedings was extensively canvassed by a Full Bench of the Commission in Four Sons Pty Limited v Sakchai Limsiripothong, 98 IR 1, in which the Full Bench considered the civil standard in the context of unfair dismissal proceedings and said at paras 10-15: 
      
       
        
        In  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
         (1938) 60 CLR 336, the High Court affirmed the principle that there is only one standard of proof applicable in civil matters, namely, on the balance of probabilities. However, it was held that the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a matter on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature or gravity of the fact to be proved.  
        Dixon  
        J stated (at 362):  
         
         
          
          The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. In such matters “reasonable satisfaction” should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences.  
          
         
         
        Similarly statements are made in other cases such as  
        M v M  
        (1988) 63 ALJR 108 and  
        Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd 
         (1992) 110 ALR 449. In the last cited case,

        ,  
        Deane  
        and  
        Gaudron  
        JJ stated (at 449 - 450):  
         
         
          
          The ordinary standard of proof required of a party who bears the onus in civil litigation in this country is proof on the balance of probabilities. That remains so even where the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct or fraud (See, eg,  
          Hocking v Bell 
           (1945) 71 CLR 430, at 500;  
          Rejfek v McElroy 
           (1965) 112 CLR 517, at 519 - 521). On the other hand, the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove. Thus, authoritative statements have often been made to the effect that clear (

          Rejfek v McElroy 
           (1965) 112 CLR, at 521). Statements to that effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proof. Rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct (See, eg,  
          Motchall v Massoud 
           [1926] VLR 273, at 276) and a judicial approach that a court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct. (footnotes incorporated) 
          
         
         
        The  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw  
        principle is now embodied in s 140 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         1995. That section provides:  
         
         
          
          140. Civil proceedings: standard of proof  
           
           
          (1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities.  
           
           
          (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: 
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence, and  
             
             
            (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and  
             
             
            (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.  
            
           
          
         
         
        The principle in  
        Briginshaw 
          
        v Briginshaw  
        has been applied by the Commission in unfair dismissal cases when considering allegations against an employee of serious misconduct involving allegations of criminal activity. For example, in  
        Wang v Crestell Industries Pty Ltd 
         (1997) 73 IR 454 at 463 - 464, the Full Bench said:  
         
         
          
          The principle applicable in relation to the onus and standard of proof in a reinstatement case concerning summary dismissal for serious misconduct involving criminal activity by the employee is that the employer must establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Commission, that the employee was guilty of the misconduct alleged. The onus of proof in such a case is on the employer and the standard of proof must be such as to enable a positive finding that the misconduct occurred. The standard is, of course, the civil and not the criminal one, but the requisite degree of satisfaction must have regard to the seriousness of the alleged conduct and the gravity of the consequences of the finding.  
          
         
         
        Nevertheless, the Full Bench made it clear that: 
         
         
          
          … the evidence in a reinstatement case involving criminal activity may well establish that the employee was guilty of conduct which, whilst falling short of criminal conduct, nevertheless constitutes serious and wilful misconduct justifying dismissal and refusal of reinstatement.

         (1998) 80 IR 434 at 456.  
         
         
        Ordinarily, the principle in  
        Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
         is applicable to findings of criminal conduct or fraud (see, for example,  
        Neat Holdings 
        ), however, the statements of principle may be applied to allegations of a broader nature. In all matters, it is necessary for a tribunal to consider the nature and seriousness of the allegation made before finding it proved at the requisite level. In this case, the finding made by the Commissioner was that “the termination of the [respondent’s] employment was not unconnected with the raising of complaints by him about the alleged work-related harassment”.  
         
        
       
     146 Of course, the usual onus in unfair dismissal cases rests with the applicant to satisfy the Commission that a dismissal was unfair or, more particularly, that it was either ""harsh, unreasonable or unjust"" within the meaning of the Act (see Western Suburbs District Ambulance Committee v Tipping (1957) AR (NSW) 273). 147 However, that onus is reversed where the employee is dismissed for misconduct. The employer must not only make the allegations against the employee, but prove the allegations to the requisite standard. 148 This shift of onus has been considered in many decisions of the Commission. A few citations will be sufficient to demonstrate the point:149 In Pastrycooks Employees, Biscuit Makers Employees & Flour and Sugar Goods Workers Union (NSW) v Gartrell White No 3, his Honour, Hungerford J said: 
      
       
        
        It is undoubted, in my view, and as Mr Walton conceded, that the onus for making out a case to warrant the intervention of the Commission in ordering reinstatement is on the claimant union: see  
        Re Barrett and Women's Hospital, Crown Street 
         (1947) AR (NSW) 565;  
        Re Municipal Employees, Greater Newcastle (Wages Division) Award (Re Wallace) 
         (1949) AR (NSW) 868;  
        Western Suburbs District Ambulance Committee v Tipping 
         (1957) AR (NSW) 273 at 279 and  
        Homebush Abattoir 
         (1966) AR (NSW) at 386. However, it is also undoubted, in my view, that where an allegation of misconduct is raised as a defence or as justification for a particular course of action by an employer, such as in summarily dismissing an employee, then the legal burden, in an evidentiary sense to establish that fact, shifts from the union to the employer: see  
        WD & HO Wills (Australia) Ltd v Jamieson 
         (1957) AR (NSW) 547 at 552, 553;  
        North v Television Corporation Ltd 
         (1976) 11 ALR 599 at 602;  
        Flynn v JC Hutton Pty Ltd 
         (1982) 3 IR 413 at 414;  
        Williams v Printers Trade Services 
         (1984) 7 IR 82 at 84; and  
        Wallace v Deering Auto Electrics 
         (1985) 12 IR 34 at 35. To the extent that Mr Newall submitted to the contrary, his submission cannot stand. The approach as to this shifting of the burden of proof received conceptual support in the judgment of  
        Dixon 
         J, as he then was, in  
        Darling Island Stevedoring & Lighterage Co Ltd v Jacobsen 
         (1945) 70 CLR 635 at 643, and in that passage from his Honour's judgment which said at 644: 
         
         
          
          Again, it is a general principle that absence of default or wrongdoing is presumed and proof is required when its absence is made a qualification of a right. It is in accordance with principle to regard fault as a particular exception defeating the right only when alleged and proved. 
          
         
         
        The right of an employer to summarily dismiss an employee without notice is qualified by the employee inter alia having committed an act of misconduct; thus, to be able to rely upon the right, and to pay the employee up to the time of dismissal only rather than terminate by notice or payment in lieu of notice, the employer must not only allege misconduct but must also prove it. In support of his submission on onus, Mr Walton referred to the judgment of  
        Dey 
        , J. in  
        Re Wentworthville Leagues Club Ltd 
         (1976) 18 AILR 355, in which his Honour clearly held that the necessity for proving misconduct lay upon the party setting it up, namely the employer, and even though the union had the responsibility for establishing a proper case for reinstatement. I respectfully agree with his Honour's conclusion, it being entirely consistent with well established authority. 
        
       
       
      
      In  
      Shop Distributive & Allied Employees' Association v Jewel Food Stores 
      , 22 IR 1, the former Industrial Commission in Court Session said: 
       
       
        
        We consider in cases where dishonesty is alleged as the reason for summary dismissal, management should only summarily dismiss if it is fully satisfied after careful investigation that the accusation has been made out. In coming to such a conclusion, a prudent and fair employer will take into account, where relevant, as part of the circumstances of the case, an employee’s youth or inexperience, the nature and effect of any interrogation and any admissions or denials made. We consider that this same standard should be applied by industrial tribunals when considering reinstatement. 
        
       
      
     150 In Franklins Limited v Webb, 72 IR 257, after discussing both these authorities, the Full Bench said at p261: 
      
       
        
        Those authorities deal with different points but are nevertheless both applicable to circumstances where summary dismissal has occurred for alleged cause. In this case, the employee was dismissed by the payment of one week's wages in lieu of notice but obviously for cause. The reasoning of the Commission in Court Session in  
        Jewel Food Stores 
        , in our view, is directly apposite and we would apply to these circumstances the same consideration with respect to onus as was adverted to by Hungerford J in  
        Gartrell White. 
        
       
     Was the applicant guilty of misconduct?151 The Commission has very much agonised over this question. For over two years, the applicant has consistently and strenuously denied the allegations against her and offered explanations for the cash discrepancies.152 The applicant has had seventy charges of obtaining money by deception dismissed in the Local Court. She seeks complete exoneration from the allegations of theft and full reinstatement to her employment. 153 There is little doubt that the effect on her reputation and livelihood have been seriously and adversely compromised by the events of the past two years. The impact must surely be, a fortiori, in a small country town like Cootamundra.154 As I earlier said, determination of this matter will be based on the civil standard of proof, ie on the balance of probabilities. Notwithstanding the dismissal of the criminal charges, if the Commission finds the allegations are proven according to this standard of proof, it seems inevitable that the consequences for the applicant will not be very much different to those she would have faced if she had been convicted of the criminal charges in February 2001.155 In para 151 I referred to the applicant's consistent denial of any wrongdoing. Schmidt J observed in Lawrence v Catholic Education Office [2002] NSWIRComm 115: 
      
       
        
        In circumstances where allegations of misconduct arise, it is commonplace for the employee concerned to vehemently protest his or her innocence. So, too, do those charged with and even those convicted of crimes. Nevertheless, decisions must be made by employers, as to whether or not such protestations are to be accepted. The continued making of such protestations, cannot of itself lead to the conclusion that misconduct has not occurred. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        I think it unarguable that in every such case, there is a risk that a person who has not engaged in the misconduct alleged, is, nevertheless, dismissed or found guilty of an offence with which they are charged. That possibility remains even when a thorough investigation into particular conduct has been conducted by an employer and not the police. The converse possibility also exists. 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        Here the applicant still maintains his protestations of innocence. He has never departed from them. These proceedings are, however, not finally concerned with establishing the applicant's guilt or innocence. That has been dealt with in the criminal proceedings. This application is rather concerned with the question of whether the applicant's summary dismissal in October 1998 was harsh, unreasonable or unjust in the circumstances which then existed. 
        
       
     156 I respectfully adopt her Honour's approach in reviewing the circumstances in this case.157 It also is apparent that this matter will be determined by the Commission making findings on witness credit - particularly the credibility of the applicant.158 In addition, it seems to me that the circumstances of this case bring into sharp focus the obligation on the Commission to closely and carefully examine whether, it is open on the evidence, to make an adverse finding against an employee. I referred to this approach in Hill and the Department of Juvenile Justice [2000] NSWIRComm 128 at paras 62-63:

        IRC 4516 of 1998, 18 March 1999, 
          
        I considered the serious implications for an employee where allegations of misconduct are made. I said at p14: 
        
       
      
      
       
        
         
          
          It hardly needs to be said that summary dismissal is the most serious form of sanction an employer can take against an employee. It can, not only serve as a means of punishing the employee for transgressions in the then existing employment relationship but can, and often does, jeopardise and diminish the employee’s future employment prospects. 
          
         
         
        A finding by this Commission that a summary dismissal was justified, is a most serious matter which may unhappily burden and grievously harm an employee for years into the future.  
         
         
        See also my discussion of this matter in  
        Thornton and Happy Hours Pre School Kindergarten 
        , IRC5333 of 1999, 29 July 1999 and

        63 The serious unproven allegations made against the applicant have gravely impugned his reputation. Left to stand unchallenged, these allegations would seriously hamper his future employment prospects, damage his reputation and more than likely, deleteriously effect his well being and that of his family. It is the Commission's duty - indeed, its obligation - to correct the injustices the applicant has so plainly suffered. I unreservedly intend to do so.  
        
       
     The Club's Procedures159 Before turning to the allegations against the applicant, it is necessary, I think, to make some critical comments on the cash handling procedures of the respondent at the relevant time. These deficiencies were adversely referred to by his Worship Magistrate Moon in February 2001. I note that corrective measures have since been taken and new procedures introduced.160 The evidence disclosed that till takings were ""pooled"" at the end of the day. As a result, if there were any ""unders or overs"" it would be impossible to identify on which till the mistake was made - let alone who made it. There also seems to have been a practice of taking change from one till when others were short.161 There was no regular or periodic check of the till refund report. The theft involving the refunds was only noticed months after the thefts commenced and then seemingly, by chance. It hardly needs to be said that if the respondent had a regular procedure for reporting refunds, the fraud would have been discovered much earlier.162 Employees recorded their own start and finishing times and when they went on breaks. No one checked these entries. It seemed very much to be an ""honour"" system. Shift times were sometimes recorded the next day or even later. Consequently, it was argued that the respondent could not be absolutely certain if a particular employee was on duty when the suspect refund entries were made.163 Notwithstanding the appallingly sloppy and unprofessional management of the respondent at the time, the fact is that this fraud was on a monumental scale over many months. Thousands of dollars have not been recovered. It is obvious the Club's management practices may well have served as a convenient cover for the theft going undetected for as long as it did.164 However, it is trite to emphasise that the respondent's failures can, in no way, justify the criminal acts which occurred. Despite Mr Acev's valiant efforts to shift the focus of the case to the respondent's deficiencies as proving the applicant could not be responsible, this is really not the issue. Whether a number of employees shared or inherited the till takings or whether the rosters were not completely accurate, does not address the more fundamental issue of when the refunds of packaged beer occurred. I shall discuss this matter shortly.165 All witnesses gave evidence that no customer had ever returned packaged beer for a refund. This, of course, is completely logical. Packaged beer would never be returned - unless in exceptional circumstances.166 Yet there were dozens of refunded packages of beer, as much as twenty cartons on one day. What on earth was going on? Was the applicant involved?The Respective Arguments167 In answering these questions I have attempted to balance the arguments in support of the parties' respective positions.168 Mr Acev's case rested primarily on the following: 
      
       
        
        i) the applicant had been vindicated by the dismissal of the criminal charges against her; 
         
         
        ii) the evidence of all the employees called by both parties was that no person saw the applicant use the refund button or remove any money from the till in a suspicious manner; 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        iii) the applicant had not used and didn't know how to use the refund button; 
         
         
        iv) the employees' rosters and entries in the time book were not accurate and could therefore not reliably prove that the applicant was on duty when the unusual transactions occurred; 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        v) the till takings for various sections of the Club were balanced against the total day's takings. It was impossible therefore, where ""unders and overs"" occurred, to identify which till had been used - let alone which employee was responsible; 
         
         
        vi) the applicant gave evidence that the till takings were consistently over some hundreds of dollars. This money was given to supervisors. The applicant said these monies were never accounted for. She presumed the supervisors simply kept the money. 
        
       
     169 On the other hand, the arguments put by Mr Schmitke include: 
      
       
        
        i) the evidence is that the applicant was the only employee who was at all times on duty on each, and every occasion, of unusual and multiple refunds of packaged beer; 
         
         
        ii) there was no evidence of packaged beer refunds at times when the applicant was not working, such as when she was on annual leave; 
         
         
        iii) the refund function, as demonstrated on an inspection of the Club, was not complicated. It was able to be accessed without too much knowledge or difficulty; 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        iv) the magistrate expressed his suspicions as to the applicant's involvement, but could not make a finding based on ""beyond reasonable doubt"". 
        
       
     170 In balancing these considerations, one question has loomed large in my thinking and was decisive to my ultimate conclusion of the matter. Were there any unusual transactions conducted when the applicant was not on duty? If there was, it would point to another person or persons acting, either independently or in concert with the applicant, to defraud the respondent. It seems to me the evidence is palpably clear. There were no unusual transactions when the applicant was not on duty. 171 Mr Acev turned my question around and argued that there were occasions when the applicant was on duty, when no unusual transactions occurred. Unfortunately for Mr Acev, this observation proves nothing. However, the answer to my question most certainly does.172 Mr Acev drew an analogy with the circumstances in this case to those identified by Harrison DP in Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union v Westport Bowling Club. In Westport, his Honour noted that the evidence disclosed that 45 per cent of the cash handling discrepancies could not be linked to the dismissed employee and that some other person/s were involved. His Honour could not find the allegations against the employee proven and reinstated her.173 In my opinion, Mr Acev's case is not assisted by reliance on Westport. The state of the evidence here is entirely distinguishable from that discussed in Westport. Here the applicant was the only common denominator in all the unusual transactions. No similar transactions occurred when she was not on duty which might point to the involvement of some other person/s.174 I have also had regard for the applicant's overall credibility. Her credibility must surely be questioned when one considers the ridiculous and implausible allegations made by her against other employees, including supervisors and work colleagues.175 One allegation was that other staff and supervisors were drinking and gambling on duty. This allegation is immediately suspect when it is considered in light of the applicant's own evidence. It was her evidence that she only raised the issue after learning that other employees would not support her claim of the daily cash overs being handed direct to the supervisors. In other words, it was nothing more than an unsubstantiated ""payback"".176 The applicant claimed that the supervisors were responsible for the missing money. The bistro staff may have been involved. Witnesses had lied to the police. 177 This allegation is bizarre. Logically, it must mean that a number of supervisors, many still employed by the Club, had acted in concert to defraud the Club. They all survived unscathed, both a criminal investigation and a criminal trial in which they gave evidence.178 I would apply the principle reductio ad absurdum to demonstrate the falsity of the applicant's premise by the absurdity of its conclusion.179 What I find even more extraordinary is that the applicant said she would have no trouble working with these employees who she has accused of being thieves and liars.180 I would make some further observations on the evidence.181 There was some rather confusing evidence concerning the applicant's knowledge of the refund function on the tills. At one point she said ""nothing was ever mentioned about refunds"" (T.p54). Shortly after, she said if a refund was to be given, approval was necessary from a supervisor. This evidence doesn't make sense.182 In any event, from my inspection of the till functions, I am convinced that it would not take very long at all for an enterprising employee (even by a process of trial and error), to work out how to use the refund function. I reject the applicant's evidence that she didn't know how to use the refund function and had never done so. 
     183 I readily acknowledge that Mr Acev successfully established that the employee time records and rosters (Ex""B"") were not accurate. I accept the evidence that the rosters were a guide and that the time records were filled in by the employees (sometimes long after) and not verified by management. However, the extent of the inaccuracies did not amount to incorrect shifts, but rather small variations in the times taken for breaks. Mr Miller's evidence was that the variations related to how busy the bar was at the time. He said the variations did not relate to start and finish times. I accept his evidence.184 It is a wide leap of logic to assume, as Mr Acev put, that the records prove the applicant was not on duty at the time. Indeed, there was no evidence that the applicant was somewhere, other than in the Club when the unusual transactions were conducted.185 I refer to one final matter on the state of the evidence which was somewhat unusual. Mr Kent gave no evidence in the proceedings. He is no longer employed by the respondent. He could not be contacted and apparently was not able to be located.186 It may be understood from Mr Vesperman's evidence that Mr Kent left the Club's employ on less than amicable terms. This may well explain the failure for him to be found. 187 There may have been some contested issues as to what was said by Mr Kent at particular meetings with the applicant. However, there were more than two people involved. What is plainly evident from the comprehensive documentation produced by Mr Schmitke is that the respondent's decision to dismiss the applicant was based primarily on the documentary evidence it had available to it.188 It seems to me to be an inescapable conclusion, on the balance of probabilities, that the allegations against the applicant are proven. It follows that the conduct of the applicant was demonstrably inconsistent with an employee's obligations to the employment relationship. Her actions amounted to a fundamental breach of her obligations to act with good faith and fidelity. See Day v Lumley Life, 90 IR 70; North v Television Corporation Ltd (1976) 11 ALR 599; Blyth Chemicals Ltd v Bushnell, 49 CLR 66, and my comments in Transport Workers' Union of Australia, New South Wales Branch, on behalf of Joseph Vallis, and TNT Australia Pty Limited t/as TNT Express [2002] NSWIRComm 46.189 In my opinion, dismissal of the applicant was, not only reasonably open to the respondent, but the only appropriate response in the circumstances.Procedural Fairness190 Mr Acev submitted that the applicant was denied both substantive and procedural fairness.191 I deal now with the principles in respect to procedural fairness192 It is obvious the expression ""procedural fairness"" does not appear anywhere in the statute. Nevertheless, the matters the Commission may take into account when determining an unfair dismissal claim are identified in s88 of the Act. These matters include, but are not limited to, whether: 
      
       
        
        i) a reason for dismissal was given; 
         
         
        ii) any reason given had a basis in fact; 
         
         
        iii) an applicant was given an opportunity to make out a defence or give an explanation of his or her behaviour; 
         
         
        iv) any warning of unsatisfactory performance was given; 
         
         
        v) the applicant sought, but was refused reinstatement or re-employment. 
        
       
     193 These matters are discretionary and the Commission may take other relevant matters into account (s88(f)).194 I would observe that in cases involving summary dismissal for misconduct, particularly of the gravity of the misconduct alleged here, it would be silly to suggest that warnings of unsatisfactory performance are necessary.195 However, a termination of employment, whether by summary dismissal or on notice, might still be held to be unfair if the process leading to the dismissal was manifestly deficient in offering the applicant procedural fairness (see Byrne & Anor v Australian Airlines; Burke v McGirr (1995) 87 IR 54; Oswald v NSW Police Service (1999) 90 IR 42; Johnson v Catholic Education Office, Diocese of Parramatta 87 IR 57; Abboud v The State of New South Wales (Department of School Education) (1999) 92 IR 32, Antonakopoulos v State Bank of New South Wales), Buckman v Burdekin 85 IR 418; Wilson v Department of Education and Training, 100 IR 1 and D & R Commercial Pty Ltd v Flood, 113 IR 344).196 It seems to me that it would be a rare case indeed which disclosed an absolutely faultless process - free of blemish or mistake. The usual highly charged atmosphere of a dismissal situation will guarantee a less than pristine process.197 I have no doubt, with the benefit of hindsight, that the dismissal of the applicant here might well have been better handled by the respondent. However, the faults in the process need to be balanced against the gravity of the allegations in the event they are proven.198 On this point, I refer to my comments in Foster and Woolworths Limited [2000] NSWIRComm 208: 
      
       
        
        … it is now well settled law that proven deficiencies in the process are not necessarily fatal to an employer's decision to summarily dismiss an employee. It is the seriousness of the allegations, if proven, which, in my view, will be decisive in establishing whether the employer's decision to dismiss the employee was reasonably open to it. 
         
        
       
     199 The appeal in Wang also considered the fairness of the process adopted by the employer in dismissing the employees. The employer in Wang had relied on the advice from the police and did not, it seems, conduct its own investigation by interviewing the employees or providing an opportunity for them to explain their actions or defend themselves.200 Notwithstanding this obvious denial of procedural fairness, the Full Bench, following the approach in Byrne v Australian Airlines, concluded that the seriousness of the misconduct was such that a lack of procedural fairness did not invalidate the employer's decision to dismiss the employees. See also Bigg v NSW Police Service, Rapp v Wauchope RSL Club, 81 IR 116 and Antonakopoulos v State Bank of New South Wales.201 The circumstances here, by contrast, reveal the respondent had conducted its own investigation, had interviewed the applicant in the presence of a union representative and provided her with an opportunity to defend herself against the allegation.202 True it is that there was no new evidence or information between the time the respondent visited the police in the afternoon of 7 April and when the applicant was dismissed the next day. However, in my opinion, at that stage the state of the respondent's investigation provided a sound and sufficient basis for the dismissal of the applicant.203 Mr Acev complained that certain documents requested by the Union had not been provided to the applicant during the investigation and despite assurances by Mr Vesperman that they would be provided. This constituted unfairness in Mr Acev's submission.204 In answering this submission, it seems to me that such documents need to be crucial to the capacity of the applicant to defend herself against the allegations raised and/or were such as to deny her the right to know exactly what was being alleged.205 In respect to the first matter, I can find no evidence that the applicant was denied documents which would have assisted her in defending herself against the allegations. 206 Secondly, there can be no doubt, in my view, that the applicant at all times knew what she was being accused of. 207 The evidence is that the applicant had been interviewed by the police three weeks before the 7 and 8 April 2000 meetings with the respondent. The applicant's own evidence reveals that the police had told her the issue concerned the refunds. She agreed that at the 7 April meeting she knew what the issue was (T.p44-45). The following extract from transcript demonstrates this belief (T.p46): 
      
       
       Q When you left the club on that occasion it was clear to you what the circumstances of the investigations were? 
        
       A Yes 
        
        
       Q And the reason as to why you were being suspended? 
        
       A It was like a jigsaw puzzle but I put the two together. 
       
     208 Clearly, the applicant was not told what the police had told the respondent. However, it cannot possibly be said that the applicant was ignorant of, or misinformed of what was being alleged against her. 209 The evidence is that, at all relevant times, the applicant was represented by her Union, or it acted on her behalf. The Union Secretary, Mrs Susan McGrath had ensured the applicant was suspended on pay when the applicant phoned her to complain about being suspended without pay.210 Further, the evidence was that the union delegate, Mr Ticehurst, attended disciplinary meetings with the applicant on 7 and 8 April 2000. The applicant was unsure if she had spoken to Mr Ticehurst before the first meeting. Mr Ticehurst said he hadn't spoken to her until the meeting. It seems that Mrs McGrath had organised Mr Ticehurst's attendance.211 As an aside, and upon which very little turns, I would observe that it is rather curious that a union delegate representing a member on a very serious disciplinary matter would make no contact with the member prior to a disciplinary meeting with the respondent.212 Mr Acev complained that the applicant was dismissed before the criminal charges were heard and determined.213 In my opinion, there is no legal or moral obligation on an employer to retain an employee on full pay until criminal charges are determined.214 Having regard for the usual time it takes to have criminal charges investigated, heard and determined, it would be unreasonable to expect an employer to retain a suspended employee on full pay until the process is completed. Moreover, the employer is entitled to conduct its own investigation and form its own view on the material it has available at the time. See Bi Lo Pty Ltd v Hooper at p229.215 Mr Acev also claimed that the respondent had not undertaken a full and thorough investigation because it did not interview other employees. The respondent was clearly acting on the request of the police not to discuss the investigation with other staff. Its hands were tied. However, in my opinion, the respondent had a sufficient basis to act as it did on the documentary evidence it had available at the time.216 Mr Acev complained that the respondent was in breach of the Club Employees (State) Award by suspending the applicant without pay. This was subsequently corrected after Mrs McGrath pointed out to Mr Kent that to do so was in breach of the award. While I accept there was a breach of the Award, the mistake was rectified. I cannot then see how a claim of procedural unfairness can be sustained.217 The Commission is well satisfied that none of the procedural issues identified by Mr Acev can either individually or collectively be regarded as grounds for a finding that the applicant's dismissal was ""harsh, unreasonable or unjust"". The gravity of the proven allegations against the applicant far outweigh any procedural deficiencies.CONCLUSIONS AND FINDINGS 
      
      1) The Commission is satisfied that the respondent has discharged its onus of proving the allegations against the applicant. 
       
       
      2) The Commission is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the applicant was responsible for falsely refunding packaged beer on numerous occasions over many months and that she kept the money involved in the transactions. 
       
       
      3) The explanations of the applicant in denying any involvement in the transactions and implicating others are not credible. Such evidence is rejected. 
       
       
      4) The conduct of the applicant was demonstrably inconsistent with an employee's obligations to the employment relationship. Her actions amounted to a fundamental breach of her obligations to act with good faith and fidelity.  
       
       
      5) Any flaws in the investigative process were inconsequential in comparison to the gravity of the applicant's misconduct. As a result, there was no denial of procedural fairness. 
       
       
      6) The Commission can find no grounds which would warrant intervention in the respondent's decision to dismiss the applicant. 
       
      
      
      7) Application IRC1852 of 2000 must be dismissed. 
       
       
      8) These proceedings are concluded.

     1 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Duc Hung Nguyen, pleaded guilty in the District Court to supplying a commercial quantity of heroin, an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act which carries a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment. He was sentenced to imprisonment for four years, to date from his arrest on 30 October 2000, with a non-parole period of three years. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
      
       
     2 Put briefly, on 30 October 2000 police seized some four hundred and twenty three grams of heroin at premises in Marrickville, following a surveillance operation. The applicant had attempted to dispose of some of the heroin down the kitchen sink, and his wife had tried to dispose of a block of heroin by flushing it down the toilet. In an electronically recorded interview, the applicant told the police that he had found that block of heroin in a plastic bag with a note which instructed him to deliver it, upon receipt of a phone call, in exchange for two thousand dollars. 
      
       
     3 The sentencing Judge said of the offence that it could not “be said to be the most serious of its type, if judged by quantity alone”. His Honour also noted a concession by the prosecution that the applicant’s “level of involvement was at the lower end of any drug operation…”. His Honour found that the applicant was remorseful and took into account his plea of guilty. The applicant was able to make out favourable subjective case, to which I shall turn in a moment. 
      
       
     4 As submissions were refined in this Court, no complaint was made about the sentence of four years. Argument was confined to the length of the non-parole period. It was said that his Honour failed to deal with a submission that there were special circumstances and there was material which called for such a finding. 
      
       
     5 The applicant was thirty-five years old at the time of the offence and is now thirty-seven. He was brought up in Vietnam but left that country in 1988, at the age of about twenty-three. He spent two years at a resettlement camp in Hong Kong before arriving in New Zealand in 1990. There he married in 1994 and there are three children of that marriage.  
      
       
     6 The family came to Australia in 2000, only a matter of months before the offence. At that time there were two children, aged two and four, and the applicant’s wife was pregnant with the third. He was unable to obtain employment and received limited social security benefits. Their financial position was exacerbated by his gambling losses, and the situation caused tension between him and his wife. It was in these circumstances that he became involved in the offence. He has no prior convictions. 
      
       
     7 Submissions on sentence before his Honour have been recorded in the transcript. It is apparent that counsel then appearing for the applicant (who did not appear in this court) argued that there were special circumstances in the light of his background and family situation. It is true that the argument was not put forcefully, counsel saying that “I’d only just get there if I’d get there at all…”. However that may be, in his remarks on sentence his Honour made no reference to the argument or, indeed, to the question of special circumstances at all.  
      
       
     8 I appreciate that the question whether there are special circumstances in any case is very much a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge and this Court would not likely interfere with the exercise of that discretion: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534, per Spigelman CJ at para 73. However, what concerns me in the present case is that his Honour was silent about the matter in his remarks even though it had been argued. Moreover, although the argument was put in a somewhat half hearted way, it had considerable merit. The applicant, a man of prior good character, was facing his first gaol term. He had only recently come to this country where, perhaps through his own fault, he found himself in financial and emotional difficulty. On the evidence before his Honour, one cannot say to what extent his relationship with his wife and family might have been compromised. If he is to remain in this country upon his release, I would expect that he would need supervision and guidance for an extended period to re-establish himself and to ensure that difficulties of a similar kind do not cause him to relapse into criminal activity. 
      
       
     9 In my view, this is one of those exceptional cases in which it can be said that the sentencing judge erred in failing to find special circumstances. For the purpose of re-sentence, we received some additional evidence, including a psychological report, which attests to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation but makes the desirability of an extended period of supervision even more apparent. I am aware that the non parole period itself should reflect the criminality of the offence and the need for deterrence: Simpson at paras 63-5, but I consider that the reduced non parole period which I propose would still serve those ends. 
      
       
     10 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would affirm the sentence of 4 years, to date from 30 October 2000, but I would quash the non parole period fixed by his Honour and substitute a non parole period of 2 years. The applicant would be eligible for release on parole on 30 October 2002. 
      
       
     11 ADAMS J: I agree.

      REGINA v Herbert TARU 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 LEVINE J: The Court is in a position to deliver judgment in this matter and I ask Hidden J to deliver the first judgment. 
      
       
     2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Herbert Taru, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of attempting to obtain possession of a trafficable quantity of cocaine which was reasonably suspected of having been imported. That is an offence under s 233B(1)(ca) of the Customs Act 1901 carrying a maximum sentence of twenty five years imprisonment. The sentence her Honour passed was imprisonment for four years and nine months, with a non-parole period of three years. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
      
       
     3 Shortly stated the facts are these: the applicant had obtained permission from the proprietors of a studio in Campbelltown to receive parcels there which he said would contain sheet music. On 19 October 2000 customs officers intercepted a courier satchel which was addressed to the studio to which I have referred. The satchel was seized and handed to Australian Federal Police. Upon examination it was found to contain 148.8 grams of cocaine of a relatively high purity. The pure amount was 101.8 grams. The police reconstructed the package, leaving a small amount of cocaine in it and sent it on its way, and it was delivered to the address to which it was directed. 
      
       
     4 On 24 October 2000 the applicant took possession of the satchel and in the early evening left the premises, carrying the package, and drove off in his car. He was under surveillance, of course, a fact of which he may have been aware because the manner in which he drove the car suggested he was attempting to evade surveillance. In the event, the police activated their lights, turned on the siren and the applicant made a fairly spirited attempt to escape from them by driving off the road. He lost control of the car and he was arrested. Shortly after his arrest he said to one of the police officers, “What you’re looking for is on the floor in the front of my own car wrapped in a black jacket.” Indeed, that was where the subject package was found. 
      
       
     5 The matter was listed for trial but the applicant pleaded guilty on the day of trial. The learned sentencing judge discounted the sentence otherwise appropriate by twenty five percent in recognition of the utilitarian value of that plea and also in recognition of the applicant’s remorse, which she accepted as genuine. 
      
       
     6 He was twenty four years old at the time of the offence and is now twenty five. He has a minor criminal record involving some drug offences, but they are of little or no significance for present purposes. He made a good subjective case. He has a supportive family. He was educated to higher school certificate standard and had a satisfactory employment record. 
      
       
     7 His father gave evidence from which it is apparent that the applicant is remorseful and had developed an insight into the seriousness of his offence by the time he stood for sentence. 
      
       
     8 While he made no admissions to the police, he did admit his involvement to his father and, indeed, named at least one of the persons to whom the package was to be delivered. 
      
       
     9 Her Honour characterised the applicant’s role as being a collector of the drugs. The Crown conceded, and her Honour accepted, that his involvement was to accept delivery of a parcel and pass it onto its ultimate recipient or recipients. 
      
       
     10 In written submissions for the purpose of the present application, Ms Francis of counsel argued that the sentence in fact passed by her Honour failed adequately to reflect the various favourable subjective matters to which I have referred and, in particular, was inadequate to reflect the applicant’s limited role in this importation. In oral argument this morning Ms Francis developed her submission as to the significance of the applicant’s limited role, relying otherwise on her written submissions in relation to the other matters agitated. 
      
       
     11 Her Honour acceded to the Crown submission that the applicant’s role was analogous to that of a courier or a person low in the hierarchy of an importation. It was to that category of offender that this Court referred when it set various guidelines in respect of offences under s 233B in R v Wong & Leung (1999) 48 NSWLR 340. 
      
       
     12 Those guidelines remain useful notwithstanding the subsequent High Court decision arising from that case, because they were expressed to be based on the existing pattern of sentence at the time that the judgment was delivered. Indeed, much of the judgment of the chief Justice was devoted to consideration of other cases and the pattern of sentence which emerged from them. That being so, notwithstanding the High Court decision, it remains fair to say that the range for offences involving low level trafficable quantities, as this case does, for offenders properly classified as couriers or persons low in the hierarchy of the importing organisation is of the order of five to seven years imprisonment. 
      
       
     13 Ms Francis this morning supplied Judicial Commission figures relating to sentences for offences under s 233B involving trafficable quantities of cocaine. Those figures, I must say, do not appear to be inconsistent with the range enunciated in Wong and Leung. 
      
       
     14 It seems to me it is appropriate to analogise the role of this applicant to that of a courier or a person low in the hierarchy of the organisation. Whilst his role was in one sense limited to the delivery of the parcel of its intended recipient, it must be remembered that it was he who arranged the premises at which the parcel was to be received. 
      
       
     15 That being so, it does not appear to me that the sentence passed by her Honour of four years nine months can be said to be manifestly excessive, even allowing for the favourable subjective factors to which Ms Francis has taken us this morning. It is not a lenient sentence, I must say, but it is not one which could be said to be outside the range properly available to her Honour in the exercise of her undoubted discretion. 
      
       
     16 The matter was certainly worthy of argument and I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
      
       
     17 LEVINE J: I agree with the remarks of Hidden J 
      
       
     18 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
      
       
     19 LEVINE J: The orders will be as proposed by Hidden J.

     Tort – negligence – duty of care – existence and scope of duty – whether council owed plaintiff a duty of care to ensure pavement in a safe condition – nonfeasanceLocal government – councils – liability in tort – nonfeasance – relevance of budgetary allocation for pavement repairs to assessment of breach of any duty of careThe plaintiff was injured when she tripped and fell on an irregular paved concrete surface in the vicinity of a school which she had just visited. The relevant surface was a junction between a footpath and a driveway. The concrete surface contained cracks and holes of various sizes, and some differences in height between its various portions. The plaintiff alleged that she tripped when her foot caught in a hole present in a crack between portions of the concrete surface. The trial judge found that the council owed the plaintiff a duty of care to ensure that the pavement was in a safe condition, that that duty had been breached, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff.The defendant sought leave to appeal against the finding of liability.Held (Heydon JA, Handley and Sheller JJA agreeing), granting leave to appeal and allowing the appeal, 
      
       
       As to existence of a duty of care: 
       
     1. Whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff depended on whether there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to a pedestrian exercising reasonable care for her own safety, bearing in mind the particular advantages of pedestrians: [29], [53]-[60].  
      
       
        
        Brodie v Singleton Shire Council; Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council 
         (2001) 206 CLR 512;  
        Parramatta City Council v Watkins  
        [2001] NSWCA 364;  
        Lombardi v Holroyd City Council  
        [2002] NSWCA 252, applied. 
        
       
     2. In determining the existence of the duty of care the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were not obliged to accept expert evidence in support of the conclusion that the footpath was “unsafe” and posed “a danger”. That opinion was not supported by the plaintiff’s evidence, nor by the expert’s expertise, which related to the behaviour of pedestrians in environments radically different from the environment in which the plaintiff moved: [43], [48], [52]. 
      
      As to the scope of the duty of care: 
     3. There was a foreseeable risk of injury here, but it was not a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to pedestrians using reasonable care for their own safety. The plaintiff, like pedestrians generally, was in an excellent position to see and avoid imperfections in the surface. There could have been no expectation on her part that the surface would be smooth. The unevenness in the paving slabs, the cracks and the holes at the place where the plaintiff was moving were as obvious as similar features all over the country, and as obvious as other common features like raised tree roots and manhole covers. There was no concealment of any of the features of the site which the trial judge criticised. There was no inadequacy in the lighting, or obscuring of the hazard by grass or otherwise. It was reasonable to expect the plaintiff to have seen what lay ahead of her as she walked along in broad daylight: what was there was obvious and called for no special vigilance: [54]. 
      
       
        
        Brodie v Singleton Shire Council; Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council 
         (2001) 206 CLR 512;

        Lombardi v Holroyd City Council  
        [2002] NSWCA 252, applied. 
        
       
     4. The conditions of the site were so obvious and so typical of those commonly to be encountered in daily life that the defendant was not under any duty to undertake inspections to identify them. Even if the defendant had become aware of the particular conditions of the site, it had no duty to alter them in view of their obviousness: [59].

       1. Leave to appeal is granted.  
        
        
       2. The appeal is allowed. 
        
        
       3. The orders of the trial judge are set aside. 
        
        
       4. In lieu of the orders of the trial judge, the Statement of Claim is dismissed. 
        
        
       5. The respondent is to pay the appellant’s costs of the trial and of the appeal.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 HANDLEY JA: I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
     2 SHELLER JA: I agree with Heydon JA. 
      
       
     3 HEYDON JA: This is an application by an unsuccessful defendant for leave to appeal against a verdict in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of $68,376.50 with costs, ordered by Blanch J on 5 December 2001. This Court received full argument to the intent that if leave were granted, the appeal could be disposed of without the need for a separate hearing. 
      
       
     4 On 19 June 1997, the plaintiff, then aged 62, attended a function at Casino High School, her granddaughter’s school. As she was leaving with her daughter, she left the grassed school grounds through a gap in a fence, moved onto a footpath outside the school, fell, and seriously injured her knee. The accident took place in the middle of the day, at about 1.20 pm, in broad daylight. The plaintiff had only used that footpath on a couple of earlier occasions.  
      
       
     5 The plaintiff’s case at trial was that the defendant was in breach of its duty of care in failing to keep the footpath in a safe condition. 
      
       
     6 The trial judge accepted that the plaintiff was telling the truth to the best of her ability. He found that the toe of the shoe on her left foot went into a “crack, gap or hole” in the concrete of the path, her foot caught in it, and she fell onto her left knee.  
      
       
     7 The trial judge described the area as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “The hole or crack appears from the photographs to be in a section across the footpath where the footpath has been graded down to the asphalt surface of the road so as to provide a drive-in over the gutter. That appears to have been done in a way that is not the usual way for such a driveway to be constructed in that it is not incorporated in the ordinary way into the footpath, but rather the level of the footpath has remained constant. The driveway has been constructed by grading the area that would otherwise be the footpath into a slope and the area between the slope and the footpath has been filled in by what has been described as a fillet. What it amounts to is another V shaped gradient made of concrete. 
         
        
        
         
         The crack or hole that is in question in this case is the crack or hole at the top of that fillet where the fillet joins the footpath.” 
         
        
       
     8 The trial judge then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The defendant has photographed and made measurements along the fillet and has measured the depth of various cracks along that fillet. According to the defendant’s calculations there is one hole or crack which is 15 millimetres deep, another that is 10 millimetres deep, another which is 8 and then another 3 millimetres. The depth of those cracks tends to reduce to nil travelling from the gutter across to the grass on the other side of the footpath. 
         
        
        
         
         The plaintiff’s evidence would support the proposition that it was the largest hole, 15 millimetres deep, which caused her to come to grief. The defendant argues that by looking at the diagram and photograph prepared by the defence that it appears to be the situation that she fell in the crack that was 8 millimetres deep.” 
         
        
        
       The trial judge rejected the latter contention. 
        
       
     9 The trial judge then discussed the evidence given by two experts called on behalf of the plaintiff, and said that the location involved “an extra danger” in the combination of the “trip lip” and the elevation.  
      
       
     10 The trial judge then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “the plaintiff fell because her foot went into a crack or hole that was in the order of 15 millimetres deep and that imperfection in the footpath was of such a kind and in such a place that it was not readily visible to her and the combination of the imperfection and the place where it was does amount to a breach of duty of care on the part of the defendant.” 
         
        
       
     11 The significance of the finding that the crack or hole was “not readily visible to the plaintiff” may be affected by the next passage in the reasons for judgment, where the trial judge found that, readily visible or not, the “crack” was seen by her: 
      
       
        
         
         “The plaintiff said that she was taking ordinary care in walking along. She saw the crack, she saw the footpath and there is nothing in her actions which I can see that could lead to any finding of contributory negligence on her part.” 
         
        
       
     12 The trial judge then turned to the defendant’s capacity to have averted the accident: 
      
       
        
         
         “Insofar as the state of the footpath is concerned and council’s knowledge of it and attitude towards it, it appears that the council officer who gave evidence was familiar in general terms with the footpath and the area outside the school. It was acknowledged to be a high traffic area and the council’s attitude towards such matters is apparently that in the longer term it is better to replace footpaths than to repair them and the council officer has also given evidence that in respect of this particular area it is not one that he would organise to be repaired because he does not regard the danger as great enough to warrant that degree of priority being given to repairs here.  
         
        
        
         
         Insofar as the costs argument is concerned there has been tendered the annual report of Casino Council, as it then was, for 1996/1997. A case was sought to be made by the defendant on the basis that only some ten thousand dollars was available for the purpose of repair of this nature. It appears however that from the Expenses and Revenue Account of the council in fact during that particular period for transport and communications under which head repair of footpath comes there was in fact an expenditure of almost three million dollars and it appears that at the end of the financial year the council found itself having a very small surplus. The short point is that how much is available for road repair is a matter for the council in prioritising its budget. Quite obviously in a budget of over ten million dollars it was possible to make a significantly larger sum than ten thousand dollars available for repair of footpaths. On that basis the plaintiff should not be denied a verdict because of the likely public cost of making safe what might be a hazard. 
         
        
        
         
         The council officer who gave evidence also said that a very rough estimate of how much it would cost to make all the footpaths safe would be fifty thousand dollars. He then wanted to resile from that because it is too difficult an estimate to make but obviously as a very, very broad figure it is an amount of money that is well and truly within the capacity of the council to meet if the council saw fit to do it. The suggestion for repair was firstly filling the hole although the council officer was of the view that grinding back the protruding parts would be a better solution. The council has the machinery to do that.” 
         
        
        
       Did the plaintiff fall at the deepest hole, 15 mm deep? 
        
       
     13 It is convenient first to clear one factual challenge out of the way. 
      
       
     14 The defendant argued to this Court that the trial judge erred in finding that the crack in which the plaintiff’s shoe caught was 15 mm deep rather than 3 or 8 mm deep. It said that a comparison of one photograph (in exhibit A) with another (in exhibit 2) revealed that the relevant crack was between or near points marked 4 and 5 on the exhibit 2 photograph (at which points the depths were 8 mm and 3 mm respectively). On exhibit 2 Mr Radnidge, who at the time of the accident was Technical Services Manager of the defendant, marked numbers indicating the height discrepancy between the fillet to the adjacent footpath slab. Points 2, 3, 4 and 5 were 10, 15, 8 and 3 mm high respectively. The defendant also submitted that Mr Radnidge was not cross-examined by the plaintiff to suggest that the truth was different from what a visual impression of the photographs supported, and a reference was given to page 51 line 55-page 52 line 30 of the transcript.  
      
       
     15 The points marked in exhibit 2 are not marked in exhibit A, and thus it is not easy to draw any conclusion supportive of the defendant’s contention by mere comparison of the photographs. But even if mere comparison offered some support for the defendant’s contention, it is not correct to say that there was no cross-examination of Mr Radnidge on the point. Immediately after the passage of cross-examination identified above by the defendant, the following appears at page 52, lines 30-49 of the transcript: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. I show you again Exhibit 2, that’s the photograph you say you took? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And I show you part of Exhibit A, photograph number 4, see that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Just looking at photograph number 4 and the photograph you’ve taken, the position you’ve got .3, I withdraw that. Looking at where you have marked number 3 on your photograph Exhibit 2, see that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That would appear to coincide with the area where the arrow as pointing in Exhibit A photograph 4 would it not? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It’s very difficult on the photograph but in the distance back across this way it would appear to be approximately a metre, yes.” 
         
        
        
       That is not merely cross-examination of Mr Radnidge on the point. It is cross-examination which caused him to concede that the point marked 3 on exhibit 2 corresponded with where an arrow pointed in exhibit A. It was common ground that the arrow in exhibit A pointed to where the plaintiff fell. At the point numbered 3 the depth was 15 mm. Mr Radnidge thus made a concession amply supporting the trial judge’s finding.  
        
       
     16 The defendant also criticised the trial judge for not giving reasons: 
      
       
        
       (a) for his conclusion that the depth of the relevant hole was 15 mm, and 
        
        
       (b) for rejecting Mr Radnidge’s evidence that the depth was 3 or 8 mm.  
        
        
       Even if criticism (a) is strictly speaking correct, the criticism goes nowhere because the conclusion was plainly correct on the evidence of Mr Radnidge, a witness called by the defendant. Criticism (b) is not correct because Mr Radnidge did not give evidence that the depth was 3 or 8 mm; rather he gave evidence that the depth was 15 mm.  
        
       
     17 The defendant also said that the trial judge’s finding could not be supported by the experts, who assumed a 15 mm depth rather than proving it. In view of what has been said above, these criticisms do not matter. The experts certainly do not point against Mr Radnidge’s concession.  
      
       
        
       What finding did the trial judge make about what the plaintiff saw? 
        
       
     18 Considerable attention was devoted to that part of the trial judge’s reasons for judgment in which he said that though the hole was not readily visible to the plaintiff, she “saw the crack, she saw the footpath … .” On one reading of the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge, the finding that the plaintiff saw the “crack” entailed a finding that she saw the depth of the crack. Counsel for the plaintiff, however, argued that the trial judge’s finding was only that what the plaintiff saw was the “crack” – the dividing line between the pavers – but not the “hole” or “gap” between them. He accepted that there was an ambiguity in the trial judge’s language, but that it could be explained by reference to the fact that the judgment was delivered ex tempore, and resolved by a reading of the whole judgment. This particular argument fails. The trial judge appeared to use the words “hole”, “crack” and “gap” indifferently throughout his judgment. He said that the plaintiff’s foot was caught “in what has variously been described as a crack, gap or hole – the plaintiff described it as a hole.” He then spoke of a “hole or crack”, a “crack or hole” (three times), various “cracks”, various “holes or cracks”, which he called “those cracks”; he then referred to a “hole” and a “crack”. Just before the trial judge made the finding that the plaintiff saw the “crack” he said her foot went into a “crack or hole”. Further, the photographs appear to show the existence of both the crack and the various height differentials. 
      
       
     19 However, much of the plaintiff’s evidence was to the effect that before she fell she saw only the crack, not the hole.  
      
       
     20 In chief she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you observe the footpath in front of you as you walked? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was looking where I was walking. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you observe at the time or immediately prior to your fall, the hole that your foot went in to? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I saw it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When was that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. When I was walking down to the car my foot went in the hole. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And then you saw it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That’s the first you saw of it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. That’s right.” 
         
        
       
     21 In cross-examination she said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And you noticed the cracks between the different slabs of concrete in the footpath at that time, that is when you were walking to the high school? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t look when I was walking to the high school, because I was on the footpath when I was walking up to the high school. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes, but when you were walking along the footpath you noticed the cracks in the slabs or between the slabs? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t notice that? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But when you were walking back you said you were looking where you were walking and no doubt you saw the cracks in the footpath? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Once I put my foot in the hole. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Isn’t it the case that when Mr Radburn asked you ‘did you observe the hole’, you said ‘I saw it’, that’s correct isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you saw it before you stepped into it, isn’t that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No.” 
         
        
       
     22 The plaintiff was then shown exhibit A photograph 4 which contained an arrow which she identified as marking the point at which she fell. The evidence proceeded: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. And you said you were looking where you were going, that’s correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you would’ve seen – well firstly I show his Honour and my friend, that line or division between the cement slabs in the footpath? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I would have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you would have seen that line or division between the slabs of concrete? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I would have.” 
         
        
       
     23 The plaintiff was then asked questions about what the trial judge called the “drive-in over the gutter” or “driveway”: the cross-examiner called it the “vehicle crossing”. 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Mrs Standing you knew you were on a vehicle crossing at some point of time when returning to your car, that’s correct isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you knew that you had walked down one slight rise and were going to go up another slight rise to return to the footpath proper? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I’m not sure, I can’t remember walking down it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you remember stepping up do you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. So you saw the rise and you stepped up over the rise or that’s what your intention was, is that correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you saw as you said that crack or division between the concrete slabs above that rise, is that right?  
         
        
        
         
         A. When I tripped in it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mrs Standing you saw – I’m showing you here from the Bar Table, tell me if you can’t see it, would you prefer me to show you the photograph up close? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Mm, yes please. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you were returning to your car Mrs Standing, you knew that that was a rise didn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you saw it? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Well I would have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you saw that crack dividing the rise from that footpath slab? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But you nevertheless stepped as you say, on that crack with your left foot, you stepped on the crack with your left foot? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION 
         
        
        
         
         WITNESS: I didn’t step on it. 
         
        
        
         
         [COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT]: Q. Did you step on the rise? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Where did you place your left foot in relation to that rise? 
         
        
        
         
         A. In the hole. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you say your toe went in the hole? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Is it the case that you say, did you know you were putting your toe in the hole or do you say you didn’t know that until after you fell? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I didn’t know that until after I fell.” 
         
        
       
     24 The ultimate effect of that evidence was that the plaintiff agreed that she saw the crack, but said that she did not appreciate she was putting her foot into a hole until after she had fallen. 
      
       
     25 At the outset the trial judge made favourable findings about the plaintiff’s credibility. When he made the finding that she saw the crack, he did not qualify those early favourable findings in any way. Despite the ambiguity of the trial judge’s language, and the strong support in that language as a whole for the conclusion that the word “crack” included the word “hole”, it is unreasonable to conclude that the trial judge meant by saying that the plaintiff saw the crack that she also saw the hole. It is unreasonable because she denied that and the trial judge apparently accepted that denial.  
      
       
        
        
       The law as stated in  
       Brodie v Singleton Shire Council 
        
       
     26 It is convenient to collect some key points made by the High Court in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council and the case argued and decided with it, Ghantous v Hawkesbury City Council:  (2001) 206 CLR 512. Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said at [150] that persons in the position of the defendant having statutory powers to design or construct roads or carry out works or repairs on them: 
      
       
        
         
         “are obliged to take reasonable care that their exercise of or failure to exercise those powers does not create a foreseeable risk of harm to a class of persons (road users) which includes the plaintiff. Where the state of a roadway, whether from design, construction, works or non-repair, poses a risk to that class of persons, then, to discharge its duty of care, an authority with power to remedy the risk is obliged to take reasonable steps by the exercise of its powers within a reasonable time to address the risk. If the risk be unknown to the authority or latent and only discoverable by inspection, then to discharge its duty of care an authority having power to inspect is obliged to take reasonable steps to ascertain the existence of latent dangers which might reasonably be suspected to exist.” 
         
        
        
       They said that questions of breach depended on the following test (at [151]): 
        
        
         
         “The perception of the response by the authority calls for, to adapt the statement by Mason J in  
         Wyong Shire Council v Shirt 
          [(1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48], a consideration of various matters; in particular, the magnitude of the risk and the degree of probability that it will occur, the expense, difficulty and inconvenience to the authority in taking the steps described above to alleviate the danger, and any other competing or conflicting responsibility or commitments of the authority. The duty does not extend to ensuring the safety of road users in all circumstances. In the application of principle, much thus will turn upon the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence in each particular case.” 
         
        
        
       They then said at [160] and [162]-[163]: 
        
        
         
         “In dealing with questions of breach of duty, while there is to be taken into account as a ‘variable factor’ the results of ‘inadvertence’ and ‘thoughtlessness’ [ 
         Smith v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd 
          (1957) 97 CLR 337 at 343], a proper starting point may be the proposition that the persons using the road will themselves take ordinary care [ 
         Miller v McKeon 
          (1905) 3  
          
         CLR 50 at 60].  
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The formulation of the duty of care includes consideration of competing or conflicting responsibilities of the authority. In the circumstances of a given case, it may be shown that it was reasonable for an authority to deal in a particular priority with repairs in various locations. The resources available to a road authority, including the availability of matériel and skilled labour, may dictate the pace at which repairs may be made and affect the order of priority in which they are to be made. It may be reasonable in the circumstances not to perform repairs at a certain site until a certain date, or to perform them after more pressing dangers are first addressed. Even so, it may well be reasonable for the authority to exercise other powers including, for example, by erecting warning signs, by restricting road usage or, in extreme cases, by closing the road in question. 
         
        
        
         
         The formulation of the duty in terms which require that a road be safe not in all circumstances but for users exercising reasonable care for their own safety is even more important where, as in  
         Ghantous 
         , the plaintiff was a pedestrian. In general, such persons are more able to see and avoid imperfections in a road surface. It is the nature of walking in the outdoors that the ground may not be as even, flat or smooth as other surfaces. As Callinan J points out in his reasons in  
         Ghantous 
         , persons ordinarily will be expected to exercise sufficient care by looking where they are going and perceiving and avoiding obvious hazards, such as uneven paving stones, tree roots or holes. Of course, some allowance must be made for inadvertence. Certain dangers may not readily be perceived because of inadequate lighting or the nature of the danger (as in  
         Webb v South Australia  
         [(1982) 56 ALJR 912; 43 ALR 465]), or the surrounding area (as in  
         Buckle 
          [(1936) 57 CLR 259 at 266], where the hole was concealed by grass). In such circumstances, there may be a foreseeable risk of harm even to persons taking reasonable care for their own safety. These hazards will include dangers in the nature of a ‘trap’ or, as Jordan CJ put it, ‘of a kind calling for some protection or warning’ [ 
         Searle v Metropolitan Water, Sewerage and Drainage Board 
          (1936) 13 LGR 115 at 117]. In  
         Romeo 
         , Toohey and Gummow JJ noted in a different context that the care to be expected of members of the public is related to the obviousness of the danger [ 
         Romeo 
          (1998) 192 CLR 431 at 455 [52]]. Kirby J pointed out in the same case that even an occupier of premises ‘is generally entitled to assume that most entrants will take reasonable care for their own safety’ [ 
         Romeo 
          (1998) 192 CLR 431 at 478 [123]]. Each case will, of course, turn on its own facts.” 
         
        
       
     27 Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ decided that the non-feasance immunity existing at common law should be abolished, and Kirby J reached the same conclusion. Though Gleeson CJ and Callinan J disagreed with the abolition of the non-feasance immunity, they each said important things about when pedestrians might recover in relation to the condition of footpaths, and what they said is as applicable to non-feasance cases as it is to misfeasance cases. At [355] Callinan J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “Even if I were to assume that an action in negligence lay against the respondent for any failure to maintain or improve the footpath to keep or make it safe, whether as a matter of misfeasance or otherwise, I would conclude that there was no failure in that regard because the footpath was not, despite what the expert witness was allowed to say, unsafe. The case of the applicant in negligence was that a differential in height between the concreted part of the footpath and the earthen part of it created a dangerous situation. A court is not obliged to accept an expert, especially when his or her evidence is evidence purportedly resolving and concluding an issue of the kind which arose here [ 
         Naxakis v Western General Hospital 
          (1999) 197 CLR 269 at 306 [110], fn 137]. A court is not bound to accept that a matter of ordinary observation such as the readily apparent state of the footpath is a matter calling for expert opinion. But in any event the expert’s opinion (uncontradicted as it was) did not go so far as to say that the ‘poor maintenance’ which caused the ‘hazard’ actually caused one of such a nature that to leave it unrectified was negligent. There was no concealment of the difference in height. It was plain to be seen. The world is not a level playing field. It is not unreasonable to expect that people will see in broad daylight what lies ahead of them in the ordinary course as they walk along. No special vigilance is required for this. The applicant herself admitted in cross-examination that she knew before the day of the accident that the earthen surface was lower than the concrete surface. The photographs tendered at the trial clearly show that there was a discernible difference between the kerb and the earthen verges. There was no negligence on the part of the respondent either in the construction of the footpath or in not keeping the concrete strip and verges level.”  
         
        
       
     28 At [6] Gleeson CJ, after noting that the non-feasance immunity was abolished in England by statute in 1961, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “when general principles of negligence, unqualified by any rule of immunity, were applied, the courts insisted that an injured plaintiff had to show that the road or footpath was dangerous. That did not mean merely that it could possibly be an occasion of harm. The fact that there was unevenness of a kind which could result in a person stumbling or falling would not suffice. Not all footpaths are perfectly level. Many footpaths are unpaved. People are regularly required to walk on uneven surfaces on both public and private land.” 
         
        
        
       At [7] he approvingly quoted Cumming-Bruce J in  
       Littler v Liverpool Corporation 
        [1968] 2 All ER 343 at 345: 
        
        
         
         “Uneven surfaces and differences in level between flagstones of about an inch may cause a pedestrian temporarily off balance to trip and stumble, but such characteristics have to be accepted. A highway is not to be criticised by the standards of a bowling green.” 
         
        
        
       The law applied to the facts: duty of care 
        
       
     29 The first question is whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. That turns on whether the failure of the defendant to repair the footpath created a “foreseeable risk of harm” to pedestrians. That expression appears to be a reference to a reasonably foreseeable risk, since at [161] in Brodie v Singleton Shire Council Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said: “Not all failures to repair will create risks to the users of a road, or at least not risks which would, as a matter of the reasonably foreseeable, pose a risk of injury.” The existence of a duty must be assessed in part by reference not to any requirement that the footpath “be safe … in all circumstances”, but by reference to the position of “users exercising reasonable care for their own safety” (at [163]). This was said to be particularly important in relation to pedestrians. The question is whether there was a reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to a pedestrian exercising reasonable care for her own safety, bearing in mind the particular advantages of pedestrians. The issue of the capacity of the defendant to deal with particular risks and the competition between claims on scarce resources is not specifically relevant to the question of the scope of duty, but to the question of its breach.  
      
       
     30 It is not entirely clear why the trial judge found that there was a duty of care. He appears to have held that there was a duty, and that it was breached, because the 15 mm hole was “not readily visible” to the plaintiff and because of its location at the top of an elevation. Though the trial judge summarised the expert evidence of both Dr Adams and Mr Moir, or at least aspects of it, at some length, he appeared to have based few conclusions on it. From Dr Adams’ report he appeared to infer that the footpath was “unsafe” and “would pose a danger” to the plaintiff. It is not clear whether he agreed with Dr Adams’ view that the broken condition of the concrete at the edge of the driveway was a “significant trip hazard”. The trial judge’s statement of his perception that there was significance in the location of the trip lip at the top of an elevation appears after discussing Mr Moir’s evidence.  
      
       
     31 In Ghantous v Hawkesbury Shire Council there was expert evidence summarised thus by Callinan J at [348]: 
      
       
        
         
         “An expert called by the respondent at the trial gave evidence that it was poor maintenance to allow the surfaces alongside the concrete strip to deteriorate to the extent to which they had, and that in their current condition they were a hazard to a person stepping, as the applicant did, to one side.” 
         
        
        
       As was seen in [25] above, Callinan J, whose reasoning was concurred in by the other judges, at [355] rejected the conclusiveness and indeed the admissibility of this evidence.  
        
       
     32 The transcript of the trial in this case records the following near the close of the plaintiff’s case: 
      
       
        
         
         “REPORTS OF DR ADAMS AND MR MOIR TENDERED. OBJECTION. RELEVANCE (ASSUMPTIONS). OBJECTION CONTINUED. 
         
        
        
         
         EXHIBIT #D AMENDED REPORTS OF DR ADAMS AND MR MOIR TENDERED, ADMITTED AFTER OBJECTION.” 
         
        
        
       The defendant’s objection was not surprising, but the trial judge’s rulings admitting the evidence were not the subject of any ground of appeal or submission to this Court. The plaintiff relied strongly on various parts of the experts’ reports, which were not the subject of either cross-examination or contradiction, in this Court.  
        
       
     33 The question is whether the trial judge was or this Court is obliged to accept the evidence of Dr Adams which led the trial judge to say that the footpath was “unsafe” and posing “a danger”, or any other expert evidence to support the trial judge’s conclusions. 
      
       
     34 Before examining that question, it is necessary to consider what use can be made of certain photographs taken by Dr Adams when he visited the site in the company of the plaintiff on 20 March 1999, nearly two years after the accident on 19 June 1997. Those photographs were reproduced in his report of 30 March 1999, and comprised exhibit A. On the face of it the photographs give a useful impression of the scene both generally and in relation to the obviousness or otherwise of particular features such as cracking and the existence of the hole in which the plaintiff tripped. Counsel for the plaintiff objected to this Court relying on the photographs for the latter purpose, on the ground that they were taken merely to illustrate and depict the scene and had been taken for the forensic purpose of highlighting the hazard. But they were taken on behalf of the plaintiff, they were relied on extensively by both experts in their strongly worded attacks on the defendant, the plaintiff accepted that the hole in which she fell, photographed on 20 March 1999, “looked the same” as it did on the day she fell, the plaintiff gave her evidence of what happened on the day she fell by detailed reference to the photographs taken on 20 March 1999, the plaintiff accepted that the photograph of the hole revealed that the path as so photographed “looks very much like the path [she] looked at on the day of the accident”, the experts (relying on inferences which their expertise permitted them to draw from the construction and other features of the site) treated the photographs as a sound representation of the scene on the day of the accident, and the trial judge concluded that they were a sound representation of the scene on the day of the accident. Accordingly it is appropriate to take the photographs into account in evaluating the reasoning of both the experts and the trial judge.  
      
       
     35 The trial judge said: “There is much in Dr Adams’ report that establishes very little”, a mild but entirely justified observation. Dr Adams called the hole a “trip hazard” at points in his report well before he endeavoured to demonstrate that it was. At one point he said that two of the most common circumstances in which a trip and fall could occur were: 
      
       
        
         
         “(i) When the trailing foot is swinging forward and the toe or heel of that swinging foot encounters a vertical face which obstructs its forward movement. In that situation the person may lose balance and fall forward or may be able to lift the swinging foot, despite its having been obstructed, and bring the foot forward quickly enough to avoid an outright fall. Such a trip may result in no more than a minor interruption to the rhythm of movement. It may result in a stumble and recovery or it may result in an outright fall.  
         
        
        
         
         (ii) The other most common cause of a trip occurs when the trailing foot is trapped at the location at which it had come down at the conclusion of the preceding pace. As the person begins to bring that foot forward its entrapment prevents its movement and unless the person can either skip forward on the leading foot which was supporting most of the weight or is able to free the trapped foot then a forward fall of some kind is almost inevitable. One possible outcome is similar to that experienced by Mrs Standing where the entrapment of the trailing foot as the person’s body continues to move forward causes them to drop to the knee of that trailing foot. It is by no means uncommon when a trip or slip results in the person dropping to one knee for the patella of that knee to be fractured.” 
         
        
       
     36 The trial judge made no finding about which, if any, of these two possibilities applied. The plaintiff’s evidence did not permit any finding. All she said was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. When you say you tripped, do you remember where your right foot was in relation to your left foot, where was your right foot when your left foot went into the hole as you say? 
         
        
        
         
         A. It would’ve been in the air. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you recall or are you just guessing? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I don’t know. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You don’t know? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did your right foot – did you attempt to – did you stumble after you say you tripped? 
         
        
        
         
         A. No, I just went down.” 
         
        
        
       There was a degree of argument in the course of the oral hearing of the appeal about precisely how the plaintiff came to fall, but it cast no greater light on the subject than was cast by her evidence.  
        
       
     37 Dr Adams said, in relation to “cognitive ergonomics”: 
      
       
        
         
         “I understand that Mrs Standing had no particular knowledge of or familiarity with that driveway or the condition of the join between the edge of the driveway and the footpath. When she had entered the school she had, of course, been walking in the opposite direction and the trip hazard was not evident or noticeable. She had no basis for expecting that there was a trip hazard at that location and hence was not prepared for or aware of the fact that she might need to exercise greater care as she crossed that driveway.” 
         
        
       
     38 Dr Adams said, in relation to “perceptual ergonomics”: 
      
       
        
         
         “As Mrs Standing was walking down the footpath her visual attention was directed further down the footpath towards the location where the vehicle was parked. In common with most people when walking through the built environment Mrs Standing was not giving close direct visual attention to the pavement immediately in front of her feet. 
         
        
        
         
         Normally, as people move through the built environment they do not give close regard to the pedestrian surface in front of their feet. Commonly, as we enter a new area we make a general visual scan of the terrain ahead, locating any significant obstacles or hazards as well as determining the position of our goals or objectives in that particular area. Thereafter, we tend to direct our visual attention to items of particular interest such as displays in shop windows, or to other pedestrians or even vehicles that may have to be avoided. I base this comment about ‘normal’ human pedestrian behaviour on my detailed observation and analysis of some 25,000 episodes of pedestrian movement. These were video taped for analysis in the course of consultancy research carried out for City Rail in respect of pedestrian movement over stairways and concourses in the underground railway system of the city. 
         
        
        
         
         On the basis of the foregoing I can fully appreciate that Mrs Standing would neither have been aware of nor noticed the trip hazard at the edge of the driveway until she actually tripped and fell because of it.” 
         
        
       
     39 Dr Adams then said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The broken condition of the concrete pavement at the edge of the driveway and as shown in several of my photographs does constitute a significant trip hazard. It does appear that the broken condition of the concrete, particularly along the join between the paving of the footpath and the side of the ramp, may be a consequence of the passage of vehicles over that concrete and the adjacent surfaces. … Whatever the cause of that condition, it is quite obvious that it now has produced a significant trip hazard.” 
         
        
       
     40 The reasoning appears to be that the hole in the crack was a trip hazard because if the plaintiff did not see it she was capable of tripping on it, and she did not see it.  
      
       
     41 Dr Adams’ explanation for the failure of the plaintiff to see the hole, even though it was there to be seen, rested on two propositions: first, that she was not looking at the pavement immediately before her, but further on; secondly, that pedestrians commonly do not look at the pedestrian surface in front of their feet, but make a general visual scan before concentrating on shop windows, other pedestrians or vehicles.  
      
       
     42 The first of these propositions was expressed as a statement of historical fact, not an assumption on which Dr Adams’ opinion might be based. The only person who could have proved that historical fact was the plaintiff. She did not. All she said was: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you observe the footpath in front of you as you walked? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I was looking where I was walking.” 
         
        
        
       Later she said: 
        
        
         
         “Q. And you said you were looking where you were going, that’s correct? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you would’ve seen – well firstly I show his Honour and my friend, that line or division between the cement slabs in the footpath? 
         
        
        
         
         A. I would have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you would have seen that line or division between the slabs of concrete? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Yes I would have.” 
         
        
        
       And later still she said she saw the rise (ie the rise at the top of which her foot became caught), or “would have”. The plaintiff gave no specific evidence whatever about “her usual attention” being “directed further down the footpath towards the location where [her] vehicle was parked” or about “not giving close direct visual attention to the pavement immediately in front of her feet”. It is also to be noted that to some extent the plaintiff’s evidence on this issue appeared to rest on reconstruction based on the probabilities, rather than on a clear recollection of a specific observation. Thus she said more than once she “would have” seen the crack and she also said she “would have” seen the rise up to it. It is no criticism of the plaintiff either as a witness or as a person to note these facts: it is understandable that she may not have made specific observations or, if she did, that the shock of her painful injury distorted any clear recollection of them.  
        
       
     43 The present point is simply that the plaintiff’s evidence does not support Dr Adams’ dogmatic assertion about what the plaintiff was looking at. If that dogmatic assertion was intended to be an assumption, the evidence does not correspond with it. If it was intended to be a conclusion in the nature of a circumstantial inference, it was a piece of testimonial impertinence on Dr Adams’ part to offer it. If it was intended to be a statement of what was in her mind, it was absurd.  
      
       
     44 Dr Adams’ second explanation for the plaintiff’s failure to see the hole is based on conclusions drawn from observations of a very different scene from that which in fact confronted the plaintiff. The scene before her consisted of a pavement interrupted by the “drive-in” or “driveway”, which moved down to gutter level and up again. Another plain feature of the scene was that there were cracks in the sense of straight lines of division between the paving blocks, other non-straight cracks moving in the approximate direction in which the plaintiff was walking, in directions approximately at right angles to it, and in other directions, and holes at numerous points along all these cracks. The photographs reveal a lot of pebbles, stones and gravel lying around. Initially the plaintiff could not recall whether they were there when she fell, though later she said there were pebbles in the hole. The plaintiff denied slipping on pebbles on the footpath, and did not recall telling a doctor that she had. The trial judge accepted her denial. There is no reason to disturb that finding. But since no other aspect of the surface had changed between the time of the fall and the time when Dr Adams’ photographs were taken, and since the plaintiff said there were pebbles in the hole, it is probable that there were pebbles, stones and gravel on the surface in the same way as revealed in the photographs. 
      
       
     45 It would be difficult for this Court to describe the scene as revealed in the photographs, and as Mr Moir considered it was at the time of the accident, better than Mr Moir did. He said: 
      
       
        
         
         “The concrete vehicle crossing was of the same width across the footpath as the concrete footpath itself. The length of the crossing, measured along the line of the gutter, was estimated as some 6 metres. As a consequence of the vehicle crossing being constructed some time after the concrete footpath and infill the footpath, the infill and the kerb had to be broken out to permit the construction of the vehicle crossing. 
         
        
        
         
         The photographs suggested that even when the existing footpath was broken out, the cuts across the concrete footpath and infill were made by a percussion or chipping tool which left a ragged, broken edge lacking in a neat workmanlike finish. It is noted that good practice required that the existing concrete be first cut with a diamond saw along the intended joint before the unwanted concrete was broken out. 
         
        
        
         
         The vehicle crossing was constructed in three sections. 
         
        
        
         
         (a) The main body of the slab for the crossing proper. It was a large slab trapezoidal in shape (almost rectangular) extending from the outer face of the gutter to the line of the inner edge of the footpath. The back edge of the slab was at the same level as the inner edge of the footpath slab and the level of the outer edge or roadside edge of the slab was slightly higher than the gutter invert. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) and (c) Two narrow wedge-shaped fillets at each end of the main slab. The fillets acted as transitions between levels of the original footpath, and the levels of the main body of the crossing slab. The wedge base length at the kerb was estimated as some 1/3rd metre long and the other two sides across the footpath each some 2 metres long. 
         
        
        
         
         It was also noted that: 
         
        
        
         
         (i) The junctions between the fillets and the original footpath and the fillets and the main body of the slab were sharp edged and without rounding transitions. 
         
        
        
         
         (ii) The main body of the slab and the fillers were not constructed in panels, or marked out in panels, to control the shrinkage cracking that would subsequently take place. 
         
        
        
         
         At the date of the accident the main slab and the end fillets were badly cracked and fragmented. It was the opinion of the undersigned that cracking had commenced shortly after the construction and had progressively worsened with time. The cracks were considered to be due to failure of the concrete slab and its foundation as structural members. The principal cracks roughly quartered the main slab while lesser cracks cut across section corners or further fractured the principal segments. Settlement and tilting also occurred in places. 
         
        
        
         
         The wedge of the eastern end of the slab was badly cracked as would be expected from its proportions. It had broken into at least 5 segments with major cracks along each side of the wedge. The trip lip which caused the accident had been formed by double cracks, spalling of concrete, and settlement at the joint between the wedge and the original footpath concrete.  
         
        
        
         
         The number of the cracks, their width, their positions, their directions, the tilting and level differences between some sections indicated that the following defects had existed: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) The foundation for the vehicle crossing had not been properly constructed, nor was it strong enough to serve the purpose required of it. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) The concrete was too thin for the purpose required of it, and for the size of the panels. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The concrete was too weak. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) The concrete lacked steel reinforcement. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) The wedge-shaped fillets should never have been constructed as separate sections of concrete. These sections had not been correctly proportioned, profiled or graded. (Wedge-shaped fillets such as those present at the site could not but crack, and break up). 
         
        
        
         
         Other design/construction defects observed were: 
         
        
        
         
         (a) Failure to use formwork to hold the back edge of the concrete pour straight and true. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) Failure to construct a properly proportioned dish crossing at the gutter. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) Failure to remove the existing kerb and gutter back to a pre-existing construction joint. 
         
        
        
         
         (d) Incorrectly constructing the slab for the vehicle crossing as a continuous member over the base of the original kerb. 
         
        
        
         
         (e) Failure to use compression/expansion membranes at construction joints with the original concrete. 
         
        
        
         
         (f) Failure to design the junctions with the original concrete so that no differential movement would take place and create trip lips. 
         
        
        
         
         It was also considered that it was probable that there had been a failure to properly cure the concrete after it was poured. This omission would have led to a more rapid onset of cracking failure. 
         
        
        
         
         It was the opinion of the undersigned that the cracking, the gaps in the concrete, the missing pieces of concrete, the differential settlements and tilting of the crossing slab, the formation of trip lips, and the existence of a trip lip 15 millimetres in height (the trip lip which caused the accident) were the direct consequences of defective design and construction of the slab.” 
         
        
       
     46 Obviously the plaintiff would not have drawn the conclusions which Mr Moir’s expertise enabled him to draw, but it was plainly open to the plaintiff, as a lay observer, to see the “ragged broken edge”, the junctions which were “sharp edged and without rounding transitions”, the “badly cracked and fragmented” slab and end fillets, consisting of “principal cracks” which “roughly quartered the main slab while lesser cracks cut across section corners or further fractured the principal segments”, the settlement and tilting, the “gaps in the concrete”, “the missing pieces of concrete” and the “trip lip 15 millimetres in height”. 
      
       
     47 This is an “environment” which, though “built”, is radically different from the condition of the “stairways and concourses in the underground railway system of the city” of Sydney. It was the behaviour of pedestrians in those stairways and concourses which Dr Adams used as the basis for his statements about the likely behaviour of persons moving along the footpath where the plaintiff fell. Judicial notice may be taken of the fact that those stairways and concourses are extremely smooth and, except where there are steps, level: there are hardly ever any uneven cracks or holes or pebbles or height differentials. What is more, the stairways and concourses are commonly thronged with busy pedestrians moving with speed and determination to and from their places of employment or about their affairs. And the concourses are bordered by shops and advertising hoardings. The effect of the entire arrangement is to permit and encourage pedestrians, subject to not running into other pedestrians, or persons handing out leaflets or free papers, or persons soliciting charitable donations, or prams, or wheelchairs, or the occasional delivery vehicle, and subject to avoiding any slippery patches ahead, to look at the shop windows and the advertising signs to be seen on walls and stair risers. It is not possible to take the way pedestrians do behave or ought to behave in those conditions and infer from it any valid conclusion about how the plaintiff behaved or ought to have behaved just after she left the grassy schoolyard and began walking with her daughter along the cracked and pebbly pavement, including the area of the pavement where there was the driveway, towards her car. This is particularly so since she had only been there twice before, and since she, being 62 and thus more vulnerable to the consequences of falls than younger persons and less likely to be able to regain her balance if she slipped or stumbled than younger persons, should have been seeking to observe closely the area in front of her feet as she moved along.  
      
       
     48 Dr Adams’ report, then, did not justify any conclusion that the “footpath was in an unsafe condition and would pose a danger to somebody such as the plaintiff” or that it was “a significant trip hazard” if the plaintiff had been looking out for what lay ahead of her.  
      
       
     49 Turning to Mr Moir, his description of the physical features which he noted and his explanations for the existence of those features have already been set out. Under the heading “The Hazard Created By The Trip Lip” he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “It was normally recognised by safety engineers and experts on pedestrian safety that trip lips and level discrepancies having a height of 10 millimetres or more in a footpath presented a potential safety hazard for pedestrians. It is noted that the trip lip at the accident site was somewhat greater than the minimum lip height considered to be a potential tripping device and safety hazard. 
         
        
        
         
         Further, if the trip lip were effectively disguised or concealed by changes in slope between panel sections, or by spalling of concrete and broken areas containing loose stones adjoining the trip lip, or by a multiplicity of cracking and textural effects in the nearby concrete, or in some situations, by a build up of leaves and soft debris against the trip lip, then the potential hazard became much greater and the likelihood of a tripping accident increased. 
         
        
        
         
         Because a number of these factors acted at this site, it was the opinion of the undersigned that the existence of the trip lip which caused Mrs Standing to trip would have [been] virtually undetectable to her if she had not been previously alerted to the hazard and not specifically looking out for it. The trip lip would have effectively been a hidden trap. 
         
        
        
         
         The trip lip at this site was a much more serious hazard than its 15 millimetre height might, at face value, suggest. 
         
        
        
         
         For a pedestrian walking across the vehicle crossing from west to east the operative height of the trip lip was increased by the level difference between the slab for the vehicle crossing and the slab for the footpath on the longsection where the lip was located. The longsection where the accident occurred was some third to halfway across the footpath from the gutter. The level difference between the respective slabs was estimated to be some 50 millimetres. Thus the top of the trip lip would have been some 65 millimetres above the level of the walking plane on the approach to the trip lip from the western end of the vehicle crossing, and the chances of the swinging foot clearing the lip were lessened.  
         
        
        
         
         The slope across the fillet of concrete was itself hazardous. The slope was 2:1 and gave a ramp that was only some 100 millimetres long for a pedestrian such as Mrs Standing. This slope was too steep and the fillet too narrow for it to function safely as a ramped section of footpath pavement. The sharp cornered and untransitioned fillet or ramp was, of itself, potentially quite hazardous and unacceptable, even without the 15 millimetre trip lip at the top of it. 
         
        
        
         
         Alternatively, if the level difference at the fillet were considered to function as a single step in the footpath the single step was, of itself, quite unacceptable and unsafe because of the intrusion of the fillet into the normal tread area of a step and more particularly because of the accidents resulting at single steps, single steps were specifically prohibited under most construction codes.” 
         
        
       
     50 Mr Moir then offered some opinions about when the defects and hazards should have been noticed and how they should have been remedied. Among these opinions was the statement that the hazard was “effectively a hidden trap on the footpath, particularly for an older pedestrian”. 
      
       
     51 The trial judge did not appear to accept this evidence at its face value. The trial judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I take it to be that all he is saying really is that the hole being placed where it was at the top of the fillet made it less visible and therefore potentially more of a danger to a pedestrian particularly since that pedestrian would have to be stepping up over the fillet which, as Mr Moir has indicated, was not capable of being a ramp because it was too narrow and too steep. 
         
        
        
         
         Whether it is necessary say to [sic – scil “necessary to say”] that I am not sure. It does appear to me, however, to be consistent with common sense that there would be an extra danger involved in that situation in a place such as this as demonstrated in the photographs and it is really the combination of the trip lip and the fact that it is elevated which is the matter for determination in this case. The fact of its elevation, of course, goes not only to its visibility but also to the fact that a pedestrian would need to step up in negotiating the footpath.” 
         
        
       
     52 In view of the very limited finding made by the trial judge which may or may not have been made on the strength of Mr Moir’s report, and which was said by the trial judge to be no more than “consistent with commonsense”, it is not necessary to devote much attention to Mr Moir’s report. The essential weakness in both the report and the conclusion which the trial judge stated after summarising parts of it is that it is impossible to conclude on the balance of probabilities that there was an “extra danger”, let alone a “hidden trap”, in view of the condition of the site and the numerous obvious aspects of the surface which were not even, flat or smooth. Mr Moir himself said that before railings were installed along the edge of the footpath at the points where there was no driveway, “the cracking and trip hazard for pedestrians would, more probably than not, have been present in the footpath and readily observable ….” If they were readily observable then, they were readily observable to pedestrians using reasonable care for their own safety on the day of the accident. 
      
       
     53 What were the circumstances of the accident? The light was good, since the “accident occurred in the middle of the day [at about 1.20 pm] in broad daylight”. The crack was of sufficient dimensions, in depth and across the top, for the plaintiff to see it, and she did see it. The hole in which the plaintiff’s foot was caught appears quite clearly in the photographs in evidence. Though the plaintiff’s evidence that she did not see the hole was accepted, the size of the hole was large enough to permit the plaintiff to see it if she had been looking. The whole area was so covered by cracks and was so uneven that a pedestrian taking reasonable care for his or her own safety would have to keep a lookout as to ground conditions in the area just in front of the feet. The hole was of a depth which was only 60% of the inch referred to by Cumming-Bruce J and Gleeson CJ as something which pedestrians had to accept. A pedestrian exercising reasonable care for his or her own safety ought to have seen the hole. If the hole had been seen, a pedestrian of that kind would not have placed his or her foot in it.  
      
       
     54 Almost any injury that happens is an injury in respect of which there can be said to have been a foreseeable risk. In that sense, there was a foreseeable risk of injury here. But it was not a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury to pedestrians using reasonable care for their own safety. The plaintiff, like pedestrians generally, was in an excellent position to see and avoid imperfections in the surface. There could have been no expectation on her part that the surface would be smooth. The unevenness in the paving slabs, the cracks and the holes at the place where the plaintiff was moving were as obvious as similar features all over the country, and as obvious as other common features like raised tree roots and manhole covers. There was no concealment of any of the features of the site which the trial judge criticised. There was no inadequacy in the lighting, or obscuring of the hazard by grass or otherwise. It was reasonable to expect the plaintiff to have seen what lay ahead of her as she walked along in broad daylight: what was there was obvious and called for no special vigilance.  
      
       
     55 So far as there was any hazard it was both not only obvious but insignificant and common. The condition of the pavement was typical of innumerable kilometres of pavements in the cities, suburbs and towns of this country. The imperfection was of a kind which users of footpaths have from childhood habituated themselves to look out for and avoid, in view of the fact that surfaces which pedestrians use may be uneven, not flat and not smooth. The imperfection was not a danger, a hazard or a trap. Neither Mr Moir nor the trial judge demonstrate how Mr Moir’s figure of 10 mm depth in the hole as the criterion of liability was crucial, and, if it was, how that view could be reconciled with the reasoning in Brodie’s and Ghantous’s cases. Though Mr Moir referred to other experts, he did not explain their thought processes.  
      
       
     56 The reasoning of Hodgson JA (Foster AJA and Brownie AJA concurring) in Lombardi v Holroyd City Council [2002] NSWCA 252 at [32] applies here: 
      
       
        
         
         “I do not accept that a plainly visible step of 25 millimetres in a footpath is correctly regarded as high risk or unacceptable risk. It is desirable that even obvious steps of 25 millimetres in footpaths be avoided and eliminated if possible; but that is not to say that the failure of a Council to detect and eliminate all such risk is negligent. As a general rule, in my opinion it is not.” 
         
        
       
     57 Hodgson JA’s reasoning in Parramatta City Council v Watkins [2001] NSWCA 364 at [27] also applies; speaking of a 50 mm change of level from the surface of a road to a manhole cover, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am inclined to think that sudden variations in level of this magnitude may generally be expected at the edge of footpaths, at transitions between different paths or surfaces, and even between footpath slabs in the vicinity of trees; and also between paved and unpaved areas of road. However, the same may not be true within the paved surface of an apparently well-maintained road, particularly where the change of level is not obvious; and the circumstance that the change in level in this case was in a designated parking area, where it could be partially obscured by a parked car, would add to the risk.” 
         
        
        
       Here there was no obscuring of the imperfection by a parked car or otherwise; the case did not concern the paved surface of an apparently well-maintained road, but a cracked pavement; the fact of the crack between the pavers was obvious enough actually to be seen by the plaintiff, and the change in level sufficiently obvious that she ought to have seen it; and the imperfection was similar to one occurring between footpath slabs in the vicinity of trees.  
        
       
     58 The proposition that there was no reasonably foreseeable injury is supported by two other matters of fact. The fact is that Mr Radnidge had not received a complaint about the imperfection in the form of an “action request” in his twelve years with the Council. The second matter of fact is that there is no evidence that any person had ever stumbled or fallen at the site where the plaintiff was injured. The vehicle crossing and the pipe railings lining the pavement in the areas where there was no vehicle crossing had been there from a time prior to 1972, according to Mr Moir. Mr Moir thought that the “defects and hazards” he identified should have been detected when the railings were installed, ie before 1972. He thought that the defects and hazards had been there, possibly, for more than thirty years. These aspects of Mr Moir’s report may safely be relied on, since the plaintiff relied on them herself for particular parts of her argument. The relevant section of the pavement was near a school, a golf course and shops. Access to the footpath from the school existed through a gap in the school fence, through which the plaintiff and her daughter had actually passed just before the fall. Though the gap was later closed, it is a safe inference that school children frequently used it. It may be inferred that pedestrians of all ages passed along the footpath and over the site where the plaintiff fell many times a day, and had done so for up to twenty-five or thirty years. Mr Radnidge’s direct evidence on the point was that there was “a very large volume of” pedestrian traffic along the footpath, including 500 or 600 school children. It may be inferred that there would also be parents picking them up, in addition to other users of the footpath. The absence of evidence of any stumbling, and the absence of any recorded complaint, strongly supports an inference that the site was not dangerous or hazardous or risky to pedestrians, and that injury to them was not reasonably foreseeable.  
      
       
     59 The conditions of the site were so obvious and so typical of those commonly to be encountered in daily life that the defendant was not under any duty to undertake inspections to identify them. Even if the defendant had become aware of the particular conditions of the site, it had no duty to alter them in view of their obviousness. 
      
       
     60 In short, the defendant did not owe the plaintiff a relevant duty of care either to identify the features of the site or to remove them. 
      
       
        
       Breach of duty 
        
       
     61 If there had been a duty, it would be necessary to consider the evidence and arguments bearing on the trial judge’s reasoning in relation to the financial capacity of the defendant. But even if the risk of injury was sufficiently foreseeable to trigger the type of breach analysis referred to in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48, the degree of probability of the risk of the occurrence was so low that the expenses of taking alleviating action and the defendant’s other responsibilities were likely to be such that the defendant was not in breach of duty. The defendant did not prove specifically or in detail what the defendant’s other responsibilities were, and the burden of proving breach lay on it. The repair budget was $10,000. The cost of repairing all pavements was at least $50,000. The plaintiff did not establish why it was a breach of duty to have a repair budget of only $10,000. Indeed Mr Radnidge, though he was cross-examined briefly on why he only regarded a 20 mm gap as dangerous and not a 15 mm gap, was not cross-examined as to why the defendant only had a budget of $10,000 for repairs, when for $50,000 or more the defendant could have fixed all the cracks with 20 mm gaps. Nor was he cross-examined on what it would cost to fix all cracks with 15 mm gaps, or 10 mm gaps, if the latter figure selected by Mr Moir was the decisive badge of danger. Counsel for the plaintiff said that it was for Mr Radnidge to have given evidence on these topics in chief, but that is not so given that his position was that a 15 mm gap was not dangerous. In short, even if the plaintiff had demonstrated that there was a duty of care, it cannot be said that she demonstrated that the defendant was in breach of it. 
      
       
        
       Orders

      AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED v MARSDEN 
      
      
       
        
       The appellant broadcast on the  
       Today Tonight  
       programme what it claimed to be the result of an investigation of allegations of paedophilia in New South Wales. Fourteen months later the appellant broadcast on the  
       Witness 
        programme what it claimed to be the result of a second investigation on the same subject matter. The respondent was named and accused in both programmes as having engaged in sexual activities with boys under the age of 18. 
        
        
       The respondent commenced proceedings in relation to alleged defamatory imputations arising from the two programmes. A jury found a number of defamatory imputations to have been made concerning the respondent in the two programmes. The gravamen of the imputations was that the respondent knowingly had sexual intercourse with boys under the age of 18, and in one case, a boy aged 15. 
        
        
       Following this verdict the trial judge conducted a hearing as to the appellant’s defences, broadly classified as justification and qualified privilege defences, and the assessment of damages. He concluded that the defences failed, and assessed damages and awarded interest on the damages. He ordered the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs, in part on an indemnity basis. 
        
        
       On appeal the appellant challenged the findings in relation to the justification and qualified privilege defences, as well as the assessment of damages (as being too high) and the indemnity costs. The respondent cross-appealed challenging the assessment of damages (for omitting relevant heads of damages and as being too low) and the interest on the damages. 
        
        
       HELD  
        
        
       Justification 
        
        
       (i) The success of the justification defences depended upon the credibility of the witnesses called to prove the substantial truth of the imputations. 
        
        
       (ii) There was no appellable error in the trial judge’s approach to the assessment of the evidence of the witnesses or in the application of legal principles.  
        
        
       (iii) There was no appellable error in the trial judge’s rejection of the evidence of the witnesses. 
        
        
       (iv) The trial judge did not err in rejecting the New South Wales and interstate justification-based defences 
        
        
       Consideration of - 
        
        (a) principles of appellate review of trial judge’s credit-based findings; 
        
        (b) standard of proof of grave allegations ( 
       Bringinshaw 
        and  
       Evidence Act  
       s 140); 
        
        (c) principles governing identification evidence in a civil case and the extent to which assistance may be found in criminal law authorities; 
        
        (d) the role of corroboration in a civil case - 
        
        (i) the extent to which assistance may be found  
        
       in criminal law authorities ( 
       Longman  
       analogy); 
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
               
               (ii) the approach to the assessment of alleged 
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       corroborative evidence; 
        
        (e) proof of knowledge in a civil case involving allegations of a criminal nature; 
        
        (f) admissions by conduct; 
        
        (g) exercise of discretion in the discharge of a witness who refuses to give further evidence; 
        
        (h) the approach to the evidence of such a witness; 
        
        (i) exercise of discretion in refusing leave to re-open, including the question of substantial miscarriage of justice. 
        
        
       Qualified Privilege 
        
        
       (v) The trial judge did not err in finding that the appellant’s conduct in publishing the imputations was unreasonable and so not entitled to statutory qualified privileges in New South Wales or interstate or  
       Lange  
       common law privilege. 
        
        
       (vi) The trial judge did not err in holding that the imputations were not published on non- 
       Lange 
        occasions of common law qualified privilege. 
        
        
       (vii) The trial judge erred in his approach to the question of malice. The defence of common law qualified privilege is denied, inter alia where there is the presence of an improper motive which actuated the publication of the defamatory matter, so constituting malice. Mere absence of an honest belief or reckless indifference as to truth or falsity, falling short of wilful blindness, are not by themselves sufficient to establish an improper motive. Malice was not established for the  
       Today Tonight 
        programme, but was established in relation to the  
       Witness 
        programme. 
        
        
       (viii) Nonetheless, since the occasion of publication of the  
       Today Tonight 
        programme was not one of non-

        common law privilege, the trial judge did not err in holding that the qualified privilege defences failed. 
        
        
       Consideration of - 
        
        (a) failure to make basic enquiries in relation to reasonableness, reckless indifference and honest belief; 
        
        (b) application of  
       Lange 
        and  
       Reynolds 
       ; 
        
        (c) response-based common law qualified privilege; 
        
        (d) reckless indifference, lack of honest belief and improper motive for the purposes of malice; 
        
        (e) public interest, public benefit and good faith where relevant to interstate legislation. 
        
        
       Damages 
        
        
       (ix) The trial judge did not err in his approach to the assessment of ordinary compensatory damages.  
        
        
       (x) The trial judge erred in holding that in the absence of evidence of injury to feelings from the respondent he could not award aggravated damages for injury to feelings.  
        
        
       (xi) The trial judge erred in not awarding exemplary damages in relation to the  
       Witness 
        programme; the Court assessed exemplary damages. 
        
         
        
       (xii) Since by reason of (x) and subject to further submissions from the parties there should be a reassessment of compensatory damages, the issues of indemnity costs and interest on the damages should not be decided; but there was no error in holding that an offer of compromise served by the respondent attracted the operation of Pt 52A r22(4) of the  
       Rules. 
        
        
       Consideration of -  
        
        (a) exercise of discretion in refusing to depart from “normal” course of trial; 
        
        (b) proof of injury to feelings where the plaintiff does not give evidence of injury to feelings – ordinary and aggravated compensatory damages; 
        
        (c) diminution of reputation with regard to character and lifestyle; 
        
        (d) whether trial judge’s findings adverse to the plaintiff can be taken into account in diminution of reputation; 
        
        (e) enhancement of extent of publication by the litigation; 
        
        (f) qualification to give opinion as to psychiatric injury; 
        
        (g) the award of exemplary damages; 
        
        (h) new trial on limited issues; 
        
        (i) principles for interest on damages for reputation; 
        
        (j) offers of compromise in proceedings for defamation.

       No substantive orders at this time. Appeal and cross appeal to be listed for further mention at 9.30am on 14 February 2003, exchange of statement of orders to be made as directed and submissions for further conduct of the matter.

      AMALGAMATED TELEVISION SERVICES PTY LIMITED v MARSDEN 
      
      
       
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
       
        
       
     1 THE COURT: On 25 February 1999, a jury found that the appellant defamed the respondent by the broadcast of two television programmes, the first on 13 March 1995 on the programme Today Tonight [J 51] and the second on 7 May 1995 on a segment of the programme Witness entitled “The Dark Side” [J 5].  
      
       
     2 The genesis of the allegations against the respondent, for the purposes of these proceedings, was a statement made under parliamentary privilege by Deirdre Grusovin, a member of the Legislative Assembly of the New South Wales Parliament, on 1 December 1994. That statement was based upon a statutory declaration made by one Colin Fisk (Fisk), a convicted paedophile, in which Fisk alleged that the respondent was a pederast. Fisk subsequently withdrew the allegation. 
      
       
     3 The first programme containing the defamatory imputations was a Today Tonight “special investigation” of the respondent and his alleged sexual conduct with “under age” boys. “Under age” meant a boy under the age of 18 years at the time of the alleged sexual encounter. The programme contained interviews with two persons, whose names were suppressed and images obscured, making allegations of under age sex against the respondent. The unidentified persons in the programme were Ronald James Kinchela and John William Pearce, both of whom gave evidence in the proceedings. The programme also reported the allegations made in State Parliament by Deidre Grusovin. Fisk’s retracting statutory declaration was also broadcast as part of the programme [J 2]. 
      
       
     4 The Witness programme, entitled The Dark Side also involved an investigation of the respondent. It contained interviews with three males who alleged they had been the “prey” of the respondent and discussed the paedophile activities that took place in Kings Cross in the 1970s and early 1980s, particularly at Costello’s Nightclub which the respondent was said to have patronised. The programme went on to allege a link between the paedophile activity and serious crimes later committed by the victims. Reference was again made to the allegations made against the respondent in State Parliament by Ms Grusovin [J 5-12]. 
      
       
     5 The respondent commenced defamation proceedings against the appellant on 14 March 1995 in respect of the Today Tonight programme and on 13 June 1996 in respect of the Witness programme. The actions were heard together. 
      
       
     6 The imputations found to have been carried and to be defamatory in the Today Tonight programme were [J 1]: 
      
       
        
         
         “1(a) The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with boys who were under the age of 18 knowing them to be under the age of 18. 
         
        
        
         
         3(a) The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with a 15 year old boy who was then under the influence of drugs which had been given to him by the plaintiff.” 
         
        
        
       The imputations found to have been carried and to be defamatory in the  
       Witness 
        programme were [J 13]: 
        
        
         
         “1(a) The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old boys, having deliberately refrained from asking those boys how old they were. 
         
        
        
         
         2(a) The plaintiff has had sexual intercourse with 15 year old male prostitutes having deliberately refrained from asking them how old they were.” 
         
        
       
     7 Following the jury verdict, the defences of justification and qualified privilege and the respondent’s claim for damages were heard and determined by Levine J pursuant to s 7A(4) of the Defamation Act 1974 (NSW). His Honour rejected both defences and awarded the respondent general damages in the sum of $275,000 in respect of the Today Tonight programme and $250,000 in respect of the Witness programme. His Honour rejected the respondent’s claim for aggravated and exemplary damages.  
      
       
     8 Both parties appeal against his Honour’s determinations.  
      
       
     9 The appellant appeals against the rejection of the defences and the quantum of damages awarded. It contends that even if his Honour was correct in rejecting the defences of justification and qualified privilege an award of nominal damages only should have been made.  
      
       
     10 The respondent cross-appeals against the trial judge’s award of damages. Specifically, he alleges that his Honour erred in failing to award, as part of his claim for general damages, damages for psychiatric injury; that in any event the general damages awarded were inadequate to properly compensate him for the injury to his reputation; that his Honour should have awarded both aggravated and exemplary damages; and that the interest rate used by his Honour was incorrect: see s 94 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).  
      
       
        
        
       JUSTIFICATION 
        
       Introduction 
       
     11 The appellant pleaded in its defence that each of the imputations was justified. For the purposes of the law in New South Wales, the defence of justification is only made out if it is established that the imputation is a matter of substantial truth and the imputation either relates to a matter of public interest or is published under qualified privilege: Defamation Act s 15(2). The appellant also relied upon s 16 of the Defamation Act, that is, whether there is substantial truth in contextual imputations. A defendant bears the onus of establishing the defence. The “justification issue” before Levine J in the present proceedings was the substantial truth of the imputations. There was no issue that the matter published was a matter of public interest [J 106]. As the programmes were also shown in other states in Australia the appellant pleaded the justification defences applicable in those States.  
      
       
     12 The appellant relied in its justification case upon the evidence of eleven witnesses, all of who alleged they had either had underage sex or had witnessed the respondent engage in underage sex. For the most part the justification witnesses were unknown to each other. They each had extensive criminal histories and many had had significant problems with substance abuse.  
      
       
     13 The appellant sought to advance its case through these witnesses on the basis that there were common features of the sexual encounters, which it was said, amounted to a “modus operandi” whereby the respondent solicited boys at various known homosexual “beats” or “pick up” places and engaged in sex either at his home at Campbelltown, at hotels or at a well-known nightclub in Kings Cross, Costello’s, which was frequented by homosexuals.  
      
       
     14 The appellant also sought to prove its justification defence by relying upon conduct of the respondent which it alleged amounted to an admission in respect of certain witnesses that his case was a weak one or was unfounded: see Wigmore: 3rd ed (1940) Vol 2 para 278; R v Watt (1905) 20 Cox CC 852. The respondent’s conduct said to amount to an admission (to the extent that it was an issue in the appeal) was his alleged attempt to suborn witnesses or potential witnesses to commit a “wrongful act” such as giving false evidence [J 39-J 44]; and having a witness make a statutory declaration which was false [J 46].  
      
       
     15 Levine J’s rejection of the justification defence involved a rejection of the justification witnesses as witnesses of credit. The respondent submitted that the appellant’s justification case was dependent upon the trial judge’s acceptance of its witnesses. That, as the appellant submitted to the trial judge, involved “a contest of credit between … [the respondent] … on the one hand and the [appellant’s] justification witnesses on the other”. The respondent pointed out that his Honour’s finding meant the appellant had “lost the contest” [RS 2] and that those findings are protected by the application of the principles in Abalos v Australian Postal Commission (1990) 171 CLR 167 at 178-179; Devries v Australian National Railways Commission (1993) 177 CLR 472; State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Earthline Constructions Pty Ltd (in liq) (1999) 160 ALR 588; Rosenberg v Percival (2001) 205 CLR 434 at 448. We will, for the purpose of these reasons, refer to the principles enunciated in these cases as the Abalos principle.  
      
       
     16 The respondent submitted that the well known exceptions to the limitations placed upon an appellate court’s interference with a trial judge’s credit findings have not been established. The appellant submitted that this was a case where appellate interference is warranted because there was incontrovertible evidence which supported contrary findings to those made by his Honour. In large measure, the appellant relied upon the components of what was referred to as the respondent’s modus operandi in support of this argument. Before further explaining that concept, and because the Abalos principle forms an essential backdrop to this appeal it is appropriate to refer to it in a little more detail.  
      
       
     17 The essence of the principle is that an appellate court faces considerable restraint in interfering with the credit based findings of a trial judge. In Devries, Brennan, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said at 479: 
      
       
        
         
         “More than once in recent years, this Court has pointed out that a finding of fact by a trial judge, based on the credibility of a witness, is not to be set aside because an appellate court thinks that the probabilities of the case are against – even strongly against – that finding of fact ( 
         Brunskill 
          (1985) 59 ALJR 842; 62 ALR 53;  
         Jones v Hyde 
          (1989) 63 ALJR 349; 85 ALR 23;  
         Abalos v Australian Postal Commission 
          (1990) 171 CLR 167). If the trial judge’s finding depends to any substantial degree on the credibility of the witness, the finding must stand unless it can be shown that the trial judge ‘has failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage’ ( 
         SS Hontestroom v SS Sagaporack 
          [1927] AC 37 at 47) or has acted on evidence which was ‘inconsistent with the facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence’ or which was ‘glaringly improbable’ ( 
         Brunskill 
          (1985) 59 ALJR at 844; 62 ALR at 57).” 
         
        
       
     18 Deane and Dawson JJ pointed out at 480, however, that the appellate court’s duty itself to weigh the evidence, draw inferences and reach conclusions was not displaced merely by a demeanour finding and could not be explained away by “any short exhaustive formula”. More relevantly for present purposes, they had earlier observed at 479-480: 
      
       
        
         
         “An appellate court which is entrusted with jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by way of rehearing from the decision of a trial judge on questions of fact must set aside a challenged finding of fact made by the trial judge which is shown to be wrong. When such a finding is wholly or partly based on the trial judge’s assessment of the trustworthiness of witnesses who have given oral testimony, allowance must be made for the advantage which the trial judge has enjoyed in seeing and hearing the witnesses give their evidence. The ‘value and importance’ of that advantage ‘will vary according to the class of case, and, … [the circumstances of] the individual case’ (Watt (or Thomas) v Thomas [1947] AC 484 at 488 per Lord Thankerton).  
         
        
        
         
         If the challenged finding is affected by identified error of principle or demonstrated mistake or misapprehension about relevant facts, the advantage may, depending on the circumstances, be of little significance or even irrelevant.” 
         
        
       
     19 It follows that an appellate court cannot reverse the findings of a trial judge unless satisfied that the advantage of having seen the witness could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge’s conclusion. In Rosenberg v Percival at 448 McHugh J emphasised the protected nature of credit based finding, especially those founded essentially on demeanour: 
      
       
        
         
         “One of the consequences of the “advantage” of seeing and hearing the witnesses is that the trial judge is in a far better position than an appellate court to know what individual weight should be assigned to the various factors — credibility, matters for and matters against — that must be evaluated in making the ultimate findings of fact in the case. Where a finding is based on credibility and other facts support the finding, the case would need to be exceptional before an appellate court could set aside the finding on the ground that, judging by the transcript, the trial judge gave insufficient weight or consideration to other facts and circumstances in the case. The common law tradition is an oral tradition. Trial by transcript can seldom be an adequate representation of an oral trial before a judge or an oral trial before a judge and jury.” 
         
        
        
       The Respondent’s Modus Operandi 
       
     20 It was common ground in the proceedings that the respondent, a prominent solicitor in this State, is homosexual and openly so and is admittedly promiscuous in the sense that over the years he has engaged in sexual activities with a number of persons (referred to in the proceedings as ‘casual sex’), including males he had picked up at known homosexual ‘beats’.  
      
       
     21 The respondent agreed that when picking up a male at a beat, he would not know their age [T 6946]. He denied that there was any risk in picking up an underage person “unless you are dumb and can’t see for yourself what you are looking at” [T 6948]. He agreed that the issue of age only became relevant in 1984 when adult homosexual engagements were removed as an offence from the statute books [T 6948].  
      
       
     22 According to the appellant, the respondent’s sexual conduct was said to involve a number of common features or involve a modus operandi. That modus operandi was as follows: 
      
       
        
       (i) the respondent engaged sexual partners at a ‘beat’, meaning he visited a pickup area to find a sexual partner;  
        
        
       (ii) they drove in his Mercedes Benz, usually driven by a chauffeur, to the respondent’s home at Campbelltown; 
        
        
       (iii) at his home, the chosen partner was taken upstairs to the respondent’s bedroom; 
        
        
       (iv) marijuana, which the respondent kept in a drawer in his bedside table and at one stage in an alcove in the walk-in wardrobe was smoked. 
        
        
       (v) the respondent used amyl nitrate during the sexual activities. It was kept in a drawer beside the bed;  
        
        
       (vi) the partner stayed the night and was driven to the railway station the following morning; 
        
        
       (vii) on occasions the partner was given a sum of money by the respondent when he was dropped off at the railway station. 
        
       
     23 The appellant argued that his Honour failed to give proper weight to this evidence. It was submitted that had he done so and then assessed the totality of the evidence including his findings on credibility in respect of both the respondent’s witnesses and the appellant’s witnesses, it was likely he would have reached a different conclusion and found that the imputations were proved.  
      
       
        
        
       Issues on the Appeal 
       
     24 The appellant challenges his Honour’s determination in 146 grounds of appeal. As might be expected with such a multiplicity of grounds, overlapping is inevitable. Accordingly, for the purposes of determining whether any of his Honour’s findings involve appealable error, it is convenient to adopt the course proposed by the appellant of dealing with the alleged errors in categories. This categorisation, in part at least, follows the format of his Honour’s judgment whereby his Honour dealt with the general issues involved in the case and gave himself a number of directions in relation to those issues before he dealt with the individual justification witnesses.  
      
       
     25 The alleged errors may be categorised as follows:  
      
       
        
       (i) General errors in self-direction 
       . The appellant alleges that his Honour erred in the manner in which he dealt with the following issues or in applying the following concepts to his consideration of the issues: 
        
        
         
         (a) in applying a criminal law standard of proof, particularly in dealing with the issues of ‘identification‘ and ‘corroboration’; 
         
        
        
         
         (b) in applying an  
         “inappropriately high standard of proof” 
         ; 
         
        
        
         
         (c) in inappropriately seeking guidance from the criminal law when dealing with the issue of ‘knowledge’. 
         
        
        
       (ii) Particular errors in relation to individual witnesses. 
        
        
       (iii) Errors in methodology. 
        The appellant alleges that his Honour’s fact finding method was flawed in that he failed to pay regard to the whole of the evidence and failed to have regard to the cumulative effect of the evidence when determining the justification defence in the following respects: 
        
        
         
         (a) wrongful segmentation of the evidence by treating each justification witness separately, without having regard to evidence of other witnesses or the respondent’s own admissions which may have been relevant to his assessment of the evidence of a particular witness.  
          
          
         (b) adopting a  
         “two stage approach” 
          to his fact finding task in respect of individual witnesses in the sense that he first determined whether a particular justification witness’s evidence was credible, and then used his invariably adverse conclusion in respect of that evidence to impeach any corroborative evidence:  
         Gamaethige v Minister for Immigration 
          [2001] FCA 565.  
          
          
         (c) failing to give weight to the admissions by conduct. 
          
          
         (d) there was an imbalance in his Honour’s assessment of the weight to be given to the evidence of the justification witnesses as compared to the weight given to the respondent’s evidence and that of the witnesses called in the respondent’s case.  
          
          
         (e) misusing the modus operandi argument so as to make an adverse finding of credit if a witness’s account did not correspond with the relevant components of the modus operandi. This allegation included an allegation that his Honour erroneously failed to have regard to the consistencies in the evidence of the justification witnesses and between those witnesses and the evidence of the respondent: see  
         Martin v Osborne 
          (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375;  
         Cross on Evidence 
          6th Ed at 21284; but conversely, emphasised the inconsistencies in the evidence of the justification witnesses [AS 29-30].  
         
        
       
     26 The consequence of his Honour’s flawed methodology, on the appellant’s argument, was that his Honour fell into appealable error in his assessment of the credit of the justification witnesses and failed to make appropriate findings in relation to the credit of the respondent and the witnesses in his case.  
      
       
        
       General Errors in Self Direction 
        
       Application of a criminal law standard of proof 
       
     27 The appellant submitted that the trial judge failed to apply the appropriate standard of proof in determining whether the appellant’s justification defence had been made out. In Rejfek v McElroy (1965) 112 CLR 517 the Court at 521 emphasised that: 
      
       
        
         
         “[t]he difference between the criminal standard of proof and the civil standard of proof is no mere matter of words: it is a matter of critical substance. No matter how grave the fact which is to be found in a civil case, the mind has only to be reasonably satisfied and has not with respect to any matter in issue in such a proceeding to attain that degree of certainty which is indispensable to the support of a conviction upon a criminal charge.” 
         
        
       
     28 There is no suggestion in his Honour’s reasons that he misunderstood the standard of proof he was required to apply either generally or in relation to particular evidence. He said at J 24: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is a civil case. The [appellant] has pleaded the defence of ‘justification’ and the burden of proof rests on [the appellant]. As this is a civil case, the standard of proof is the  
         ‘balance of probabilities’ 
         . That which the [appellant] has to prove in its defence of justification is the substantial truth of ‘grave allegations’. There is no escaping the allocation to those allegations (as captured by the found imputations) of the description ‘criminal conduct’. However, any such description cannot derogate from the application of the civil standard of proof: see  
         Refjek v McElroy 
         .” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     29 In stating his conclusion in respect of, for example, Homes’ evidence, his Honour said [J 626]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… considering all the evidence in relation to this so-called incident,  
         the [appellant] has failed to persuade me on the balance of probabilities 
          that what Mr Homes says took place between [the respondent] and his brother Les Murphy has not (sic) been proved to be the fact.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     30 The appellant also relied on his Honour’s references to the criminal law in a number of his interlocutory judgments. For our part, we consider that our point of reference should be his Honour’s judgment under appeal. But in any event, as our considerations in relation to this judgment demonstrate, a reference to or even seeking guidance from the criminal law does not involve the application of a criminal standard of proof. Accordingly, we do not consider there is any point of substance in this part of the appellant’s submission. 
      
       
        
       Application of a criminal law standard of proof to the issue of identification 
       
     31 The positive identification of the respondent as having been engaged in specific incidences of underage sex was crucial to the appellant’s justification case. His Honour took the view that the principles which govern evidence of identification in criminal trials provided guidance to a judge in a civil trial “in considering the reliability and weight of any evidence on this issue by itself, together with the nature of other evidence” [J 88]. In particular, his Honour considered that given the well known dangers inherent in identification evidence, it was appropriate to give himself directions cognate with the directions which would be given at common law to a jury in a criminal trial.  
      
       
     32 His Honour referred in particular to Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555, where the High Court stated at 562: 
      
       
        
         
         “The attention of the jury ‘should be drawn to any weaknesses in the identification evidence’ … It follows that the trial judge should isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance which may reasonably be regarded as undermining the reliability of the identification evidence.” 
         
        
        
       The Court further stated at 565-566 that in determining whether a warning to the jury had been adequate, it was necessary to consider  
       “the nature of the relationship between the witness and the person identified, the opportunity to observe the person subsequently identified, the length of time between the incident, and the identification and the nature and circumstances of the first identification” 
       . 
        
       
     33 To like effect is the statement In Cross on Evidence (Australian Edition), at para 1400 where the author points out that the warning as to identification evidence which should be given to a jury depends upon the circumstances of each case and the warning given in any given case:  
      
       
        
         
         “usually discusses the opportunities of identification which the witness had – the position of the witness and the person identified, the light, the exposure of the witness to stress or fear or the like – and the perceptiveness of the witness:  
         R v Clune 
          [1982] VR 1 (FC);  
         R v Dickson 
          [1983] 1 VR 227 (FC).” 
         
        
       
     34 The appellant submitted that his Honour’s reliance on the criminal law in his approach to identification evidence “was unduly restrictive”.  More importantly it alleged that in applying those principles his Honour failed to determine the issue of identification on the balance of probabilities. [AS 100] 
      
       
     35 The appellant further contended that the trial judge, rather than taking the identification evidence of each individual witness and giving consideration to the weight of that testimony in context, including whether or not the witness was cross-examined or challenged on the identification evidence “adopted an inflexible approach based on criminal law”.  
      
       
     36 In this case, however, the identification evidence itself was an integral part of the credit challenge to Homes’ evidence. This was also the case in respect of Lilburn and D18. It was appropriate, therefore, for the trial judge to deal with the identification evidence in the context of the overall credibility of the witnesses.  
      
       
     37 So far as we are aware, there is no direct authority as to whether his Honour’s approach in seeking guidance from the criminal law was correct. Certainly, the same principles apply in a criminal trial without a jury: Grbic v Pitkethly (1992) 38 FCR 95. In that case, Sheppard J said (at 103) this was so with one qualification, namely that in a jury trial, identification evidence may be rejected because of its unsatisfactory nature, whereas in a trial without a jury identification evidence remained admissible even if it was unsatisfactory and it was a question of the weight and significance to be given to the evidence at the end of the case. See also Sharrett v Gill (1993) 65 A Crim R 44; Parker v Espinoza (1996) 85 A Crim R 366. 
      
       
     38 The principles upon which his Honour relied were principles derived from the criminal law, which is the area where identification evidence is most contentious. However, there is always a risk that identification evidence, whether in a criminal or a civil trail, may be unreliable. This has now been recognised by statute in the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s 165 (1)(b). Although criminal law references are the source of the passage in Cross on Evidence to which we have referred, this passage, like the passage in Domican v R, to which we have also referred, provides reasons why identification evidence may be unreliable – reasons which may be equally applicable to identification evidence in a civil trial, subject to their being considered according to the appropriate standard of proof. Accordingly, we do not consider that by reference to the principles stated in the criminal law his Honour applied any wrong principle.  
      
       
     39 We see nothing in his Honour’s statement of his approach to the identification evidence to indicate that he applied any wrong principle or the wrong standard of proof. Accordingly, we reject these aspects of the appellant’s challenge to his Honour’s findings.  
      
       
     40 As we have said, the real issue in identification evidence is its reliability. It is not a credit issue per se. That is so whether the case is a civil or a criminal one. An honest witness may not give reliable identification evidence. The warnings to the jury are directed to ensuring that they are satisfied that the identification evidence is reliable. As Mason J pointed out in Alexander v The Queen (1980) 145 CLR 395 at 426: 
      
       
        
         
         “Identification is notoriously uncertain. It depends upon so many variables. They include [relevantly for this case] … the vagaries of human perception and recollection.” 
         
        
        
       Application of a criminal law standard of proof to the issue of corroboration 
       
     41 In New South Wales, s 164(1) of the Evidence Act provides that evidence need not be corroborated. The section does not, however, prohibit the giving of a direction in respect of corroboration: R v Lewis (unreported, New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 September 1998).  
      
       
     42 Section 165 of the Evidence Act deals with “unreliable evidence”, specifying the type of evidence which may be unreliable, for example, identification evidence: s 165(1)(b); and evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer: s 165(1)(e). The evidence of a complainant of a sexual assault does not fall into any of the nominated categories of unreliable evidence, although it is important to keep in mind that s 165(1) does not constitute a code of unreliable evidence. Section 165(2) provides that in a case before a jury, the judge is to give a direction if so requested, that the evidence may be unreliable. Subsections (3) to (6) qualify this requirement in certain respects.  
      
       
     43 Levine J, at J 64 dealt with the question of corroboration in a civil trial in the following terms: 
      
       
        
         
         “The trial judge in a civil action, as the fact finding tribunal, will give due weight to uncorroborated evidence but will bear in mind the fact that it is uncorroborated (which in the end may have no effect at all) in determining whether on the balance of probabilities the particular issue has been established. To ignore the absence of corroboration in a civil case where a grave allegation is made could give rise to a perceptible risk of the miscarriage of justice:  
         R v Longman (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 86:  
         not because it is a grave allegation of sexual misconduct, but because it is evidence standing alone without corroboration.” 
         
        
       
     44 Longman was a criminal case dealing with the question whether a warning should be given in respect of the uncorroborated evidence of the victim of sexual abuse. There were statutory provisions which governed the giving of warnings in such a case. The High Court held that notwithstanding that the statute in part prohibited the giving of a warning, a warning could still be given “where the particular circumstances of the case provide a justification”: per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 88–89. See also Deane J at 94-95 
      
       
     45 In R v Crampton (2000) 206 CLR 161 the High Court, in applying Longman, considered that a warning of the danger of convicting on uncorroborated evidence was justified – and it would seem required – where there was a delay in a complaint of sexual assault.  
      
       
     46 The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in his approach to corroboration by importing into this case, which is a civil case, principles which are applicable to the criminal law by transposing the ‘warning’ requirement, for which Longman and Crampton are authority, to a requirement of corroboration in the case of a grave allegation in a civil case.  
      
       
     47 Had his Honour’s comments at J 64 stood alone, there might have been an argument that his Honour considered that the absence of corroboration in the case of a grave allegation affected the quality of the evidence given. That would not necessarily be correct. Evidence of itself may be inherently credible or incredible. The work of corroborative evidence is to support the evidence of a particular witness. A witness’s evidence may require support before it is accepted because of some feature of the evidence itself – for example, the evidence may be in respect of an event which occurred many years previously or the witness may have proved so unsatisfactory that the trial judge determined that the witness’s evidence would not be accepted unless supported by other evidence. J 64 appears on its face to go beyond that. 
      
       
     48 It is apparent, however, from his Honour’s later remarks that he did approach the question of corroborative evidence correctly, in the way to which we have just referred. His Honour acknowledged that the need for a cautious approach to the acceptance of uncorroborated evidence in the criminal sphere is not based upon the ‘kind’ of evidence but on the circumstances of the case: Lane v the Queen (1996) 66 FCR 144. He specifically rejected the respondent’s submission that there is a need for caution by reason of the class of evidence, that is, that there is a need for caution in relation to “uncorroborated evidence of a complainant in a sexual offence case” [J 68]. 
      
       
     49 His Honour considered that it was appropriate in civil cases involving grave allegations to scrutinise the evidence with care: see Murray v R (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19, noting the different standard of proof involved. He said:  
      
       
        
         
         “The difference is, of course, that the trial judge will scrutinise the evidence with care, but by reason of experience would understand that taking into account the need for careful scrutiny does not mean that the evidence is unreliable, but rather that the exercise is to determine whether it is reliable before concluding the part it plays in the weighing of the probabilities.” [J 70] 
         
        
       
     50 His Honour concluded “the complainant’s evidence will be considered with care to determine its reliability and weight, not merely because it is unsupported evidence in a sexual complaint case” [J 73]. This comment is explained in the paragraphs which follow in his judgment, namely that there could be two circumstances which were relevant to the need for careful scrutiny – “delay in complaint” and a consideration of the question “why would the complainant lie”.  
      
       
     51 His Honour noted that in R v Crampton the High Court held that evidence of a complaint could not be adequately tested after a long passage of time, and that it would be dangerous to convict someone on such a complaint without scrutiny by the jury. However, the trial judge accepted the appellant’s submission that Crampton could be distinguished as this was a civil trial with a different standard of proof and these specific allegations had been able to be “explored” throughout the hearing. He noted, however, that the “antiquity” of the allegations remained relevant to the consideration of the evidence. We see no error in this approach. 
      
       
     52 As to the second matter “why would the complainant lie”, his Honour concluded that, in “the absence of litigation of an issue as to whether in fact the witness has a reason to lie or in fact lied”, it would be imprudent to consider the question of whether the witness would lie. Again there is no error in his Honour’s observation. 
      
       
     53 It is apparent from his Honour’s discussion of the emphasis to be placed on the presence or absence of corroborative evidence that he did not err in applying a criminal standard, rather he adopted a cautious approach in line with the gravity of the allegations. 
      
       
        
       Application of “an inappropriately high” standard of proof/gravity of the allegations 
       
     54 The appellant submitted that his Honour also erred in the standard of proof he applied to his fact finding exercise by placing undue emphasis on the “gravity” of the conduct alleged.  
      
       
     55 In the introductory remarks to his judgment the trial judge characterised the found imputations as serious allegations. He said [J 24]: 
      
       
        
         
         “This is a civil case. The [appellant] has pleaded the defence of ‘justification’ and the burden of proof rests on [the appellant]. As this is a civil case, the standard of proof is the ‘balance of probabilities’. That which the [appellant] has to prove in its defence of justification is the substantial proof of ‘grave allegations’. There is no escaping the allocation to those allegations (as captured by the found imputations) of the description ‘criminal’ conduct. However, any such description cannot derogate from the application of the civil standard of proof.” 
         
        
        
       His Honour referred to  
       Briginshaw v Briginshaw 
        (1938) 60 CLR 336 and  
       Neat Holdings Pty Limited v Karajan Holdings Pty Limited 
        (1993) 67 ALJR 170 at 170-1 (the  
       Briginshaw 
        test).  
        
       
     56 The appellant challenged this characterisation, submitting that given the respondent’s admitted lifestyle of casual and promiscuous sex the allegations were not grave or serious. We do not agree. The imputations involved allegations of criminal conduct of a type abhorred in our community. The allegations were of ‘knowing’ engagement in a criminal act with a 15 year old having administered drugs to the boy upon whom the criminal act was perpetrated and of engaging in criminal acts under, in effect, a screen of deliberately refraining from enquiring about the ages of the persons upon whom the criminal acts were perpetrated. The allegations were, unarguably, very serious. His Honour was correct in so characterising them and he was correct, therefore, to have regard to the Briginshaw test in his assessment of the evidence. 
      
       
     57 The principles in Briginshaw and Neat Holdings are well known but, given the importance of this submission to the appellant’s overall challenge to his Honour’s determination, they bear repeating.  
      
       
     58 In Briginshaw Dixon J said at 361-362: 
      
       
        
         
         “… when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. It cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality … it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.” 
         
        
       
     59 This was explained further in Neat Holdings where the Court stated at 170-171: 
      
       
        
         
         “The ordinary standard of proof required of a party who bears the onus in civil litigation in this country is proof on the balance of probabilities. That remains so even where the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct or fraud. On the other hand, the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove. Thus, authorative statements have often been made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary ‘where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found’. Statements to that effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proof. Rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct.” (citations removed) 
         
        
       
     60 Section 140 of the Evidence Act now statutorily enshrines the standard of proof on the balance of probabilities in a civil case. It further provides: 
      
       
        
         
         “(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.” 
         
        
       
     61 It is well accepted that the test to be applied under s 140(2)(c) is the Briginshaw test: see Pedler v Richardson (unreported, NSWSC, Young J, 16 October 1997); Wily v Fitz-Gibbon (unreported, FCA, Hill J, 2 March 1998); WK v SR (1997) 22 Fam LR 592 (Full Court of the Family Court). 
      
       
        
       Seeking guidance from the criminal law when dealing with the issue of knowledge 
       
     62 The appellant’s general submission that the trial judge erroneously sought guidance from the criminal law when dealing with the issue of knowledge was made in respect of Leary, Stevens, Lilburn, Stals, David Maynard, John Maynard and Kinchela: 
      
       
        
         
         “Nine of the … ten justification witnesses met the Respondent at beats where underage male prostitutes met customers. Most of the justification witnesses were of boyish appearance at the relevant time… [see, for example, Leary, Stevens, Lilburn, Stals]. Some told the Respondent their age… [David Maynard, John Maynard, Kinchela, Stevens].” 
         
        
       
     63 There is no appeal in respect of Leary, Stals, David Maynard, John Maynard and Kinchela. As the particular challenge to his Honour’s approach relating to knowledge is essentially confined to D18 it is more convenient to consider that challenge in the section dealing with D18. 
      
       
        
       Modus Operandi; Tendency Evidence 
       
     64 The appellant, as a feature of the manner in which it sought to prove its case, “constructed” a modus operandi of the respondent’s conduct. The trial judge rejected that approach. He said when setting out his reasons in respect of the witness Kinchela [J 1864]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The [appellant] sought to construct a ‘modus operandi’ against which the accounts of each of its complainants called to prove the truth case would be, as-it-were, judged. The problem with that approach of course is that the modus operandi itself depended to a very great extent upon acceptance of the evidence of the complainants.” 
         
        
       
     65 The appellant complains that this finding was wrong because the modus operandi upon which it relied was based upon the respondent’s own evidence [AS 36]. However, this submission fails to take into account his Honour’s further observation at J 1866 [AS 39]: 
      
       
        
         
         “As I have said above the modus operandi concept was based upon, as it had to be, either or of both matters admitted by [the respondent] and matters alleged by the complainants. If the complainants are not believed, then a great proportion of the so-called modus operandi disappears as does the basis for the assertion, that the probabilities favour the [appellant] because the asserted conduct conforms with the modus operandi.” 
         
        
       
     66 To the extent that the appellant’s submission overlooks this passage we reject it. It is our view, however, that the modus operandi argument had the potential of misdirecting the parties and ultimately the court’s attention from the real issue, which was whether a particular witness’ evidence could, on the whole of the evidence, be believed. To that extent, elements of the “modus operandi construct” were relevant as evidence potentially corroborative of the evidence of individual witnesses. We deal with that question as we consider the evidence overall. 
      
       
     67 There are two other matters with which it is convenient to deal first. One is whether his Honour erroneously approached the assessment of the evidence of various witnesses by rejecting it if it did not fit the modus operandi. It is necessary to go to individual examples to determine whether this submission is made out. 
      
       
     68 In the case of the witness Stevens, for example, his Honour concluded at J 1381: 
      
       
        
         
         “The event described by Mr Stevens is extraordinarily different from the events described by any other complainant. Insofar as there exists any template or modus operandi in the [respondent] save for what I describe as the ‘pick up’ everything otherwise falls outside of any standard procedure.” 
         
        
       
     69 We see no error in his Honour’s remarks. 
      
       
     70 His Honour’s remarks in respect of Kinchela are more problematic. We have already quoted J 1866 above. 
      
       
     71 This passage seems to indicate that his Honour’s approach to determining whether the imputations were made out depended upon him being satisfied that the modus operandi was established through each witness. To the extent that his Honour found that “an element” of the modus operandi was missing or different from that alleged, it appears his Honour used that as a factor when assessing, always adversely, the credit of the appellant’s witnesses. This carries with it a danger that a witness’ evidence might be tested against a pre-determined set of facts or formula, rather than determining whether a witness’ evidence assessed in conjunction with any or all the evidence, including any corroborative evidence, should be accepted.  
      
       
     72 For example, in the case of D20, his Honour stated in his Conclusions [J 2869]: 
      
       
        
         
         “D20 said he was picked upon in a Mercedes; [the respondent] had a Mercedes. It was chauffeur driven; [the respondent] had a driver. The driver gave evidence that it was not his habit or usual function to drive [the respondent] to ‘beats’ and did not do so. [The respondent] gave evidence that he did not pick up casual sexual partners at El Alamein Fountain. The [appellant’s] submission that this falls into the modus operandi of the [respondent] of course depends upon that modus operandi having otherwise been established. It is not as I have found in relation to other witness who have said that that was the place where they were picked up.” 
         
        
       
     73 At J 2875, he said: 
      
       
        
         
         “As to the sexual activity itself it was as between a practising homosexual and a casual sexual partner unremarkable except that D20 said that he was ‘the top’ albeit unsuccessfully as I understand it. The casual sexual partner being ‘the top’ does not fit in with any template or ‘modus operandi’ advanced for the [appellant].” 
         
        
       
     74 This conclusion, we believe, demonstrates the danger to which we have just adverted – namely, unless a witness’ evidence fitted the modus operandi precisely, his Honour considered that the account of the witness was thereby diminished. However, it should not be overlooked that it was the appellant that urged upon his Honour that conformance of the witness’ account with the appellant’s version of modus operandi supported acceptance of that evidence. His Honour was entitled to consider the extent to which there was disconformance in determining whether or not to accept the witness’ account. 
      
       
     75 Another example can be found in his Honour’s treatment of the evidence of David Maynard. He said at J 248: 
      
       
        
         
         “I find it to be bizarre and in no way conformable with any ‘modus operandi’ or sexual practice on the part of the [respondent].” 
         
        
       
     76 We include this passage by way of illustration only. The appellant did not rely upon the evidence of either John or David Maynard on the appeal. We add that there was no appeal in relation to Kinchela.  
      
       
     77 We deal more fully with both these issues as and when they arise in relation to the individual witnesses. It is necessary at this point to deal with the various justification witnesses.  
      
       
        
       Admissions by Conduct 
       
     78 This was an area upon which the appellant relied in support of its justification case. No complaint is made that his Honour misstated the principles which govern an ‘Admissions by Conduct’ case. However, as it is an area relevant to several of the witnesses it is convenient at this point in our reasons to consider the general principles which apply. 
      
       
     79 His Honour’s preliminary analysis of the case the appellant sought to make under this heading is found at J 44-46, and J 48: 
      
       
        
         
         “44 The defendant submits that the evidence establishes attempting to suborn witnesses or potential witnesses and thus constitutes an admission of the relevant allegations. The evidence establishes, the defendant submits, the plaintiff inducing, or attempting to induce, especially in a secret manner, witnesses to commit a wrongful act such as giving false evidence: that constitutes the suborning of the witnesses. 
          
          
         45 I shall come in due course to the evidence of the alleged suborning. It is the defendant’s position, however, that I should find that the plaintiff attempted to suborn eight witnesses for the purposes of preventing each of them being called to give evidence by the defendant, and to interfere with and inhibit the preparation of the defendant’s case on justification in order to prevent the Court from “ 
         discovering the truth 
         ” of the issues raised in that case advanced by the defendant.  
          
          
         46 Further, the defendant contends that the conduct of the plaintiff in relation to two documents, the making of a statutory declaration by a witness and the procuring of a letter from his (the witness) solicitors to the defendant’s solicitors was done for the purpose of preventing that witness being called and of interfering with the defendant’s case. 
          
          
         … 
          
          
         48 The submission is that upon the appropriate findings being made on the evidence, the only explanation of the plaintiff’s conduct is that the plaintiff acknowledged the truth of the matters raised in the defendant’s case on justification, in respect of which testimony would be led from the eight witnesses referred to, and that the plaintiff did not believe that his case had sufficient strength for the Court to accept his version of the events in answer to the testimony of those witnesses.” 
         
        
       
     80 His Honour considered that the allegations involving the Admissions by Conduct were “grave” and that “gravity”, “as required by s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995, will be taken into account”. 
      
       
     81 As no error is alleged in his Honour’s statement of the law which underlies the circumstances in which conduct may amount to an admission, it is sufficient to refer to the statement of Phillimore J in R v Watt at 853: 
      
       
        
         
         “… the conduct in the litigation of a party to it, if it is such as to lead to the reasonable inference that he disbelieved in his own case, may be proved and used as evidence against him. 
         
        
        
         
         The principle is well stated by Sir Alfred Wills, until lately Wills J, in his edition of his father’s work upon circumstantial evidence, ‘[a]mongst the most forcible of presumptive indications may be more than all attempts to pollute or distort the current of truth and justice or to prevent a fair and impartial trial,  
         by endeavours to intimidate, suborn, bribe, or otherwise tamper with the  
         prosecutor, or  
         the witnesses 
         , or the officers or ministers of justice, the concealment, suppression, destruction, or alteration of any article of real evidence;  
         any of which acts clearly brought home to the prisoner or his agents, are of a more prejudicial effect as denoting on his part a consciousness of guilt, and a desire to evade the pressure of facts tending to establish it’ 
         .” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     82 Lies may also amount to an admission by conduct. The question as to when this is the case more frequently arises in a criminal case than in a civil case and in that context is often considered under the label of ‘corroborative evidence’ – that is as evidence which can be used by the Crown in aid of proof of guilt.  
      
       
     83 The authorities caution that particular care has to be taken when directing a jury as to the circumstances in which a lie may amount to corroboration. In Buck v R (1982) 8 A Crim R 208, Burt CJ said at 214: 
      
       
        
         
         “A jury, in my opinion, requires a very careful direction upon the circumstances in which a lie told by an accused person in or out of court can amount to corroboration. It has been said that to be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie must be deliberate, it must relate to a material issue, the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of truth and the lie must be established as such by evidence independent of the witness to be corroborated or by admission made by the accused.” 
         
        
       
     84 This statement was approved in R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697 at 701. In that case, after referring to Buck, Street CJ said: 
      
       
        
         
         “… reliance by the Crown on collateral conduct eloquent of guilt, such as flight or a lie, is fraught with the risk of miscarriage. The link between such conduct and the crime in question must be demonstrable.” 
         
        
       
     85 It is important, however, to remember that there is a distinction between lies which may constitute an admission of guilt and lies which merely go to credit: see R v Lucas [1981] QB 720 at 724; R v Liddy (2002) 81 SASR 22 at 90 (para 241). In Lucas the Court noted that people: 
      
       
        
         
         “… sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family.” 
         
        
       
     86 The principle it would seem is equally applicable to lies told in Court: see Lucas at 724; “Can Lies Corroborate”, Professor J D Heydon (as he then was) (1973) 89 LQR 552 at 561. 
      
       
     87 The authorities to which we have just referred are criminal ones. In R v Liddy, Mullighan J said at para 242-243: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is unnecessary to set out the circumstances in which a deliberate lie told by an accused person may amount to positive evidence of guilt as opposed to adversely reflecting upon the accused’s credibility. The telling of relevant lies is a piece of circumstantial evidence from which an adverse inference of guilt may be drawn if the lie is told out of a consciousness of guilt and no other rational inference may be drawn.” 
         
        
       
     88 The concept that “no other rational inference may be drawn” is a concept of the criminal law, necessitated by the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. In a civil case, it is sufficient in our view for a lie to be accepted as an admission of guilt, if that is the more probable inference to be drawn. In this regard we adopt the like approach taken by the trial judge to the adoption of the knowledge test in Pereira v Director of Public Prosecutions (1988) 63 ALJR 1 (to which we come later in these reasons) to the civil sphere. That adoption is not only appropriate but necessary to accommodate the differing standard of proof. 
      
       
        
       Appellate Review  
       
     89 It is now necessary to consider the appeal as it relates to the individual witnesses.  
      
       
     90 Before embarking upon that process, however, it is important to understand the nature of the appellate task we are undertaking, not only in relation to the justification defence but generally in relation to the appeal. In the first place it is necessary to find appellable error. More significantly for present purposes, however, is what should follow if appellable error has been made out. There is no question that if appellate interference is called for in relation to justification in this case, the only possible order is for a new trial, in whole or part. However, Pt 51 r 23(1) of the Supreme Court Rules provides that a new trial shall not be ordered “unless it appears to the Court of Appeal that some substantial wrong or miscarriage has been thereby occasioned”. 
      
       
     91 Adopting for convenience extracts from the annotations to Pt 51 r 23(1), it can be said relevantly, that: 
      
       
        
         
         “In order to satisfy the court that there has been a substantial wrong or miscarriage it is not necessary to show affirmatively that the result of the trial was in fact affected by the error:  
         Ashley v Schonberger 
           
         [1968] VR 22

         ;  
         Holford v Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Co Ltd 
          [1909] VLR 497 at 527. However, a new trial ought not to be ordered if the court is satisfied that the error in the conduct of the first trial did not really bear upon the result:  
         Freeman v G J Coles & Co Ltd 
          [1967] 1 NSWR 297;  
         Coroneo v Kurri Kurri and South Maitland Amusement Co Ltd 
          (1934) 51 CLR 328 at 345 (not sufficient merely to raise a doubt about the correctness of the first trial).” 
         
        
       
     92 In Freeman v G J Coles & Co Ltd (1967) 1 NSWR 297 the plaintiff claimed damages in a slipping case. He said he reported the accident to a person who claimed to be the manager of the shop. Evidence was admitted as to the result of enquiries made by the defendant in an attempt to find the person to whom the plaintiff said he reported the accident. It was held by two of the judges, the third not deciding, that the evidence was admissible. All three judges said that if it was not admissible there should not be a new trial.  
      
       
     93 Herron CJ said at 300 (Sugerman JA agreeing): 
      
       
        
         
         “The result, however, of all the authorities seems to be this: a new trial ought not to be ordered if the court is satisfied that if the rejected evidence had been received, it could not have affected the jury’s verdict. The same rule applies in cases where the evidence has been improperly admitted. What has to be looked at is the essential justice of the case, and for the appellate Court to see whether the error of the judge, if there was one, really bore upon the ultimate result.  
         In this case, having regard to the way in which it was conducted and to the essential issue of whether the plaintiff was to be accepted, or whether the defendant’s evidence was to be accepted as to the happening of the accident, I myself would have decided, if it had been necessary, that the act of the judge in admitting the evidence would not have affected the verdict 
         .” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     94 Walsh JA said (also at 300): 
      
       
        
         
         “Whilst in theory I recognize that if the evidence was wrongly admitted it could have had some bearing on the question whether the jury would accept the appellant’s version or not, I think that in reality and in substance this is a case in which the Court can confidently say it is satisfied that the rejection of the evidence instead of its admission could not have affected the ultimate result of this case.” 
         
        
       
     95 There is some reference to substantial wrong or miscarriage in Goldsmith v Sandilands (2002) 76 ALJR 1024. At trial the plaintiff was refused leave to reopen to lead certain evidence. Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said the refusal was correct as the evidence went only to credit, while acknowledging the difficulty of characterising the evidence. Kirby J considered that there was error, while regarding the case as borderline (para 72). His Honour went on to say (para 73) that the error was “not of a degree that caused the trial to miscarry or such as to have the necessary bearing on the outcome of the trial or the crucial issue of fact in the trial”. The reasons for this (at para 74) were rather intricate but included: 
      
       
        
         
         “Whilst the precise way that the rebutting evidence might have influenced the primary decision-maker can never be known, because it was excluded, that is not the test. The issue is not whether the Commissioner could have been persuaded to change his mind about the issue of credibility but rather whether objectively such a change of opinion might  
         possibly 
          have followed if such evidence had been admitted”.  
         
        
        
       It was said that  
       “it would be unreasonable to conclude that a change of decision on credibility might have been reached” 
       .  
        
       
     96 There are a multitude of cases on the point and as might be expected, there are shades of opinion in the various authorities. The evaluation of whether there has been a miscarriage can be different when dealing with the inscrutable verdict of a jury, on the one hand, or the reasoned conclusion of a judge, on the other hand, since the possible effect of the error in question can be better assessed in the latter case. Overall, however, such burden as there is on an appellant who successfully establishes error is not very heavy. If the court can be satisfied that the error did not affect the result, then it will follow that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage. That may be because in any event the right result was reached, or because the significance of the error was minimal. If the court can not so conclude, however, the flavour seems to be that it is difficult to hold that there was not a substantial wrong or miscarriage. It may be that nothing much more sophisticated than the formulation in Freeman v G J Coles & Co Ltd can be reached, namely whether the error “really bore upon the ultimate result”.  
      
       
     97 We now turn to the individual justification witnesses. They were Tony Homes, Jason Lilburn, D20, D18, Jason Stevens and Steven Elomari. We will deal with each in turn. 
      
       
        
       HOMES 
       
     98 Tony Homes was called as a witness in the appellant’s justification case to prove the substantial truth of the Today Tonight imputation 1(a) and the Witness imputation 1(a).  
      
       
     99 Tony Homes was originally named Patrick Alan Murphy and is an older brother of Les Murphy. He changed his name by Deed Poll in 1987 to Tony Patrick Homes although he had used other names from time to time. He has an extensive criminal record including for offences of dishonesty and violence. He has served numerous prison sentences.  
      
       
     100 Homes said that he first began “getting into trouble” when he was about 11 and by the time he was 13 years old had gravitated to Kings Cross in company with his brothers, Les and Garry [T 5027]. He was employed at Costello’s at 2 Kellett Street, Kings Cross, in between prison terms, from 1976 to 1978. He was then 14 to 16 years old.  
      
       
     101 Homes gave evidence that in June or July 1978, when he was working at Costello’s, he saw the respondent, at Costello’s, having anal intercourse with his brother Les Murphy. Les Murphy is a notorious convicted murderer in this state. Both the respondent and Les Murphy denied such an event took place. According to each they did not meet until sometime between 1997 and 1999 [J 488]. The respondent also denied he had ever been to Costello’s [J 488] and called evidence to support this assertion [J 494; J 465]. 
      
       
     102 His Honour rejected Homes’ evidence [J 640], essentially on the basis that he did not accept him as a witness of truth. His Honour said [J 639]: 
      
       
        
         
         “One matter in particular affected my view of Mr Homes. This was a witness whose demeanour made an adverse impact upon me as the trial judge. As the [respondent] submitted Mr Homes in cross-examination resorted to ‘smart alec’ answers and responses to the point where I felt at the time that that evidence was given he was being flippant, irresponsible and totally unreliable.” 
         
        
       
     103 The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in his approach to the task of assessing, on the balance of probabilities, whether what Homes said he observed did in fact occur [AS 367]. The appellant alleged three specific errors [AS 368]: 
      
       
        
       (i) the trial judge failed to give proper weight to Homes’ evidence of identification of the respondent (Grounds 3 and 4); 
        
        
       (ii) the trial judge failed to deal properly with issues relating to the respondent’s credit and the credit of Les Murphy (Grounds 1, 2, 6 and 7); and 
        
        
       (iii) the trial judge failed to give proper weight to Homes’ and other evidence concerning the respondent’s sexual behaviour and modus operandi (Grounds 1, 5 and 8). 
        
       
     104 The respondent submitted that these alleged errors failed to come to grips with the fundamental issue, namely, that his Honour made an adverse demeanour based credit finding against Homes, and given the evidence of other witnesses, did not believe Homes that the incident occurred. It followed, on this submission, that the finding was protected unless the appellant was able to overcome the Abalos principle. The respondent submitted that the appellant did not even attempt to do so.  
      
       
        
       Identification Evidence 
       
     105 Homes said that he recognised the respondent as being the person whom he saw having intercourse with his brother because he had been introduced to him previously, in 1976, at his home at Campbelltown in the company of Stacey Fenton and had subsequently seen the respondent at Costello’s on a number of occasions, both in the bar on the first floor and in the sauna/brothel section on the second floor. 
      
       
     106 Homes’ evidence as to identification is one of the areas where the appellant makes a larger attack on his Honour’s judicial method. We have already dealt with that larger attack. However, it is necessary to consider the particular matters upon which the appellant relies in respect of Homes’ identification evidence. 
      
       
     107 The respondent denied he had ever been to Costello’s or even heard of it until its existence was revealed during the Wood Royal Commission in the 1990s. The trial judge accepted the first part of this denial, although he doubted the second. His acceptance of the respondent’s denial that he had ever been to Costello’s necessarily involved the rejection of Homes’ evidence that he had witnessed the respondent having underage sex with his brother at Costello’s. It followed that his Honour rejected Homes’ identification evidence. There were a number of reasons why he did so.  
      
       
     108 First, he found Homes’ evidence to be flawed [J 629]. In particular, he doubted his evidence that he met the respondent in 1976 when he was introduced to him by Stacey Fenton, a young male prostitute who worked at Costello’s and who was a friend of the respondent’s, at Campbelltown, before he witnessed him having sexual intercourse with his brother [AS 104]. That evidence was, on his Honour’s finding, a “late component of the appellant’s case” [J 521]. That finding was based on the difference between Homes’ evidence and the particulars the appellant had supplied in respect of Homes, namely that [J 498]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The first occasion when … (Homes) met the [respondent] was on the first floor of Costello’s before the cubicles were built on the second floor. 
         
        
        
         
         (Homes) met the [respondent] at the front end of Costello’s in the bar. The barman at the time was Phillip Russell.” 
         
        
       
     109 When Homes came to give the evidence to which we have just referred, senior counsel for the appellant introduced the evidence by stating [J 497]: 
      
       
        
         
         “the information came to me during the course of a conference today.” 
         
        
       
     110 His Honour’s comment that this was a “late component of the appellant’s case” implied that this evidence had been recently invented. A finding of recent invention is, of course, an adverse finding as to the witness’ credibility on that issue. It was legitimate for his Honour to take the difference between the particulars and the evidence into account in determining whether to accept Homes’ evidence on this point.  
      
       
     111 Further, the identification evidence in respect of the introduction at Campbelltown was spare in its detail. Homes did not describe the person to whom he was introduced. The only descriptive element of the meeting was that the respondent was “walking towards the door with just a throw rug around him, like a dressing gown sort of thing” (T 5042). This description in its bare terms even lacked the element of a named introduction [J 630, 496]. Homes gave no details of the respondent’s home where he said he was introduced. He gave no details of how he got there other than saying “I went there to pick up my friend Stacey Fenton” (T 5039), “I got there early in the morning” (T 5042). Homes was 13 years old when this was said to have occurred.  
      
       
     112 The appellant placed considerable emphasis upon the respondent’s failure to cross-examine Homes on this evidence, asserting that Homes’ evidence should therefore have been believed.  
      
       
     113 It is well accepted that the absence of cross-examination is relevant in determining whether to accept evidence or not. However, it does not compel the acceptance of that evidence. As Samuels JA said in Paric v John Holland Constructions Pty Ltd [1984] 2 NSWLR 505 at 507: 
      
       
        
         
         “While I do not think that it would be right to conclude that the absence of cross-examination entails the acceptance of the evidence given, it certainly enables that evidence to be regarded by any tribunal of fact with a greater degree of assurance than might otherwise have been the case.” 
         
        
       
     114 His Honour was not prepared to accept the evidence of the introduction at Campbelltown. He was not in error in so doing. He did not find the evidence inherently persuasive [J 496]. That finding was open to him and not surprising, given the nature of the evidence given. His Honour also placed emphasis upon the lateness of the allegation. The evidence had the hallmarks of recent invention and his Honour was entitled to treat it as such. [J 521]  
      
       
     115 The second circumstance of prior identification relied upon by the appellant was that Homes had seen the respondent at Costello’s in the bar area on a number of occasions during 1976. The bar was on the first floor in 1976. It was moved to the second floor during 1978 [T 5043]. Homes was extensively and successfully cross-examined by senior counsel for the respondent. He was rejected as a witness of credit. There was other evidence called by both parties seeking to prove or disprove the appellant’s case that the respondent visited Costello’s. His Honour’s finding on this was also challenged by the appellant and we deal with it shortly. However, his Honour’s rejection of Homes’ evidence on this issue (and generally) was a matter for his Honour and has not been demonstrated to be in error. As with many of the appellant’s submissions, it was a submission that his Honour was wrong to have disbelieved the witness. This is not appellable error. 
      
       
     116 Once the evidence of the Campbelltown meeting and the evidence of the sighting at Costello’s is rejected there is no basis for the appellant’s complaint, finally encapsulated in AS 104, that:  
      
       
        
         
         “The trial judge rejected Homes’ identification of the Respondent at Costello’s, making no allowance for the fact that Homes had met the Respondent before he witnessed the Respondent having sexual intercourse with an underage male” 
         
        
        
       The task which confronted his Honour was to decide whether to accept the evidence of prior contact or not. The appellant’s submission implied that the evidence had to be accepted. That is not so. His Honour considered the evidence and did not accept it. That is quite different from his Honour making  
       “no allowance” 
        for the fact Homes had met the respondent before having sexual intercourse with an underage male. 
        
        
       Rejection of Homes as a Witness of Credit 
       
     117 His Honour found other weaknesses in Homes’ evidence. He considered him “flippant, irresponsible and totally unreliable”. That was a demeanour based finding [J 639]. It has not been shown to be wrong within the Abalos principle. 
      
       
     118 His Honour also considered that Homes’ allegation that he had observed the respondent having sex with his brother was a recent invention [J 503; J 638]. This finding was based upon the fact that Homes, in a recorded interview on 14 September 1996 in which he said that “what I’m about to talk about is the truth” [Blue 820] and “I’ll name some people and some ages” [Blue 822], made no mention of the respondent’s alleged abuse of his brother, notwithstanding that he named other persons whom the respondent had abused and referred to his brother having commenced working as a prostitute at Costello’s “when he was pretty young” [Blue 828] and “doing it pretty hard, knowing his life was tied up in a vicious circle” [Blue 830]. This was a good foundation for the finding. 
      
       
        
       The Costello’s Evidence 
       
     119 Both parties called evidence in relation to Costello’s. The appellant called Raymond Leary and Phillip Russell. Leary was a justification witness. He said he had had four sexual encounters with the respondent, three of them at Costello’s, two of those occasions being in 1973 and the other in 1976 [J 196-J 200]. The respondent denied any sexual encounter with him. Leary was not accepted by the trial judge and there is no appeal in respect of that finding.  
      
       
     120 Russell was the barman at Costello’s around early 1972 or 1973 and who worked there “on and off for 10 years” [J 327; T 397]. He said he saw the respondent frequent the club “for years” [J 329; T 3978]. He first saw him coming to the club “probably about 1973 I suppose” [J 329]. He saw arrangements being made between the respondent and McKnight who was 14 at the time [J 339]. He also saw the respondent with other young men including Pearce, Fenton and Lewis [J 341]. McKnight and Pearce were both called as justification witnesses alleging sexual contact with the respondent when each was underage. McKnight alleged that he had sexual contact with the respondent at Costello’s in the period June/July 1978. The trial judge rejected McKnight’s evidence and there is no appeal from that finding. 
      
       
     121 Pearce said he was child prostitute at Kings Cross and on occasions worked at Costello’s. His evidence varied as to when he had sexual contact with the respondent. His initial allegation was made in a statutory declaration supplied to Deidre Grusovin, in which he alleged that when he was about 15 years old he was picked up by the respondent at the Rex Hotel. He appeared on the Witness programme and made similar allegations. During the course of his evidence Pearce was asked his age when he first had sex with the respondent. He said he was “23, 24 years of age”. He was subsequently ruled an unfavourable witness under s 38 of the Evidence Act and his Honour’s ultimate finding was that he had “no capacity to discriminate between truth and falsity”. There is no appeal from his Honour’s finding.  Relevantly, however, for present purposes, Pearce did not at any time make any allegation of a sexual encounter with the respondent at Costello’s. Indeed, his evidence was that he had never seen the respondent at Costello’s. It follows then that his evidence did not support Russell’s evidence.  
      
       
     122 The respondent called evidence from six persons to support his case that he had never been to Costello’s [J 494].  
      
       
     123 One witness, Ms Annette Crowe, a social worker, routinely visited Costello’s in her professional capacity from late 1978/early 1979 to the end of 1982/early 1983 twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays and sometimes on other nights as well, between about 9pm and 6am. She never saw the respondent on any occasion of her visits there [J 561]. Nor did she ever hear any reference to him either by his name or nickname (Madge) [J 563]. His Honour found that “the fact she did not, strongly supports [the respondent’s] denial” [J 561]. Ms Crowe said she first met the respondent in the mid eighties but did not recognise him as someone she had met before. She knew Homes, Les Murphy, Pearce, Stringer and Russell who all had an involvement with Costello’s in some way or another [J 563]. There was no suggestion that Ms Crowe was other than an ‘independent’ witness. 
      
       
     124 The appellant submitted Ms Crowe’s evidence was irrelevant as it related to a period after the alleged incident. However, the appellant’s case was (and it was never disputed) that the respondent’s ‘lifestyle’ including casual sex with persons picked up at ‘beats’ spanned a considerable period. If the respondent was a ‘regular’ at a place like Costello’s, as Homes alleged, it is possible and might even be likely that he would become known, by sight or reputation, to someone like Ms Crowe, who was a regular visitor and whose work was concerned with the welfare of male prostitutes who worked there.  
      
       
     125 The appellant’s submission that Ms Crowe’s evidence was irrelevant involved the proposition that having been a ‘regular’ at Costello’s, at least until July 1978, the respondent stopped going there by late 1978 and his name was never mentioned by anyone. This does not fit with the picture attempted to be portrayed of the respondent in the appellant’s case. Ms Crowe’s evidence was relevant to the question whether the respondent had ever visited Costello’s. It was then a question of the weight to be attached to it. That was a matter for his Honour. 
      
       
     126 The other witnesses, Carlos Azzarradel, Jon Clark, Robert Thompson, Derek Cook and Noel Shinkwin, were patrons and/or employees of Costello’s at varying times throughout the period 1974 to 1980. All gave evidence that they had never seen the respondent there. Thompson was acquainted with MacLean, Stringer, Marshall-Moore and Shinkwin – all supposedly part of a paedophile ring, of which the respondent was allegedly a member [J 581]. It is not necessary to deal with the detail of the evidence of these witnesses. It is set out in his Honour’s judgment at J 569 – J 586.  
      
       
     127 The appellant submitted that his Honour erred in placing weight on these witnesses. It was submitted that other than Shinkwin, none had attended at Costello’s at the time of the incident witnessed by Homes, that is June or July 1978. It further pointed out that the respondent did not meet Marshall-Moore until 1983. The appellant’s submission is correct in the sense that, except for Shinkwin, none gave evidence of visiting or being at Costello’s in June/July 1978. However, they each gave evidence of being at Costello’s at varying times around this period. For example, Clark was a regular patron at Costello’s from about March 1974 until early 1975 and Avzarradel commenced working there in August 1978.  
      
       
     128 The trial judge was aware of the limitations of the evidence called by the respondent on this issue. He said at J 575: 
      
       
        
         
         “It is for the [appellant] to prove the [respondent] was at Costello’s at the times relevant to the Leary/McKnight/Les Murphy incidents. The [respondent] said he was never there and called such evidence as he did, not to prove the unprovable (his never being there) but to provide material of varying degrees of weight to aid in the determination of the probabilities of what the [appellant] asserts to have been the facts” 
         
        
       
     129 In dealing with the evidence he accorded it the weight it deserved. For example, when dealing with Clark’s evidence he said:  
      
       
        
         
         “Given the hours he attended Costello’s, it is arguable that little weight should attach to his testimony. Be that as it may what he said will go into the scales.” [J 575] 
         
        
       
     130 Accordingly we do not see that his Honour erred in the consideration he gave to this evidence or in the weight he gave to it.  
      
       
     131 It also has to be borne in mind that there was a range of evidence relating to Costello’s which extended beyond Homes’ allegation in relation to Murphy. That evidence included the evidence of Leary, Russell, McKnight and Pearce, referred to above, which related to different periods. The evidence called by the respondent to support his case that he had never been there was called in relation to all the allegations against him and was not confined to the period relevant to Homes’ allegation.  
      
       
        
       Respondent’s Credit 
       
     132 The appellant also submitted that the trial judge should have made adverse credit findings against the respondent and Les Murphy, given no weight to their denials and accepted Homes’ evidence of the events he observed. [AS 393] 
      
       
     133 The appellant makes two points. First, that no weight should have been placed on the respondent’s denial in light of the number of adverse credit findings made in relation to his evidence. Strictly, this submission is misconceived. His Honour was faced with two conflicting pieces of evidence. Homes said he saw the appellant at Costello’s having homosexual intercourse with his brother. The respondent said he had never been to Costello’s and had not had homosexual intercourse with Les Murphy. Accordingly, on this aspect of the case, it was not a matter of attaching weight to the denial. It was a matter of determining whether he believed Homes or the respondent. In assessing whether he accepted Homes’ evidence, his Honour was required to assess the respondent’s denial.  
      
       
     134 The respondent’s denial was directly supported by Les Murphy who denied the incident occurred. If his Honour accepted Homes, he would have found the incident occurred. Conversely, if he did not accept Homes and accepted the respondent’s evidence, he would not have accepted that the incident occurred. There was no other alternative. However, it was a matter for his Honour to determine what evidence he accepted. He did not accept Homes’ evidence. It followed that he accepted the respondent’s denial. The appellant has not demonstrated any error in his Honour’s rejection of that evidence. Its submission really rises no higher than saying that there were aspects of the respondent’s evidence found by his Honour not to be credible, accordingly none of his evidence should be believed. That is not appellable error. We consider the submission that his Honour failed to deal with the respondent’s credit as a separate issue in these reasons. However, the particular submission made here has not, on our view, been made out. 
      
       
     135 The second point raised by the appellant in this submission is that his Honour found part of the respondent’s evidence, that he had not heard of Costello’s in the 1970s, to be “improbable” but failed to give that adverse finding “reasonable operation and effect”. This submission is really encompassed in the next point made by the appellant, namely that his Honour made inconsistent findings in respect of the respondent’s evidence on this issue. On the one hand he found the respondent’s evidence that he did not know about Costello’s and had not been there to be credible [J 554; J 559]. On the other hand, he found that Costello’s was “notorious” [J 589] and had reservations about the respondent’s assertion that he had never heard of Costello’s “as it seems improbable” [J 643], but concluded at J 644: 
      
       
        
         
         “But  
         if  
         I do not accept the [respondent] when he asserts that he had not heard of it, it does not follow that I must reject his statement that he never went there; that I must reject his reasons for never having gone there; and that therefore I should come to the conclusion that he was there, not only generally, but also in connection with the three specific events the subject of Mr Leary, Mr Russell/McKnight and Mr Homes/Murphy components.’ 
         
        
       
     136 The appellant submitted that his Honour should have extended his finding that it was improbable that the respondent had never heard of Costello’s to a finding that it was improbable he had never been there [AS 402]. It was said that in assessing the weight to be given to the respondent’s denials, his Honour should have taken into account his finding that Costello’s was notorious, and given no weight to the respondent’s denials [AS 403]. To the extent that we have already commented on the trial judge’s entitlement to accept evidence, reject evidence and accord it weight as he considered appropriate, those comments apply equally to this submission. His Honour assessed the respondent’s evidence and rejected part of it. That did not compel him to reject other parts as this submission suggests. His Honour rejected such evidence as placed the respondent there in the 1970’s. He had good grounds for doing so. Accordingly we reject the appellant’s submission on this point.  
      
       
        
       Inconsistency Within Trial Judge’s Credit Findings 
       
     137 The appellant next submitted that the trial judge’s treatment of its evidence in relation to Costello’s contained within it an internal inconsistency which, had his Honour recognised it, may have affected his acceptance of the respondent’s evidence that he had never been there. This submission is an extension of the submission just discussed. 
      
       
     138 The respondent said that the first he had heard of Costello’s was during the course of the Wood Royal Commission in the 1990s. If that was accepted it followed that he had never been there in the 1970s. His evidence was that he had never been there at all.  
      
       
     139 However, in the course of his cross-examination the following evidence emerged [T 7140-T 7143]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q If you knew in the 1970’s of the existence of Costello’s, can you think of any reason why you wouldn’t have gone there? 
         
        
        
         
         A No.  
          If I had known it existed in the 1970’s as a gay club, not as an underage thing or anything like that, as a gay club, there is absolutely not one reason why, if I had been in Sydney late, I wouldn’t have gone there 
         . Probably the only minus is that the research we have done, is it didn’t open until between 10.30 and 11, and that’s just a wee late for me to be out. I like to get up at 4 o’clock, and I don’t think I would be floating into Sydney with an hour to go home. There is no reason why I would have gone. (emphasis added).  
         
        
        
         
         Q There would be no reason you wouldn’t get involved? 
         
        
        
         
         A Except for the reason about the time. 
         
        
        
         
         Q That assumes that Costello’s was closed until it opened at 10 or 11 at night? 
         
        
        
         
         A That was what my research revealed from reading the Wood Royal Commission. 
         
        
        
         
         Q If in fact Costello’s was opened in much more liberal hours than that, there would have been no reason why you wouldn’t have gone there, would there? 
         
        
        
         
         A No reason whatsoever, sir.’ 
         
        
       
     140 The appellant’s submission on this point again involved two aspects. First, it submitted that it was inconsistent to believe the appellant’s denial that he had been to Costello’s but to doubt his evidence that he had never heard of it. We have already dealt with that point.  
      
       
     141 The second aspect was that, in accepting the respondent’s denial, he in effect “quarantined” that part of the evidence which he considered was “improbable”, so that it had no effect on his determination whether to accept the respondent’s denial that he had never been there [AS 401]. Again, we have dealt with that submission above. However, the appellant seeks to further support this argument by the evidence emphasised above, apparently as indicating that if it was accepted that he knew about Costello’s, it should be inferred that he would have gone there and it followed, his Honour should thereby have found that he did go to Costello’s in the 1970’s. Once the argument is expressed in this sequence it is apparent that it has no legal logic.  
      
       
     142 The appellant’s submission has another problem. The evidence relied upon was qualified. The respondent said one thing that would have stopped him going to Costello’s was its operating hours. It was suggested that if the hours were not as the respondent assumed they were, there was no reason he would not have gone there. The appellant did not, in this line of questioning directly put to the respondent what the operating hours were, although there was other evidence on the point. However, if the appellant intended to fix the respondent with an admission on this evidence, it was incumbent on it to put the matter expressly to him to allow him deal with: see the principle in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 to which we refer more fully below. The appellant failed to do so. It cannot now complain that his Honour should have made an express finding on a matter which was not fully put to the witness. In any event, even had the matter been put fully to the respondent, the evidence would not have compelled the conclusion sought by the appellant.  
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
       
     143 Having regard to the conclusions which we have expressed in relation to the various challenges made by the appellant to his Honour’s findings in respect of Homes, it is sufficient for us to merely record at this point that we reject each of the grounds of appeal in relation to Homes.  
      
       
        
       LILBURN 
       
     144 Jason Lilburn was called as a witness in the appellant’s justification case to prove the substantial truth of the Today Tonight imputation 1(a) and both the Witness programme imputations.  
      
       
     145 Lilburn was born on 17 September 1975. He has an extensive criminal record, commencing in 1991 whilst still a juvenile, and has served periods in juvenile detention centres and in prison. At the time of giving evidence Lilburn was serving a period of imprisonment in Queensland [J 778]. 
      
       
     146 Lilburn first gave information concerning the respondent to the NSW Police in 1998. On 28 May 1998, when an inmate of the Kirkconnell Correctional Centre, he gave a signed statement (exhibit 74) [Blue 286] to Detective Sergeant Panich from the NSW Child Protection Enforcement Agency. On 5 June 1998 he provided a second statement (exhibit 75) [Blue 291] in the form of a recorded interview with Detective Sergeant Panich. 
      
       
     147 In the statement of 28 May, Lilburn gave details of being a ‘procurer’ of ‘boys’ for the respondent whilst working at the Wall as a prostitute in early to mid 1991. He described the respondent as then being about 45 years of age with dark brown hair who wore a suit and tie. He said the respondent came to the area in a “limo” driven by a male driver. In the statement of 5 June, he described the car as a “black limo”. He said that the boys he procured for the respondent were “anywhere between 14 and 17 … they just looked that age [but] as a matter of fact, I hardly knew them” [Blue 293].  
      
       
     148 In neither statement did Lilburn assert any personal sexual encounter with the respondent. 
      
       
     149 On 15 September 1998, whilst an inmate at Goulburn Gaol, Lilburn made a statutory declaration (exhibit 76) in which he stated that he had never seen or met the respondent in person, but had only heard of him on television and in the newspapers. He said his statement to Detective Sergeant Panich, that he had seen the respondent pick boys up at the Wall, was a lie told to benefit himself [Blue 296]. In particular, he said he “was trying to get a s 24A of the Crimes Act” [Blue 301]. This was a reference to s 24A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) which allowed the court to adjust the commencement of cumulative sentences on the quashing or variation of earlier sentences. It is difficult to see how Lilburn could obtain any benefit from the section. That, however, is not the point. The point is that on one version of the material before the court, Lilburn was seeking a benefit, which he believed was available to him under the section. 
      
       
     150 He gave evidence that he had met the respondent, whom he identified in court, sometime when he was between the ages of 14 and 16 years (that is, between September 1989 and September 1991) at the ‘Wall’ where he was working as a prostitute. He said his original ‘relationship’ with the respondent was as a procurer of young boys for him for sex. However, on one occasion a boy did not turn up and Lilburn went with the respondent instead. He said he and the respondent had sex on that occasion and on two subsequent occasions, at a house on the North Shore. He was paid on each occasion - $150 to $200 on the first occasion, and unspecified amounts on the second and third occasion. They were driven to the house by a chauffeur and the respondent returned him to the city afterwards on the first and third occasions and may have done so on the second occasion – Lilburn said he was “going through withdrawals” on this occasion and could not remember much [T 4544].  
      
       
     151 In his evidence, Lilburn did not specify the make and colour of the car nor the location of the place where they went, other than it was on the ‘North Shore’, about 30 to 40 minutes drive from the city [J 1619].  
      
       
     152 Lilburn did not give evidence of the smoking of marijuana or the using of amyl nitrate during these sexual encounters. He gave evidence of anal sex but not oral sex. There was no evidence of any ‘rough’ treatment. 
      
       
     153 Lilburn said the respondent did not ask him on any occasion how old he was, nor did he tell him. 
      
       
     154 The respondent denied any sexual activity with Lilburn. 
      
       
     155 Lilburn’s evidence ended abruptly after he refused to answer further questions during the course of cross-examination and he was discharged by the trial judge. 
      
       
     156 The appellant made three challenges to the manner in which his Honour dealt with Lilburn and Lilburn’s evidence. The specific grounds of appeal are: 
      
       
        
         
         “His Honour erred in not receiving Lilburn’s explanation of his wish to be excused from giving further evidence and thereby deprived the appellant of Lilburn’s evidence to the effect that the respondent had caused him to be intimidated and suborned and the opportunity of having his evidence being accorded full probative value” ( 
         amended 
          Ground 50); 
          
          
         “His Honour erred in his approach to the issue of admissions by conduct in relation to Lilburn. Having found that the respondent engaged the services of Les Murphy to persuade Lilburn to withdraw allegations that he had procured underage sex for the respondent, his Honour should have found that the respondent’s conduct amounted to an admission that he disbelieved his case, had a weak case, or was conscious that the allegations made by Lilburn were true” (Ground 51); and 
          
          
         “His Honour failed to find, and should have found and taken into account, that the respondent was a witness whose testimony was generally unworthy of credit. Such a finding should properly have been made having regard to his Honour’s findings and the matters referred to in ground 2 (Ground 1(c)) and that the respondent employed the services of Les Murphy at Goulburn Gaol to persuade Lilburn to recant the allegations made in exhibit 76 concerning the respondent” (Ground 2(h)). 
         
        
       
     157 The appellant submitted that had the trial judge not erred in respect of each of these matters, he would have found adversely against the respondent’s credit and therefore would have been likely to disbelieve his denials of sexual activity with Lilburn and the other justification witnesses and would have accepted that the appellant had, through Lilburn’s evidence, justified each of the imputations. 
      
       
        
       Intimidation of the Witness 
       
     158 Lilburn gave evidence on 7, 8 and 13 March 2000. During the course of his evidence and after he had given evidence of the three sexual encounters with the respondent, the statements of 28 May (exhibit 74) and 5 June (exhibit 75) were tendered. The appellant’s counsel then led evidence from Lilburn that he had made the statutory declaration of 15 September (exhibit 76) withdrawing the allegations in the earlier statements after Les Murphy, to whom we have referred earlier when dealing with the evidence of his brother, Tony Homes, had threatened him. Lilburn’s evidence was [T 4553]: 
      
       
        
         
         “[Murphy] said to myself that I had done things wrong that needed to be fixed otherwise I would be fixed. I agreed. … 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         The next day … he said that he was going to get me to fill out some statutory declarations … and he was going to – he wrote out, or he was going to write out, what needed to be said on those stat decs.” 
         
        
       
     159 Lilburn subsequently made the statutory declaration, exhibit 76, and gave it to Murphy. The trial judge found that the respondent employed the services of Les Murphy to persuade Lilburn to change his position in respect of the statements made in exhibits 74 and 75 [J 1137]. 
      
       
     160 Lilburn said in evidence that the statements in the statutory declaration exhibit 76 were false and that his original statements, exhibits 74 and 75, to Detective Sergeant Panich were true [T 4558]. 
      
       
     161 He said that about a week after having made the statutory declaration he was visited in gaol by a barrister Wayne Flynn, who had been retained by Marsdens solicitors to assist with the case. Flynn had the statutory declaration with him and told Lilburn “[the respondent] was grateful because of what I had done for doing the stat dec” [T 4567]. 
      
       
     162 In January 1999, Lilburn had lunch with the respondent and Flynn in Wollongong [J 788]. There was no dispute about this. The respondent relies upon it as the occasion he first met Lilburn. Lilburn and the respondent gave conflicting evidence as to who suggested they meet and have lunch. His Honour did not deal with this conflict in evidence. 
      
       
     163 Lilburn’s evidence was that that during lunch the respondent said that Lilburn “would be well looked after, after the case was over, if [he] kept [his] mouth shut” [T 4590]. The respondent denied in cross-examination that this conversation had taken place. 
      
       
     164 Lilburn’s cross-examination commenced on 8 March. He was asked about having been visited in gaol in March 1999 (he was, at that time, serving a further period of imprisonment) by two lawyers from the appellant who asked him if he would cooperate with the appellant in respect of the “lawsuit that was going on between [the appellant] and John Marsden”. The cross-examination to this point was of fairly short duration. Lilburn was answering responsively. After the seventh question Lilburn said “I just thought I would state something please” [T 4609]. His Honour informed him Mr Nicholas QC would deal with any matters he wanted cleared up [T 4609].  
      
       
     165 He was asked a further four questions when senior counsel for the respondent said [T 4610]: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am sorry, do you have a problem?” 
         
        
       
     166 Lilburn responded [T 4610]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Yeah. I want to see my – could I have a talk and see me solicitor please. There is something further I want to bring up with him that’s important.” 
         
        
       
     167 Senior counsel for the appellant said [T 4610]: 
      
       
        
         
         “He may be referring to the recent entry into the court of an individual. I do not know. I do not know what follows from that. I would like the opportunity of speaking to my witness if he wishes to speak to me.” 
         
        
       
     168 The appellant’s legal representatives were given an opportunity to confer with Lilburn. His cross-examination then continued. He identified the ‘individual’ in the court as Glen Goldsmith [T 4610]. Goldsmith was a client of the respondent and, according to the respondent’s evidence, was a close friend of Lilburn. The respondent knew Goldsmith would be in court when Lilburn gave his evidence and agreed it was not a coincidence that that was so. The respondent was not cross-examined as to the source of his knowledge or the basis of his expectation. He denied that he arranged for Goldsmith to be there [T 7454; J 926], saying that he would have expected for him to be there during Lilburn’s evidence.  
      
       
     169 Senior counsel for the respondent cross-examined Lilburn about Goldsmith [T 4629]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q You stayed with him in January 1999, didn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes 
         
        
        
         
         Q And you told him the allegations against [the respondent] were bullshit, didn’t you? 
         
        
        
         
         A No. 
         
        
        
         
         Can I say something now you’ve said your piece? 
         
        
        
         
         Q You told him they were bullshit I suggest? 
         
        
        
         
         A No. He tried setting me up with a job with Wayne Flynn at Gosford.” 
         
        
       
     170 During the course of his cross-examination, Lilburn directed an unsolicited remark to Goldsmith: “[l]ooking good Gazza” [T 4610; J 838] and, unresponsively to a question, alleged that Goldsmith also procured boys for the respondent. At another stage of his cross-examination, Lilburn alleged that the respondent flashed a tape at him. [T 4632] 
      
       
     171 Lilburn was asked about a conversation he had with Flynn when Flynn visited him in prison. A significant portion of his responses to that cross-examination (over approximately 20 pages of transcript) was “I don’t recall” [T 4631 and following]. 
      
       
     172 At T 4650, and nearly at the conclusion of the day’s evidence, the following exchange occurred: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q When you made [the statement of 28 May (exhibit 74)] you had in mind there was some mechanism that would give you early release? 
         
        
        
         
         A No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q If you made such allegations? 
         
        
        
         
         A No, that’s untrue, because I found out a long – in the meantime my parole was automatic. It is probation. 
         
        
        
         
         Q When did Mr Steyne tell you about section 24A? 
         
        
        
         
         A I actually didn’t hear about it from him. It is through the bloke’s name I wrote down on the piece of paper. 
         
        
        
         
         Q When did you first hear about it? 
         
        
        
         
         A At the same time I made them allegations in the facts. 
         
        
        
         
         Q The ones you wrote out. It is absolute nonsense to say you sought a section 24A, whatever it is, because [the respondent] was harassing you or anybody connected to you, isn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A  
         Just hear me out. What has my parents been stalked for the past month by a private investigator and my 13 year old sister -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q By 1998--? 
         
        
        
         
         A  
         I don’t give a fuck about 1998. I want to state it. Persecuted my 13 year old sister over the phone, harassed my parents, stalked them from the creek down the road. Don’t you think that is pretty mature (sic) 
         . 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         Q You had in mind that you would get some benefits such as early release if you made allegations against [the respondent]? 
         
        
        
         
         A No.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     173 At the commencement of evidence the following morning, 9 March 2000, the following exchange occurred [T 4654]: 
      
       
        
         
         “HIS HONOUR: Good morning. You are still bound by your oath. Right? 
         
        
        
         
         [LILBURN]: Hmmm. 
         
        
        
         
         BARKER: Q I asked you yesterday if you had worked as a prostitute in January 1999 and you said, firstly, that you had, and then you said that you didn’t need to because you had had compensation paid to you. Do you remember that? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yep. 
         
        
        
         
         Q That was untrue, wasn’t it? 
         
        
        
         
         A I don’t wish to proceed with this Court case any more. No further questions. I want to be escorted back to the cells please. I have nothing more to say. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Take a seat. 
         
        
        
         
         WITNESS: I have nothing more to say. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Take a seat. 
         ” (emphasis added)  
         
        
       
     174 Senior counsel for the appellant was given a short adjournment to speak to Lilburn and upon resumption he sought a further adjournment of Lilburn’s evidence until the following Monday (13 March 2000). On 13 March, prior to Lilburn being called back to the witness box, senior counsel for the appellant requested that the court assist Lilburn to make an application that he be excused from giving further evidence [T 4771]. Alternatively, senior counsel said he would seek leave to assist Lilburn to make that application. His Honour, in effect, refused both applications and directed that the cross-examination continue [T 4772]. 
      
       
     175 Senior counsel for the respondent asked the trial judge to commit Lilburn for contempt “because they had many questions to put to him” [T 4744]. Senior counsel for the appellant again requested that Lilburn be permitted to make his application to be discharged. Senior counsel said [T 4775]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… in the light of the [contempt] application my friend has made, it would be fair, for the Court of its own motion, to enquire of the witness the basis or justification, if any, as he perceives it to be, for him to take a position which, on one view of things, puts him in some difficulty with the court. … it would be in my submission necessary for it to at least hear what the witness has to say regarding the position that he is now adopting.” 
         
        
       
     176 Senior counsel for the respondent resisted that course. His Honour said [T 4775]: 
      
       
        
         
         “I am not going to demean the procedures of this Court by spending any further time with Mr Lilburn. It is open to me to simply discharge him from his obligations under the subpoena, and he can go back to Queensland.” 
         
        
       
     177 His Honour did not, however, discharge him at that point. Lilburn’s cross-examination recommenced at 12.25pm that day. In response to the first question asked he said “I have nothing to say”. His Honour directed him to answer. He said “I refuse”. He refused to answer the next question. His Honour ascertained that his then gaol sentence was due to expire on 16 September that year. Senior counsel for the respondent requested his Honour to commit Lilburn for contempt. His Honour then indicated that he considered it would be of “no utility” to commit Lilburn for contempt. Lilburn was asked by his Honour if his position had changed. He said “no”, whereupon his Honour, of his own motion, excused him from giving further evidence. [J 776] 
      
       
     178 His Honour added [T 4776]: 
      
       
        
         
         “… I will tell you now I will need immense persuasion to say that the plaintiff is disadvantaged by reason of the truncated cross-examination in these circumstances. His evidence has been given in chief, we have seen him in cross-examination, that’s it.” 
         
        
       
     179 Mr Nicholas QC said: 
      
       
        
         
         “That is an appropriate matter for submission and that is when we will deal with it” 
         
        
       
     180 His Honour stated that Lilburn’s evidence “would stay on the record, but the weight to be given to it would be assessed in light of the denial to the plaintiff of the opportunity to cross-examine” [J 1020]. The respondent had, of course, had some opportunity to cross-examine Lilburn, including in respect of some of the critical aspects of his evidence. In particular, he had been cross-examined extensively about the truth of exhibits 74 and 75, as opposed to the truth of exhibit 76, and maintained, as he had said in his evidence in chief, that exhibit 76 was false. 
      
       
     181 His Honour held that there was no basis for finding that the respondent “brought” Goldsmith to court [J 1090] and he was not prepared to “speculate” as to what the parties knew about Goldsmith’s presence [J 1132]. He noted that although Lilburn appeared to have been distracted for a short time by Goldsmith’s presence [J 933] in court on 8 March (being the only day on which there was any reference to him being in court [J 1016]), it was not until 9 March 2000 that Lilburn had had any “change of heart” as to giving evidence and it was only on 13 March 2000 when Lilburn began to “play up”. Given the lapse of time between Goldsmith’s arrival in court on 8 March and the attempted resumption of Lilburn’s evidence on 13 March (with a weekend intervening) his Honour was “not persuaded on the probabilities that the Goldsmith incident [could] account for Lilburn’s conduct” [J 1132]. Nor was his Honour prepared to assume that senior counsel for the respondent knew, when Lilburn initially “reacted” to “something”, the cause of his “problem” was Goldsmith’s entry into the court room [J 923]. As his Honour did not see the ’tape’ incident he ignored it [J 858; 935; 1019; 1131].  
      
       
     182 Finally, although his Honour found that exhibit 76 came into existence as a result of “something [taking] place between Murphy and [the respondent]”, he was not satisfied that the respondent expressly suggested that Murphy use a threat of violence as part of the persuasion [J 1137]. 
      
       
     183 The appellant contended that his Honour’s finding that Lilburn had not been intimidated whilst giving his evidence was simply, and obviously from all the surrounding circumstances, not correct. Those surrounding circumstances were that Lilburn had, following overtures by Murphy, withdrawn his allegation against Marsden, in circumstances where his Honour accepted that Murphy had established a relationship of some tyranny over Lilburn [J 1127] and the overtures were accompanied by threats of violence; that Lilburn claimed members of his family had been stalked [AS 451]; and that the respondent had “brandished” a tape in court being conduct “designed to upset and harass” Lilburn [AS 453].  
      
       
     184 The appellant submitted that any astute, fair minded and patient trial judge would have been conscious of what was happening in the court room whilst these events unfolded. It was submitted his Honour should have ascertained the cause of Lilburn’s upset and should have permitted him to state what was troubling him. It was said by not doing so his Honour’s approach to Lilburn and his evidence was unfair. We do not agree and consider that a submission in these terms is not fair to the trial judge. There were a number of judicial tasks in which his Honour would or may have been engaged at the time, for example, he was obliged to be listening to the witness. In doing so he may have been looking directly at Lilburn so as to observe him, or he may have been taking notes. The alleged incident may not even have been in his Honour’s line of vision. The fact that he failed to see a tape being ‘brandished’ – an event which might have taken no more than 2 to 3 seconds – is not, in all the circumstances, surprising. Nor is it surprising that his Honour did not observe that it was the entry of someone into the courtroom which affected Lilburn. This was a complicated trial. Lilburn was posing difficulties as a witness. There had been interruptions in his evidence. In our opinion, there was nothing wanting in his Honour’s conduct in respect of any of the matters raised by the appellant. It was then a matter for his Honour to determine how to assess the evidence in all the circumstances.  
      
       
        
       Discharge of the Witness 
       
     185 The next issue relates to his Honour’s discharge of Lilburn. The appellant does not contend that his Honour had no power to do so. The essential complaint made is that Lilburn was not afforded the opportunity of giving an explanation as to what was troubling him or why he sought to be discharged. The appellant claims, however, that it was deprived of the opportunity of Lilburn giving evidence that he had been intimidated and suborned by the respondent or at his behest [AS 457]. The appellant further argued that that would be a relevant matter in considering whether or not Lilburn’s evidence should be accepted or the weight to be given to his evidence. In the circumstances it was submitted that his Honour was unfair to Lilburn and did not give himself the proper opportunity to do justice. The appellant accepts that this is a new trial point if it is made out.  
      
       
     186 It is convenient to deal with the second of these two issues first. 
      
       
        
       Weight to be given to the witness’ evidence 
       
     187 The discharge of Lilburn part way through his cross-examination was unusual.  
      
       
     188 There appears to be no direct authority as to how a court should deal with the evidence of a witness discharged in such circumstances. There is, however, some authority as to how to deal with evidence upon which there has been no opportunity to cross-examine, because, for example, a witness had died. It has been held that such evidence is admissible but that the “‘court [would] not attach so much weight to it as it would have been done if there had been an opportunity of cross-examination’, Daniell’s Chancery Practice, 6th Ed, p 786”: Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis & Goldstein Ltd (1967) 116 CLR 254 at 263. In that case, a witness who had died by the time the trial came on for hearing swore two contradictory affidavits. Windeyer J said at 263: 
      
       
        
         
         “The latter I think makes the former of no weight; and it can itself be of little or no weight in the circumstances, except to the extent that it is supported by documents which accord with other evidence to which I shall come later.” 
         
        
       
     189 Abadom v Abadom (1857) 24 Beav 243 is to the same effect. There it was held that whilst an affidavit of a witness who had died could be read, the court would “pay much less attention to it than the other evidence”. 
      
       
     190 The case of R v Stretton (1988) 86 Cr App Rep 7, is perhaps closer to this. The complainant in a sexual assault trial took a series of epileptic fits during the course of her cross-examination. She was discharged from giving further evidence. The trial judge allowed the trial to proceed but gave the jury a warning in terms that if they were of the view that the defendant was deprived of the opportunity of properly testing and probing the complainant’s evidence, he ‘advised’ they should acquit the defendant. If, however, as a matter of “commonsense and fairness” they considered they had had “a fair and complete opportunity of judging her credibility” they should assess the case accordingly. The English Court of Appeal held that it was a matter for the trial judge’s discretion as to whether to permit the trial to continue and no error had been shown in the manner in which he had exercised that discretion. 
      
       
     191 Likewise, in Meyer v Hall (1972) 26 DLR (3d) 309, it was held that it was a matter for the discretion of the trial judge as to the weight to be given to the evidence of a witness who could not be cross-examined, including if the trial judge thought appropriate, ignoring the evidence. 
      
       
     192 These authorities support the trial judge’s approach in the manner in which he dealt with Lilburn’s evidence, if Lilburn was appropriately discharged.  
      
       
        
       Opportunity for the witness to give evidence 
       
     193 The appellant complained that his Honour should not have discharged Lilburn without hearing his explanation as to why he was refusing to give further evidence. The appellant argued that by his Honour discharging Lilburn as he did, it was deprived of the opportunity of having Lilburn give evidence that he was intimidated by Goldsmith’s presence in the court and that somehow, this was due to conduct by the respondent.  
      
       
     194 As we have already mentioned, the appellant does not contend that his Honour had no power to discharge Lilburn. Rather it challenges the exercise of his discretion is doing so. Being a discretionary decision, the appellant is bound to show error in the exercise of the discretion, such as by the application of wrong principle, taking irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant considerations into account, or by mistaking the facts: see House v King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 –505.   
      
       
     195 The error alleged by the appellant is failing to permit Lilburn to explain his situation with the consequence that the appellant was deprived of the benefit of the evidence which might have been given. That evidence, it was submitted, might have been to the effect that Lilburn would state that he had been intimidated and the respondent was behind that, either directly or indirectly. So phrased, this submission seems to raise a procedural fairness issue. However, an allegation of breach of procedural fairness is usually an allegation that procedural fairness has been denied directly to a party. That is not what is alleged here. Rather, the appellant’s argument is directed solely to a challenge to a discretionary decision.  
      
       
     196 In other parts of its submissions the appellant argued that his Honour failed to take into account that Lilburn had been intimidated by Goldsmith with the consequence that his Honour did not do justice to his evidence. We presume that this argument was an argument that his Honour failed to take into account a relevant consideration in considering whether to discharge Lilburn. That argument has problems. The question for his Honour was how he should deal with Lilburn’s refusal to give evidence. He had two options. One was to deal with him for contempt, a course for which the respondent was pressing. The other was to discharge him. The relevant consideration there was whether Lilburn would resile from his refusal to give evidence. His Honour took the view he would not and granted Lilburn’s request. It is not open in our view to advance an argument that, in acceding to an application which is granted, the trial judge did not consider a particular matter, when the ultimate order by the trial judge is not challenged. 
      
       
     197 There are other shortcomings in the appellant’s argument. Let it be assumed for the moment that Lilburn would have given evidence to the effect that he was intimidated by matters going on in the court room, such as Goldsmith’s presence. The question arises what would have flowed from that. It might be, for example, that the trial judge could have taken steps to ensure that there was no inappropriate conduct taking place during the evidence. However, if Goldsmith was ‘the problem’ any problem relating to his presence was, by then, academic as there was no suggestion that Goldsmith was in court other than on 8 March.  
      
       
     198 If Goldsmith was ‘the problem’ then his presence of itself does not implicate the respondent, a matter which was at the forefront of the appellant’s submission, presumably upon the basis that it would have been another strand in its “admissions by conduct” case. But regardless of whether it was Goldsmith’s presence which was the source of Lilburn’s agitation, it would have been necessary for Lilburn to give admissible evidence that the respondent was responsible, either directly or indirectly, for whatever the intimidation was, for the appellant’s argument to have any substance. On the premise he would have done so, the question arises as to how the appellant was deprived of the opportunity for that evidence to be given. 
      
       
     199 In the normal course of proceedings a party calls the evidence upon which it seeks to rely. If the appellant wanted Lilburn to give the evidence which it submits he might have given, it could have called him. The most obvious way it could have done that was by seeking to reopen his evidence in chief. It did not do so. Another course was for it to have made the application that Lilburn be discharged. Again in the normal course, applications to the Court have to be supported by evidence so that the appellant would have had to have called Lilburn. It did not make any such application.  
      
       
     200 The appellant’s offer to assist Lilburn to make the application to be discharged was not an application to call evidence in its case. It was an offer to assist a third party to the proceedings to make an application in the proceedings. Third party applications are not uncommon, an application by a third party to set aside a subpoena is an example. However, if that course had been permitted, it must be asked what would have flowed from it. The appellant’s submission was to the effect that Lilburn should have been allowed to state his position as to why he wished to be discharged. A statement is not evidence, in which case the appellant would be no further advanced.  
      
       
     201 If Lilburn gave evidence on the application the question arises as to the status that evidence would have had in the proceedings. The respondent submitted that any evidence given on the application would not have been evidence in the trial, but rather evidence on the voir dire. As such it was said “unless things were to change later [which they did not] it would be fatal to the present stance by [the appellant] in this Court” (AT 352). We understand this submission to mean that the evidence would not have been evidence in the proceedings unless tendered in the proceedings or unless Lilburn was recalled. This is the principle which applies in a criminal trial where evidence is given on the voir dire in the absence of the jury: see Sinclair v The King (1946) 73 CLR 316 at 326; R v Basto (1954) 91 CLR 628 at 639. 
      
       
     202 However, it appears a different rule applies to evidence on the voir dire in the case of a civil trial or a criminal trial without a jury. In Cross on Evidence the learned author states at para 11035 in relation to a voir dire: 
      
       
        
         
         “… in every case tried before a judge alone, it would seem that the evidence given, if relevant, is available on any issue.” 
         
        
        
       Ex parte Whitelock; Re Mackenzie 
        [1971] 2 NSWLR 534;  
       Casley-Smtih v FS Evans & Sons Pty Ltd 
        (No 2) (1988) 49 SASR 332 are cited in support of this proposition. 
        
       
     203 In Ex parte Whitelock, Meares J, although not expressing a concluded view, said at 539: 
      
       
        
         
         “I should have thought that evidence given on the voir dire is evidence if relevant, on any issue if given in the presence of a jury … and in all cases if given before a tribunal sitting without a jury.” 
         
        
       
     204 In Casley-Smith, Olsson J at 335 considered this reasoning to be unassailable. See also R v Amo & Amuna [1963] P & NGLR 22, where Man CJ held that proceedings on a voir dire “cannot be regarded as constituting a separate collateral proceedings”. Both Meares J and Olsson J referred to R v Amo & Amuna with approval. See further Smith v R (1957) 97 CLR 100 at 132 per Webb J.  
      
       
     205 This principle is consistent with the rule of practice often adopted in civil cases where evidence is admitted subject to admissibility or subject to relevance: see Dubbo Base Hospital v Jones [1979] 1 NSWLR 225 per Moffitt P at 227. 
      
       
     206 However, we do not think that these principles have any relevance to the present issue. The appellant’s argument is that had Lilburn been permitted to make his application and to give evidence on it (we discount his making a statement for the reasons we have given), it would have had the benefit of that evidence. That, however, overlooks the fact that such evidence would not have been evidence in the proceedings. Nor would it have been evidence on the voir dire as contended by the respondent. Evidence on the voir dire is evidence taken as part of the proceedings to determine, for example, a point of admissibility; whether a witness should be treated as hostile; whether an expert has the necessary qualifications to given certain evidence. If given, this evidence would have been on a third party application. 
      
       
     207 Evidence on a third party application is both different in nature to and serves a different purpose from evidence on the voir dire. Usually it is evidence which would not be given in the principal proceedings because it is not relevant in those proceedings, although logically connected with the issues in the principal proceedings. Again an application by a third party to set aside a subpoena provides a useful example. If some such evidence was required in the principal proceedings, it would have to be called. We have already pointed out that there was no occasion during the course of this issue being before the court that the appellant made any application to his Honour to call evidence from Lilburn. We do not consider that in these circumstances it can complain that his Honour failed to ‘hear’ Lilburn’s reasons for wanting to be discharged. 
      
       
     208 In our opinion, therefore, the appellant has not demonstrated appellable error in his Honour’s discharge of Lilburn.  
      
       
        
       Error in Dismissing the Pimping Allegations as Irrelevant 
       
     209 We have referred above to Lilburn’s allegation that he made the statutory declaration of 15 September (exhibit 76) in circumstances where he was pressured, under threat of physical violence, to do so by Les Murphy. Les Murphy denied this was the case. The respondent denied asking Murphy “to induce by threats or force, or in any other way, a retraction by Lilburn of his allegations” [J 899; T 6726]. His Honour disbelieved Murphy and the respondent on this issue. He found that Murphy’s evidence that there was no involvement between himself and Lilburn in relation to the preparation of the statutory declaration “was false” [J 1126]. He also accepted that Lilburn would have been adversely affected by Murphy’s conduct [J 1126]. 
      
       
     210 His Honour further found on the probabilities that the respondent “did employ the services of his friend Les Murphy at Goulburn Gaol to persuade Mr Lilburn to change his position”. However, he was “unable to find” that the respondent was implicated in any suggestion that Murphy use a threat of violence, although observing that “the very presence of Mr Murphy may well have been sufficient to intimidate anyone” [J 1137]. 
      
       
     211 His Honour specifically found that the respondent’s conduct was directed to obtaining a withdrawal of the pimping allegations made in the first two statements, exhibits 74 and 75. He considered, however, that conduct could not overcome the “flaw” in the appellant’s case of the lateness of the complaint of the personal sexual encounters with the respondent. In other words, his Honour found the substantial allegation against the respondent was a matter of recent invention. His Honour held that because the respondent’s conduct related to the pimping allegations: 
      
       
        
         
         “[t]here is no rational basis therefore for concluding that any conduct by the [respondent] prior to February 1999 can be taken to be conduct consistent with a consciousness of guilt in [the respondent] of conduct that had not been alleged against him.” [J 1134] 
         
        
       
     212 It appears that it was for that reason that his Honour found that the pimping allegations “in the end have no relevance to the case” [J 1136]. His Honour concluded [J 1139]: 
      
       
        
         
         “The ultimate point is that the evidence prior to the termination of Mr Lilburn’s testimony was such as to preclude me from being satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the nub of the defendant’s case namely, the allegation of the three sexual encounters, had been established for the reasons I have stated relating to Mr Lilburn’s credit, the fundamental flaw in the defendant’s position as to the timing of the allegations and the consequential irrelevance of any ‘consciousness of guilt 
         ’ 
          in [the respondent] by reason of his conduct towards Mr Murphy.”  
         
        
       
     213 By the time that his Honour reached this conclusion, he had observed that the case advanced through Lilburn did not fit the modus operandi for which the appellant so strongly contended. His Honour described the differences between the Lilburn allegations and the modus operandi as being “stark and unique” [J 1118]. His Honour had also dismissed Lilburn’s identification of the respondent as having no weight observing that Lilburn’s in-court identification was of the person with whom he had had lunch in January 1999 and whom he contended was the person with whom he had had the sexual encounters approximately ten years previously. His Honour added that at no time had Lilburn given a personal description of the person who took him to the house on the north shore. Whilst that is correct, it is worth observing that on the appellant’s case, identification by way of description was not necessary as Lilburn had had dealings with the respondent over a significant period of time and the respondent had given him his business card. His Honour did not refer to this. However, there was no issue on the appeal arising from this. 
      
       
     214 His Honour referred to the termination of Lilburn’s evidence and then said [J 1122]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Pausing here there is sufficient material in my mind to raise serious reservations about the integrity of Mr Lilburn’s testimony surrounding his assertion that these three encounters took place.” 
         
        
       
     215 The appellant contended that his Honour’s treatment of the pimping allegations as being irrelevant amounted to error. The substantive allegation made by Lilburn was that the respondent was a person who had had sexual intercourse with boys who were under the age of 18 knowing them to be underage, and that was the very essence of the pimping allegations. Accordingly, it was relevant evidence of a corroborative nature: see R v Beck [1982] 1 All ER 807 at 815; Galuzzo v R (1986) 23 A Crim R 211 at 215. His Honour found that the respondent had wanted those allegations withdrawn and had engaged the services of Murphy to assist in that. The appellant further contended that given the respondent’s maintenance under oath of the falsity of seeking to have Lilburn withdraw his statements “the more persuasive became Lilburn’s evidence as to the respondent’s involvement in underage sex, and the more likely that the respondent’s denials as to his knowledge of, and sexual contact with, Lilburn were false” [AS 477]. It followed on the appellant’s submission that the trial judge should have found that the actions of the respondent in engaging Murphy’s services amounted to an admission that Lilburn’s allegations were true. 
      
       
     216 His Honour’s finding was that “in the end” the pimping allegations were irrelevant. This, as we understand his Honour’s reasons, was that having considered all the evidence, having found Lilburn a witness of little credit and having concluded that the substantial allegations were matters of recent invention, the pimping allegations did not support the truth of the substantive allegations. His Honour considered that the pimping allegations “aggravated” the “flaw”, the flaw being the late raising of the specific allegations upon which this part of the justification defence was based, as there was no reference to them in exhibits 74 and 75 (in which the pimping allegations were made). His Honour’s reasoning on this was clear. The pimping allegations, which included no reference to the substantive allegations, provided a basis for what we have referred to as a finding of recent invention. For that reason the pimping allegations did not assist the appellant in proof of the case of the substantive allegations. It is in that sense that we understand his Honour to have found the pimping allegations to be irrelevant. 
      
       
     217 Although the pimping allegations were found to be irrelevant, that is, as we understand it, as evidence supporting the truth of the substantive allegations, the question still remains whether the respondent’s conduct in seeking to have them withdrawn and his false evidence about that could amount to an admission by conduct. 
      
       
        
       Admissions by Conduct 
       
     218 We have referred earlier to the considerations which apply when it is alleged that conduct amounts to an admission by conduct. It is sufficient at this point to remind ourselves that conduct which involves intimidation of a witness or is directed at ‘tampering’ with a witness may constitute an admission by conduct: R v Watt. Likewise, lies may amount to an admission by conduct.  
      
       
     219 The ‘type’ of conduct in which the respondent engaged, directed at having Lilburn withdraw his pimping allegations and the telling of lies about it in court, is conduct which might in a given case be evidence of an admission by conduct, provided that it relates to the matter in issue in the case. Leaving aside the case based on contextual imputations, it is only in a general sense that it can be said in this case that the matter in issue is “sex with underage boys”. The justification case was a detailed case based upon specific particularised allegations. The pimping allegations did not form part of the justification case sought to be made out by the appellant. Accordingly, neither aspect of the respondent’s conduct could be said to constitute an admission by conduct of the relevant matter in issue – that is, the specific Lilburn allegations of three occasions of underage sex or any of the other specific particularised allegations.  
      
       
     220 It is possible that this evidence could be evidence which supported the admissions by conduct case generally. The appellant’s submissions do not seek to advance that argument, although there is a general allegation that the trial judge failed to consider the evidence as a whole. We deal with that argument when dealing with our Conclusions in relation to the respondent’s credit. However, in so far as the submissions are specific to the case involving Lilburn we do not consider they have been made out. 
      
       
     221 Finally, and we mention this aspect only to dismiss it, the appellant contended that it was on one of the pimping occasions that Lilburn had his first sexual encounter with the respondent. No such case was put at trial. 
      
       
     222 The appellant made a further complaint in relation to the manner in which his Honour dealt with the “admissions by conduct” case, namely, that he declined to consider the “coincidence” which the appellant submitted there was between the respondent’s conduct in respect of Rainey (relating to D18), W2 relating to Stevens, and Lilburn. These coincidences related to the allegations that in respect of each, the respondent made an offer of money or financial reward “after the case was over”. If the contents of the Elomari tape become relevant that will add to the ‘coincidence’ of the conduct. In so far as Lilburn’s case was concerned, his Honour simply did not deal with this issue in his Conclusions.  
      
       
     223 This evidence was relevant. It was a significant part of the appellant’s case that the respondent had made offers of financial assistance or reward to a number of the justification witnesses and that the “offers” bore at least this similarity, namely that, if any money was to be paid, it was to be paid after the case. As we have said, in the case of Lilburn, his Honour did not even deal with this evidence. That may have been because he had already indicated that because he had discharged Lilburn in the circumstances he did, his evidence would be afforded little weight and because his Honour had already made an adverse credit finding against Lilburn. We will return to this when dealing with our reasons relating to the Elomari tape and in particular the section relating to the appellant’s case that the tape supported the evidence of other witnesses in relation to the payment of money after the case was over.  
      
       
        
       Respondent’s Credit 
       
     224 The trial judge’s finding at J 1137, that the respondent did “employ” Murphy to persuade Lilburn to change his position, involved, on the appellant’s submission, a deliberate falsity on behalf of the respondent. That must be correct. Another aspect of the respondent’s evidence found to be false was when he said he first knew of and saw the statutory declaration exhibit 76. 
      
       
     225 The appellant complained that notwithstanding this obviously false evidence, his Honour failed to make any adverse credit finding against the respondent. This is correct. The submission was also put that his Honour’s finding that the respondent was implicated in Murphy’s approach to Lilburn was “a powerful finding against the credit of the respondent” and that his Honour did not consider this in determining what weight should be given to Lilburn’s evidence. 
      
       
     226 It is apparent from the manner in which his Honour constructed his reasons that he did not consider it necessary to do so. At J 1122 he concluded that there was “sufficient material in my mind to raise serious reservations about the integrity of Mr Lilburn’s testimony”. He next referred to the Les Murphy allegations, accepting the appellant’s submissions on that issue. He then said [J 1128]: 
      
       
        
         
         “None of these findings however overcome what I hold to be the incurable flaw in the [appellant’s] case.” 
         
        
       
     227 The incurable flaw was that Lilburn’s assertion of a sexual relationship was recent. It was not made in exhibits 74, 75 or 76. Nor was it made in a number of discussions he had had with Detective Sergeant Panich and Superintendent Woodhouse. In fact, Lilburn made no such allegation until February 1999 when he was visited in gaol by Quail [J 1053]. His Honour’s assessment of this part of the case was also affected by the fact that Lilburn’s allegations did not fall into the modus operandi upon which the appellant relied so heavily. 
      
       
     228 The respondent resisted the various attacks the appellant mounts against his Honour’s judgment in respect of Lilburn essentially on the basis that Lilburn, who had completed his evidence in chief at the time he was discharged, was not believed in his allegations against the respondent [RS 215]. We have already referred to this. The respondent also argued that even if there was any basis to the appellant’s case based on “admissions by conduct”, that case “proves nothing” [AS 218] as his conduct was equally explicable on the basis that the respondent was acting as an innocent person seeking to have untrue allegations withdrawn. The respondent also pointed out that that conduct related to the pimping allegations, not to the core case against the respondent.  
      
       
     229 The respondent’s arguments are best considered, in our view, as part of our overall conclusions in relation to the respondent’s credit. 
      
       
        
       D20 
       
     230 D20 appeared both in the Today Tonight programme and on Witness. He was called as a witness in the appellant’s justification case to prove the substantial truth of all imputations.  
      
       
     231 D20, who was born on 25 August 1970, gave evidence that on one occasion only he had sex with the respondent. He said he was 15 years old at the time and the incident occurred at the respondent’s residence at Campbelltown. On the appellant’s case as particularised, the incident occurred “when D20 was fifteen and in the year 1985”, that is, between 26 August and 31 December 1985. The most precise evidence that D20 could give of the date was “late 1985” [T 4890]. An application by the appellant for leave to amend the particulars so as to delete the particular “in 1985” ([2000] NSWSC 227) was refused by his Honour.  
      
       
     232 The respondent denied having had a sexual encounter with D20. 
      
       
     233 The trial judge’s determination of the substantial truth of the imputations in so far as D20’s evidence was concerned was thus dependent upon whether he preferred the evidence of D20 or that of the respondent. His Honour rejected D 20 as a witness of credit, finding him to be “a liar and a fabricator” [J 2891], an assessment made essentially on the basis of the impact that D20’s “demeanour and testimony” had on him [J 2891].  
      
       
     234 The appellant challenged his Honour’s rejection of D20’s evidence, notwithstanding that his Honour’s finding was substantially credit based. In doing so it submitted that an appellate court was entitled to interfere with such a finding [AS 153]: 
      
       
        
         
         “where in a complex pattern of events incontrovertible evidence can only be fitted into a pattern if a different view of the credibility of a witness is taken by the court on appeal.” 
         
        
        
       See 
        Agbaba v Winter  
       (1977) 51 ALJR 503 at 508 per Jacobs J. Jacob J’s remarks were made in the course of a discussion of the limited circumstances in which an appellate court may interfere with factual findings. It is useful to quote his Honour’s remarks more fully:  
        
        
         
         “… it was not open to the Court of Appeal to interfere in the way which it did with the findings of primary fact made by the trial judge, based as they were so largely upon the credibility of the witnesses. There are cases, very rare cases, where an appeal court is justified in displacing primary findings based on credibility of witnesses … but they are cases where a whole body of evidence points inescapably to a conclusion different from that reached by the judge at first instance, where in a complex pattern of events incontrovertible evidence can only be fitted into the pattern if a different view of the credibility of a witness is taken by the court on appeal.” 
         
        
       
     235 The appellant submitted that in this case there was independent or incontrovertible evidence to which his Honour failed to give appropriate weight in rejecting D 20’s testimony. It also alleged that his Honour failed to give appropriate weight to the respondent’s admissions and the consistent testimony of other witnesses (Grounds 21, 22) [AS 36]. It submitted that, in accordance with the principle stated by Jacobs J, his Honour’s adverse credit finding was therefore insupportable (Ground 23). The appellant also alleged that the trial judge failed to give proper weight to D20’s evidence of identification.  
      
       
     236 The respondent contended that his Honour’s rejection of D20’s evidence is protected from appellate review on the basis of the Abalos principle. He also made specific responses to certain aspects of the purported ‘incontrovertible’ evidence relied upon by the appellant in support of its case that the trial judge erred in not accepting D20’s evidence. 
      
       
        
       Background 
       
     237 In his evidence in chief, D20 said he had left his mother’s home on the central coast when he was about 14, that he started to get into trouble with the police, that he was running away from home and would “choose to stay with [his] father” in Sydney. At about age 13 or 14 he began to venture up to Kings Cross, where he continued to engage in criminal activity, for example purse snatching or ‘rolling a drunk’ and taking his wallet. He also solicited homosexual men at the Wall in return for money. Between September 1985 and 31 December 1985, the period in which the incident was said to have occurred, D20 lived variously with his mother on the central coast, with an aunt in Sydney, with his grandparents in Ballarat, Victoria, or in a number of different refuges, including one in the outer suburbs of Sydney. 
      
       
     238 D20 said that he met the respondent at the El Alamein fountain in Kings Cross sometime late in 1985 and that he accompanied him in a Mercedes car to the respondent’s residence about 45 minutes from the city. D20 gave evidence of a sexual encounter there with the respondent which, it was submitted, was consistent with the respondent’s modus operandi. D20 then gave evidence in some detail of the respondent’s residence. 
      
       
     239 The respondent argued that in cross-examination a different picture of D20 emerged from that which he sought to portray in his evidence in chief. For example, in cross-examination D20 agreed he was a “poofter basher” [T 4911] and that he was not a “prostitute really” but was “a basher of homosexuals in order that [he] could deprive them of their money” [T 4911] and that he substantially earnt his living from bashing and robbing. Although he had only one conviction in this period for an offence committed at East Gosford (in September 1985), he admitted that he “got away with a lot of robberies” for which he was not caught and that he was robbing and stealing “in 1985 around Gosford consistently” [T 4923].  
      
       
     240 The respondent submitted that on this evidence it was highly unlikely that D20 was living the life of a male prostitute on the streets of Kings Cross (and in fact amounted to a denial that he was) [RS 106.5] and, it followed, it was unlikely that he would have been ‘picked up’ by the respondent as alleged. 
      
       
     241 His Honour rejected that D20 was travelling from Gosford to Sydney quite regularly at that time [J 2676] or that he was operating as a prostitute [J 2868]. Rather, his Honour found that “D20, was a very busy burglar amongst other things, pursuing his career in that regard over the relevant period on the central coast” [J 2676] and held that he was not satisfied that the alleged incident occurred. He said at [J 2889]: 
      
       
        
         
         “This witness … at a very superficial level gave evidence about time, place and activity which if there was nothing else could tip the scales in the defendant’s favour. But it is the very generality,  
         particularly of timing 
         , and the  
         defendant’s response thereto as I have discussed 
         , the unacceptable testimony about the automatic teller machine, which comfortably predispose me to the point where I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that what D20 said in fact happened.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     242 His Honour further explained the basis for this view:  
      
       
        
         
         “the good grounds … for having reservations about the bare details given by D20, the failure of the defence case in relation to admissions by conduct, the qualities of D20 akin to an informer and all the matters raised by the [respondent] … lead to the inevitable result that the [appellant] fails.” 
         
        
       
     243 It appears that his Honour considered that some particularity as to the date of the incident was required for him to be satisfied that D20’s evidence should be accepted. This impression is gained from his Honour’s frequent reference to the lack of specificity in D20’s evidence of the date.  
      
       
     244 For example, at J 2829, his Honour commented that apart from the detail in respect of the sexual conduct “everything was generalised commencing from ‘late in 1985’” [J 2829]. Another passage to the same effect is to be found at J 2883: 
      
       
        
         
         “At this point in my consideration of the evidence thus far reviewed I must say I keep coming back to the vagueness of the allocation of the time of the event.” 
         
        
        
       He later commented at J 2888 and J 2889 (which is set out above) as to the vagueness and generality of D20’s evidence again with focus on the generality of the timing. 
        
       
     245 Then, at the commencement of his Conclusions in respect of D20 his Honour described the date of the alleged incident between D20 and the respondent “[b]y reference to the calendar the relevant beginning date [being] 26 August 1985 and the concluding date 31 December 1985” [J 2862]. He then found [J 2862]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Within that framework the assertion by D20 that the events took place in late 1985 cannot be said (the more so given that it is but one occasion only) to be  
         ‘specific’ 
          as the [appellant] submits; it is vague.” 
         
        
       
     246 His Honour added at J 2867: 
      
       
        
         
         “As I have said the starting point is vague and is internally inconsistent with the witness’ own evidence, carefully articulated, in chief.” 
         
        
        
       This was a reference to the evidence that D20 gave as to when he went to Cairns. As this was evidence given at an early stage in the proceedings and which appears to have affected his Honour’s overall assessment of D20’s credibility, it is convenient to deal with that issue first. 
        
        
       Date D20 Went to Cairns 
       
     247 D20 had said in his evidence in chief that he had gone to Cairns in mid-1985 and had worked in the fishing industry for Hayles Cruises [J 2656]. In a statement to the police D20 had said he went to Cairns in February 1986 [T 4885.56-4887.10]. His group certificate for the period disclosed he had worked for Hayles Cairns Cruises (Blue 316) from 1 June 1986 to 11 July 1986.  
      
       
     248 His Honour found that D20’s “evidence-in-chief as to the date on which he went to Cairns turned out to be false” [J 2656]. His Honour further found at J 2805: 
      
       
        
         
         “… D20’s evidence about the timing of the incident and his move to Cairns was contradictory (having said he moved to Cairns in mid 1985) and inconsistent with statements that he had previously made to the police.” 
         
        
       
     249 D20’s evidence on this issue was as follows. D20 was asked about working at the Wall and over what period that occurred. His examination then continued [T 4880-1]: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q Did you move to Cairns in North Queensland? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. I-- 
         
        
        
         
         Q When was that? 
         
        
        
         
         A Mid 1985. 
         
        
        
         
         Q When you went to Cairns, what did you do? 
         
        
        
         
         A I went to Cairns in the hope that I could obtain work, or some sort of work, relating to the boating industry, fishing industry or generally working on the water. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Did you get a job? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes, I did. I was lucky in that I was fortunate to -- 
         
        
        
         
         Q Who did you get a job with? 
         
        
        
         
         A I was lucky in that I got a job with a company by the name of Hayles Cairns Cruises. By that I mean I believe that they have since changed their name. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Is that spelt H-A-Y-L-E-S? Is that right? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q Did you obtain a group certificate in respect of that work? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q And that employer? 
         
        
        
         
         A Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         EXHIBIT #89 GROUP CERTIFICATE OF HAYLES HOLDINGS TRADING AS HAYLES CAIRNS CRUISES, TENDERED, ADMITTED WITHOUT OBJECTION.” 
         
        
       
     250 Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that his Honour erred in characterising D20’s evidence as to the date he went to Cairns as “false” and making an adverse credit finding against D20 on the basis of that falsity when it was clear that it was no more than a slip. 
      
       
     251 The sense gained from reading this portion of the transcript is that the difference between D20’s evidence and the group certificate was not noticed by any of the legal representatives at the time and that rather than it being ‘false evidence’ in the sense found by his Honour, it was no more than a slip by the witness. That impression is reinforced by the cross-examination which does not touch upon the inconsistency between D20’s oral evidence and the group certificate or challenge his evidence that he went to Cairns in mid 1985. Nor was it put to D20 in cross-examination that his evidence in chief was “false” or a “lie” or inconsistent with the group certificate. Rather, the thrust of the cross-examination was that D20 went to Cairns in 1986 (although the respondent suggested the date was February 1986), and that during the second half of 1985 he was “preoccupied with criminal activities in Gosford” [T 4922].  
      
       
     252 It was also submitted that his Honour’s finding was pejorative of D20 and that this reflected an attitude his Honour had towards the appellant’s case overall. We do not consider it necessary to examine that submission.  
      
       
     253 The relevant matter for our determination is whether his Honour erred in his finding that D20 gave ‘false’ evidence as to the date he went to Cairns and if so, whether that error has any appellable significance. The period in which the alleged incident occurred was a pivotal issue in the case the appellant sought to make through D20. D20’s evidence was wrong, but for the reasons we have given we consider it was a slip. D20’s error was one of the reasons his Honour rejected D20 as a witness of credit and this part of the appellant’s case. The finding was important in his overall consideration and ultimate rejection of this part of the appellant’s case. However, we leave to later consideration the consequence, if any, which flows from that for the determination of the appeal. 
      
       
     254 The appellant made another complaint about the manner in which his Honour dealt with D20’s evidence about going to Cairns. The complaint emanated from J 2803, where his Honour made reference to the fact that during the course of D20’s evidence, the appellant sought leave to amend the particulars to delete the words “in 1985”. The effect of such an amendment would have been to extend the time in which the incident occurred from the end of 1985 until August 1986 when the appellant turned 16. His Honour said [J 2803]: 
      
       
        
         
         “One can only assume, the [respondent] argues, that he did so on instructions that D20 had recently told the [appellant] that the alleged incident occurred in 1986 and not 1985 as particularised. (The particulars presumably having been drafted in accordance with D20’s previous statements to the [appellant]). I refused the application.” 
         
        
       
     255 The appellant submitted that the only purpose of recording the respondent’s submission in this paragraph was to indicate his Honour’s acceptance of the submission. 
      
       
     256 There is some basis for the appellant’s complaint, as the recording of the submission occurs in a paragraph in which his Honour was otherwise dealing with factual matters.  
      
       
     257 If his Honour accepted the respondent’s submission, there is merit in the appellant’s complaint as the respondent’s submission involved an attack on D20’s credit. The appellant contended that that attack, and his Honour’s acceptance of it, was ill-based as it was not based on an appropriate factual foundation. It submitted, for example, that such a ‘finding’, if that is what it amounted to, failed to take into account that, as his Honour knew, D20 had come from Queensland in the custody of two prison officers who remained in the court during his testimony and who returned him to the cells of the Supreme Court during any adjournments. At the end of each day D20 was returned to Long Bay gaol. Accordingly, it must have been apparent to his Honour that the appellant’s counsel did not have ready access to D20 and did not have any conferences with him before he gave his evidence [AS 147-9]. 
      
       
     258 For our part, as we do not know what his Honour knew and was entitled to infer, we do not consider we should engage in any speculation about the matter. In any event, whilst it is not readily apparent why his Honour recorded the submission as he did, mixed as it was with factual matters, nothing seems to flow from it in his Honour’s reasons. Accordingly, we do not consider there is any basis for a complaint of appellable error.  
      
       
        
       Failure to Give Proper Weight to Other Evidence in Determining Whether to Accept D20’s Testimony 
       
     259 It was an important part of the appellant’s case in relation to D20 that his evidence was supported by incontrovertible evidence from objective sources and from the respondent’s own admissions. The evidence said to support D20’s evidence was set out in detail in a table in the appellant’s written submissions. In summary that evidence was: 
      
       
        
       (i) D20 said that he was approached by the respondent at the El Alamein Fountain and asked if he would accompany the respondent back to his place for the evening [T 4889.32-52; 4890.29-36]. He said it was about a 45 minute drive to the respondent’s home [T 4890.59]. The respondent admitted picking up people for sex at ‘beats’ and taking them, inter alia, to his home at Campbelltown [T 6943.60; 6947; 6594.11], which it was accepted was about a 45 minute drive from the city. 
        
        
       (ii) D20 said the respondent had a driver who drove them in a Mercedes Benz to the respondent’s house [T 4890.44]. In late 1985 the respondent owned a Mercedes Benz and employed Francis Bonomini as a chauffeur on a full time basis (Exh M; T 8187.10-15). Bonomini had dark hair and an olive complexion, which accorded with the description of the driver given by D20. Bonomini said that he lived at home while he was working for the respondent and that after he finished work for the evening, he went home and did not return until the next morning [T 8195.22]. 
        
        
       (iii) D20 said the respondent  
       “had quite a large house” 
        with a large driveway. In late 1985 the respondent’s house was a large two storey residence with a large driveway. In the latter part of that year renovations were being carried out on the house. 
        
        
       (iv) D20 said that on arriving at the house, the respondent  
       “went to an area of the house close by to the front door to disactivate a security system in his home” 
        [T 4891.06]. The respondent’s counsel did not cross-examine D20 on this evidence. In a letter dated 25 November 1985 to Liverpool City Council the respondent stated his home was  
       “totally and absolutely alarmed …” 
       .  
        
        
       (v) D20 did not notice any tarpaulins and builder’s equipment at the house [T 4939.12]. Photographs taken of the house establish that as at December 1985 renovation work was largely complete and no tarpaulins were in use.  
        
        
       (vi) D20 described the kitchen as being  
       “downstairs, at the front of the house [and] to the left of the front passageway of the house” 
       . Exhibits 197 and AL showed that the kitchen was at the front of the house and to the left of stairs which led up to the new main bedroom.  
        
        
       (vii) D20 said the kitchen was quite big with a lot of timber in the kitchen and an area where wine was stored or kept [T 4938.25-35]. A photograph of the kitchen as at 1985 [Exh AC] showed a large kitchen with a predominantly wooden décor, encompassing the cupboards, bench tops and floors and there was a large wine rack in the kitchen area. 
        
        
       (viii) D20 said the respondent gave him a beer and took him out to the back of the house and showed him around. There was a  
       “very large rectangular pool at the back of the house” 
       . Exhibit AL also showed that from the kitchen and family room area there was access to the back of the house and to a large rectangular outdoor swimming pool.  
        
        
       (ix) D20 said there were about a dozen PVC chairs around the pool. A photograph taken after 6 December 1985, but before renovations were finally completed on 23 December 1985, showed eleven white PVC chairs beside the pool [Exh 177]. There was no fence around the pool at that time. 
        
        
       (x) D20 described the wardrobe as being on the left of the doorway into the bedroom and an ensuite opposite the doorway into the bedroom. He said there was a cabinet, possibly housing a television. Exhibits AL (1985 plans), DJ (1981 plans and 1983 additions) and 188 (1970 and 1985 plans) show the respondent’s bedroom on the first floor. The bedroom had an ensuite and a wardrobe area [T7071, 7067]. The 1985 plans [Exh AL and AK] show a large wardrobe on the left as one walked in to the bedroom. The respondent admitted there was a television in the bedroom [T 6550]. 
        
        
       (xi) D20 said that the respondent produced approximately an ounce of marijuana from a set of drawers on the left hand side of the bed which he then rolled into two marijuana cigarettes and they each smoked one [T 4891.45-55]. The respondent admitted that he kept  
       “one or two deals”  
       of marijuana in a box beside his bed.  
        
        
       (xii) D20 said the respondent used amyl nitrate during the sexual activity. He described the bottle as being  
       “a very small bottle, almost like the size of a ‘liquid paper’ bottle” 
        [T 4893.10-20; 4891.54-55]. The respondent inhaled the amyl nitrate and had D20 inhale it [T4892.10-15]. The respondent agreed he kept amyl nitrate in a drawer beside his bed and that he had amyl nitrate at his home at the end of 1985 [T 6913, 6914, 6921, 7065]. There was also evidence as to the respondent’s use of amyl nitrate and this was not in dispute. His butler, Mr Whitton, gave evidence that the amyl nitrate was kept in small bottles in his bedside drawer. There was other evidence that amyl nitrate was distributed in small clear bottles about half an inch in diameter and one and a half inches long. 
        
        
       (xiii) D20 said that he and the respondent performed oral sex on one another and that the respondent asked D20 to perform anal sex on him, which he did [T 4891.53-4892.25; 4892.61]. The respondent admitted having anal and oral sex with male partners. 
        
        
       (xiv) D20 said that the following morning, the respondent drove him to a railway station about 10 minutes away [T 4893.40]. The closest railway station was five minutes drive away from the respondent’s house [T 7069]. 
        
       
     260 Notwithstanding the significant degree of correspondence between D20’s evidence and the proved facts set out above, his Honour held that D20’s evidence viewed overall was vague and general, especially as to time. 
      
       
     261 The appellant contended that his Honour’s conclusion that D20’s evidence was “generalised” cannot stand given the particularity and correctness of the evidence to which we have just referred.  
      
       
     262 Leaving aside the question of when the incident occurred, it appears to us that his Honour’s assessment of D20’s evidence as “vague and general” was only available to him because of the manner in which he dealt with the importance of any evidence which was accurate and particular. This is apparent from his Honour’s findings in his “D20 – Conclusions”. He said [J 2870-2]: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         There is nothing remarkable 
          about a person such as D20 saying that there was in the back, sometime late in 1985, a large rectangular swimming pool. On the other hand there was a large rectangular swimming pool without a fence in a poorly lit area. 
         
        
        
         
         There is nothing remarkable 
          about D20 identifying PVC frame chairs as being the furniture around a swimming pool. On the other hand the photographs on which the [appellant] is so insistent in its reliance as at the end of December or towards that time do show some PVC chairs and some Brown Jordan chairs. 
         
        
        
         
         There is nothing remarkable 
          about a person entering their home and deactivating an alarm system. On the other hand, D20 was not cross-examined about this. The [respondent] suggests that the alarm system (and there is no question that there was one there) was  
         ‘a lucky guess’ 
          in the same way as the unremarkable identification of pool furniture as PVC framed.” (emphases added) 
         
        
        
       His Honour, it appears, accepted the respondent’s submissions that this was a  
       “lucky guess” 
       .  
        
       
     263 With respect to his Honour, we cannot agree that any one of the above matters was “unremarkable”. They were matters of detail which corresponded to independent evidence as to the state of the respondent’s residence. For example, as to the chairs around the pool, D20 had given substantially accurate evidence as to the number (save that the number of white PVC chairs was 11 not 12) and type of chairs which were proved by photographic evidence to be around the respondent’s pool in late 1985. His Honour accepted that the evidence of there being “about a dozen chairs around the pool … comfortably could fall into place with evidence as to the state of the pool and the house as at late 1985”. However, his Honour added, apparently as a qualification to the significance of the accuracy of this evidence [J 2865] “[b]ut the witness D20 could do no better in identifying the time as ‘late 1985’”. His Honour then, as we have indicated, diminished both the importance of the accuracy of this evidence and its content in J 2871, to which we have referred. 
      
       
     264 D20 had also given accurate evidence as to the shape and size of the pool although he could not remember the colour of the pool fence. There was, however, no fence around the pool, it would appear, at least until sometime in late December 1985. This is clear from correspondence from the local council on 6 December 1985 requiring the respondent to fence the pool.  
      
       
     265 D20’s evidence that he did not recall the colour of the pool fence was elicited by counsel’s question “what colour was the fence around the pool?”. For the reason just given there may have been no fence so that the question may have been based on an incorrect premise. His Honour did not, it seems, make any allowance for this in his comment at J 2870. Rather, he seems to record it as indicating it was something about which D20 was wrong. That, of itself, is a small matter if it stood alone. However, it is indicative of an approach by his Honour to rely upon any wrong evidence to diminish the effect or weight of D20’s accurate evidence.  
      
       
     266 His Honour continued [J 2873]: 
      
       
        
         
         “ 
         The use of marijuana and amyl is unremarkable in the context of this trial 
         . The [respondent] denies neither. In relation however to D20, whilst not denying the presence of amyl in the house, he said that he was engaged otherwise emotionally in a relationship which did not require its usage.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
     267 The same comment can be made about this finding. D20’s evidence was both detailed and an accurate reflection of other evidence on this issue which was accepted by the trial judge. This finding also raises another issue. The question which his Honour was required to consider was not whether the use of marijuana and amyl nitrate was unremarkable in the context of this trial. Rather, being engaged in the task of assessing D20’s evidence, it was part of that task to assess the accuracy of the evidence and to ultimately assess its import if it was accurate.  
      
       
     268 As we have said, D20’s evidence accorded with the evidence of other witnesses as well as with the evidence of the respondent as to the use of these substances and where the respondent kept them. This did not make the evidence “unremarkable”, but logically gave rise to the question as to how D20 knew about these matters in such detail, a matter about which he was not cross–examined.  
      
       
     269 It has to be acknowledged, of course, that his Honour appears to have accepted the respondent’s evidence that he did not need to use amyl nitrate at that time because he was otherwise engaged in an emotional relationship. We say “appears to accept” because although his Honour merely records a statement to that effect by the respondent, this paragraph is included in his Honour’s Conclusions and appears to be",2002-12-23 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The Applicant seeks leave to appeal from sentences imposed upon him by O’Keefe J, after convictions on nine counts of malicious wounding and one count of manslaughter. 
     
      
    2 On 22 February 1999, the Applicant discharged two shots from a double barrel shotgun in Kiera Street, Wollongong, and shot and killed Mr Vedran Ravnjak (“the deceased”). There were a significant number of people in the vicinity of Keira Street and nine people were wounded. The Applicant was charged with murder. 
     
      
    3 At his trial he was found guilty of each malicious wounding charge. However, the jury was unable to agree on the murder. A second trial on the murder count led to the discharge of the jury. The Crown subsequently indicated that it would be prepared to accept a plea to manslaughter on the basis of provocation. Such a plea was entered and then accepted in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
       
      Background Facts 
       
      
    4 The development of an acrimonious relationship between the Applicant and Mr Ravnjak is at the centre of these tragic events. It appears that Mr Ravnjak had an association with Ms Maria Nacin. She broke up with him and, it emerged, she had falsely informed the deceased that she had developed an association with the Applicant. There then followed a long period of confrontation between the Applicant and the deceased. 
     
      
    5 They had previously been friends, but the friendship ceased and a course of harassment by Mr Ravnjak of the Applicant commenced. There were telephone calls in which the Applicant was threatened by the deceased. 
     
      
    6 On 18 January 1999, there was confrontation between the two men, during the course of which Mr Ravnjak said to the Applicant: “I am going to kill you when we get outside”. This confrontation culminated in a fight, but at this stage the Applicant claims not to have taken the threats seriously. The Applicant claimed in evidence before the sentencing judge that during the course of this fight, Mr Ravnjak produced a knife. However, his Honour did not accept that evidence and concluded that the fight was a fist fight. As a result of the fight, the deceased spent some days in hospital. 
     
      
    7 After the deceased was released from hospital, he telephoned the Applicant again and threatened him. Again he said he would kill him. The Applicant says that, at this stage, he started to believe that the deceased was capable of doing what he said and he became scared. 
     
      
    8 On a subsequent occasion at a nightclub, on either 25 or 26 January 1999, Mr Ravnjak pointed to the Applicant and made a motion indicating that he intended to slit the Applicant’s throat. The sentencing judge accepted that about this time the Applicant was beginning to think that Mr Ravnjak would be capable of carrying out his threats and may do so. 
     
      
    9 Thereafter, there were many threatening phone calls from Mr Ravnjak to the Applicant, during the course of which Mr Ravnjak threatened to kill the Applicant’s mother and his son. The Applicant reacted strongly to these statements and threatened the deceased. 
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although I am firmly of the opinion that there is some exaggeration on the part of the prisoner in his evidence … I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that threats of a kind that were very upsetting, disturbing and quite worrying were made by Mr Ravnjak to the prisoner. They included threats to kill the prisoner, his mother and his son.” 
        
       
       
        
        The prisoner’s reaction was that he was angry and scared and that he felt ’ 
        like a cat, a cat when it stands and its spine just goes up. I felt like all my hairs just gone up into my head, my body 
        ’. I accept this evidence and further accept that by this time he had come to believe that Mr Ravnjak was capable of carrying out his threats.” 
        
       
      
    11 The Applicant contacted Mr Ravnjak’s father to seek assistance to prevail upon his son to stop making threats. Nevertheless, frequent threatening phone calls from Mr Ravnjak continued. 
     
      
    12 There was an incident just a few days before the actual killing. Mr Ravnjak went to the vicinity of the home of the Applicant’s mother and was seen by him in the street. The Applicant then took a .357 Magnum pistol, which he had purchased, rushed out of the premises, chased Mr Ravnjak and fired five shots at him. The Applicant gave evidence he thought that the deceased had a pistol in his hand on this occasion. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge noted that the Applicant had not mentioned any such pistol in his statements to the police, nor had he mentioned it to either of his treating psychiatrists. His Honour did not accept the evidence of the Applicant on this matter. Nevertheless, his Honour had no doubt that Mr Ravnjak had come to the house of the Applicant’s mother and that the Applicant had fired a gun on that occasion. 
     
      
    14 The Applicant retrieved a sawn off shot gun, which he had purchased some eight to twelve months before the shooting, from its hiding place. Thereafter he kept the gun, together with some ammunition, at close hand. Furthermore, he had purchased the Magnum pistol, to which I have referred, about one week before the shooting. 
     
      
    15 The sentencing judge noted that in 1992 the Applicant had pleaded guilty to illegally possessing firearms and had been fined. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge went on to find that from early February until the day before the killing, the deceased made further numerous threatening telephone calls to the Applicant. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was thus a basis for the belief that I am satisfied the prisoner had by that time formed that Mr Ravnjak was capable of carrying out his threats and well may do so.” 
        
       
      
    17 The Applicant gave evidence that he carried the shotgun with him during this period, including on the morning of the killing. In the course of his record of interview the following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What was your intention if you had found Vedran Ravnjak on one of those occasions with your loaded firearm? 
         
        A. I would have shot him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what was your intention when you shot him? Was it to wound him or was it to kill him? 
         
        A. I don’t know. First thought probably just wound him. But, that particular day I wanted to kill him.” 
        
       
      
    18 On 22 February 1999, the Applicant had his shotgun with him. He and a male companion drove to Keira Street, Wollongong, in the afternoon. When he got out of the car, the Applicant saw Mr Ravnjak on the western side of Keira Street. The Applicant reached back into his vehicle, took out the backpack in which he had the shotgun and ammunition. He crossed to the eastern side of Keira Street. When he reached the footpath on the east, the Applicant called out to Mr Ravnjak. 
     
      
    19 According to his Honour’s finding, the deceased was then walking diagonally from west to east across Keira Street towards the north. The deceased’s back was half turned away from the Applicant, who was, by that time, on the eastern side of Keira Street. There was a verbal exchange between the Applicant and Mr Ravnjak, which was initiated by the Applicant and was quite short. Independent evidence did not establish what was said. 
     
      
    20 I should note the version propounded by Mr Ramage, who appears for the applicant, was that it was Mr Ravnjak who had originally called out the Applicant’s name and initiated the conversation. 
     
      
    21 In the record of interview, the Applicant said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I asked him in Serbian, the things he said over the phone and he, you know, ‘Are you gonna commit to them, going to do it?’ And he had a smile on his face and he went, ‘Yeah’, so, you know, if you translate it bloody oath you know … And that’s when I snapped … 
        
       
       
        
        Darkness fell over my eyes. I took it out of my bag. He watched me load it. I loaded it, took it up; he didn’t really notice what it was and sort of came forward towards me … I swung the gun over. I hit him with the gun, that’s when the first shot fired …” 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour concluded that it was clear that the deceased was not carrying anything in his hands. He had no bag with him and was wearing loose-fitting clothing. His Honour noted that the Applicant claimed that he thought the loose clothing might possibly have concealed a knife. His Honour said that this was not mentioned in the record of interview at the police station, or at the demonstration which took place at the scene. That is not challenged by Mr Ramage. 
     
      
    23 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “When considered in the light of the plea entered on behalf of the prisoner I am satisfied beyond any doubt that the killing of Mr Ravnjak by the prisoner did not occur in circumstances in which the prisoner was in any actual fear on the particular occasion for his own life or bodily well being. He was, however, provoked to do what he did largely by the threats made by the deceased concerning the prisoner’s mother and son. That he was provoked is the effect of the plea.” 
        
       
      
    24 Two shots were fired in quick succession within seconds. The first shot caused injury to nine bystanders who were spread along the eastern side of Keira Street at various distances up to some fifty metres. They included men, women and a child. They suffered a number of different injuries. None of the wounds resulted in serious and permanent disablement, though in one case, it produced certain ongoing effect, which were debilitating. 
     
      
    25 The second shot was discharged when Mr Ravnjak was approximately a metre from the Applicant. The contents of that cartridge did not have an opportunity to scatter. They entered the abdomen of the deceased and the pellets spread out inside him with fatal effect. 
     
      
    26 After the shooting, the Applicant and his companion slowly walked back across the western side of Keira Street and left the scene. The Applicant declined to identify his companion. An eyewitness observed the Applicant and his companion walking slowly, placing the gun in the bag, getting into the car and driving away. 
     
      
    27 The Applicant was at large for about four days, during which time he gave an interview to the media concerning the events of the day. He expressed no remorse for the killing of Mr Ravnjak, but he did express some remorse with respect to the shooting of the bystanders. 
     
      
    28 His Honour, after reciting the above facts concluded, correctly, that “objectively the circumstances of the killing were serious.” He did note, however, that the plea of guilty to manslaughter based on provocation meant that the act causing death was committed as a result of the loss of self-control on the part of the Applicant, which was induced by the conduct of the deceased. 
     
      
    29 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the circumstances in which the killing occurred, the relative situations of the deceased and the prisoner on the day in question, such of the evidence given by the prisoner as I have said I accept, and the plea accepted by the Crown, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the prisoner intended to kill Mr Ravnjak, but that such intention was a consequence of the provocation proffered by Mr Ravnjak over a period of time and finally on the day of the shooting.” 
        
       
      
    30 That reference to “on the day of the shooting” is no doubt a reference to a statement which the Applicant attributed to the deceased to the effect that he indicated in Serbo/Croatian, something roughly translated as “bloody oath” to a question as to whether he intended to carry out his threats. 
     
      
       
      The Reasons of the Sentencing Judge 
       
      
    31 In his reasons, his Honour turned first to the sentence for manslaughter. He noted the wide variety of circumstances in which the crime of manslaughter is committed. He noted that the felonious taking of a human life was recognised as a serious crime. He said the factual content and circumstances of the crime may significantly reduce the blameworthiness of the perpetrator. 
     
      
    32 With respect to the convictions on nine charges of malicious wounding, his Honour noted that the charges did not involve an intention to wound. His Honour noted that in the case of these changes, unlike the count of manslaughter, no issue of provocation arose directly. However, his Honour noted that the shooting of the bystanders occurred as an accompaniment of the shooting of Mr Ravnjak and the circumstances of provocation. Further, the principle of totality was required to be considered. 
     
      
    33 His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        “… members of the community are entitled to go about their everyday affairs without concern that someone may shoot them, albeit as part of an intent to kill or inflict harm on some other person brought about in circumstances of provocation by such other person. The members of the community are entitled to be free from having their physical health and well-being interfered with in the course of the resolution of personal and private problems between two particular people. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        … the place and time of the commission of those offences in the present case mark them as objectively serious. 
        
       
       
        
        Thus, when determining the sentences for the nine charges on which the prisoner was convicted by the jury it would not, in my opinion, be appropriate to make the sentences on the nine counts of malicious wounding wholly concurrent with the sentence to be imposed in respect of the conviction of manslaughter. The sentences in respect of those offences should reflect their seriousness and the disapprobation of the Courts for crimes of such a nature.” 
        
       
      
    34 His Honour noted the various factors that were to be considered in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. He referred to the need to take into account the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    35 I have outlined, in my consideration of the background facts, a number of his Honour’s findings of fact. Of particular significance was his Honour’s findings about the circumstances giving rise to provocation. 
     
      
    36 It was submitted his Honour should have found the degree of provocation to be significant or even great. I am not sure of the terms in which the submission was made to his Honour, but his Honour treated it as a submission that the degree of provocation should be found to be “quite great”. 
     
      
    37 His Honour set out the facts found by him, including that there were thirty to fifty threatening phone calls over a comparatively short time. These phone calls, together with the confrontations and events preceding the shooting, had a cumulative effect on the Applicant and were responsible for him losing his self-control. 
     
      
    38 His Honour concluded that the threats were seen by the Applicant as real and that the fact that they involved threats to his family was of particular significance to him. Nevertheless, his Honour said that: “the description ‘great’ goes beyond the description I would apply.” 
     
      
    39 His Honour indicated that he took into account the plea of guilty, although he did not quantify the degree to which he took it into account. 
     
      
    40 It had also been submitted that the plea indicated the Applicant’s contrition. His Honour referred to the media interview, to which I have already referred, in which the Applicant expressed his regret for injuring the bystanders, but no such regret with respect to killing Mr Ravnjak. His Honour noted that this stance was maintained at the first trial. It was not until the sentencing hearing, and here in this Court, that any element of contrition was expressed by him, in terms. 
     
      
    41 His Honour accepted that there was genuine contrition, albeit belated. 
     
      
    42 His Honour rejected a submission that the killing lacked premeditation. His Honour found that the shotgun was not obtained for self-protection. Rather, his Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was retrieved by the prisoner well before the killing and carried by him, mainly in a loaded condition, so that he could use it on Mr Ravnjak when he  
        found 
         him … By his own admission the prisoner’s intent was to kill Mr Ravnjak. The plea of guilty on the basis of provocation involves an acceptance of the fact that there was either an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm at the time of the shooting, albeit as a result of the provocation.” 
        
       
      
    43 His Honour concluded that the Applicant intended, on the day of the killing, to discharge the shotgun at the deceased and had been so intending prior to that day. 
     
      
    44 His Honour noted the firearms offence on the part of the Applicant. His Honour also set out a number of subjective considerations directed to the prospects for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    45 A submission was made to O’Keefe J that the sentences for the malicious wounding should be wholly concurrent with the sentence for manslaughter. His Honour rejected that submission and added to his earlier observations quoted above: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have already expressed the view that the combination of nine malicious woundings together with the manslaughter, even given that they are closely related in time and in origin, should nonetheless bear a greater blameworthiness than a conviction for the manslaughter alone. It would be inappropriate in accordance with community standards to ignore the nine malicious woundings, even taking into account the circumstances of the present case. 
        
       
       
        
        Even given the application of the principle of totality I am of opinion that regard should be had to the fact that nine people were injured as a consequence of the actions of the prisoner. However, recognition of the fact that those offences were closely related to and intertwined with the manslaughter is also appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    46 His Honour proceeded to impose a sentence for each of the malicious woundings and to make the manslaughter sentence partially concurrent with the sentences for the malicious woundings. His Honour fixed a term of three years for each of the offences of malicious wounding and determined those sentences would be concurrent with each other. 
     
      
    47 His Honour then imposed a sentence of ten years imprisonment for the manslaughter, which was to commence at the expiration of two years of the three-year sentences for the malicious wounding charges. 
     
      
    48 His Honour fixed the non-parole period so that it expired on 25 February 2007. His Honour said that it was appropriate to vary the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period and said that he found special circumstances on two grounds, rehabilitation prospects of the Applicant and the accumulation of sentences. 
     
      
    49 His Honour varied the ratio for a non-parole period of seven and a half years down to six years by reason of these factors. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    50 The Applicant relies on the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      1. The total sentence imposed was unduly harsh and severe. 
       
       
      2. The sentencing judge erred in imposing fixed sentences for the malicious wounding counts. 
       
       
      3. The sentencing judge erred: 
       
       
       (a) in accumulating the sentences; 
       
       
        
        (b) in failing to give an appropriate reduction in sentence for the plea; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) in failing to appreciate the level and extent of the provocation endured by the Applicant; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) in determining that provocation was not relevant on the malicious wounding offences; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) in finding that the number of persons wounded was a relevant aggravating matter; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) in failing to take into account that the Applicant had unsuccessfully sought assistance against the deceased from the police; 
        
       
       
       (g) in failing to give full benefit to the contrition shown; 
       
       
        
        (h) in making adverse findings of fact against the Applicant which were largely irrelevant to the proceedings and not open to him to make at the requisite standard, which included: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) that the deceased did not possess a knife during the fight on 18 January 1999; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) that the Applicant was an associate of the criminal element; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) that the Applicant did not believe that the deceased may have had a knife on him at the time of the shooting; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iv) that the Applicant was not in any actual fear for his own life or bodily well being at the time of the shooting; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (v) that at an earlier incident where the Applicant said he fired a pistol, that the Applicant thought the deceased had a gun. 
          
         
        
       
       
      The Appeal 
       
      
    51 The jurisdiction which this Court exercises is that found in s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It turns on the formation of an opinion on the part of this Court that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed”. 
        
       
      
    52 If the Court forms such an opinion, it is empowered to quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution for it. I am not of the opinion that another sentence less severe than that imposed by O’Keefe J is warranted. This is a test which must be applied to each of the offences. 
     
      
    53 The three year sentence imposed with respect to each of the malicious wounding counts was fully justified. These were innocent bystanders who were injured by the Applicant who pursued his victim in a public place. The offence was constituted by the inflicting of wounds and does not turn on any intention to wound. It has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years. 
     
      
    54 The sentencing judge’s imposition of a sentence of three years is well within the scope of his discretion. It would not be regarded as high, even though the offender had lost control of his actions for reasons unconnected with the victims of these offences. 
     
      
    55 I reach a similar conclusion with respect to the imposition of a ten year sentence, with a six year non-parole period in the case of the conviction for manslaughter. What was involved was, in substance, a public execution, which was reduced from murder to manslaughter, by the acceptance on the part of the Crown that the degree of provocation was such as to involve a relevant loss of self-control on the part of the Applicant. 
     
      
    56 Nevertheless, the loss of human life involved requires condign punishment. His Honour’s sentence was well within the scope of the reasonable exercise of his discretion in all the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    57 The Applicant relied on the Judicial Commission’s sentencing statistics with respect to each of the two kinds of offences here in question. I do not find the statistics helpful on this occasion. 
     
      
    58 In the case of manslaughter, it is well known the circumstances of the offence differ so widely that virtually nothing can be obtained from statistics that is of assistance in a particular case. 
     
      
    59 With respect to the statistics relating to malicious wounding, they indicate that only thirty two percent of offenders received more than three years as a head sentence and that sixty percent received non-parole periods or minimum terms of eighteen months or less. 
     
      
    60 These do not suggest to me that there is anything particularly severe about the sentences imposed in this case. These statistics alone do not suggest that his Honour’s sentences are outside the permissible range. 
     
      
    61 His Honour was, in my opinion, entitled to impose fixed term sentences rather than, as suggested by the Applicant in ground 2, that he should have imposed a term with a non-parole period. 
     
      
    62 A fixed term is a sentencing option that is reasonably open. In any event, I would not form the opinion, for which s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 calls, in circumstances where as a matter of substance, the effect of his Honour’s sentencing structure was equivalent to his imposing a head sentence of three years, with a non-parole period of two years for consecutive sentences, i.e. consecutive between the wounding and the manslaughter offences. 
     
      
    63 I have noted that a number of the grounds of appeal overlap. This is because of the way his Honour accumulated the sentences. This was part of the basis for ground 1 and is also expressly raised in ground 3(a). 
     
      
    64 The Applicant’s submission that there was no “extra criminality involved” in the malicious wounding offences, apparently based on the fact that they came from one act. That submission should be rejected. At the very least it ignores the fact that there were two shots. It was the first shot that injured the bystanders and the second that killed the deceased. His Honour gave clear and cogent reasons for indicating that the additional criminality involved in the malicious wounding charges needed to be separately recognised in the sentences he imposed. His Honour was correct for the reasons he gave. 
     
      
    65 A submission was made that the effect of the accumulation was such as to deprive the Applicant of the finding of special circumstances, but the finding of special circumstances was partly based on the accumulation of sentences. In any event, the substance of the sentence structure is, as I have indicated, a three year head sentence for malicious wounding, with a two year non-parole period. This was a recognition of special circumstances to some degree. 
     
      
    66 By ground of appeal 3(b), the Applicant asserts that the sentence was so high that it manifested the probability that an appropriate reduction in sentence for the guilty plea had not been given. His Honour stated that he took the plea into account. He was not obliged to quantify the effect of the allowance for the plea. 
     
      
    67 There is no basis for any inference that his Honour failed to give the plea proper weight. The inference is not available from the sentence itself. This ground of appeal is no more than a possible explanation of why, if it were otherwise the case, his Honour imposed a sentence which was beyond the range of permissible discretion. As I have indicated above, in my opinion, his Honour did not do so. 
     
      
    68 As to ground of appeal 3(c), the Applicant submitted that his Honour minimised the degree of provocation. His Honour did make a finding that, in all the circumstances, he would not describe the degree of provocation as “great”. This was a matter which was at the heart of Mr Ramage’s submissions. 
     
      
    69 It was open to his Honour to evaluate the extent, gravity and effect of the provocation for purposes of the plea. The degree of provocation is a relevant consideration on sentence (see R v Alexander (1995) 78 A Crim R 141 at 144). 
     
      
    70 His Honour accepted that the provocation had led to a loss of self-control on the part of the Applicant. Nevertheless, the acts constituting the provocation were threats, albeit made on numerous occasions and directed not only at the Applicant, but also at his mother and son. 
     
      
    71 Nevertheless, it was open to his Honour to come to the view, bearing in mind the range of kinds of provocation with which the Court is familiar over many years of dealing with issues of this character, that the particular acts in this case were not at the highest end of the scale. 
     
      
    72 The Applicant submitted his Honour erred in saying that provocation was not relevant to the malicious wounding offences. This is ground of appeal 3(d). It was, however, accepted, that although it was not a legal defence to the charges, it nevertheless was a matter to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for the malicious wounding charges. 
     
      
    73 I do not believe his Honour ignored the fact the Applicant had lost control of his actions at the time he fired the first shot which caused injury to the bystanders. He did say that “no issue of provocation arose” with respect to the malicious wounding charges. This was, in my view, a reference to the uncontested proposition that provocation was not a defence, or even a partial defence to those charges. In the passage in which that statement appears, his Honour immediately went on to say that “the fact that the shooting of the nine people in question took place immediately before and as an accompaniment to the ultimate shooting of Mr Ravnjak” and, as his Honour put it, “consideration needs to be given to those circumstances”. His Honour’s reference to ‘consideration needing to be given to the circumstances’ indicates that his Honour did take into account, on the malicious wounding charges, the facts and matters constituting provocation for the killing of the deceased, although he did not take into account provocation as such. 
     
      
    74 Ground of appeal 3(e) states that his Honour erred by holding the number of persons wounded was a relevant aggravating factor. The Applicant submitted that “there was only one reckless criminal act”. Accordingly, the number of persons was not an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    75 In my opinion, his Honour was entitled to take into account on sentence for each of the malicious wounding charges, the fact that each charge occurred in such circumstances that the Applicant discharged a shotgun in a crowded shopping street. Notwithstanding the situation that he had lost control, the number of persons injured on the same occasion was not an irrelevant consideration on sentence for each. However, I do not believe it is a proper reading of his Honour’s judgment that he took the matter into account in this way. His Honour referred to the number of persons injured as bystanders in the context of determining that the sentence for manslaughter should not be wholly concurrent with all of the sentences for malicious wounding. In fact, he did make all of the sentences for malicious wounding concurrent with each other. 
     
      
    76 Ground of appeal 3(f) is to the effect his Honour failed to take into account that the Applicant had unsuccessfully sought assistance against the deceased from the police. It was submitted that this not only supported the existence of threats, which his Honour in any event accepted in full, but also was a manifestation of “the Applicant’s desire to stay within the law”. 
     
      
    77 I accept that attempts to avoid violence are a relevant consideration. His Honour did not expressly refer to this matter in his reasons for sentence. His Honour did, however, refer to the attempt to obtain the intervention of the deceased’s father. This was a matter which his Honour took into account and was, in all of the circumstances of the deceased’s irrational behaviour, a more likely source of redress. 
     
      
    78 Although his Honour does not mention the approach to the police, I doubt his Honour failed to take it into account. Nevertheless, on any view, it was not a matter which would materially affect the ultimate result. 
     
      
    79 Ground of appeal 3(g) asserts his Honour failed to give full benefit for the contrition shown. His Honour accepted that there was genuine but belated contrition. The Applicant’s submission was based on his Honour’s finding that “no contrition was expressed by the prisoner” until after the second trial. There was evidence that the Applicant had expressed contrition at least to his lawyers prior to the second trial. There was also other evidence, to which Mr Ramage referred, suggesting expressions of contrition to other people, which expressions could have extended to the deceased, and not simply to the bystanders. 
     
      
    80 His Honour’s observations in his remarks on sentence were directed to the failure to “express” contrition to the court. This is made plain from the immediately preceding sentences quoted above, where his Honour noted that the second trial was aborted before the Applicant had an opportunity to give evidence. 
     
      
    81 In my opinion, his Honour did not minimise the Applicant’s contrition. He accepted it as genuine, though belated, and took it into account in his sentence. 
     
      
    82 Ground of appeal 3(h) refers to a number of findings of fact. I have referred to the remarks on sentence in which his Honour makes the various references to which objection is taken. Each of the findings was open to his Honour and I do not find any of them to be irrelevant to the decision-making process of his Honour. Nor, in my opinion, were any of the challenged findings of central significance to the sentencing process. 
     
      
    83 Whether or not a knife was in the possession of Mr Ravnjak during the fight on 18 January, was of some relevance to the level of provocation relied upon by the Applicant. However, the finding by his Honour that he rejected the evidence of the Applicant that the deceased had a knife was not of great significance as his Honour found that the Applicant did eventually develop a fear for his life and that he did eventually develop a loss of control as a result of the provocation. 
     
      
    84 The reference to the Applicant being an associate of criminal elements was in the context of whether or not his prior record was such as to justify any degree of leniency. This statement played a limited role in that judgment, which was based on the prior conviction of the firearms offences and the Applicant’s possession of two firearms, one a shotgun, which he had acquired some months before for unspecified future use and, therefore, had nothing to do with any provocation by the deceased. 
     
      
    85 Nor can any complaint be made about his Honour’s finding that the Applicant did not believe that the deceased had a knife on the day. His Honour simply rejected the Applicant’s assertion. His Honour’s reasoning was based on the objective circumstances of the event and the absence of any such assertion on prior occasions, although his Honour appears to have erred in one inconsequential respect in this regard. 
     
      
    86 The Applicant had armed himself with a shotgun for the express purpose of killing the deceased. The circumstances of provocation leading to the killing were not determined by the asserted belief that the deceased had a knife on the day. In any event, in my opinion, it was open to his Honour to reject the evidence. 
     
      
    87 Similarly, it was open for his Honour to conclude that the Applicant had no actual fear for his life “on this particular occasion”. His Honour otherwise accepted the evidence that the Applicant did have fear for his life and for the safety of his mother and son. By his reference to “on this particular occasion”, his Honour was referring to the absence of any specific threat to which the shooting was an immediate impulsive reaction. His Honour was entitled to make such a finding. His Honour accepted that the killing was provoked by a fear on the part of the Applicant for his life. 
     
      
    88 I come to the same conclusion with respect to the assertion that there was error in his Honour’s rejection of the Applicant’s assertion that, on a prior occasion, he thought that the object, which he believed the deceased had in his hand, was a pistol. It was open to his Honour to reject that evidence. 
     
      
    89 In oral submissions the Applicant identified an additional factual error to those set out in the grounds of appeal. That factual finding was the finding to the effect that the short verbal exchange on the day of the killing was initiated by the Applicant. However, the most that was said at this time, by either the deceased or Applicant, was the calling out of the other’s name. If there is any error on the part of the sentencing judge, I consider it was immaterial. 
     
      
    90 Leave to appeal should be granted, but the appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    91 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice, subject to one matter, with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    92 The point of difference lies in the description of the degree of provocation. I would, myself, have characterised it as “great” but that fact would not cause me to think that his Honour’s sentence was otherwise than appropriate. 
     
      
    93 That conclusion follows largely because of the response of the Applicant to the provocation in the period leading up to the fatal day, and, indeed, on that day. 
     
      
    94 The Applicant’s failure to do a lot more by way of dealing with the provocative conduct in a more civilised manner, in going more than once to the police if he could not achieve the satisfaction he wanted from them, in arming himself, not with only one but with two weapons, in carrying those one or other of the weapons with him, often in a loaded state, on the day in question, on not departing when he saw the deceased in the street, and then in taking the weapon from the car with him at a time when he wished to accost the deceased, are all matters of conduct to be weighed in the balance against the extent of provocation. 
     
      
    95 His offence was gross, and the penalty, in my view, appropriate. 
     
      
    96 BUDDIN J: I agree with the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    97 SPIGELMAN CJ: The order is leave to appeal is granted, appeal dismissed.

      70055/02 - REGINA v Van Teo CAO 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 18 July 2003 Van Teo Cao was found guilty of having murdered Karolina Zizius on 22 May 2001. It remains for me to pass sentence. To do so I must first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion in a manner consistent with the jury verdict. Where the facts are adverse, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Cao, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities (R v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270). 
     
      
       
      The Incident 
       
      
    2 In May 2001 Mr Cao was 45 years old. The deceased, Karolina Zizius, was 25 years. She was a heroin addict. They had known each other for a number of years. According to the deceased's mother, they had been living together off and on for approximately three years.  
     
      
    3 At about 8.30 am on Sunday 13 May 2001, Mr Cao was telephoned by his friend, Mr Nguyen. Mr Nguyen suggested that they should go to the Flemington Markets. Mr Cao agreed. At approximately 10.00 am, Mr Nguyen and his wife came to Mr Cao's flat in Villawood Road, Villawood. They remained there for about two hours before setting out for the markets. During that time Mrs Nguyen cooked a meal, which they ate. Karolina Zizius remained in the bedroom. She did not come out. Mr Cao told his friends that she was asleep. He later told the police that she had taken heroin at approximately 11.00 am. 
     
      
    4 Mr Cao had two children, Jasmine and Krystal. They were then aged about five years and three years. The children also went to the markets. A number of purchases were made, including a bag of rice by Mr Cao. 
     
      
    5 The group left the markets, arriving at Villawood shortly after 2.00 pm. Mrs Nguyen and Jasmine were dropped at the local shopping centre, which was close by. Mr Cao and Mr Nguyen therefore arrived at the flat a few minutes ahead of Mrs Nguyen and Jasmine, who completed the journey on foot. Mr and Mrs Abbott occupied the flat below. It was Mothers' Day and they were sitting outside on the steps. They saw Mr Cao and Mr Nguyen return.  
     
      
    6 Having entered his flat, Mr Cao began washing the dishes from the morning meal. Mrs Nguyen then arrived and volunteered to complete that task. To this point it was a very ordinary domestic day. Mr Cao left the kitchen. He went to the bedroom which he shared with Karolina. 
     
      
    7 Karolina was awake. There was an argument. The jury accepted, and I therefore find, that Mr Cao took hold of a slim metal rod, which had been part of a television aerial, which he then used as a weapon to strike the deceased. The blow was delivered above the left ear with considerable force, sufficient to penetrate the skull. It entered the brain to a depth of about 3 cms. Karolina Zizius immediately lost consciousness. 
     
      
    8 Thereafter, paradoxically, Mr Cao's actions manifested an extreme concern for the welfare of Karolina. Because his English was limited, he rushed downstairs and presented his mobile phone to Mrs Abbott. He asked her to telephone the emergency number to summon an ambulance. The ambulance, in fact, took some time. Mr Cao ran up and down the stairs, suggesting that the authorities should be rung again. 
     
      
    9 Once the ambulance personnel arrived, Mr Cao was in a state of extreme agitation. He was asked by the ambulance officers, and by others, what had happened. He suggested that Karolina had thrown the aerial at him in the course of their argument. It had struck the door. It had then rebounded and somehow penetrated her skull. 
     
      
    10 It was said by the Crown that this was a false explanation and, indeed, was a deliberate lie told in order to cover up his own guilt. The jury clearly accepted that this was so.  
     
      
    11 What is known about the argument between the deceased and Mr Cao? Mr Cao did not give evidence at the trial. However, he provided the police with a statement. He also participated in an electronic interview. He said, and I accept, that Karolina was upset with him for not having woken her up so that she could go to the markets. She also asked for more heroin. However, there was none. 
     
      
    12 I think it probable that, in the course of the argument, Karolina Zizius broke the aerial, separating the two rods from the plastic base. I also think it probable that she threw part of the aerial at Mr Cao. Mr Cao gave the impression, and I accept, that he retreated from the room, closing the door behind him. There was an indentation consistent with the door having been struck by part of the aerial. 
     
      
    13 Neither Mr Nguyen nor his wife heard raised voices, although they were in adjacent rooms. The Abbotts, likewise, gave no evidence of having heard raised voices. Both Mr and Mrs Abbott said that the interval between Mr Cao's arrival from the markets and his rushing downstairs, asking Mrs Abbott to telephone the ambulance, was about ten minutes. Indeed, it may have been as little as five minutes. Part of that time was spent by Mr Cao in washing up. The argument, therefore, must have been short lived. It follows that the act of Mr Cao in striking Karolina was impulsive, presumably the consequence of a flash of anger. It is not known what caused that anger. The only evidence of anger was that of Karolina towards Mr Cao. However, common sense would suggest that something must have been said or done which provoked in fact (if not in law) Mr Cao. 
     
      
    14 Karolina Zizius was taken to the Liverpool Hospital. She underwent surgery. At first she appeared to make progress. However, she relapsed and died on 22 May 2002. 
     
      
       
      Mr Cao's Background 
       
      
    15 Mr Cao gave evidence on sentence. He was born on 15 January 1956 in Vietnam. He described his parents as ""fisher folk"". He came to Australia in 1979. He worked in a brick factory in Cooma. He was later employed by various businesses in the Cooma area. In 1980 he was working for a fish cannery at Eden when he suffered a serious industrial accident. He was left with a prominent scar on his face and, one gathers, damage to his eye. Thereafter he performed various jobs in restaurants and elsewhere.  
     
      
    16 Mr Cao, as mentioned, has two young children. They are now aged approximately seven years and five years. The mother of the children died in 1999. Mr Cao then took over the care of the children. Upon his arrest, the children were taken into the custody of ""welfare"". They have remained with welfare ever since, even though Mr Cao was granted bail within a relatively short time. Mr Cao speaks to his children from time to time by telephone. They are apparently in Adelaide where his former wife's mother lives. One gathers that the childrens' grandmother has some contact with them. 
     
      
    17 Mr Cao described the circumstances in which he met Karolina. He was at the office of the Department of Social Security. So was she. She had nowhere to live. She had stolen a machine from her sister whilst living at her mother's home. She had done so in order to pay for the drugs she required. The machine at the time had not been paid off. She was thereafter banished from the home. Mr Cao gave the following evidence on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... I helped her out by giving her a place to stay and giving her some pocket money."" 
        
       
      
    18 Karolina, when she was able, assisted with the house and the children. Ultimately, she and Mr Cao formed a relationship. Mr Cao took her back to her mother in the hope that she would again be accepted by her family. In this, one gathers, he was successful. Karolina's mother trusted him. She gave him the key to the house. 
     
      
    19 Mr Cao made various attempts to assist Karolina to give up heroin. Karolina entered a rehabilitation programme using the drug Naltrexone. The programme cost $3,000. That cost was met by Mr Cao. The rehabilitation programme required family support. Mr Cao provided that support, attending the centre each day. Unfortunately Karolina relapsed. She did not complete the programme. 
     
      
    20 Mr Cao then took Karolina to Vietnam in January 2001. They remained in Vietnam for approximately five weeks. In his words, she was kept busy, to distract her from her craving for heroin. She was also taught meditation techniques to overcome that craving. Again, however, she unfortunately relapsed. 
     
      
    21 After the jury verdict, Mr Cao asked his counsel to look after his wallet. Within his wallet was a photo of Karolina. I accept that Mr Cao loved Karolina. 
     
      
    22 Mr Cao has twice previously come before the Court in respect of criminal charges. The first occasion was in 1989. He was charged with offensive language. No conviction was recorded. The second occasion was in 1999. Mr Cao was charged with being in possession of a prohibited drug. He was fined the sum of $100. There is no evidence as to the nature of the drug. The Crown accepted that, having regard to the outcome, the drug was probably cannabis. The Crown also accepted that the matter should be approached upon the basis that Mr Cao has, for the purposes of sentencing, no relevant record. 
     
      
    23 Having regard to his age and history, I regard the prospects of Mr Cao's rehabilitation as very good. 
     
      
    24 I believe that it is appropriate to make a finding of special circumstances and to make a small adjustment to the sentence which would otherwise be appropriate. Mr Cao has had a limited education. As mentioned, he has limited English. His family is in Vietnam. He has been separated from his young children, who have been transferred interstate. His incarceration is likely to be the more harsh by reason of his isolation. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    25 I have been provided with statements made by Karolina Zizius' mother and her sisters. Although the deceased had her share of difficulties, by reason of her addiction to heroin, she was dearly loved by her mother and by her sisters. She is sorely missed. I must, of course, deal with this material in a manner consistent with R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85. 
     
      
    26 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence by way of imprisonment to serve the interests of punishment, including general deterrence. I accept that the incident occurred in the context of what may be described as a ""domestic relationship"" (R v Elphick [2002] NSWCCA 273, paras 16, 17 and 27). I further accept, as a generality, that Mr Cao loved the deceased. There was no evidence of abuse in their relationship. I accept as probable that unwittingly something said or done by the deceased provoked Mr Cao (cf s21A(3)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). Nonetheless, although spontaneous, the act of striking the deceased with a metal rod was one of significant brutality. 
     
      
    27 Mr Cao was in custody for ten days after his arrest and before being given bail. He has been in custody since the jury verdict (18 July 2003). To give Mr Cao the benefit of the ten days he served before he was convicted, I believe it appropriate to date the sentence from 8 July 2003. 
     
      
    28 Van Teo Cao, I sentence you to imprisonment for 15 years commencing on 8 July 2003, and expiring on 7 July 2018. I fix a non parole period of 10 years and 6 months. You will therefore be eligible for release on parole on 8 January 2014.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 WHEALY J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant had adhered to pleas of guilty before his Honour Acting Judge Shillington QC on 29 August 2002. These related to two charges.  
     
      
    2 First there was a charge of supply prohibited drug on an ongoing basis. This related to a period of time between 17 October and 30 October 2001. This offence carried a maximum penalty of twenty years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000, s 25A(1) Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    3 The second charge alleged a supply of a prohibited drug and referred to a total of 0.39 grams of cocaine, this supply having occurred on 30 November 2001. The second charge carried a maximum penalty of fifteen years’ imprisonment and/or a $220,000 fine, s 25(1) Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    4 In addition the applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account one charge of goods in custody relating to an amount of $585. So far as one can ascertain from the material in the present application the plea had apparently been first entered before a local magistrate on 27 June 2002. It was expressly conceded by the Crown during the sentencing process that the applicant should have the benefit of his early plea (see transcript of 6 September 2002 p 1, 40 to 45). 
     
      
    5 The learned sentencing judge took into account the matter on the Form 1 and sentenced the applicant in relation to the first charge to a term of imprisonment for four years commencing on 15 March 2002. His Honour imposed a non-parole period of two years expiring on 14 March 2004. 
     
      
    6 In relation to the second charge his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for two years commencing on 15 March 2002 and expiring on 14 March 2004. The applicant had been in custody since the date of his arrest on 15 March 2002. 
     
      
    7 It is convenient to state first the facts relating to the offences. The applicant was arrested as a result of undercover police operations carried out during October and November 2001. During this period of time the applicant was employed as a “runner” or “street dealer” with other operatives working out of a unit at Mitchell Road Alexandria.  
     
      
    8 Drugs were packaged at this address, the drugs being heroin and cocaine. They were sold in deals nominated by the cost of the package. A street dealer would go to a prearranged place by car and would collect money and hand out deals to customers. 
     
      
    9 Although the applicant was involved in supplies of this nature on an ongoing basis it was agreed at the sentence hearing that he should be sentenced on the basis of three particulars supplies of heroin during the relevant period. These particular occasions were 18 October, 19 October and 29 October 2001. I shall shortly describe them in more detail. 
     
      
    10 The cocaine charge however related to an undercover operative’s approach to the offender in a council car park on 30 November 2001 at Petersham. This operative sought and obtained two lots of cocaine being .14 and .25 grams respectively. Generally in relation to the nature of operations relating to the sale of both heroin and cocaine they were, as his Honour described them, “on a large scale”.  
     
      
    11 The documents tendered before the sentencing judge included a summary of the facts relating to the undercover operation prepared by the police. At the bottom of p 5 and the top of p 6 the following summary appears. 
     
      
       
        
        “During the controlled operation police undercover operatives purchased from Koklas a total of 0.33 grams of heroin and 0.39 grams of cocaine. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        During the controlled operation police undercover operatives purchased from Koklas and the co-defendants Burnett, Gent and Kanjo a total of 1.36 grams of heroin and 0.39 grams of cocaine.” 
        
       
      
    12 Details of the individual components of these amounts were contained in the police statement. For example on 18 October 2001 the facts summary stated that the undercover police operative saw the applicant pass an object to a male customer who had approached the vehicle and asked for “a 40”. This happened a second time in relation to a second customer. 
     
      
    13 The operative then approached Koklas and asked for “two 40s”. The operative paid $80 cash to the applicant and received two small red balloons from the other person who was in the car with the applicant. While the operative was walking away, she saw another customer approach the vehicle and pass a $50 note to the applicant hearing him ask for “a 50 of coke”. The contents of the two balloons supplied to the operative were analysed and each found to weigh .08 grams and 0.07 grams of heroin with purities of 13.5 percent each. 
     
      
    14 The undercover operation continued again on 19 October 2001. On this occasion the operative approached a motor vehicle being driven by a person Burnett. The applicant was in the passenger seat. The operative passed $80 cash to the applicant and asked for “two 40s”. Burnett then removed two small red balloons from a plastic container in the console, passed these to the applicant, who in turn handed them to the operative. The contents of these balloons were analysed and each found to weigh 0.05 grams and 0.07 grams of heroin. 
     
      
    15 The third specific supply occasion in relation to the heroin occurred on 29 October 2001. The operative approached a motor vehicle at Bent Street Petersham at about 2.58pm. The operative spoke to the applicant who was in the front passenger seat and asked for “a 40”. Forty dollars cash was handed over to the applicant and he in turn handed over a small red balloon to the operative. The contents were analysed and found to weigh a total of 0.06 grams of heroin with a purity of 14 percent. 
     
      
    16 It is to be observed that the total combined weight of those balloons whose contents were analysed, that is those that related to the specific supplies by the applicant to the operative, was 0.33 grams. This is in fact the amount identified in the police statement at the bottom of p 5 to which I have made earlier reference. The amount mentioned at the top of p 6 was of course considerably higher.  
     
      
    17 In this regard it is to be noted that Mr Dalton, who appeared for the applicant during the sentencing process, specifically asked the judge to note the discrepancy between the amounts at the foot of p 5 and the top of p 6 of the summary. Mr Dalton also asked the sentencing judge to note that it had been agreed, as he understood it, between the Crown and the applicant that the applicant was to be sentenced only in relation to the actual amounts that related to the supply by the applicant to the operative, that is they were not to include those that related to any other supply referred to in the police summary.  
     
      
    18 Putting the matter slightly differently, as I understand the agreement referred to by Mr Dalton, the quantities noted at the top of p 6 were only to be taken into account in a general and not in any specific manner. As to the three specific supplies his Honour said this, - (I quote from p 1 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence and over to p 2). 
     
      
       
        
        “The three occasions related to incidents which occurred on 18 October 2001 when an undercover police operative rang a mobile phone service and was told to go to the address at Petersham where the operative saw two males approaching a motor vehicle and obtaining a 40, that is 0.5 grams of heroin. The operative then asked for and obtained two 40s costing $80. The physical handover was from the prisoner.  
        
       
       
        
        On 19 October, the following day, an undercover made a phone call on a mobile phone, again met the prisoner who was the passenger in the vehicle in a motor vehicle at a Petersham address. He then bought 2.05grams of heroin for $80. The third occasion was on 29 October when the undercover again purchased a $40 weight of heroin from the prisoner in the passenger seat of a motor vehicle near Mandrill Park.” 
        
       
      
    19 The sentencing judge dealt with the prisoner’s subjective circumstances quite briefly. He noted that he was then twenty-eight years of age; he had a substantial criminal record which began in 1992; he noted that the entries were almost entirely drug-related, although this was his first period in custody. The sentencing judge then referred to his upbringing in a supportive family environment, to the fact that he had regular work and that he was leading a productive life until his addiction to hard drugs about five years earlier. 
     
      
    20 His Honour noted that the addiction to heroin had had a devastating effect upon the applicant causing the loss of legitimate work and had occasioned financial pressure, both upon his family and himself. Nevertheless, the applicant’s family had continued to support him. The applicant had attributed the commission of the offences to financial demands resulting from his addiction. 
     
      
    21 That this was so was confirmed by the references which had been tendered before the sentencing judge. There was in addition a letter from the applicant himself in which he claimed he was now determined to rid himself of his drug habit. 
     
      
    22 In relation to the sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have formed the view that clearly a full-time custodial sentences must be imposed. On the charge of the s 25A matter the prisoner is sentenced to four years’ imprisonment which is to date from 15 March this year and there will be a non-parole period of two years. I find special circumstances being his need for rehabilitation upon his release. The form 1 charge will be taken into account on that charge.” 
        
       
      
    23 In relation to the second charge, as I have already indicated, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term which was to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on the s 25A offence. 
     
      
    24 Six grounds were identified in the written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant in support of the submission that the sentence was too severe. 
     
      
    25 First it was alleged that the learned sentencing judge had erred in relation to his calculation of the quantity of drugs supplied in relation to the heroin charge. In fact it was submitted that his Honour treated the overall criminality on count 1 as involving a weight of heroin of at least 2.55 grams excluding the weight of the third supply: that is, an amount over seven times greater than that which was actually involved in the subject offence. Additionally it constituted an amount of well over four times the weight of the drugs combined from both counts 1 and 2. 
     
      
    26 Secondly it was submitted that his Honour had failed to properly assess the applicant’s level of criminality. It was suggested the applicant had in fact been at the “bottom of the line” of responsibility and had been subject to a regime of violent subrogation at the hands of the organiser, one Nader Barakat. 
     
      
    27 Thirdly his Honour was said to have erred in failing to take into account the fact that the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. There should have been attributed a discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea at the upper level of the range, that is 20 percent to 25 percent. (See R v Sharma [2002] NSWCCA 142 and R v Thompson [2000] 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    28 Fourthly it was submitted that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the fact that the applicant had served and would in the future be required to serve all his time in prison in strict protection because of the real fears for his safety. One co-offender, Asad Barakat, in fact had been killed in custody as the pre-sentence report identified. 
     
      
    29 Fifthly it was submitted that the overall sentence was excessive having regard to certain stated comparative sentences. 
     
      
    30 Finally it was argued that the principle of parity was infringed so as to give rise to a legitimate sense of grievance. This was said to arise out of the fact that a co-offender, Albani, a runner at the same level as the applicant, had been sentenced to a suspended fixed term of 12 months. 
     
      
    31 Overall, counsel for the applicant was critical of the sentencing judge for failing to give adequate reasons for the views he expressed. This submission encompassed a complaint about the manner in which it was alleged the sentencing judge had dealt with the submissions which had been made by Mr Dalton on behalf of the applicant. Those submissions had been made in written form. A copy of the submissions was provided to this Court during the hearing. 
     
      
    32 In my view there is no substance in any of the grounds argued on behalf of the applicant. I shall deal with each separately. As to the first matter I am perfectly satisfied that there is a simple misprint or mistype in the remarks on sentence which have given rise to this submission. I have set out that paragraph from the remarks on sentence earlier.  
     
      
    33 It is apparent to me however that his Honour intended to convey at p 2 of the remarks in relation to the supply of heroin on 19 October that the undercover operative bought “two” .05 grams of heroin for $80. It is quite clear, as his Honour had identified on p 1, that “a 40” was .05 grams of heroin. Such a parcel cost $40. The reference on p 2 to the purchase of two such parcels for a combined total of $80 indicates that each parcel was approximately .05 of a gram.  
     
      
    34 Moreover, as I have indicated earlier, Mr Dalton had specifically taken his Honour to the quantities at the bottom of p 5 of the statement of facts prepared by the police and had indicated his Honour should accept that these rather than the figures stated on p 6 were the specific supplies for which the applicant should be sentenced.  
     
      
    35 His Honour made it quite clear in the relevant part of the transcript that was what he intended to do. It is quite easy to accept, I think, that when his Honour was reading out his remarks on sentence, the reporter mistakenly took down the number “2” rather than the number of parcels or balloons. Thus it may be seen that his Honour, in fact, had acceded precisely to Mr Dalton’s submissions and in fact treated the applicant favourably in relation to the amounts actually supplied during the period of the undercover operation. 
     
      
    36 Similarly I am not satisfied there is any substance in the second matter argued. In my opinion his Honour correctly identified the level of criminality involved and the role the applicant played in the supply operation. His honour in fact referred to the dictatorial regime imposed by the person Barakat in his remarks on sentence. The police summary, as had been observed in the submissions, referred to the calls made by this person from time to time threatening violence to the runners if they were not efficient in their supply operations. Despite all that, the applicant made it quite clear in the pre-sentence report interviews that  
     
      
       
        
        “he became involved in the supply of the drugs because he had exhausted all his resources and needed to support his own habit”. 
        
       
      
    37 In one of the references his sister-in-law Penny Koklas, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe that he broke the law as a consequence of becoming a drug addict to support his habit”. 
        
       
      
    38 There is, in my opinion, no substance in the suggestion that he was involved in this supply ring because he was the victim of a regime of violent subjugation at the hands of Barakat. It was his own choice to become involved because he needed money to feed his own drug habit. 
     
      
    39 In relation to the third point I accept that it would have been preferable for his Honour to have precisely said that he had made an allowance for the early plea. Equally it would have been preferable if he had quantified it. His Honour however had made specific reference to the plea of guilty before the Local Court at the commencement of his remarks on sentence. This was the first matter he mentioned. 
     
      
    40 Secondly, on that very day, 6 September 2002, shortly before his remarks on sentence were delivered, his Honour had been informed by the Crown representative that the Crown conceded that the offender should benefit by his early plea.  
     
      
    41 Thirdly, it is clear that on 29 August 2002 his Honour had been informed of the early plea and in fact asked the applicant whether he adhered to the pleas made on the earlier occasion. In the particular circumstances I have outlined there can be no doubt whatsoever that his Honour took into account the fact of the early plea and gave consideration to it as part of the sentencing process. His Honour is a very senior experienced criminal judge and it cannot be accepted that he failed to take this matter into account. 
     
      
    42 In the R v Thompson at paras 160 to 162, Spigelman CJ published the well-known guideline applicable to questions of discount for a plea for offences against state laws. There is no need for me to repeat the guideline but it is important to note that at para 113 his Honour had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As Gleeson CJ and Hunt J said in Gallagher it will not always be possible or appropriate to specify a discount for a plea. Whether or not it is possible or appropriate is a matter for the exercise of the discretion of the sentencing judge. This Court should go no further than encouraging judges to do so.” 
        
       
      
    43 Earlier at para 72 the Chief Justice had remarked that: 
     
      
       
        
        “A guideline is not binding in a formal sense. It does not constrain the exercise of the discretion. Accordingly a guideline which indicates that judges should where appropriate quantity a discount for a plea operates by way of encouragement and not by way of prescription.” 
        
       
      
    44 Although it would have been preferable for his Honour to have indicated in this case the level of discount he applied I do not consider that his failure to do so constitutes in the circumstances an error of law nor do I consider that his Honour’s failure to give reasons for the nature of the discount amounted to an error of law. I shall however return to this matter again when looking at the sentence in its overall context. 
     
      
    45 I turn now to the submission made that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the fact that the applicant had served and would in the future be required to serve his time in prison in strict protection. There is no doubt that the sentencing judge made no reference to the question whether the applicant would serve any part of his sentence in protective custody. The starting point in relation to this argument is the recognition that a sentencing court is entitled to take into account the fact that an offender is likely to spend part or perhaps all of the sentence in protective custody. This is because a position may become apparent that while in protective custody the offender will be subject to conditions of custody which are more onerous and more disadvantageous than those to which prisoners in the general population are subject. 
     
      
    46 If those circumstances are shown to exist or shown to be likely to exist, then they are matters relevant to determining the length of the sentence which should be imposed and they may be relevant in determining whether the sentencing judge should find that there are special circumstances so as to warrant a variation of the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence. It should be borne in mind however that where, because of the prospect of protective custody, there is a reduction in the total term it will not necessarily be reflected a second time in the non-parole period unless there is good reason to do so. (See R v S  NSWCCA 13 at 33 and R v P G [2001] NSWCCA 231 at para 34.) 
     
      
    47 The first question to determine in the present matter is what material was in fact before his Honour. Was there for example any evidence from the applicant as to the conditions of custody at the time of sentence? Was there any evidence to suggest what would happen in terms of custody after the imposition of sentence? It seems the answers to those questions are these: that there was no evidence in relation to the conditions of custody, either at the time of sentence or in the future. There was however a reference to the topic, admittedly a brief one, in the report of Mr Simon West, a Probation and Parole officer, whose report was dated 14 August 2002. There was also a submission in writing from Mr Dalton.  
     
      
    48 The section in Mr West’s report, dealing with the possible alternatives of periodic detention, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has been assessed as unsuitable for a periodic detention order as per the requirements of s 66(1) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         for the following reasons. He is presently on protection. One of his co-offenders, Asad Barakat, was recently murdered in Parklea prison. Mr Koklas said he would have fears for his safety in a periodic detention centre because he would not be on protection and would therefore prefer not to be considered for this option.” 
        
       
      
    49 It may be inferred from this material that the applicant was in protection at his own request. The reference in Mr West’s report to the murder of the co-offender does not by any means make it clear that the murder was related to the heroin and cocaine supply scheme. It may have been a random murder as unfortunately occurs from time to time in the violent atmosphere of prison life. 
     
      
    50 Mr Dalton’s submissions included the following matter at the top of p 3 in the paragraph (iv): 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst his prior criminal record reveals he is not of good character and has one prior matter of a like kind, 25 March 1998, his record is not of the worst kind. It is certainly consistent with his history of addiction and reveals that this is his first term of imprisonment. He has been in custody since 15 March 2002 and given real fears for his safety has been in strict protection at all times. Asad Barakat has in fact been killed while in custody. Any further sentence of full-time custody imposed will also have to be served in protection and it is submitted this should be taken into consideration when determining sentence.” 
        
       
      
    51 The Crown has placed before the Court an affidavit sworn 13 October 2003 by one Vicky Brunskill. She is a correctional officer working at Junee Correctional Centre. In that capacity she has access to information relating to the applicant’s custody. She states in her affidavit: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Koklas is currently on a Special Management Area Placement (normal protection) order (SMAP). 
        
       
       
        
        He has been on a SMAP order since 21 march 2002. SMAP orders are reviewed every six months. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Koklas was placed on the current SMAP order on 15 April 2003. This order will expire on 14 October 2003 whereupon the area manager will review the order and make a decision as to whether to revoke or extend the order. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Koklas’ current protection order states that he is a fearful inmate. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Koklas is housed in the general population at Junee Correctional Centre. His incarceration does not differ from that of other inmates housed at Junee Correctional Centre as most of the other inmates are also on SMAP orders. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Koklas has access to employment and educational courses, counselling and any other facility at Junee Correctional Centre. Mr Koklas is currently doing the NETT General Course in Education which is a seventeen week intensive therapeutic course available at Junee Correctional Centre. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Koklas is currently a C2 classification and this is in no way affected by his protection status.” (Paragraph numbers omitted) 
        
       
      
    52 This material appears to have been confirmed by Mr Dalton today who informed the Court the applicant was not here as he was presently involved in a course, presumably the one to which reference was made in Ms Brunskill’s affidavit. I should interpolate that there is a body of material before the Court relevantly tendered for the purposes of re-sentencing, should that become necessary. This, I might say, gives a very encouraging picture of the applicant’s progress in prison and gives hope for a successful return to a normal life after his release. For present purposes however, it is relevant to note that he has recently been recommended for a C3 classification within the Junee Correctional Centre. 
     
      
    53 The Crown submissions in reply on the protection point focus on the fact that his Honour found special circumstances in the present case, citing the need for the applicant to undertake rehabilitation on his release. Secondly, the Crown pointed to the fact that there was no evidence before the sentencing court as to the nature of the custodial conditions that would apply to the applicant once he had been sentenced.  
     
      
    54 Thirdly, the Crown placed reliance upon the affidavit material to which I have made reference. This demonstrates, so it was argued, that it cannot be said that the applicant has experienced or will experience hardship because of his protection status, at least while he remains at Junee. Next the Crown submits that in any event there was no error in the judge’s failure to mention the protection issue in circumstances where he was already intending to give the applicant the benefit of special circumstances. 
     
      
    55 Finally the Crown reminded the Court of the principle stated in R v Simpson [2001] 53 NSWLR 704 that there is an ultimate constraint upon a Court considering special circumstances, namely the fact that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence and must not be reduced below that level. In my opinion the Crown’s submissions are well-founded. Whatever the position may have been in earlier times, it cannot now be assumed, without some evidentiary basis, that protective custody requires an automatic adjustment of the head sentence or the non-parole period. 
     
      
    56 The situation revealed at Junee Correctional Centre, so far as the present applicant is concerned, is a very good example of why this is so. Moreover it is important that the sentencing court have before it a sound basis on which it can understand the reasons for the particular offender requiring protection.  
     
      
    57 It may be the case that protection has been sought out by the offender; or it may be the case protection is necessary because he or she has given assistance to the authorities, has acted as an informer or is proposing to give evidence in the trial of co-offenders. Each of these situations, depending upon the material revealed by the evidence, may call for a different response. The need for an evidentiary basis for an understanding of the situation is plainly important (see R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 at paras 39-43). 
     
      
    58 At para 43 in the judgment of James J with whom Sheller JA and O’Keefe J agreed said the following statement was made: - 
     
      
       
        
        “There are difficulties in a sentencing judge taking into account a circumstance that part or all of the sentence of imprisonment is likely to be served in some form of protective custody. Taking such a circumstance in account involves the sentencing judge in making a prediction about how the offender will be dealt with in the correctional system. The sentencing judge’s prediction may not be fulfilled. Furthermore, as Bell J pointed out in her judgment in  
        Scott 
        , there are within the correctional system not just one form of protective custody with fixed conditions as to custody but a number of different kinds of protective custody, the conditions of which vary considerably in the extent to which they depart from the conditions of custody to which prisoners in the general prison population are subject. Not all forms of protective custody involve the serious disadvantages referred to by Hunt J in  
        Burchell 
        , such as being obliged to serve the sentence under heavy protective guard and in isolation, even from other inmates on protection.” 
        
       
      
    59 The reference to Bell’s decision was to a decision of a two judge bench of this Court in R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 28 at para 34. See also the decision of Howie J in R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253. The latter was a decision of a two judge bench of the Court. Wood CJ at CL concurred with Howie J. Howie J stated at para 19: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the fact that the applicant had placed himself into protective custody was a matter relevant to the question of special circumstances, it was not decisive. It will not always require the sentencing judge to find special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. Much will depend upon the particular circumstances such as the reasons for the prisoner being in protection, the prospect of his remaining in protection throughout the sentence and the actual effect that it has upon the prisoner and his prospects of reform. What weight such a factor will have will also depend upon the objective seriousness of the offence for which the sentence is passed and the extent to which other factors such as general and specific deterrence must be reflected in the non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    60 The question that was at issue in the last mentioned case related to whether or not there should have been a finding of special circumstances. Nevertheless it seems to me that considerations of a similar nature are applicable to the issue as to whether the head sentence should be reduced. 
     
      
    61 In the present case having regard to the seriousness of the offence, the purposes of punishment, the nature of the conditions of custody which are applicable to the applicant and the sentencing judge’s finding of special circumstances, I am satisfied that no error has been shown. 
     
      
    62 That leads me to the next point. May it be said that his Honour’s sentence was in any event manifestly excessive? My reaction to the sentence, uninfluenced by statistics and comparisons with other sentences for similar offences, is that it is a relatively stern sentence, perhaps towards the upper level of the anticipated range. In expressing that view of the sentence I am acting on the assumption, one I consider fully justified, that his Honour gave an appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. I am not satisfied however, that the sentence exceeds that range. 
     
      
    63 There is no doubt the applicant had a number of valuable subjective features in his favour. I have no doubt that they were carefully weighed by his Honour in the sentencing process. The fact remains that the offence to which the applicant pleaded was a serious one and his role in the drug supply operation, although limited to that of a street dealer or runner, as his Honour categorised it, called for a stern punishment which would act as a deterrent to the applicant himself and to others who were minded to participate in the destructive and organised distribution of prohibited drugs. 
     
      
    64 Viewed in this light I do not see the sentence as overly harsh or beyond the limits of a sound sentencing discretion. It needs to be recalled that the undertaking of this illegal drug operation was described by his Honour as one “on a large scale”. It is also the fact that it could not be carried out without willing and compliant street dealers such as the applicant. 
     
      
    65 I am, despite Mr Dalton’s forceful submissions, confirmed in this general view of the sentence by the statistics placed before the Court in this matter. Of course statistics, as the cases selected for analysis in the submissions, before the sentencing judge show, can be sparse and difficult to apply with any degree of utility. Those statistics, in my view, do not detract from the Crown contention that the sentence is within an acceptable range. 
     
      
    66 I do not think it was incumbent upon his Honour the sentencing judge, in the circumstances of this matter, to have gone through the cases selected for comparison and to have given chapter and verse as to the differences between the factual situation in each of those cases and the present matter. Nor do I consider it is incumbent upon this Court to do so. What was required was the selection of a sentence, which fell within the confines of a sound sentencing discretion, having regard to the facts of the matter and the application of proper and appropriate sentencing principles. The statistical material does not persuade me that the sentence imposed was otherwise than within those proper boundaries. 
     
      
    67 I agree also with the Crown submission that the case of R v Hoon and Pouoa [2000] NSWCCA 137, is not a truly comparable reference point for the present sentence. The offenders in that case were seventeen and nineteen years of age respectively. Each had completed the minimum term of her sentence by the time the appeals were heard. There was, at least in the case of Miss Hoon, a situation where she had fully cooperated with the police. 
     
      
    68 Their cases were unsuccessful Crown appeals dismissed on discretionary grounds. I note however that the Court was in fact divided on the issue as to whether the sentences were or were not manifestly inadequate. All these points of difference persuade me that these sentences do not establish any reliable benchmark for the present sentence. 
     
      
    69 Finally I do not consider that there is any substance in the argument based on disparity between the treatment of the offender Albani when it is compared to the sentence imposed on the applicant. Albani was sentenced upon six counts of supply, (s 25(1) of the Crimes Act). He was not charged with or sentenced for the same offence as the applicant. Albani also gave what was described in the written submissions of the applicant here as “considerable assistance and an undertaking to give evidence”.  
     
      
    70 It is plain and beyond argument that the position of the two offenders, namely the applicant and Albani, is quite different for at least these two reasons. A justifiable sense of grievance does not necessarily arise on the part of an applicant simply because his co-offender has appeared to receive more favourable treatment when being sentenced. This is especially so, as is the situation here, where the sentences relate to different offences and necessarily in my opinion therefore to different levels of criminality. 
     
      
    71 It is trite to say that the mere fact that there is disparity between sentences imposed upon an applicant and a co-offender does not of itself enliven the Court’s discretion to interfere with a sentence passed upon the applicant which is otherwise appropriate. It is only where the disparity cannot be explained by reference to a relevant difference in the criminality of the two offenders or their subjective circumstances or the proper application of sentencing principles that an asserted grievance is a justifiable one calling for appellate intervention. (Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 at 618; Postiglione v The Queen (1996) 189 CLR 295 at 301, 303, 313 and 325). 
     
      
    72 In this matter I would propose the following orders, that leave be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    73 STUDDERT J: I agree. 
     
      
    74 BARR J: I also agree. 
     
      
    75 STUDDERT J: The orders of the Court then will be those proposed by Justice Whealy.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 SULLY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the applicant by his Honour Judge Nield in the District Court on 1 February 2002. The applicant had pleaded guilty before a magistrate to a number of offences of dishonesty and was committed for sentence. In the District Court he pleaded guilty to 21 offences and asked the sentencing judge to take into account a further 180 offences on a Form 1 under the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. As a result Judge Nield sentenced the applicant to a total sentence of imprisonment for 7 years 4 months and 2 weeks and specified a non-parole period of 4 years 7 months and 2 weeks. The sentences were to commence on 2 September 2001 and the non-parole period is to expire on 15 April 2006. 
     
      
    4 There is one ground of appeal relied upon being to the effect that this Court should receive as fresh evidence the fact that from 1 February 2002, the date upon which he was sentenced by Judge Nield, the applicant has been required to serve his sentence in protective custody. There is no criticism of the length of the sentences imposed by Judge Nield, the facts as found by his Honour or the method by which the sentences were calculated. 
     
      
    5 In order to determine the ground of appeal relied upon, it is unnecessary to detail the offences for which Judge Nield sentenced the applicant or the way in which the sentences were structured. It is sufficient for present purposes to indicate that as a result of numerous fraudulent acts committed by him over the period from 24 April 1999 to 19 September 2001, the applicant obtained money and other financial advantages totalling $97,170.25. The proceeds of this persistent criminal conduct were spent on living expenses, a holiday, luxury items, cocaine use and gambling. The sentencing judge determined that the applicant “likes to use other people’s money in order to live the way that he wishes to live”. His Honour also came to the conclusion that the applicant, who was 31 years of age when sentenced, was “obviously a conman” and that he may be a pathological liar. The applicant has a criminal record including a large number of entries for matters of dishonesty and, at the time that some of the offences, for which Judge Nield dealt with him, were committed he was on a good behaviour bond or on bail. 
     
      
    6 It should be noted that Judge Hock dealt with the applicant on 15 November 2002 for an offence of sexual intercourse without consent. Her Honour sentenced him to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 16 April 2005, that is a date one year before the expiration of the non-parole period specified by Judge Nield. As a consequence of that sentence the earliest date upon which the applicant can be considered for release to parole is 18 April 2008. 
     
      
    7 Further, the applicant was before the Penrith Local Court on 24 May 2002 when he was sentenced to a number of fixed term sentences of 9 months each. Those sentences were to commence on 24 May 2002 and were fully concurrent with the sentences imposed by Judge Nield. 
     
      
    8 The material upon which the applicant relies is principally an undated letter from the Department of Corrective Services, the relevant part of which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        You client has been verbally informed of the reason he is being held as a non-association inmate whilst held at the Metropolitan Remand & Reception Centre. On 1 February 2002 in Prisoner Application number 382783, your client requested protective custody because he believed he was “….in great danger”. He also requested a change of name whilst in custody. 
         
         
        As a result of his application further inquiries were undertaken by the Intelligence Section. There is substantial evidence to indicate that the inmate is at risk in gaol and steps had to be taken to minimise that risk. Due to this fact, approval was given to place your client on non-association to ensure his safety. This situation will be reviewed at regular intervals whilst your client is in custody, to ensure that the reason for non-association is still pertinent. 
        
       
      
    9 The applicant also relies upon a letter from a psychologist dated 23 May 2002 containing the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I have been seeing inmate Steven Durocher-Yvon (MIN: 204669) on a weekly basis since November 2001. He self-referred. We have been addressing his offending behaviour resulting from a gambling addiction. In February 2002 Mr Durocher-Yvon was placed in protective custody (non-association) because of a threat against his life. Life in gaol is considerably more difficult when in this position. 
        
       
      
    10 It can be gleaned from the material before the Court that the applicant, apparently on the day when he was sentenced by Judge Nield, requested that he be placed in protective custody and since then has been held on protection. There is nothing in the material indicating why it was that the applicant, who had been in custody on remand, chose that day to seek protection or the circumstances in which the gambling debts arose. 
     
      
    11 The submission made on behalf of the applicant is that this Court should receive this material into evidence and, as a result, vary the sentence imposed by Judge Nield in order to reflect the fact that the applicant may be required to serve his sentence on protection thus imposing more onerous conditions upon him than was apparent at the time he was sentenced. 
     
      
    12 In Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 at 378 I said this about sentence appeals based on fresh evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Generally before fresh or new evidence will be received by this Court, it must be shown that the sentencing of the appellant in the absence of that evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. As a general rule, where that evidence was available to the defence at the time of sentencing, a miscarriage of justice would rarely result simply from the fact that the evidence was not before the sentencing judge, even if the evidence may possibly have had an impact upon the sentence passed. 
         
         
        However, fresh evidence has been received by this Court where a miscarriage of justice may have occurred because there has been incompetent legal representation at the hearing before the sentencing court:  
        R v Abbott 
         (1984) 17 A Crim R 355 or where there has been negligence or carelessness in the presentation of the defence:  
        R v McKenna 
         (CCA, 16 October 1992,unreported). It has been held that new evidence may be admitted where the evidence has real significance to the sentencing proceedings, and where the significance of the evidence was unknown to the appellant and the existence of that evidence was not made known to the legal representatives at the time of sentencing:  
        R v Goodwin 
         (1990) 51 A Crim R 328, cf  
        R v De Marco 
         (CCA, 20 November 1995, unreported). There is also a general power in the Court to receive fresh or new evidence where the interests of justice require that course: R v Many (1990) 51 A Crim R 54. 
         
        
       
      
    13 It is submitted on behalf of the applicant that the fact that he might spend his sentence on protection was material that was not available at the time of sentence and, if it had been, it would have had a real significance to the sentencing proceedings. The Court’s attention was drawn to the fact that it is generally regarded as a mitigating factor that an offender would be required to spend the sentence on protection as it has been accepted that this will impose more onerous conditions of confinement upon the offender and interfere with his or her eligibility to available courses, programmes and activities. Reference was made to the decision in R v Patison [2003] NSWCCA 171 as to the deleterious effects of serving a sentence on strict protection. 
     
      
    14 It is remarkable that there is no evidence from the applicant filed in support of the application. It seems that the applicant had some concern about his gambling debts and the consequences for him were he unable to pay them before he appeared for sentence. He raised this matter in an interview with police after his arrest. But why it was that the applicant did not raise this matter with his legal representatives or himself during the course of his evidence before the sentencing judge remains a mystery. Further, the Court has scant evidence as to what have been the conditions of his custody prior to August last. 
     
      
    15 The Crown has objected to the material being received by the Court on the basis that there is nothing to show when it was that the applicant sought to be placed in protection and, therefore, that the material was not available at the time of sentence or that otherwise a miscarriage of justice might have occurred. Further, the Crown submits that, on a consideration of the material it has placed before the Court, the custodial situation for the applicant is not as onerous as the fact that a prisoner has been placed on protection might otherwise suggest. 
     
      
    16 The Crown relies upon a letter from the General Manager of the Junee Correctional Centre, the prison in which the applicant is presently being housed. The significant part of this letter is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Inmate 204669 Roland DUROCHER-YVON is presently a B classification inmate who has been housed at Junee Correctional Centre since 17th August 2003. Inmate DUROCHER-YVON is currently a Special Management Area Placement (S. M. A. P.) inmate, with records indicating that on or about 1st February 2002 he was designated this status as a result of unpaid gambling debts. In accordance with this status, inmate DUROCHER-YVON has unimpeded access to all Educational and Vocational Programs available at Junee Correctional Centre. 
         
         
        Similarly, inmate DUROCHER-YVON is afforded access to Counsellors and other Program related services available at this Centre. Inmate DUROCHER-YVON is also permitted access to authorised recreational areas including the Centre gymnasium, recreation yards and oval. 
         
         
        Inmate DUROCHER-YVON is currently accommodated in Unit B3, which is a designated Special management Area. Following consultation with Staff allocated to this Unit, it has been established that inmate DUROCHER-YVON appears to interact well with other inmates and has raised no concerns or issues in relation to his current placement. Records indicate that inmate DUROCHER-YVON is presently employed on an assembly line in the Industries Area, having gained employment on 11th September 2003. 
         
         
        As can be seen from the aforementioned information, inmate DUROCHER-YVON is not deprived of access to any programs or services as a result of his status as a S. M. A. P. inmate. Similarly his classification is not affected by this status. 
        
       
      
    17 The Crown also relies upon material from the Judicial Commission which reveals that as at 31 July 2000, 93.9 per cent of the inmates at the Junee Correctional Centre were on protection, see Sentencing Trends No 21 February 2001, Protective Hardship and Custody in Prison by Lynne Barnes. That paper makes it clear that there are different types of protection and that facilities differ as between correctional institutions. 
     
      
    18 In my opinion the Court should refuse to intervene to alter the sentence imposed by Judge Nield. This Court does not supervise sentences once they have been imposed and it would be a rare case where it would reduce a sentence because of circumstances arising after the offender commenced to serve the sentence. In particular, the fact that an offender may have to serve a sentence under more onerous conditions than were apparent at the time of sentence will not necessarily require this Court to interfere with a sentence that was otherwise unimpeachable. Although the applicant relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Ingram [2002] NSWCCA 398 there is nothing in that case which offers support to the present application. That was a case in which the Court found error in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. Although the Court would not otherwise have intervened to correct the error, it did so because some other sentence should have been imposed given the evidence then before the Court as to the applicant’s custodial situation. It was simply a case where the Court resentenced the applicant based upon material then before it. 
     
      
    19 Further, the fact that an offender is to serve his sentence on protection will not necessarily result in a shorter head sentence or a finding of special circumstances. In R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253, in a case involving protective custody for a first time offender, with the concurrence of Wood CJ at CL, I stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        19. Although the fact that the applicant had placed himself into protective custody in the gaol was a matter relevant to the question of special circumstances, it was not decisive. It will not always require the sentencing judge to find special circumstances justifying a reduction in the non-parole period. Much will depend upon the particular circumstances such as the reasons for the prisoner being in protection, the prospects of his remaining in protection throughout the sentence and the actual effect that it has upon the prisoner and his prospects of reform. What weight such a factor will have will also depend upon the objective seriousness of the offence for which the sentence is passed and the extent to which other factors such as general and specific deterrence must be reflected in the non-parole period. 
        
       
      
    20 Although the question in that case was concerned with whether there should have been a finding of special circumstances, the same considerations seem to me to apply to the question of whether the head sentence should be reduced. Generally speaking, the fact that an offender is to serve a sentence under more harsh or restrictive conditions is relevant to an assessment of the sentence as a whole rather than the length of the non-parole period; R v MacDonnell [2002] NSWCCA 34. In R v S [2000] NSWCCA 13 sentencing judges were cautioned against applying such a discount twice in reducing both the head sentence and then the non-parole period. Once that matter has been taken into account in determining the length of the sentence to be served, it may have no further role to play in determining whether special circumstances exist unless by itself or in combination with other factors it points to a need to further reduce the minimum term of imprisonment to be served by the particular offender; see for example R v GP [2001] NSWCCA 231.  
     
      
    21 In R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207, a case to which neither party referred during their submissions, this Court was concerned with the relevance of the fact that the offender may be required to serve some or all of a sentence under protection because he had been convicted of a child sexual assault offence. James J, with whom Sheller JA and O’Keefe J agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        43 There are difficulties in a sentencing judge taking into account a circumstance that part or all of a sentence of imprisonment is likely to be served in some form of protective custody. Taking such a circumstance into account involves the sentencing judge in making a prediction about how the offender will be dealt with in the Correctional system. The sentencing judge’s prediction may not be fulfilled. Furthermore, as Bell J pointed out in her judgment in  
        Scott 
         [2003] NSWCCA 28 
        , 
         there are within the Correctional system not just one form of protective custody with fixed conditions of custody but a number of different kinds of protective custody, the conditions of which vary considerably in the extent to which they depart from the conditions of custody to which prisoners in the general prison population are subject. Not all forms of protective custody involve the serious disadvantages referred to by Hunt J in  
        Burchell  
        [(1987) 34 A Crim R 148], such as being obliged to serve the sentence under heavy protective guard and in isolation, even from other inmates on protection. In some forms of custody which are described as protective custody the prisoner is kept in a Correctional Centre or an area of a Correctional Centre in which the other inmates are prisoners who have been sentenced for similar offences and the prisoner is able to mix freely with those other inmates and to have access to programmes conducted by the Department of Correctional Services. I would agree with what Bell J said in par 34 of her judgment in  
        Scott 
         that:- 
         
         
          
          ""It is appropriate for a sentencing court to take into account the circumstance that a sexual offender may spend his custody in conditions subject to some form of ‘protection’ status. Evidence as to the likely conditions of custody is important if the Court is to make an informed assessment of the extent to which the offender’s custody will be more onerous than that of prisoners housed in the general prison population. The concerns of which Hunt J spoke in  
          Burchell 
           would seem to be significantly lessened for sexual offenders who are placed in special facilities such as the MSPC…"". 
          
         
         
        44. Notwithstanding the difficulties in a sentencing judge taking into account, especially without the benefit of evidence, a circumstance that part or all of any sentence of imprisonment imposed is likely to be served in some form of protective custody, I consider that it is a well entrenched principle that it is a circumstance that a sentencing judge should take into account, in favour of the prisoner, both in determining the length of the sentence to be imposed and in determining whether there are special circumstances. That a sentencing judge may not have expressly referred to this circumstance in his or her remarks on sentence should not necessarily give rise to an inference that he or she has failed to take the circumstance into account. What weight the circumstance should be given will depend very much on all the circumstances of the particular case. 
         
        
       
      
    22 In the present case the protective custody is not due to the nature of the offence for which the sentence is being served, or because the applicant gave assistance to the authorities or for some other reason that is related to the sentence imposed by Judge Nield. There will be any number of reasons why a prisoner may choose to seek protection during the course of serving a sentence and it is not a matter that must always result in a reduction of the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate. The fact that in the present case there appears to be an unexplained coincidence between the imposition of the sentence and the seeking of protection by the applicant does not mean that this circumstance should mitigate the sentence imposed upon him. Further, It is not apparent that the applicant will require protection for the whole of his sentence, although I note that Judge Hock took into account his custodial situation when imposing sentence upon him. Finally, the evidence available does not suggest that the current custodial situation of the applicant requires any adjustment of the sentence imposed by Judge Nield. 
     
      
    23 What this application does illustrate is that, although the fact that the offender may be required to serve his sentence in protective custody is a relevant matter in determining the sentence to be imposed, a sentencing court should not automatically grant a reduction of the otherwise appropriate sentence simply because the offender has been, or will be, on protection during the course of the sentence. In some cases such as prison informers or persons giving assistance to the authorities, the court may confidently assume that the offender will spend most, if not all, of the sentence in some form of strict protection which will carry with it severe physical and mental hardships over and above the normal prison experience. In other cases, such as child sex offenders, the court should recognise that to a degree the range of sentences imposed already has an element of leniency built into it because sentences for such offences are normally reduced to take this factor into account. 
     
      
    24 But in other cases, especially where the offender has sought protection, there may have to be closer scrutiny given to just what effect that factor should have on the sentence to be imposed having regard to the seriousness of the offence, the purposes of punishment and the nature of the conditions of custody which the offender may have to bear by reason of his or her protected status. There are undoubtedly other cases like the present where there might be good reason to doubt that a significant discount would be justified. 
     
      
    25 I propose that the application for leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

    FACTSThe appellant had been convicted, after a trial by jury, of one count of being knowingly concerned in the importation of prohibited imports (a commercial quantity of heroin) contrary to s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth), and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years. The appellant appealed against his conviction on several grounds (addressed below) and the Crown appealed against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate.The appellant appealed on the following grounds:1. The expert voice similarity opinion evidence which established that his voice spoke the incriminating words on tape number 6 should not have been admitted (appellant’s grounds numbers 1, 2 and 3 concerning evidence presented by Mr Stephen Chan, Sergeant Tat Lee and Dr John Peter Gibbons respectively);2. His Honour failed to adequately warn the jury as to the dangers inherent in voice similarity evidence (ground number 4);3. Detective Watson’s evidence concerning the identification of the appellant in surveillance materials should not have been admitted (ground number 5);4. His Honour failed to adequately warn the jury of the dangers inherent in the visual identification evidence given by Detective Watson (ground number 6);5. The trial miscarried by reason of cumulative effect of the errors referred to in grounds numbers 1 to 6 (ground number 7); and6. That the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported by evidence.HELD per IPP JA (WHEALY J AND HOWIE J agreeing)1. Mr Stephen Chan’s evidence1.1. Mr Chan’s evidence was correctly admitted by the trial judge. Mr Chan’s evidence was not inadmissible due to being irrelevant for reason that the tapes were available to the jury and the jury could have made the comparisons for themselves, as evidence of ad hoc expertise is admissible: R v Butera (1987) 164 CLR 180; R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405. It was appropriate for the jury to hear identification evidence from a person who understood the words spoken: Simpson J in R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405 at 414.1.2. Mr Chan’s evidence was not inadmissible due to its probative value being outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, nor was Mr Chan’s evidence weak or tainted as alleged by the appellant. Other matters raised by the appellant against admissibility of Mr Chan’s evidence were matters for the jury and/or did not carry any weight under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.1.3. Issue raised by the appellant concerning questions of propriety about voice identification and an analogy between voice identification and physical identification by way of photographs or police line-ups were limited, without effect, distinguishable under s 114(1) of the Evidence Act, and not substantiated: R v Adler (2000) 116 A Crim R 38.2. Sergeant Tat Lee’s evidence2.1. Arguments raised in relation to Sergeant Lee’s evidence which concerned matters of weight were essentially matters for the jury, and none of these points gave rise to any substantial danger of unfair prejudice against the appellant. Further, a risk of bias is no reason not to admit the evidence of an expert: FGT Custodians Pty Ltd v Fagenblat [2003] VSCA 33; Collins Thomson v Clayton [2002] NSWSC 366; and Kirch Communications Pty Ltd v Gee Engineering Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 485.3. Dr John Peter Gibbons3.1 Arguments raised in relation to Dr Gibbon’s evidence that concerned matters of weight were essentially matters for the jury, and none of the points raised gave rise to any substantial danger of unfair prejudice against the appellant nor were they factors that would bear on the exercise of a discretionary use of s 137 of the Evidence Act. 3.2. Cross-lingual comparisons did not in this case give rise to any significant problem that would render the evidence inadmissible due to any lack of probative value.4. Failure to warn the jury as to dangers inherent in voice similarity evidence4.1. Shadbolt DCJ gave strong warnings to the jury in relation to the voice identification evidence which were more than adequate.5. Visual identification evidence of Detective Jonathan Tony Watson5.1. Detective Watson’s evidence went to an issue about the presence or absence of some identifying feature other than one apparent from observing the accused on trial and was therefore admissible: Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650. 5.2. No relevant prejudice to the appellant arose from Detective Watson’s disclosure to the Court that he had undertaken surveillance of the rooms occupied by the appellant, as not only had similar evidence already been led, but such evidence is not inadmissible on discretionary grounds. 5.3. Detective Watson’s evidence was not inadmissible under s 137 of the Evidence Act, and other allegations against its admissibility by the appellant were either without substance, weight, relevance or were matters for the jury.6. Failure to warn the jury of the dangers inherent in the visual identification evidence presented by Detective Watson6.1. Shadbolt DCJ warned the jury as required under s 165(2) of the Evidence Act on more than one occasion.7. Miscarriage of justice7.1. Having rejected each ground of appeal, the other two grounds asserting a miscarriage of justice necessarily fail, and no other errors or defects in the trial proceedings were found. 8. The Crown Appeal against sentence8.1. The Crown contended that there was a lack of contrition on the part of the appellant. The Crown also contended that the trial judge’s ‘starting point’ in regard to the possible head sentence of 24 years was erroneous and should have been 30 years, and that R v Chan [2002] was analogous with respect to the similar weight of heroin involved. 9. Held by Ipp JA (Whealy J and Howie J agreeing)9.1. The starting point for sentencing should not have been less than 30 years in view of the degree of criminality involved in the appellant directing the criminal enterprise.  9.2. Due to the selective and limited nature of assistance given by the appellant to the authorities that a discount of 25% in sentencing was over-generous. ORDERS1. Appeal against conviction dismissed.2. Crown appeal against sentence upheld.3. Set aside sentences imposed by Shadbolt DCJ and in lieu thereof impose a head sentence of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years 3 months. Based on commencement date of 25 August 2001 (as determined by Shadbolt DCJ) the head sentence will expire on 24 August 2016 and the non-parole period on 24 November 2012.IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 IPP JA:  
     
      
       
      The conviction and sentence 
       
      
    2 Alan Siu Lun Li (the appellant) was convicted, after a trial by jury, of one count of being knowingly concerned with the importation into Australia of not less than the commercial quantity of heroin.  
     
      
    3 The trial judge, Shadbolt DCJ, sentenced the appellant to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years. The sentences were ordered to commence on 25 August 2001. Accordingly, the head sentence expires on 24 August 2013 and the non-parole period on 24 August 2010.  
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals against his conviction on several grounds detailed below. The Crown appeals against the sentence on the ground that it was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The circumstances of the offence 
       
      
    5 Early in 1998, police in Thailand discovered that a concealed shipment of heroin had been lodged for transport to Australia at the offices of D H L Freight Forwarders in Bangkok. The shipment involved 3,995.9 grams of gross heroin, the pure amount being 2,495.6 grams. The value of the heroin on a wholesale basis was between $410,000 and $470,000. 
     
      
    6 The heroin was made up of a number of blocks, embossed with the figures 999. The heroin blocks were hidden in hollowed out computer books. The computer books had been delivered to the Bangkok offices of D H L Freight Forwarders for shipment to Australia.  
     
      
    7 The Australian Federal Police were alerted to the proposed shipment and, with the co-operation of the Thai police, the heroin was permitted to be conveyed to Sydney. In Sydney, the police removed the heroin from the computer books and substituted it with another substance made up to look identical to the original blocks of heroin. The substitute blocks, too, had the figures 999 embossed upon them. 
     
      
    8 The addressee of the heroin was one Mr Lee of 86 Liverpool Road, Summer Hill. One Mr Tack Lee Pang received the heroin. Pang subsequently gave evidence against the appellant. Pang explained that the heroin had been consigned to Sydney pursuant to a scheme involving a number of people. Pang, himself, had been offered the task of courier when in Kuala Lumpur. He was given flight tickets and instructions together with the necessary visa. He left for Sydney on 31 March 1998 to await delivery of the heroin. 
     
      
    9 In Sydney Pang met one John Kook, who took him to the Summer Hill address. Pang moved to another hotel and then he was ordered by a note to move to the Travelodge at Camperdown. There, an advance booking had been made for him. From time to time Pang was given money that he gambled away whilst he waited to play his part. 
     
      
    10 Kook was Pang’s controller. He met with Pang and directed Pang’s movements and gave him instructions in regard to the receipt of the heroin at Summer Hill. He took delivery of the heroin from Pang. Another person said by the Crown to be involved was one Mei. A charge against Mei in relation to the heroin transaction did not proceed as it was no-billed by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The Crown contended that the appellant gave instructions to Kook and Mei and controlled the enterprise.  
     
      
    11 A neighbour at the Summer Hill premises informed Pang that he had seen plainclothes policemen in the vicinity. This disturbed Pang who telephoned Simon, the man who had given him the job in Kuala Lumpur. Simon reassured Pang and told him to get on with the job. 
     
      
    12 The parcel of computer books containing the substituted heroin eventually arrived in Sydney and Pang handed it over to Kook. He had been instructed to do so. Pang then left for the airport where he was arrested. 
     
      
    13 While employed in the enterprise, Pang was given over $5,000. Of this sum, $1,900 was for someone else. Thus, Pang received about $3,000 for himself.  
     
      
    14 At about the time that Pang was arrested, Kook was arrested at Mitchell Road, Alexandria. There the computer books were found. They were empty. The substituted heroin had been removed.  
     
      
    15 Throughout the period that Pang was in Sydney attempting to fulfil his duties as courier, the Australian Federal Police carried out various forms of surveillance. This involved visual observations, telephone intercepts and video surveillance of various persons, including Pang and the appellant. 
     
      
    16 The Crown contended that the appellant had played an important and supervisory role in the criminal enterprise. The Crown case in this regard was based substantially on the surveillance evidence. Important aspects of this evidence depended on the reliability of voice identification by witnesses called by the Crown and visual identification by a police witness, Detective Watson.  
     
      
    17 Video and audio tapes produced in consequence of the surveillance undertaken constituted powerful evidence tending to establish the appellant’s guilt.  
     
      
    18 Words spoken by a speaker recorded on one particular tape, referred to at the trial as tape 6, indicated that the speaker knew that the heroin blocks had been substituted and was seeking to have the substituted blocks buried somewhere. The speaker indicated that he did not know who had substituted the material but he was not then prepared to blame the police. He commented on the numbers 999 embossed on each block and expressed the view that it was unlikely that the police would go to the trouble of reproducing such detail. Expert witnesses identified the speaker as the appellant.  
     
      
    19 Detective Watson identified the appellant as the person who delivered the envelope to Pang’s room. That evidence was significant, particularly when coupled with what was said to be the appellant’s voice on tape 6 indicating shortly thereafter that money had been delivered to Pang.  
     
      
    20 Apart from the evidence that depended on the voice and visual identification, there was other evidence, not in dispute, that linked the appellant to the offence and to the managerial role he played. 
     
      
    21 It was common ground that two video tapes tendered in evidence depicted the appellant in his hotel room on 21 April 1998 (video tape 5) and on 26 April 1998 (video tape 12). These video tapes included audio recordings of the appellant’s voice as he spoke on the telephone during the time that his movements were being photographed. Video tape 12 recorded the appellant saying on 26 April 1998: 
     
      
       
        
        “How much money have we paid in total? … Have paid 3,000 odd dollars? It’s got to be more than that”. 
        
       
       
      It was open to the jury to find that the appellant was, in this conversation, referring to the money paid to Pang. 
       
      
    22 Video tape 12 also recorded a statement by the appellant that: 
     
      
       
        
        “A few days ago, when I went back then, it … failed as well, don’t know what’s going on, it’s so … troublesome … don’t if it had been … changed by somebody. Don’t know now, everyone checks, everyone is checking now. …. Don’t talk about it on the phone”. 
        
       
       
      It was open to the jury to find that, in making this statement, the appellant was discussing whether or not the heroin had been substituted. 
       
      
    23 In sentencing the appellant, Shadbolt DCJ remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “By the inter-relationship of voice, video and proven occurrences, the Crown case became a very strong one”. 
        
       
      
    24 The appellant did not give evidence. His defence was based to a significant extent on challenges to the expert evidence concerning the voice identification and the visual identification by Detective Watson.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s grounds of appeal 
       
      
    25 On appeal, the appellant did not dispute that audio tape 6 (were it to be proved that he spoke the words recorded thereon) was powerful proof of his guilt. He submitted, however, that the expert evidence establishing that his voice spoke the incriminating words on tape 6 should not have been admitted. This contention is the subject of grounds 1, 2 and 3. 
     
      
    26 Ground 4 is to the effect that his Honour failed to adequately warn the jury as to the dangers inherent in “voice similarity evidence”. 
     
      
    27 Detective Watson testified that he had conducted a surveillance exercise in respect of the appellant between March 1998 and May 1998. During that period Detective Watson had observed the manner in which the appellant moved and held himself while walking. Detective Watson testified that he had watched a video tape of events on 9 April 1998 outside a room in a hotel occupied by Pang. The film showed a man walking down a hallway and placing something under the doorway of Pang’s room. Detective Watson identified the appellant because of the way he swung his left arm, the way he held his head to the right when he walked, his distinctive hairline, and his general appearance and manner of walking. The appellant submitted that this evidence should not have been admitted and this contention is, in effect, ground of appeal no. 5. 
     
      
    28 Ground of appeal no 6 is that his Honour failed adequately to warn the jury of the dangers inherent in the visual identification given by Detective Watson. 
     
      
    29 Two other grounds were argued by the appellant, namely, that the trial miscarried by reason of the cumulative effect of the errors referred to in the proceeding grounds and because the verdict was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. 
     
      
       
      The admissibility of the voice similarity evidence of Stephen Chan 
       
      
    30 The Crown led the evidence of three voice identification experts. They were Mr Stephen Chan, Sergeant Tat Lee and Dr John Peter Gibbons. The appellant asserted that none of their evidence should have been admitted. As mentioned, this contention was the subject of grounds of appeal 1, 2and 3. I shall deal first with Mr Chan’s testimony. 
     
      
    31 Mr Chan was an experienced interpreter and translator. He was accredited at the highest level with the National Accreditation Authority of Translators and Interpreters in interpreting and translating the Cantonese and Mandarin languages into English and also English into those two languages. Cantonese was his native language and he had worked as a translator and interpreter in Cantonese and Mandarin since 1984.  
     
      
    32 In July 1998 Mr Chan was given five audio tapes, including audio tape 6, which he transcribed. The language spoken on the tapes was principally Cantonese. Mr Chan listened to these tapes, working on them and analysing them, for many hours over many days. There was more than one voice on the five tapes and, amongst other things, Mr Chan performed the task of distinguishing one particular voice from other voices on the tapes. He referred to the speaker with that particular voice as “M1”. According to Mr Chan, the voice of M1 was recorded on each of the five tapes.  
     
      
    33 In the course of working on the five tapes, Mr Chan translated what was recorded on them from Cantonese into English. 
     
      
    34 On 16 July 1999 Mr Chan listened to an audio recording comprising part of a video tape of the police record of interview with the appellant. There was no dispute that the appellant was the speaker on this tape (which became Exhibit AH at the trial). 
     
      
    35 Mr Chan identified the speaker on Exhibit AH (namely, the appellant) as being the speaker he identified as M1 on the five tapes he had examined a year before in July 1998. 
     
      
    36 Prior to making the comparison in July 1999, he listened again to the five tapes. He could not remember whether he listened to them again only once or more than once, but conceded that it might have only been once. 
     
      
    37 Mr Chan’s evidence was admitted pursuant to s 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a person has specialised knowledge on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge”. 
        
       
      
    38 The “opinion rule” referred to in s 79 is that contained in s 76. By the opinion rule, subject to stipulated exceptions, opinion evidence is generally declared inadmissible.  
     
      
    39 The Crown contended that Mr Chan had acquired sufficient knowledge of the voice of M1 to be classified an ad hoc expert in that respect. This concept was recognised in R v Butera (1987) 164 CLR 180 where Dawson J (at 195) said that where words in a tape recording are inaudible or unintelligible (or by implication not spoken in the English language), “expert evidence of its contents may be required and it has been held that an ad hoc expertise may be acquired by a witness by playing and replaying a tape so as to become more familiar with its contents than could be done by playing it only once or twice”. 
     
      
    40 In R v Leung (1999) 47 NSWLR 405 Simpson J (with whom Spigelman CJ and Sperling J agreed on this issue) said at 412 to 413: 
     
      
       
        
        “The notion of an ‘ad hoc expert’ appears to have originated in  
        R v 
          
        Menzies  
        [[1982] 1 NZLR 40]. The ad hoc expertise in that case was the capacity to decipher tape-recordings that were substantially unintelligible to anybody who had not played them repeatedly. A transcript of tape-recordings made by a police officer who had, by listening to the tapes many times, acquired such expertise, was held to have been properly put before the jury. The following passage appears in the joint judgment of Cooke J, McMullin J, Somers J and Sir Clifford Richmond (at 49): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘If the tape is reasonably short and clearly audible there can normally be no justification for allowing a transcript as well as playing the tape. But there will be cases in which the aid of an expert is reasonably necessary. For example, there may be the use of a foreign language. Or deficiencies in the recording may make it necessary to play tapes more than once to enable a better understanding, yet the sheer length of the tapes may mean that inordinate time would be taken by replaying them to the jury. In such cases, while there should normally be at least one playing to the jury, the evidence of an expert should be admissible as an aid to the jury 
          . He may be a temporary expert in the sense that by repeated listening to the tapes he has qualified himself ad hoc 
          . And we see no compelling reason why his evidence should not take the form of production of a transcript which can be admitted as an exhibit. Whether the judge allows the jury to have copies of the transcript, as distinct from merely hearing it read, must be a matter for his discretion in the particular case, bearing in mind the requirements of justice and any risk of unfairness to the accused. (Emphasis added.)’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The idea of the ad hoc expert was endorsed by the High Court in  
        Butera 
        . Again, tape-recordings were involved. This time the conversations recorded were mainly in the Punjabi language, with some Thai, Malay and English. Parts of the recordings were indistinct and could only be made out after being listened to repeatedly by a person familiar with the languages. Transcripts of the translation made after that exercise had been undertaken were held to have been rightly admitted. In the course of so deciding Mason CJ, Brennan J and Deane J quoted the passage from  
        Menzies 
         extracted above, and accepted the concept of the ad hoc expert”. 
        
       
       
      Simpson J was of the opinion that s 79 accommodated the idea of an ad hoc expert. 
       
      
    41 Mr Nicholson QC, who appeared with Mr Stanton for the appellant, submitted that the evidence of Mr Chan (and also Sergeant Lee and Dr Gibbons) was irrelevant as the tapes were available to the jury and the jury could have made the necessary comparisons for themselves. He submitted that Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650 supported this submission. 
     
      
    42 Butera and Leung, however, demonstrate that evidence of ad hoc expertise is admissible. The very many hours that Mr Chan spent listening to and working on the five tapes with a view to identifying the words spoken by M1 qualified him as an ad hoc expert in the characteristics of M1’s voice.  
     
      
    43 In any event, as the words on the five tapes were spoken in Cantonese, it was appropriate for the jury to hear identification evidence from a person who understood the words spoken. As Simpson J observed in R v Leung at 414: 
     
      
       
        
        “Voice comparison is not necessarily a question for expert evidence, although it may be. If the two sets of tape-recordings in the present case had been in English, it would have been open to the Crown to have left it to the jury to make their own comparison and assessment of whether the voices on the DAT tapes (or any of them) corresponded to either of the voices on the police tapes. That course theoretically remained open but would have left the jury with a task immeasurably more difficult, given the reasonable assumption that no member of the jury understood either of the Chinese languages involved. The jury would, truly, have been comparing voices only, without the intrusion of language and speech patterns that are part of voice identification”. 
        
       
      
    44 In my opinion, Mr Chan was qualified to say whether, in his opinion, the voice of the appellant, as heard in the record of interview tape, was the same voice as the voice Mr Chan had identified as M1 on the five tapes. His evidence (and that of Sergeant Lee and Dr Gibbons) was not irrelevant. 
     
      
    45 In submitting that the evidence of Mr Chan should not have been admitted, Mr Nicholson submitted that Mr Chan’s evidence “had the following weaknesses”: 
     
      
       
        
        “[a] When performing his task of comparing the tapes, he did not think of the possibility that what was recorded on the tape was a compilation of different passages of speech from different locations. He conceded the probability of him being mistaken as to the context surrounding his interpretation (T.474). 
        
       
       
        
        [b] He was not a voice recognition expert (T.475). 
        
       
       
        
        [c] A year may have elapsed between the time when he was engaged in interpreting the tapes and the time when he was asked to give his opinion on the similarity issue. 
        
       
       
        
        [d] When he listened to those tapes again one year later, he may have listened to them only once (T.477). 
        
       
       
        
        [e] The opinion he gave was an ‘ordinary man’s opinion’ as to the sameness of the voices on the tapes (T.477) 
        
       
       
        
        [f] He would not say there were any special features of the voice on the record of interview tape which would enable him with certainty to say the voice was different from those of other confident male Cantonese speakers with deep tonal voices (T.477). 
        
       
       
        
        [g] He agreed that when seeking to understand the language in a conversation it is highly desirable to have both sides of the conversation, instead of one side only as in a telephone conversation. He further agreed that because of the nature of the language, Cantonese, there are some ambiguities which can exist without both sides of the conversation being heard (T.479). 
        
       
       
        
        [h] He also agreed that it will sometimes be almost impossible to ascertain meaning without both sides of the conversation (T.480). 
        
       
       
        
        [i] The witness further agreed that people speaking on a telephone have a different type of speech from people speaking face to face (T.480). 
        
       
       
        
        [j] He possessed no training, knowledge or experience in comparing voices speaking in English and those speaking in Cantonese (T.485).: 
        
       
      
    46 Mr Nicholson submitted that, on these grounds, Shadbolt DCJ should have refused to admit the evidence because “its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant” (to use the words of s 137 of the Evidence Act). 
     
      
    47 As regards the submission in paragraph [a] above, Mr Chan did not concede the probability of him being mistaken as to the context surrounding his interpretation. He said that there was a “possibility” of him being mistaken. In any event, in my view, the “context” in which the voices were spoken, while being of significance to the interpretation of words for translation purposes, is, I would think, far less relevant than the identification of the voices speaking the words concerned. 
     
      
    48 As regards paragraph [b] above, Mr Chan did not have to be a voice recognition expert to become an ad hoc expert within the meaning of R v Leung. In any event, his years of practising as an interpreter and translator would have been of great assistance to him as it meant he had considerable familiarity with the language spoken and with voices speaking Cantonese and English. 
     
      
    49 As regards paragraph [c], the relevance of the lapse of the year was a matter for the jury, and had little bearing on a discretionary exercise under s 137 of the Evidence Act. In any event, Mr Chan refreshed his memory immediately before the final identification exercise, by listening to the five tapes again. 
     
      
    50 Paragraph [d] has no merit in the present context. It raises a matter for the jury, it is not a matter that would have any relevant weight under s 137.  
     
      
    51 As regards paragraph [e], the fact that Mr Chan gave an “ordinary man’s opinion” said nothing about whether he was duly qualified as an ad hoc expert as explained in R v Leung. 
     
      
    52 Paragraph [f] is essentially a jury matter, it is not a matter that would have any relevant weight under s 137. 
     
      
    53 Paragraph [g] is also essentially a jury matter and not one that would have any relevant weight under s 137. In any event, ambiguities in the language are irrelevant to an identification of the voice. 
     
      
    54 As regards paragraph [h], the ascertaining of meaning in the sense referred to was of minor significance in the voice identification exercise. Again, this was essentially a jury issue. 
     
      
    55 I do not understand what relevance paragraph [i] has with regard to the issue of Mr Chan’s ability to identify the voices to which he listened. 
     
      
    56 As regards paragraph [j], Mr Chan acquired expertise in the voice of M1 by listening, over and over again, to the five tapes. It was not suggested to him that he could not apply that expertise in identifying the voice on the video tape which was speaking in English. In any event, I see no reason why the cross-lingual element in the comparison that Mr Chan was required to undertake detracted significantly from his ability to express a reliable opinion. Once more, this is, essentially, a jury matter. 
     
      
    57 In oral argument, Mr Nicholson submitted that Mr Chan could not acquire the relevant expertise because he had only undertaken a single act of comparison, namely, that between the voices he identified as M1 on the five tapes and the voice on the video tape. In my view this submission must be rejected. Once Mr Chan acquired the necessary expertise in being able to identify the voice of M1 he was able, as an ad hoc expert, to use that expertise in determining that the voice on the video tape was also that of M1. 
     
      
    58 Mr Nicholson also submitted, orally, that the evidence of Mr Chan was “tainted” as he must have known that the appellant was a suspect when he compared the appellant’s voice on the record of interview with the voice of M1 on the five tapes.  
     
      
    59 In making this submission, Mr Nicholson relied on certain remarks made by Simpson J in R v Leung. Simpson J in that case drew attention to an aspect of voice identification evidence that she said might raise “real questions of propriety”. Her Honour pointed out that a situation may arise in voice identification that is analogous to physical identification by photographs or by a police line up, “in which care must be taken not to suggest that a particular person is the suspect”. 
     
      
    60 While I accept, with respect, that the analogy is capable in certain circumstances of being apt, it has, I think, limitations. It is one thing to produce persons not fundamentally dissimilar from a suspect in a photograph book or a line up. It is another, to produce voices not dissimilar to the voice to be identified. In the present case, for example, the police had five tapes where the identity of the voices was in dispute. Mr Chan had spent considerable time on the five tapes first distinguishing and then identifying, by the use of pseudonyms, the speakers of the words recorded therein. He had to use pseudonyms as the identity of the persons concerned was then unknown. Later, the police obtained a recording of the appellant’s voice. They wished to determine whether the appellant’s voice was one of the voices recorded in the five tapes. In this situation, I do not see how a means of identification akin to a line up could have been contrived. 
     
      
    61 It is further to be noted that voice identification evidence is to be distinguished from “visual identification evidence” within the meaning of s 114(1) of the Evidence Act. That is because voice identification evidence is not “based wholly or partly on what a person saw”, the quoted words being an element of “visual identification evidence” as defined. As is noted by Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law, 5th Ed at para 1.3.9660, the admission of voice identification evidence turns on judicial discretion. See also R v Adler (2000) 116 A Crim R 38.  
     
      
    62 As Shadbolt DCJ noted in giving judgment in the voir dire relating to the admissibility of the voice identification evidence of Mr Chan and Mr Lee: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question then is not one which lies within ss 114 to 116 of the Evidence Act 1995 but rather within those sections dealing with opinion evidence, namely ss 76 to 80 which necessarily carry with [them] consideration[s] of discretion under ss 135, 137 and 165 and perhaps 192”. 
        
       
      
    63 In my view, Shadbolt DCJ committed no error in admitting the evidence of Mr Chan. 
     
      
       
      Sergeant Tat Lee 
       
      
    64 Sergeant Tat Lee was an officer in the New South Wales Police Service. His mother language was Cantonese. Sergeant Lee was educated in Hong Kong to secondary and tertiary level in the medium of both Cantonese and English. He came to Australia in 1991. He had passed an examination in translating from Cantonese to English and from English to Cantonese. He was plainly familiar with both languages. He was also familiar with Mandarin. 
     
      
    65 On 26 April 1998 Sergeant Lee had been present at a listening post where audio surveillance of the appellant’s hotel room was being undertaken. He transcribed and translated a tape recording, known as tape 11, of what was being spoken in the room at the time in question. In November 1998 he listened to the voice recordings on two master video tapes, tapes 5 and 12. He also listened to the voice recordings on master tape 53. Tape 5 was in Mandarin and the other two tapes were in Cantonese. 
     
      
    66 It was not in dispute that the voice on master video tape 5 and on master video tape 12 was the voice of the appellant. This was quite apparent from the two video tapes themselves and the jury were able to identify the appellant from them. There was a dispute about the voice on master tape 53.  
     
      
    67 A portion of master tape 53 formed part of audio tape 6. Tape 6 had been translated and transcribed by Mr Chan. Mr Chan had identified certain words on tape 6 as having been spoken by M1. Tape 6 was the critical tape on which the Crown relied in its case against the appellant. 
     
      
    68 By his opinion that the voice on master video tapes 5 and 12 was the same as the voice on master tape 53, Sergeant Lee’s evidence established that the voice on master tape 53 was that of the appellant.  
     
      
    69 As tape 6 was part of master tape 53, once it was proved that the voice on master tape 53 was that of the appellant, it followed that the voice on tape 6 was that of the appellant. 
     
      
    70 Mr Nicholson submitted that the following weaknesses existed in relation to the opinion evidence of Sergeant Lee. 
     
      
       
        
        “[a] The passage of speech was quite short in the first tape recording Mandarin speech. 
        
       
       
        
        [b] The next segment, recorded in Cantonese on a different day, was a very short passage of low key speech. 
        
       
       
        
        [c] There was a risk of unconscious bias, by reason of him being a member of the NSW Police Service. 
        
       
       
        
        [d] The witness had no special training in voice identification in Mandarin, Cantonese, or English. 
        
       
       
        
        [e] The passages of speech used were quite short 
        
       
       
        
        [f] He did as he was asked, that is, provide an opinion as to whether the recordings were of the same speaker. 
        
       
       
        
        [g]) He had no skill above those of an ordinary human being in forming his opinion. 
        
       
       
        
        [h] He conceded another ordinary human being might be of a different opinion (T 530).” 
        
       
      
    71 In my opinion all of the arguments raised in relation to Sergeant Lee concerned matters of weight and were essentially matters for the jury. Most of the points made are repetitive of those concerning Mr Chan, and it is not necessary to discuss them again. I would add that the shortness of the passages examined by Sergeant Lee are plainly matters of weight and would not give rise to any unfairness. The risk of bias (unconscious or otherwise) is no reason not to admit evidence of an expert: FGT Custodians Pty Ltd v Fagenblat [2003] VSCA 33 (Ormiston JA, Chernov and Eames JJA concurring); Collins Thomson v Clayton [2002] NSWSC 366 per Austin J, and Kirch Communications Pty Ltd v Gee Engineering Pty Ltd [2002] NSWSC 485 per Campbell J. See also paper delivered by Heydon J entitled ‘Comments on May LJ’s Paper’ at Supreme Court Conference, 22 August 2003. 
     
      
    72 In my view, none of the points raised regarding Sergeant Lee gave rise to a substantial danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. I would dismiss the appellant’s argument in relation to Sergeant Lee. 
     
      
       
      Dr John Peter Gibbons 
       
      
    73 Dr Gibbons had been for three years an ordinary lecturer and for 16 years a senior lecturer in linguistics at Sydney University. He was familiar with Cantonese, having lived in Hong Kong for nearly seven years. He was not familiar with the Mandarin language.  
     
      
    74 Dr Gibbons listened to the voice of the appellant in the taped police record of interview and used this as a base or comparison tape. Dr Gibbons noted that the appellant had a “very distinctive” voice with an exceptionally low pitch that was considerably below normal. The appellant also had another pronunciation feature that Dr Gibbons said was called “eshing” (that is where an “s” is pronounced as “sh”). 
     
      
    75 Dr Gibbons listened to five tapes including tape no. 6 and compared the voice on these tapes, attributed by Mr Chan to M1, with that of the appellant. In one of the tapes, tape 3, there was a lot of background noise and the tape was very short. Dr Gibbons said that in regard to this tape he would “have to tread carefully” but he thought that the speaker was the same as that on the base tape. Importantly, as regards tape 6, he said that M1 had the distinct characteristics of the appellant’s voice, namely the low pitch and the eshing. He also said he heard the “general voice properties” that he associated with the voice on the base tape. He expressed the opinion that the voice attributed by Mr Chan to M1 was the voice of the appellant.  
     
      
    76 There was no dispute that the appellant was the relevant speaker on four of the tapes, not including tape 6, to which Dr Gibbons listened. It is therefore not in dispute that Dr Gibbons identified the appellant’s voice correctly in regard to those four tapes. The material significance of Dr Gibbons’ evidence was that he identified the appellant as M1 on tape 6.  
     
      
    77 Mr Nicholson submitted that the weaknesses associated with Dr Gibbons’ evidence included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “[a] Whilst maintaining there was a difference between a trained ear and an untrained ear, he conceded he might be wrong and an untrained ear might be right (T.549). 
        
       
       
        
        [b] He was unable to provide statistics in support of his contention that ‘eshing’ was not a common feature of male Cantonese speakers (T.552). 
        
       
       
        
        [c] He could not comment on the proposition that ‘eshing’ is a most common feature amongst the male Cantonese speaking population of Sydney (T.552). 
        
       
       
        
        [d] In relation to cross lingual comparisons, he was not an expert in either Cantonese or Mandarin (T.570). 
        
       
       
        
        [e] He agreed Mandarin and Cantonese were tonal languages and that English was not (T.570). 
        
       
       
        
        [f] He agreed that the pitch of a voice may vary with context – for example, when a person is screaming (T.570). 
        
       
       
        
        [g] He had not had his ears tested recently (T.573). 
        
       
       
        
        [h] He conceded that cross-lingual comparison was something that would have to be taken very seriously (T.612).” 
        
       
      
    78 Again, in my view, all the matters raised on behalf of the appellant were matters that went to weight. They were essentially jury questions. In my view, none of them gave rise to a danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    79 Mr Nicholson submitted that there were problems with cross-lingual comparison and these caused the evidence to lack probative value. I have already explained that I do not regard the cross-lingual comparison as giving rise to any significant problem. 
     
      
    80 Mr Nicholson submitted that Dr Gibbons’ evidence was statistically confused.  
     
      
    81 Dr Gibbons acknowledged that he did not have statistics for figures on the percentages of eshing. He said that his evidence was based on his experience with mixing extensively with Cantonese speaking persons while in Hong Kong. It was a matter for the jury whether the absence of statistics was a material matter. I do not think it is a factor that would bear on the exercise of a discretion under s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    82 Mr Nicholson submitted that Dr Gibbons’ evidence was not based on scientific methodology and it involved an assertion by him, incapable of being tested.  
     
      
    83 Dr Gibbons said that he brought objective skills to bear on the identification of inherent voice characteristics. He regarded himself as an “auditory expert”. He said that his views depended on the human ear and human judgment. He said that he was able to recognise pitch, tone, voice modulation and voice characteristics. This was his basic field of expertise.  
     
      
    84 I do not think it fair to say that Dr Gibbons’ evidence was based solely on assertion. He did explain his opinions by reference to pitch and eshing at least and explained the features on which he focused when drawing conclusions as to similarities and differences in voices.  
     
      
    85 Although Dr Gibbons did not appear to apply scientific methodology in the sense of using machines or measuring (or other) equipment, and although he relied only on his experience, knowledge and hearing, that did not detract from the inherent expert quality of his evidence and I consider that his evidence was properly admitted as being expert in nature.  
     
      
    86 Mr Nicholson submitted that Dr Gibbons did not have adequate expertise in Cantonese or in Mandarin. 
     
      
    87 In the light of Dr Gibbons’ experience and the methods of comparison he uses, his lack of knowledge of Cantonese and Mandarin did not prevent him from expressing opinions based on the sounds he heard. His expertise was identifying and recognising particular aspects of voice and this was based on experience over many years. 
     
      
    88 Mr Nicholson submitted that Dr Gibbons’ testimony was unreliable as tapes given to him at one particular time had noises on them that had not been on those tapes at an earlier time and Dr Gibbons, according to Mr Nicholson, agreed that he could not exclude the possibility of the tapes having been electronically tampered with.89 Dr Gibbons examined master tape 53 on at least two occasions. When he first listened to it he found no distortion in it. He then listened to a copy of the tape and found no distortion in it. At a later date he detected distortion in a copy of the audio tape. A tape with distortion in it was played in court. Mr Nicholson submitted that this difference in the quality of the tapes indicated that the tapes may have been tampered with. 
     
      
    90 Mr Alvin Castle Lawson, a witness called by the appellant, accepted that an explanation for the distortion was that the tape in question had been copied by a person using an inappropriate recording system.  
     
      
    91 Dr Gibbons referred to a difference in voice quality in the tapes but could not give any reliable explanation as to the source of the difference. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may have been tampered with but it may also just have been the higher quality playback equipment”. 
        
       
      
    92 The problems with the distortion were not regarded as sinister at the trial. As I have said the appellant’s own witness accepted that the distortion was caused by incompetence rather than anything deliberate. Dr Gibbons’ reference to tampering was speculative and a throw-away line.  
     
      
    93 In my view, there is nothing in the point relating to any sinister manipulation of the tapes. 
     
      
    94 I would not uphold the appellant’s submissions in regard to Dr Gibbons.  
     
      
       
      Failure to warn the jury as to the dangers inherent in voice similarity evidence 
       
      
    95 Shadbolt DCJ gave strong warnings to the jury in relation to the voice identification evidence. 
     
      
    96 His Honour told the jury that they should treat expert evidence exactly as they treat any other evidence and should subject it to exactly the same scrutiny. 
     
      
    97 His Honour said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Voice similarity, or saying one voice is similar or the same as another is notoriously open to mistake”. 
        
       
       
      He gave examples of such mistakes. He said that it was “terribly difficult to describe a voice”. He said that “some voices are particularly distinctive and some are not”. He said that human beings were not infallible. 
       
      
    98 His Honour gave a particular warning in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “When you are considering the voice similarity opinion evidence in this case, you should look to see the qualities, distinctive or otherwise, that have been described by the experts. The length of time that the expert had to hear the voice, that is the amount of time and familiarity he had with the unknown voice, the length of time over which the expert had to carry the imprint of that voice in his head, the manner of comparison, and the sureness or otherwise of the opinion”. 
        
       
       
      He warned of the need for corroboration, because “of the danger of voice expert evidence”. 
       
      
    99 His Honour said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “You are quite permitted, indeed encouraged to make your own observations of the voices in those tapes to see if you would accept what opinion has been proffered”. 
        
       
      
    100 He warned the jury about the deficiencies in the Crown case on the voice similarity evidence. He drew attention to the fact that “the samples are not really great in quantity”. He pointed out that the record of interview was not long and much of it involved the police officers talking. He drew attention to the fact that Mr Chan had examined the tapes for translation purposes many months before. He reminded the jury that Dr Gibbons did not say that all of the tapes were identical. 
     
      
    101 The judge concluded by stressing that there was “a special need for caution in assessing that evidence. You should be very careful with it, and you should make, as I say, your own enquiries”. 
     
      
    102 In my opinion these warnings were entirely adequate. 
     
      
       
      The visual identification evidence of Detective Jonathon Tony Watson 
       
      
    103 Mr Nicholson submitted that the evidence of Detective Watson was irrelevant and relied again on Smith v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 650.  
     
      
    104 In Smith v The Queen, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at para 15 (see also Kirby J at 41-47): 
     
      
       
        
        “In other cases, the evidence of identification will be relevant because it goes to an issue about the presence or absence of some identifying feature other than one apparent from observing the accused on trial and the photograph which is said to depict the accused. … [I]f it is suggested that there is some distinctive feature revealed by the photographs (as, for example, a manner of walking) which would not be apparent to the jury in court, evidence both of that fact and the witness’ conclusion of identity would not be irrelevant”. 
        
       
      
    105 Detective Watson’s testimony was of the very nature postulated by the High Court. 
     
      
    106 Detective Watson had made extensive observations of the appellant during surveillance operations between March and May 1998. From the knowledge so gained he was able to testify as to the appellant’s posture and manner of walking, which were distinctive. This involved the swinging of his left arm, the holding of his head to the right and the manner of his walking generally. The jury were not able to see the appellant walking in court. Hence, Detective Watson’s evidence was not irrelevant and was properly admissible. 
     
      
    107 Mr Nicholson also submitted that, on discretionary grounds, Detective Watson’s evidence should not have been admitted as it necessarily involved the jury being informed that the appellant was under surveillance in a police investigation.  
     
      
    108 In my view, no relevant prejudice arose from Detective Watson disclosing that he had undertaken surveillance of the appellant between March and May 1998. This information was well known to the jury as evidence had been led that for several weeks the police had undertaken surveillance of the rooms occupied by the appellant.  
     
      
    109 Mr Nicholson also submitted that the evidence should have been excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        “[a] The poor quality of the video, which his Honour observed to be ‘grainy and short’ (at SU.12). 
        
       
       
        
        [b] The tainted nature of the procedure, which involved the witness purporting to identify a known person and suspect. 
        
       
       
        
        [c] The lack of basis for comparison of the appellant and the person in the video. There was no means of judging height, and the descriptions given by Watson of the person having average, medium build, was inconsistent with the slight build of the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        [d] The witness did not identify the person on the video as being Asian or having Asian features. He just purported to identify the appellant, who is, in fact, Asian. 
        
       
       
        
        [e] The prejudicial effect of disclosing to the jury the evidence of prior Police surveillance of the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    110 The poor quality of the video tape did not detract from the probative value of Detective Watson’s evidence. Detective Watson based his identification on the characteristic body movements of the appellant as compared to those that were apparent on the video tape. 
     
      
    111 While Detective Watson indeed identified “a named person and suspect”, he was doing so by reference to characteristics that were of an extraordinary quality. These characteristics involved a singular way of walking. These characteristics were described by Detective Watson and were available for the jury to see on the video tape. It was of course open to the appellant to contradict Detective Watson but he did not. The situation was not comparable to that which arises when a witness identifies a person by facial characteristics. Detective Watson testified that the person he saw on the video tape had the peculiar walking characteristics of the appellant. There was no way in which this evidence could have been made more reliable by some form of identification parade. In my view the criticisms made on the appellant’s behalf in this regard have no substance.  
     
      
    112 The fact that the person on the video was not identified as being Asian or having Asian features is irrelevant. I reiterate that the identification was made on grounds relating to the physical movements of the person in the video tape. 
     
      
    113 I would dismiss the grounds of appeal relating to the admissibility of the evidence of Detective Watson. 
     
      
       
      The failure to warn the jury of the dangers inherent in the visual identification evidence given by Detective Watson 
       
      
    114 The warnings that Shadbolt DCJ was required to give the jury concerning Detective Watson’s visual identification evidence were those set out in s 165(2) of the Evidence Act, namely, that that evidence might be unreliable and there was a need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. His Honour was also required to inform the jury of matters that might cause the evidence to be unreliable. 
     
      
    115 His Honour’s charge to the jury is replete with warnings of the kind described by s 165(2). In addition, his Honour on more than one occasion reminded the jury of the attacks that the appellant had made on Detective Watson’s evidence. 
     
      
    116 In my view, there is no substance in this ground. 
     
      
       
      Miscarriage of justice grounds 
       
      
    117 Having rejected each one of the particular grounds on which the appellant relies, the other two grounds asserting a miscarriage of justice both fail. 
     
      
    118 The appellant asserts that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The preceding grounds individually reveal substantial errors and defects in the trial proceedings requiring the intervention of this court”. 
        
       
       
      In my view, none of the grounds reveal errors or defects of any kind. 
       
      
    119 Once the challenged evidence is accepted as being admissible, the Crown case was very strong. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Appeal against Sentence 
       
      
    120 The appellant was aged 51 years at the time of sentence. He was born in Hong Kong but was an Australian citizen. He carried on business in Hong Kong trading in kitchenware. He had two adult daughters, one in Hong Kong and one in Sydney. Members of his family lived in Sydney. Shadbolt DCJ noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has a second wife who is now in the process of being deported, a matter which bears heavily upon him”. 
        
       
      
    121 Shadbolt DCJ was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was “a person with the overall responsibility for the importation into this country and its delivery here”. His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant “was the first or principal or most responsible person in this country, in other words the boss”. 
     
      
    122 Shadbolt DCJ noted that the appellant had been convicted in 1986 and sentenced to imprisonment for the supply of heroin. He served 14 months of a two years three months sentence. Shadbolt DCJ observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is hardly a record which would permit the court to extend any leniency to him”. 
        
       
      
    123 Shadbolt DCJ also noted that the appellant had given some help to the authorities. His Honour said that the appellant’s help was “accurate and timely”. It led to another shipment of heroin being intercepted and seized, but no arrests were made. Nevertheless, his Honour considered that the effect of the appellant’s assistance was to be tempered by qualifications expressed by the police in regard to its value. 
     
      
    124 The learned judge also considered the question of parity. He said in this regard: 
     
      
       
        
        “Pang pleaded guilty, assisted police and received a sentence of eight years and five years non-parole which was reduced to five years and three years non-parole by the Court of Criminal Appeal. He was regarded, quite rightly in my view, as a courier. Kook, following a plea, received twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years. This was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In this case, although there has been assistance, there has also been a trial and a lengthy pre-trial application. [The appellant] was more seriously involved than Kook, and, not only that, he also had a previous conviction for the supply of heroin. The sentence I impose will be greater than that of Kook for the above reasons”. 
        
       
      
    125 His Honour pointed out that the maximum sentence under s 235 of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) was life imprisonment without parole. He observed that “offences of this nature are viewed by both the legislature and the community as offences of the greatest gravity”. 
     
      
    126 Shadbolt DCJ said that the importation in question involved approximately one kilogram more than the commercial quantity. For this reason he considered it should be put towards the lower end of the scale of seriousness. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The method used was simple, almost time honoured one might say, and presented no novelty or singular cunning. No officials were corrupted”. 
        
       
      
    127 Shadbolt DCJ concluded his remarks on sentence by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appropriate sentence for this offence could have been 24 years. I reduce that by one-third making 16. From which I take 25% for the assistance which has been rendered. The prisoner is therefore sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of 9 years.” 
        
       
      
    128 The Crown contended that there was a complete lack of contrition on the part of the appellant. I accept that this is the case. 
     
      
    129 The Crown contended that in the light of all the circumstances his Honour’s starting point in regard to a possible head sentence of 24 years was erroneous and should have been 30 years. The Crown submitted that the case of R v Chan [2002] NSWCCA 217 was analogous. About 3.4 kilograms of heroin was involved in R v Chan. Hodgson JA, in giving the leading judgment of the Court, said that the offender in that case was “the mastermind” and “a starting point of less than 30 years would be erroneous”. 
     
      
    130 The Crown also submitted that his Honour also erred by allowing as much as 25% discount for assistance. The material before the learned judge, in the form of a “letter of assistance” by an officer of the Australian Federal Police, indicated that while the appellant provided information to the police that was valuable, “it has always fallen short of being such value that it has led to either narcotic seizures or the arrest of offenders”. The officer expressed the opinion that, having regard to the apparent position of the appellant in the criminal hierarchy, and the information to which he would be privy, the assistance given by him “has been selective and of minimal practical value”. 
     
      
    131 Mr Nicholson has pointed to other material indicating the extent of the assistance provided by the appellant. This material was provided in the course of an application by the appellant to Shadbolt DCJ for a permanent stay of the indictment that was eventually presented against him. 
     
      
    132 It is rare for a principal of a drug importation enterprise to be apprehended and convicted. Where that does occur full weight must be given to the criminality involved in being one of the directing minds of the criminal enterprise. This is the explanation for the approach of this Court in R v Chan. 
     
      
    133 In my view his Honour erred in failing to impose a sentence that gave proper recognition to the degree of criminality involved in the appellant directing the criminal enterprise. In my view, the starting point should not have been less than 30 years.  
     
      
    134 I also consider that when due regard is had to the selective and limited nature of the assistance given, a discount of 25% was over-generous. 
     
      
    135 Having regard to the sentences imposed upon the other offenders, and the fact that this is a Crown appeal, I consider that an appropriate head sentence would be 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years 3 months. 
     
      
    136 I would therefore uphold the appeal, set aside the sentences arrived at by his Honour and impose a head sentence of 15 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years 3 months. Accepting that the appropriate date for the commencement of the sentences would be 25 August 2001 (as determined by the learned trial judge), the head sentence will expire on 24 August 2016 and the non-parole period on 24 November 2012. I propose that orders be made in these terms.  
     
      
    137 WHEALY J: I agree with Ipp JA. 
     
      
    138 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Ipp JA for the reasons given by his Honour.

      70033/03 Regina v Tai Zhu Yu 
       
       
      
    SENTENCE 
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 24 November 2003, Tai Zhu Yu, entered a plea of guilty to an indictment charging him with the manslaughter, on 30 August 2002, of Jang Sig Seo, also known as Sung Il Park. He had been arraigned on 4 July 2003 on a charge of murder, to which he had pleaded not guilty. The plea to the lesser offence, which had been informally discussed, at least by the time of the arraignment, and then formally offered in October last, was accepted by the Crown in November, following a conference with the de facto partner of the deceased, and a review of the expert reports, to which I will refer. In those circumstances it can properly be regarded as an early plea to manslaughter. 
     
      
      Facts 
       
      
    2 The defendant, who is of a Korean background, and who came to Australia from China during the 2000 Olympics, was, at the time of the offence, working as a cleaner. By reason of their status as illegal immigrants, both he and his de facto partner Song Zhu Piao, who had followed him to Australia, were taken advantage of by the cleaning contractors for whom they worked, and who had come from a similar ethnic background. As a consequence they found themselves working extremely long hours for little pay, for which they often had a lengthy wait. 
     
      
    3 The deceased and his de facto partner Ah Kyung Choi, who was distantly related to the defendant, also came to Australia from China. They arrived in about 2002 and took up residence with the defendant and his de facto partner at their home in Dee Why. Work as cleaners was arranged for them through Jae Su Kim, who had been the principal, although not the sole, employer of the defendant and his partner. 
     
      
    4 After a time tensions emerged between the two families, as a result of delays in being paid for their work, personality clashes, and behaviour of the deceased that the defendant described as “backbiting”, involving, it would seem, tales told by the deceased to Jae Su Kim, as well as some untoward and aggressive incidents when the deceased had been affected by alcohol. 
     
      
    5 On one occasion, it is said, he made reference to the criminal connections which his brother allegedly had in China, and to an incident in which that brother had apparently killed someone. This was said in a context that conveyed an implicit threat of harm to the families of the defendant and of his partner, who were still living in China. There were also some problems in relation to the work performance of the deceased and his wife, and in relation to an insufficiency of cleaning jobs for all four persons. 
     
      
    6 These problems came to a head after about two to three months, at which point the deceased and his wife either decided, or were asked, to leave the defendant’s flat. They moved to an address nearby, although they still saw one another on occasions, and exchanged pleasantries. 
     
      
    7 In about December 2001 Song Zhu Piao suffered a serious leg injury which prevented her working for about six months. During this period the defendant assumed sole responsibility for their contracts, adding to an already demanding and stressful workload. 
     
      
    8 During the lead up to 30 August 2002, the defendant and his wife, who by then had resumed her cleaning duties, were working for several contractors for about 17 hours a day, often each day of the week, and at various locations in the Peninsula and Northern Suburbs. That this was the case was confirmed by Michael Lee, who was the area manager and inspector of the company which subcontracted work to Jae Su Kim. They were able to gain only three hours or so sleep each day between jobs and were living mainly on snack foods, Coca-Cola and coffee. The demands upon them had also increased over the preceding weeks as a result of them taking over some additional work for Jae Su Kim. Not surprisingly, the defendant was showing signs of stress and depression, as a result of the pressures of this work and of his constant sleep deprivation. Jae Su Kim, who saw him early on the morning of the offence, confirmed that he had appeared exhausted and had remarked that he had been too tired to take on some other jobs.  
     
      
    9 On 30 August, after finishing work, the defendant and his wife went to the shops at Dee Why, where they happened to meet the deceased and his partner. The meeting was amicable, and after some discussion, they went their own ways. 
     
      
    10 After arriving home Song Zhu Piao began to prepare a meal, after which they planned to retire for a few hours sleep before returning to work. In the meantime the deceased and his partner had found themselves accidentally locked out of their flat. Over his partner’s opposition, the deceased indicated that he intended to visit the defendant in order to be “reconciled”, and to offer him some work which he had been unable to accept, since he did not have a motor vehicle. This visit also coincided with the notice which had recently been given by Jae Su Kim, that he did not intend to continue the employment of the deceased and his partner.  
     
      
    11 The stress which each of the deceased and the defendant were under at this time, was also no doubt exacerbated by the fact that Jae Su Kim admittedly owed the defendant between $4000 and $5000, for work performed. An amount of about $6000 was also owed to the deceased. It had apparently been Kim’s practice over the preceding period, to pay each of them limited amounts sufficient only to cover their rent and living expenses, and to defer the bulk of their entitlements until a later date. 
     
      
    12 After the deceased arrived unexpectedly at the defendant’s flat, between 10 and 11 AM, it was decided that he would share a meal with them, and that they would purchase some alcohol to have with that meal. The defendant indicated that he had contemplated the purchase of only a small quantity of beer, but, at the insistence of the deceased, three six packs of 375 ml Cascade Premium bottles were brought home and then consumed. 
     
      
    13 By the end of the meal, the defendant and Song Zhu Piao were tired. They began to hint to the deceased that he should go home, although they suggested that they should get together, on the following day, for a meal. The deceased declined and indicated that he wished to stay, to continue their conversation, and drink the rest of the beer. 
     
      
    14 The conversation seems to have centred largely around the deceased’s concern with their employment and with his suggestion that he was planning to leave his wife. 
     
      
    15 The defendant remonstrated with the deceased in relation to these observations, most particularly in relation to the deceased’s plan to leave his wife, since he felt a “brotherly” obligation towards her. That was an obligation which had arisen out of their distant family relationship, and out of his parents’ request to assist her and the deceased, when they had first come to Australia. 
     
      
    16 By this time Song Zhu Piao said that the defendant was showing signs of exhaustion, was having difficulty keeping his head up, and was repeatedly suggesting that the deceased should go home, so that they could rest. At one point, he stressed this by going to the bedroom, removing his trousers and lying down briefly before coming back to the table. 
     
      
    17 After a while the deceased’s conversation became repetitive and more aggressive, insulting and offensive in tone and in content. He began to complain that the defendant thought himself to be superior, suggested that he was conspiring to have him dismissed, and made reference to the fact that they all had families back in China, and that those of the defendant and his wife were vulnerable. In this respect he repeated the reference which he had made, on another occasion, to having a younger brother with gangster connections, and a history of violence. 
     
      
    18 Over the four or so hours which had elapsed to this point, it would seem that one of the bottles of beer which had been earlier purchased, had been consumed by Song Zhu Piao, while the remainder had been shared approximately equally by the defendant and by the deceased. 
     
      
    19 The defendant said that he had become angry as a result of the deceased’s refusal to go home and lack of respect, and fearful, by reason of the threats as to the well-being, in particular, of his daughter back in China. 
     
      
    20 At about 2:30 PM the defendant and his partner again asked the deceased, who by this time appeared to have become very drunk and aggressive, to leave, but he refused to do so. As the tension escalated, it seems that the deceased jabbed his fingers at the defendant, and at some stage kicked him in the ankle, leaving a substantial bruise. 
     
      
    21 The defendant, who was well affected by alcohol and who was angry and tired, responded to the deceased’s actions by fetching two knives from the kitchen. He returned to the table and struck the deceased with considerable force to the side of the head with the flat of one knife, an act which he hoped might persuade him to leave. The force of the blow knocked this knife out of his hand, but he still held onto the other knife, which he then moved to his right hand. 
     
      
    22 A physical altercation followed, in the course of which the deceased seized the defendant by the shirt collar, and a struggle developed between them. It would appear that in the course of this struggle, which moved between several rooms and led to some damage to the fabric of the flat, the smaller of the two knives which the defendant had obtained from the kitchen, was used to stab the deceased in the abdomen. 
     
      
    23 The defendant has said, both to police and in his evidence, that he did not intend to stab the deceased with the knife, and that he did not know how the stomach wounds were caused. 
     
      
    24 The defendant saw that the deceased had blood on his clothing, but he said that the struggle between them continued, with the deceased maintaining his resistance to leaving the premises. Up to that point, he acknowledges, he had been very angry, although still in control of himself. However, when the struggle continued, he totally lost control of himself and picked up a golf club. Thereafter, it is accepted, he struck the deceased five times to the head, using two separate golf clubs, with sufficient force for the heads of the clubs to be detached, and for the shaft of one to be bent. 
     
      
    25 When the deceased was seen to be injured and to have collapsed, Jae Su Kim was telephoned for assistance. He telephoned Michael Lee, who in turn telephoned the 000 number for assistance. 
     
      
    26 While Lee did this, Jae Su Kim drove to the defendant’s apartment. On his account, by the time that he arrived, the defendant and his partner had left the premises. They say however that they were still there, but were encouraged by Kim to leave because there was nothing that they could do for the deceased, and because they had immigration problems. I see no reason to disbelieve them in this respect. 
     
      
    27 After leaving the premises, with some personal belongings, they went to an ATM where they withdrew $800 from the bank account. They then moved into new accommodation at Belmore, although they remained in contact with Michael Lee, who they met later that day to return the keys for some cleaning jobs, and also with Jae Su Kim. 
     
      
    28 They spoke to Hoy Sig Kim, a Pastor with the Korean Church, who urged the defendant to surrender himself to police. On 11 September 2002, police called to the premises and arrested the defendant, who they found hiding in the bushes outside, suffering from some minor injuries sustained when he jumped out of a window and which led to him being taken to hospital. His partner was also arrested. She was eventually convicted of the offence of concealing a serious crime and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for six months. Immigration officials elected to arrest her outside the Court on the second day of these proceedings, and she has now either been deported or awaits such fate. 
     
      
    29 When interviewed by police on 12 September 2002, the defendant made a number of admissions concerning the stabbing and striking of the deceased. 
     
      
    30 In his evidence before me the defendant said that he had not followed the Pastor’s advice to surrender himself immediately, because he needed to continue working in order to pay out the debts, which he and his partner, and which the deceased and his partner, had incurred in arranging for their unlawful passage to Australia. 
     
      
    31 The deceased, who had been alive when taken to hospital, died of his injuries during surgery. At the post mortem examination by Dr Cala, he was found to have sustained two parallel stab wounds to the upper left abdomen, which passed through the stomach, the small intestine and left diaphragm, and which led to haemorrhaging from, inter alia, the splenic vein and artery, and the left hemidiaphragm. 
     
      
    32 Additionally, Dr Cala found that the deceased had suffered multiple lacerations to his head, a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, and a bruise to the right upper back, injuries which were all consistent with him having been struck by an instrument such as a golf club. 
     
      
    33 His death was ascribed to the combined effects of blunt force trauma to the head and to the stab wounds. At committal Dr Cala said that, in his opinion, while both sets of injuries contributed to the death of the deceased, the head injuries would probably not have resulted in death, on their own. 
     
      
    34 Analysis of post mortem samples in relation to the deceased showed that his blood/alcohol level was 0.116 g/100 ml, his urine/alcohol level was 0.209 g/100 ml, and that his vitreous humour/alcohol level was 0.144 g/100 ml. Professor Starmer expressed an opinion, based upon the deceased’s assumed body weight, the number of beers which he had drunk, the time which had elapsed and the post-mortem findings, that his blood/alcohol concentration would have been in the range of 0.189 to 0.225 g/100 ml at the time of the incidents which led to his death. 
     
      
    35 He also expressed an opinion, based upon the body weight of the defendant, and the assumption that he had consumed eight 375 ml bottles of Cascade Premium beer over four hours, that his blood/alcohol concentration at the time would have been in the range of 0.116 to 0.204 g/100 ml. 
     
      
    36 The effects of such a concentration upon the defendant, Professor Starmer indicated, could have been exacerbated by the circumstance that he may well have had the genetically determined intolerance to alcohol, which is more common in North Asian populations than in Caucasian populations. Additionally he said, if he had been consistently working approximately 17 hours per day and sleeping for only three hours per day, as he claimed, then he would “almost certainly have been in a state of extreme, chronic fatigue”, which was only likely to have greatly exacerbated the effects of the alcohol which he had consumed. 
     
      
    37 The effects of alcohol, he explained, somewhat obviously, are that it impairs cognitive abilities, modifies demeanour and verbal responses, interferes with verbal and non-verbal communication between parties who have been drinking thereby increasing the chances of miscommunication and misinterpretation, and increases emotional lability. Where verbal and behavioural responses become inappropriately aggressive as a result of drinking, he added, the likelihood of violence is increased. 
     
      
    38 On any view, each of the deceased and the defendant was significantly affected by alcohol. That the defendant was significantly intoxicated, and may have suffered from the intolerance to alcohol mentioned by Professor Starmer, is also reinforced by the observations of him, which were reported by his partner and by Mr Lee, following the incident. 
     
      
    39 Dr Grunstein, an expert in sleep and respiratory medicine provided a report, in which he expressed an opinion, based upon the history of the defendant’s work schedule and sleeping times, that he would have been suffering sleep deprivation at the time of the offence. That condition, he said, leads to “impairment in performance loss of efficiency and deterioration in mood state, resulting in tension, depression, aggression, confusion, fatigue and loss of vigour”. 
     
      
    40 Additionally, he said “as sleep debt accumulates a person’s mood, motivations, attention, alertness, … become more negatively affected”, and logical reasoning is reduced. 
     
      
    41 It was his opinion that there was reasonable evidence, upon the history provided to him, that the “severe sleep loss exposure sustained by [the defendant] would have led to a mood disturbance and loss of control”. Similarly to Professor Starmer, he said that the “consumption of alcohol would be expected to exacerbate these effects”. 
     
      
    42 Ms Sunny Hong, who practices as a psychotherapist and clinical consultant, provided a report on the psychosocial and Korean cultural issues, which she saw as pertaining to the case. She made reference to the sense of obligation to the deceased and his partner, which the defendant had accepted, as a result of their family connections; the respect which the deceased should have afforded, but had not afforded, to the defendant as an older man; and to the assistance which the defendant had provided, at his own loss, in order to ensure that the deceased and his partner continued to have work. She also explained that it was customary for Korean men to drink alcohol if they needed to engage in a conversation that addressed difficult issues, such as strained relationships, and for the older man to listen to the younger man, and to bear with his drunken behaviour. She also made reference to the strong feelings of regret and remorse, which the defendant had expressed to her. 
     
      
    43 While she expected that the provocation offered by the deceased would have been managed well by the defendant in normal circumstances, it was the combination of alcohol, sleep deprivation and exhaustion, which, in her view, had led the defendant to lose control of himself and to erupt into violent behaviour. 
     
      
    44 Dr Lucas, a forensic psychiatrist, has also provided a report, which was prepared upon the basis of a two-hour interview, and the material in the prosecution brief, as well as the two reports just mentioned. It was his opinion that the defendant displayed no signs of any psychiatric disorder, or of any cognitive problems. On the contrary, he presented as a polite and affable man of good intelligence, who deeply regretted what had occurred and the impact on the families of those involved. 
     
      
    45 He considered that the effects of the defendant’s sleep deprivation and intoxication were highly relevant to an understanding of his state of mind at the time of the incident, and of his responses to the provocative behaviour of the deceased. He also thought that the cultural factors which he had discussed with Sunny Hong, and which I assume were the same as those expressed in the report which I have mentioned, were essential to an understanding of the way that the deceased’s conduct had been upsetting and provoking the defendant. 
     
      
    46 It was his view that the defendant’s mood, cognition and behaviour, had been affected by the interaction of severe sleep deprivation and his intoxication with alcohol, resulting in the ability to control his behaviour being markedly compromised. In combination, he said, these circumstances rendered him more vulnerable to respond as he did to the behaviour of the deceased, which seemed also to have been culturally inappropriate. 
     
      
    47 In order to assess the extent of the defendant’s objective criminality, it is necessary to determine the basis on which he is to be understood as having committed the offence of manslaughter. Additionally, it is necessary to take into account the factors mentioned in the new s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    48 The Crown submitted that the case should be viewed as one in which all of the defendant’s acts, including the use of the knives and of the golf clubs, had been done with the specific intention of causing grievous bodily harm, although in circumstances giving rise to a defence of provocation. 
     
      
    49 Very fairly, it accepted that the defendant’s actions were not premeditated, that they were significantly contributed to by his sleep deprivation and by his consumption of alcohol, and that the behaviour of the deceased as an uninvited and intoxicated guest, who had become aggressive, who had made threats to the defendant and to his family, and who had refused to leave the premises, had been significantly provocative. 
     
      
    50 The Crown also very fairly accepted that the evidence of the defendant having an intention to cause grievous bodily harm was sparse, and was dependent upon inferences to be drawn from the acts themselves. 
     
      
    51 Mr Molomby SC for the defendant, submitted that the case should be regarded as one involving an unlawful and dangerous act, in relation to each set of injuries. He submitted that it was one in which the defendant’s objective culpability should be regarded as having been, in addition, significantly reduced by reason of the serious provocation offered by the deceased, the exhausted and sleep-deprived state of the defendant, and the fact that the impossible situation in which he found himself had been entirely brought about by the deceased. 
     
      
    52 As Street CJ said in R v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 400 at 402: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been said that manslaughter, perhaps, beyond any other crime is protean. The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter rather than murder can vary infinitely, and it is not always easy to determine in any given case what should be done in the matter of sentence. At the start it should be recognised that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the  
        Crimes Act 
        , 1900 and in the community at large as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The courts have, however, over the decades gradually manifested a willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attended by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of the courts and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party. 
        
       
       
        
        In a case such as the present, where there is material justifying a degree of understanding and of sympathy towards the appellant, the task of sentencing is particularly difficult. It is necessary to evaluate the demands of the criminal justice system, the expectations of the community at large, the subjective circumstances of the person coming forward for criminal judgment and the interest of society in protecting itself and its members from criminal activity amounting, as in the present case, to the taking of a life.” 
        
       
       
      
    53 The present case is one that demonstrates the wisdom of these words, presenting, as it does, an almost unique situation. It does not necessarily follow that provocation/manslaughter is to be regarded as objectively more serious than manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374. Each case turns upon its own facts, and the extent of the provocation offered may be so extreme as to counter balance the fact an offender may have acted with the specific intent that would otherwise have left the crime as one of murder. Nevertheless, it is helpful to determine the precise basis for the offence for which the offender is to be sentenced.  
     
      
    54 I am satisfied, upon the evidence before me, that the stab wounds were occasioned without any specific intent on the part of the defendant. There was no admission that he used the knife with any specific intent to cause harm, and he has denied, on oath, having any such intent. He impressed me as a witness of the truth in this respect. I find that he produced the knives in response to the aggression and threats which had been offered by the deceased, and then struck him with the flat of the blade of one knife, in order to persuade him to leave the premises. No intent to cause grievous bodily harm could be inferred from that fact. 
     
      
    55 Thereafter, I am satisfied that there was a significant struggle between the two men, and that the abdominal injuries were caused as they grappled with one another and moved about the premises. The knife wounds were parallel and close together and Dr Cala accepted that the sharpness of the smaller knife, and the movement of the bodies of the men grappling together, while one held a knife, could have accounted for the wounds. 
     
      
    56 The production and continued holding of the knife by the defendant, while they struggled was, however, clearly an unlawful and dangerous act. 
     
      
    57 The position is somewhat less clear in relation to the golf clubs. Where one man strikes another forcibly and repeatedly to the head with a golf club, it is difficult to draw any inference, from that fact, other than that the former intended to cause the latter grievous bodily harm, at least in circumstances where he has some measure of self-control and appreciation of what is occurring. It is, in relation to this qualification, that the present case is to be determined, since the concern is with the subjective state of mind of the offender at the time of the relevant act or acts. 
     
      
    58 Leaving aside entirely the fact that the earlier knife wounds would of themselves have led to death, and that the head injuries were only a contributing cause, I have reached the conclusion that the defendant did not use the golf clubs with the specific intent alleged by the Crown. 
     
      
    59 I find that the deceased’s exhausted and sleep deprived state, the extreme provocation which had been offered by the deceased, and the effects of alcohol, which need to be taken into account in the manner provided by s 428C and 428E of the Crimes Act, left him in a position where he acted wildly, in a state in which he was totally out of control, and without forming any specific intention as to the result of his actions. 
     
      
    60 In these circumstances, I consider the case to be one that should properly be approached as one of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act. Even if I am incorrect in that finding, there would not seem, here, to be any significant difference in the level of objective criminality, were the case to be approached as one of provocation/manslaughter. That follows from the very same considerations as those just mentioned. Additionally, there are the circumstances that the defendant was trapped in his own home by an uninvited visitor, to whom he felt obliged to provide hospitality, and with whom he had to share alcohol which he did not really want. He was prevented from having the sleep which he desperately needed, he was abused and threatened in relation not only to himself, but also in relation to his family in China, and he was then assaulted physically. 
     
      
    61 It has been customary, when dealing with provocation manslaughter cases, to have regard to the three matters which were identified by Hunt CJ at CL in Regina v Alexander (1995) 78 A Crim R 141 at 144, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) the degree of provocation offered (or, alternatively, the extent of the loss of self-control suffered), which when great has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) the time between the provocation (whether isolated or cumulative in its effect) and the loss of self-control, which when short also has the tendency of reducing the objective gravity of the offence; and 
        
       
       
        
        (3) the degree of violence or aggression displayed by the prisoner, which when excessive has the tendency of increasing the objective gravity of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    62 Items (1) and (2) would weigh heavily in favour of reducing the objective gravity of the present offence, if it were to be considered as one of provocation/manslaughter. The provocation was extreme and the time between the provocation and the loss of self-control very short.  
     
      
    63 Similar reasons apply in measuring the defendant’s culpability for manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, since I am satisfied that it was only because of the deceased’s provocation that the defendant committed such an act. 
     
      
    64 The aggravating factors identified in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are confined to those mentioned in sub paragraphs (b), (c) and (g), namely, that the offence involved the actual use of violence and of a weapon, and that the injury and loss occasioned were substantial. However, since they are integral to the commission of the offence itself, being elements of it, they do not call for any additional punishment. 
     
      
    65 For these reasons, while the offence remains a serious one, for the reasons identified in Hill, and in the many subsequent cases involving manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, or provocation manslaughter (see for example R v Bolt [2001] NSWCCA 487, R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; R v Whalen NSWCCA, 5 April 1991), so far as it involved the taking of a human life, I am persuaded that this case is one which displays exceptional circumstances that place the defendant’s objective criminality at a relatively low level. 
     
      
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    66 The defendant, who is now aged 33 years, was born of Korean parents in the Yuen Beun area of Northern China, which has a large population of Koreans, being descendants of those who had taken refuge there during the occupation of Korea by Japan at the turn of the 20th century. 
     
      
    67 He is the elder of two brothers, who qualified as an electrician after completing compulsory military service. He was married in China, but is separated from his wife and is waiting for the finalisation of their divorce. He has, from that marriage, one daughter, now aged 12 years. His parents, who are still alive and resident in China, are not working, his father having retired from his previous position as an electrician. His family background was conservative, stable and happy, and he had no health problems in China, save for a congenital back problem. 
     
      
    68 He said that he came to Australia on a false Korean passport, which was obtained while in transit in the Philippines, to support his daughter and his parents, an obligation which fell upon him as the eldest child of the family, and to improve the quality of his life. In order to finance his unlawful passage through those engaged in the evil trade of people smuggling, he was obliged to borrow the equivalent of about AU $30,000, which loan was secured over the family home. It is likely that this security will now be forfeited, with consequential harm to his parents.  
     
      
    69 Upon his arrival in Australia he sought a protection visa but this was refused. For reasons which are not apparent, this decision was not followed by deportation, and he managed thereafter to remain in the country as an illegal immigrant. A significant part of his motivation to do so was attributable to the need to repay the debt, which he could never have done while living and working in China. 
     
      
    70 He made ends meet through a variety of jobs, before obtaining, after about 12 months, regular cleaning work through several Korean head contractors. He sent most of his earnings back to China to pay off the loan and to support his family. By all accounts, as established by the evidence before me, including that of Michael Lee, Jae Su Kim and Ok Jing Choi, he was regarded as reliable, truthful, well mannered, and generous and as a very good worker. He had not been known to display aggression or to drink to excess.  
     
      
    71 Pastor Hoy Sig Kim, who has known the defendant since March 2001, said that he regarded him as a very gentle and kind person, who had been helpful to others. He said that he could not have imagined that the present offence could have happened, which I take to mean that he regarded it as totally out of character. He confirmed that the defendant had said to him, when advised to hand himself in, that he would do so after he had paid out the debts of the two families, which they had incurred in coming to Australia. This I take to be a sign of a man of honour, rather than as an excuse to avoid justice.  
     
      
    72 As I have indicated, he has no psychiatric or personality disorder. He appears to be a man of some intelligence, as well as a person who has shown himself to be responsible, helpful, reliable and cognisant of his social and customary obligations. He has no other offences listed in his antecedents, and the only blemishes, on his otherwise good character, are this offence and the fact that he entered, and remained in, this country illegally. His only known physical illness, apart from his back condition, is a form of liver complaint, which it is agreed has been diagnosed as Hepatitis C, and for which he is receiving treatment within the prison medical service. Although a potentially serious condition, it is not one that would occasion any adjustment to the sentence which I would otherwise consider appropriate.  
     
      
    73 I accept that he is remorseful and has considerable contrition for his actions. This has been demonstrated by his observations to each of the experts who have assessed him, by his demeanour during the ERISP, by his evidence before me, and by the fact that he has been prepared to assume responsibility for the debt which was owed by the deceased to those who had lent him money for his passage to this country. 
     
      
    74 He faces the inevitability of deportation, and the prospect of a somewhat difficult return to China, having regard to the money which is owed, not directly to a people smuggler, but to an organisation which might satisfy itself by the sale of the family home, and also having regard to the possibility of revenge at the hands of the family of the deceased. 
     
      
    75 He speaks some Mandarin in addition to Korean, but has only limited English. He will be isolated, both linguistically and otherwise, in custody, since once his de facto partner has been deported, he will have no family or friends in this country. He has minimal prospects of receiving any family visits. He is not of a criminal persuasion, and is unlikely, as a result, to form much by way of any meaningful association with those fellow countrymen who are serving sentences for organised criminal activity. He will presumably be able to receive some support from Pastor Kim, but the nature of his situation, including the separation from his partner, is such that he will serve the sentence in somewhat more onerous conditions than other offenders. While that circumstance has been regarded as having almost no weight in relation to those who come to this country specifically to commit a serious crime, such as the importation of drugs, somewhat different considerations apply in the present case, such that it can be given some weight: see R v Huang (2000) 113 A Crim R 386 and R v Kanj [2000] NSWCCA 408. 
     
      
    76 On any view this case is wholly exceptional and could well answer the description of a tragedy of considerable proportions. An extremely hard-working young man of otherwise good character, who would almost certainly have been a worthwhile citizen of this country, had he followed or been permitted to follow the correct channels for immigration, has offended in circumstances that were entirely beyond his control.  
     
      
    77 For the reasons already mentioned, I regard his objective criminality to fall towards the lower level of that involved in the offence of manslaughter, which, no matter how committed, remains a very serious offence so far as it involves the felonious taking of a human life. His subjective circumstances are entirely favourable, and I am satisfied that he is not a person who is likely to reoffend in any way.  
     
      
    78 If he were allowed to continue to live in this country, his prospects of rehabilitation could only be assessed as extremely high. However, by reason of his immigration status, and the debts which he owes in China, both personal and financial, his future is as uncertain as it is bleak. 
     
      
    79 The mitigating circumstances, which I must take into account, in accordance with s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are those identified in sub paras (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (k). In that latter regard, the plea, as I have indicated, should be regarded as having been an early plea, and to have had a significant utilitarian value. The defendant is entitled, in respect of it, and in respect of the contrition, to the benefit of a discount towards the upper range of that accepted for early pleas, in accordance with s 22(1) of the Act. 
     
      
    80 The fact that the defendant will almost certainly be deported, does not mean that he should be deprived of the potential opportunity for release on parole: R v Shrestha (1991) 173 CLR 48. 
     
      
    81 Tai Zhu Yu, for the manslaughter of Jang Sig Seo, also known as Sung Il Park, I sentence you to imprisonment for 5 years to date from 11 September 2002. I fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, also to date from 11 September 2002, and to expire on 10 March 2005, which will be the earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole. I have significantly reduced the non-parole period, as I find that special circumstances exist in relation to the more onerous nature of your imprisonment, which will arise inter alia from your cultural, linguistic, and familial isolation.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY J:  The Court is in a position to deal with this matter. I invite Barr J to give the first judgment.2 BARR J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions under the provisions of s 5D Criminal Appeal Act against sentences imposed in the District Court. On 21 November 2002 the respondent, Justin Robert Smith, was committed to the District Court for trial for an attempted robbery in company on 14 February 2002 at Kensington, a robbery in company on 18 February 2002 at Cronulla and a robbery in company on 28 March 2002 at Annandale. On the first day of his trial, 10 March 2003, he pleaded guilty to all three charges. On 29 November 2002 he pleaded guilty before a Local Court magistrate to robbery with corporal violence on 7 March 2002 and was committed to the District Court for sentence. On 14 February 2003 he pleaded guilty in the Local Court to robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon on 17 May 2002 at Bankstown and was committed to the District Court for sentence.3 All charges came before Judge Backhouse QC and on 13 June 2003 her Honour imposed these sentences:- 
     
      
       
        
        For the attempted robbery in company on 14 February 2002 a fixed term of two years’ imprisonment commencing on 14 June 2006 and expiring on 13 June 2008;  
         
         
        For the robbery in company on 18 February 2002 imprisonment for four years commencing on 14 June 2006 and expiring on 13 June 2010 with a non-parole period of two years expiring on 13 June 2008; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        For the aggravated robbery with corporal violence on 7 March 2002 imprisonment for a fixed term of three years commencing on 14 December 2002 and expiring on 13 December 2005; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        For the robbery in company on 28 March 2002 imprisonment for a fixed term of two years commencing on 14 June 2006 and expiring on 13 June 2008; and  
         
         
        For the robbery with a dangerous weapon on 17 May 2002 imprisonment for seven years commencing on 14 December 2002 and expiring on 13 December 2009 with a non-parole period of four years and six months expiring on 13 June 2007. 
        
       
      
    4 In sentencing for the robbery of 18 February 2002 her Honour took into account under the provisions of s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the respondent’s possession of small amounts of cannabis and heroin.5 The practical effect of the sentences was a head sentence of seven years and six months commencing on 14 December 2002 and expiring on 13 June 2010 and a non-parole period of five years and six months expiring on 13 June 2008.6 On 27 July 2000 the respondent had been sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for four years and six months for the offence of robbery in company. The two-year non-parole period had expired on 4 November 2001 and the respondent had been released to parole on that day. He was subject to that parole throughout the commission of the five offences with which this appeal is concerned. He was arrested on 24 May 2002 and not long afterwards the Parole Board revoked his parole, backdated the revocation to the date of his arrest and ordered him to serve the balance of the four-year sentence, a period of two years and three days commencing on 24 May 2002 and expiring on 26 May 2004.7 There was, thus, a concurrency between the sentences which commenced on 14 December 2002 and the one for which parole had been revoked, beginning on 14 December 2002 and ending on 26 May 2004.8 The circumstances of the offences were as follows. Shortly after 4pm on 14 February 2002, the Kensington branch of the Commonwealth Bank had closed for the day but clients were still within the chamber completing their business. Four intending robbers entered the bank after one of them broke the door with an axe. The respondent and one other kicked open a door and gained access to the place where the cash was kept. The staff pressed an alarm, security screens rose and the attackers were thwarted. They ran out of the bank and got away from the district in a stolen car. The image of the respondent’s face was recorded by a security camera.9 During the afternoon of 18 February 2002 the respondent and three others entered the Cronulla branch of Westpac Bank. Two of them went up to a security guard and struck him on the head. Another stood at the door to stop anybody leaving. The respondent jumped onto the counter and swung on a security screen until it came loose. He threw it to the floor. He and one other went to the cash drawers, removed money and put it into a bag that the respondent was carrying. They got away with more than $15,000. As before, the respondent’s image was recorded by a security camera. During the commission of the offence, an eight-one year old client of the bank was pushed to the floor and fell heavily onto his right shoulder, which was sprained. He was treated in hospital. A staff member was struck on the face and the back of the head. She was treated in hospital for concussion and facial bruising.10 At about 11.20pm on 7 March 2002 staff of Coles’ Supermarket at Randwick were removing money from tills and placing it in bags. The respondent and another entered the store. The respondent struck a staff member on the head and tried to take a money bag from her. He and his companion ran from the store and as they did so one of them took the sum of $260 in cash out of the hand of another staff member. The first staff member was put in pain and was scratched on the arm. The other suffered minor cuts and bruising to a hand and arm. The respondent left a fingerprint at the scene.11 On 28 March 2000 the respondent and three others entered the Annandale branch of the Australia and New Zealand Bank. The respondent and two others got into the place where the cash was kept and removed it from drawers. One of them required the manager to open the safe and as she went to do so another co-offender pushed her, causing her to fall and hit her head on a door frame. She lay stunned on the floor and the co-offender kicked her and dragged her towards the safe. One of the co-offenders called “Time” and the robbers ran away. They got away from the district in a stolen car driven by a fifth offender. They stole more than $17,000. The image of the respondent was recorded by a camera.12 The last of these offences took place on 17 May 2002 at Bankstown. The respondent and two others banged on the door of the ANZ Bank and the manager opened it. One of them threatened him with a crowbar and they demanded to be let in. The manager ran into the bank and they followed him. One of them took out a gun. They removed a quantity of deposit bags and money from drawers. They took the wallets and handbags of members of the staff. They got away in a stolen car driven by another offender. Altogether they took more than $134,000. On 24 May 2002 police searched the respondent’s house and found the deposit bags and other documents and things stolen in the robbery. A member of the bank’s staff identified the respondent as one of the attackers by selecting his from a number of photographs.  
     
      
    13 The maximum sentences for the offences were, respectively, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty and twenty-five years’ imprisonment.14 The respondent did not give evidence on sentence but a report from Mr John Machlin, psychologist, was tendered that said something about him and his history. He was born on 7 February 1977, so he was twenty-six years old at the time of sentence. His parents separated when he was three years old and he had not seen his father since. His mother was an alcoholic. He was raised mainly by his grandmother and an aunt. He began offending at the age of twelve years but avoided juvenile detention. At fifteen or sixteen years old he began cohabiting with his partner. They have two children, a son aged nine and a daughter aged four years. The respondent left school from Year 8. He has done some work under Work for the Dole schemes as a juvenile and on work release programs while in custody. He has participated in drug and alcohol counselling through involvement with the justice system.15 He used cannabis until the age of nineteen or twenty, when he began using heroin. That started while he was serving a gaol sentence. He has been smoking heroin for the past five years, except when in custody. He participated in a rehabilitation program when he was nineteen or twenty years old but only briefly, leaving it almost immediately after beginning. At the time of his arrest he said that he was using two grams of heroin a day at a cost of $700.16 The respondent is considered to be well below average in intelligence, having a composite IQ calculated at 75. Mr Machlin considered that to be above the level of developmental disability. Mr Machlin thought that the respondent was depressed, though not clinically so.17 The respondent has a bad record for a young man. I shall not refer to his less serious offences of dishonesty and violence. In March 1994, when he was sixteen years old, he was dealt with for five counts of robbery. He was ordered to perform community service. In August 1996, when he was nineteen years old, he was convicted of seven counts of robbery in company and sentenced to a term of three years three months’ imprisonment with a minimum term of one year. In January 1998, when he was twenty years of age, he was dealt with for stealing from the person and two other offences. He was sentenced to imprisonment for one year with a minimum term of nine months. In July 2000 he was sentenced for the count of robbery in company, which I have already mentioned.18 A pre-sentence report, which was prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service, drew attention to the respondent’s financial and social deprivation and to the consequence that he had failed to realise his potential. The officer regarded the respondent as a person with low self-esteem who was easily influenced by associates and who had come to regard a succession of gaol sentences as inevitable. The officer drew attention to the respondent’s repeated failures on parole which had led to the two prior revocations.19 The remarks of the sentencing judge are extensive and detailed. Having reviewed the facts at length, the judge recorded that the respondent accepted responsibility for the part he had played as well the parts his co-offenders had played in each of the offences. The judge noted that none of the money stolen from the banks had been recovered. The judge expressed the view that the respondent was entitled to a twenty-five per cent discount from the sentence which would otherwise apply for each of the offences, mentioning the utilitarian value of the pleas and the respondent’s remorse and contrition. Her Honour continued by saying, “...albeit limited by the strong Crown case in each instance.” That statement implies, if it does not express, doubt about remorse and contrition, though elsewhere in the remarks on sentence her Honour appeared to be free of doubt about those matters.20 Her Honour referred to the family, education, work and criminal history of the respondent, with particular reference to his use of heroin and his acknowledged need to rid himself of the need to use that drug. Her Honour accepted the evidence of Mr Machlin that the respondent would probably respond to therapeutic and rehabilitative efforts now, having acknowledged his need to be rid of his addiction.21 Her Honour referred to the objective seriousness of the offences and for the need for sentences to deter the respondent and others from committing such offences. Her Honour observed that the fact that the offences were committed to obtain money to buy heroin did not mitigate the respondent’s criminality.22 Referring to the most recent revocation of parole and observing that the respondent had been in custody ever since his arrest on 24 May 2002, her Honour stated an intention to backdate the sentencing for a period of six months from the date of imposition, though there was no explanation of how that commencement date was selected or calculated.23 In accordance with s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act her Honour identified the age of the respondent, the fact that he was Aboriginal and the need for ongoing rehabilitation as justifying a sentencing structure in which the parole period exceeded one quarter of the head sentence.24 During the remarks on sentence her Honour referred to Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610.25 The Crown made a number of attacks on the sentences in this Court. First, relying on Regina v Henry and Pearce v The Queen, it was submitted that the individual sentences were too low. It was submitted that the total effective sentence was too short to reflect the objective seriousness of the whole of the respondent’s bout of criminality. It was submitted that the sentences, short as they were, were really even shorter because there was a concealed leniency resulting from the partial concurrency with the parole period of the previous sentence. It was submitted that the commencing date of the overall sentence should have been the day of its imposition, 13 June 2003. Finally it was submitted that the discount of twenty-five per cent for the pleas of guilty was too high, in view of the fact that only two of the five offences involved pleas of guilty at the earliest opportunity.26 Although her Honour made a passing reference to Regina v Henry, there was no comparison made between the circumstances of the present case and those dealt with in that case. Regina v Henry indicates a range of four to five years as an appropriate starting point for sentencing in a fairly typical kind of robbery in company, important features of which are that the accused is young with no substantial previous criminal history, little or no planning is involved, and little property is taken. The present case was far more serious than the kinds of cases there contemplated in that the respondent was no longer a youth, there was a substantial degree of planning in each attack, substantial amounts of money were taken or at risk and there were the aggravating features of the violence done to property and staff and clients of the banks. The last offence involved the use of a dangerous weapon. All the offences were committed when the respondent was on parole. To the extent that Regina v Henry might offer any guidance, therefore, it would be that in the absence of strong reasons to the contrary the starting point for these sentences ought to have exceeded the range there indicated. They did not.27 The fact that the judge made no attempt to justify by reference to Henry or any other case or body of information that might have indicated appropriate sentences and the shortness of the sentences themselves satisfy me that her Honour fell into error.28 Moreover, the fact that the sentences imposed for the offences committed on 14 February 2002, 7 March 2002 and 28 March 2002 were made concurrent with the other two sentences meant that the respondent received no punishment for those three offences. I have not overlooked the fact that it may be appropriate in a particular case to order that one sentence run concurrently with another but in my view the shortness of the individual sentences and the resulting shortness of the overall sentence had the result that I have explained. Really, it seems to me that the strength of the Crown argument is that, however the sentences are structured, the total effective sentence is far shorter than it reasonably could have been.  
     
      
    29 In a Crown appeal against sentence, this Court will not interfere merely because it would itself if sentencing have imposed a higher sentence. The Crown must show that the sentence appealed against was so low as to be entirely outside the proper range of discretion of the sentencing judge. Even then the Court is not bound to interfere but must exercise its discretion whether to do so. An important consideration in the exercise of that discretion s that effectively the offender is called for sentence a second time.30 Bearing all these matters in mind, I have come to the view that these sentences were individually and collectively so low that they fall below the proper range of sentencing discretion of the judge. For the same reason I think that this Court should interfere.31 It is not necessary to deal with all the attacks made by the Crown, but I do think it appropriate to deal with two other matters. The Crown submitted that her Honour erred in allowing a twenty-five per cent discount for the pleas of guilty. A plea of guilty may affect the sentence in a number of ways. First, it will save the State time and money in trying the offender. This has been called the utilitarian value of the plea and is generally taken to entitle an offender to a reduction of somewhere in the range of ten to twenty-five per cent from the sentence which would otherwise apply, depending on the timing of the plea. The earlier the plea the more time, trouble and money are saved and the greater the reduction that should be allowed. The assessment of reduction for this reason does not concern itself with motive but with the measure of the benefit flowing to the State.32 Secondly, a plea of guilty makes it unnecessary for witnesses to give evidence. That assumes importance where lay witnesses who because of age or as a result of injury or the unsettling effect of their experience might find giving evidence unusually burdensome. It was an important feature of the respondent’s pleas, because they relieved the clients and staffs of the organisations concerned, some of whom were injured, one of whom was elderly and all of whom must have been badly shaken by their experience, from the need to give evidence.33 Thirdly, a plea of guilty might be evidence of remorse. Her Honour appears so to have regarded it. There was independent evidence in the report of Mr Machlin that the respondent was sorry and that he wanted to do what he could to rid himself of his addiction to heroin.34 The judgment of this Court in Regina v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 made it plain that a sentencing court is encouraged to nominate the percentage or other proportion by which a sentence has been reduced on account of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. I say “encouraged” because it is unnecessary for the Court to do so if it does not appear appropriate for the Court to do so.35 In due course I shall propose sentences to be passed in lieu of the sentence imposed by her Honour. Those sentences will incorporate a substantial allowance for the respondent’s pleas of guilty, some in the Local Court and some at the very commencement of the trial. I do not think it appropriate otherwise to mention the value of the discount which I shall allow.36 The Crown submitted that the sentences were even more lenient than they at first appeared because they had been made to commence during the currency of the earlier sentence. Her Honour appears to have regarded the period between arrest on 24 May 2002 and the commencement date of the first sentence, 14 December 2002, as notionally attributable solely to the prior sentence. There was no evidence on which her Honour could do so and no reason was given. At the same time, her Honour regarded as an aggravating feature, justifying a higher sentence, the fact that the offences were committed on parole.37 A number of cases in this Court have dealt with the problem that exists when a sentencing judge is faced with the prospect of grafting a new sentence or new sentences onto the parole period of an existing sentence. Views differ about the appropriate way to deal with the problem in any particular case.38 In argument before us, Mr Cook, responding to the Crown’s submission that any sentence should be made to date from the date that her Honour imposed sentence, submitted that this would produce a capricious result, that in a practical sense the precise day upon which an offender came for sentence was ultimately quite accidental.39 That states only one half of the problem, to my mind. What a sentencing judge has to do is impose a proper sentence or proper sentences overall, taking into account the criminality for the sentences that are there and then to be imposed and all relevant antecedent facts, including, if it is the case, that an offender is serving the balance of the parole period of an existing sentence. The sentencing judge must take that into account and in an intuitive way adjust accordingly the sentence or sentences to be imposed.40 I shall propose the commencement the first of the sentences on the day on which her Honour imposed sentence. In doing so, however, I shall take into account the fact that the offender was serving the balance of parole of an earlier sentence. I shall take into account the fact that these offences were all committed while the respondent was on parole and I shall take into account the fact that the sentences will be accumulated onto an existing sentence. That last fact of itself weighs, when the Court considers the principle of totality, in deciding the length of sentences it is to impose.41 Employing the restraint which is necessary in re-sentencing a respondent to a Crown appeal and reducing sentences which would otherwise be appropriate by an appropriate amount sufficient to allow for the pleas of guilty and their consequences, as well as the other subjective features to which her Honour drew attention, I would impose an effective head sentence of fifteen years and a non-parole period of nine years counting from the date upon which her Honour imposed sentence.42 The parole period would exceed twenty-five per cent of the head sentence because the respondent needs a longer period than would ordinarily apply to promote the chances of his rehabilitation when he is released to parole.43 The partial accumulation of sentences justifies the Court in declining to fix a non-parole period on any of the first three sentences, to reduce it on the fourth and to increase it on the fifth.

    Ex tempore - RevisedTHE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOMMON LAW DIVISIONADAMS JFRIDAY 19 DECEMBER 200370216/02 - REGINA v WAI MAN LO70044/02 - REGINA v KA KAN CHANSENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 22 May 2001 Wai Kit (usually known as Ricky) Lo and David Ng entered the office area of Market City Tavern where they knew Mr Nigel Stiffe, the Tavern's manager, counted the Tavern's cash takings. They were armed with a pole from a dismantled shopping trolley, a knife and a gun. In the course of the armed robbery that then ensued Mr Stiffe was murdered. Ricky Lo and David Ng have been given heavy sentences in respect of these offences.  
     
      
    2 The police investigation following the murder soon identified Ricky Lo as a suspect and he was placed under surveillance.  
     
      
    3 Ricky Lo is the offender, Wai Man Lo's, younger brother. In late June 2001 police went to Ricky Lo's home several times in an attempt to locate him. They were told by both the offender and his mother that they did not know where Ricky was and they had not seen him for some time. This was not true. On 28 June 2001 the offender was in the company of Ricky Lo, their mother and Simon Chan at a restaurant. He, Chan and Ricky then went to a travel agency where Chan brought airline tickets for Ricky. On 3 July, the next day, Ricky Lo was arrested at Sydney International Airport with airline tickets to Manila. He was interviewed by police and admitted his involvement in the armed robbery and murder of Mr Stiffe. 
     
      
    4 About ten hours after Ricky Lo's arrest, the police arrested the offender, Wai Man Lo. He told police, in substance, that he suspected his brother was involved in the robbery and murder because he knew he had previously worked at the Tavern and was desperate for money. His suspicions then increased when Ricky told him he had done something bad and asked him for help. Ricky then disappeared for a few days and called the offender from Queensland to let him know he was all right. Shortly after he returned from Queensland he again told the offender that he had done something bad and asked for his help, though he denied that he had been involved in the Market City Tavern robbery. Later, he told the offender that there was a knife under his bed and asked him to get rid of it and later that day the offender retrieved the knife, put it in a plastic bag and threw it in a garbage bin in Canada Bay. He said that he did so because he did not want his brother to be involved in any more trouble and did not know, though, that it had been used in the robbery. His suspicions were allayed to some degree because his brother requested money, but they were confirmed on 28 June 2001 when the offender recognised his brother from a photograph taken from a CCTV camera at the Tavern, which was published in a newspaper article about the robbery. He contacted Ricky, who then admitted that he had taken part in the robbery. The offender admitted that he had given his brother $500 towards his overseas travel to the Philippines. 
     
      
    5 The offender pleaded guilty on 5 November 2003 to the crime of assisting Wai Kit Lo knowing that he had committed a robbery with on offensive weapon. This crime carries a maximum term of imprisonment of fourteen years. The Crown does not allege that the offender knew that his brother had murdered Mr Stiffe, although it is obvious that he must have known Mr Stiffe was killed in the course of the robbery. It is important to note, however, that it is not alleged the offender was ever aware of his brother's plan to rob the Tavern or that he got any of the proceeds or was rewarded in anyway for helping his brother. Accordingly, it is appropriate to approach the offender's culpability upon the basis that he acted out of a sense of family loyalty and had nothing whatever to gain from what he did. 
     
      
    6 The offender was born on 25 February 1975 and, accordingly, was twenty-six years old as at the date of the offence. He was born in Hong Kong and came to Australia with his family when he was one year old. His older brother was convicted of murder several years ago. The next oldest, the offender, took the role of the head of the family, his father having left some years before. I do not doubt that, in part, his role impelled him to assist Ricky, whose plea for help he found himself, as his older brother, unable to resist. 
     
      
    7 The offender has no previous offences and has been in consistent full-time employment since leaving school with his higher school certificate. He has been with his current employer for something over two years and he is highly thought of. 
     
      
    8 I accept that the offender is genuinely sorry for his offence and he has manifested this contrition by his plea of guilty. The Crown accepts that this was done at the earliest practical opportunity and, accordingly, he is entitled to the twenty-five per cent discount referred to in The Queen v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309. 
     
      
    9 It was also relevant to note that, although the police were aware that the offender was keeping company with his brother, they would not have known, had he not told them, that he had disposed of the knife and given Ricky $500 to help him escape. Indeed, without his admissions to police it was very unlikely that any prosecution of the offender for the present offence could have succeeded. 
     
      
    10 The offender was placed in custody for five days after his arrest before he obtained bail and since then his freedom has been significantly affected by the conditions of his bail, which required him to report to police, at first daily and thereafter with somewhat less frequency. 
     
      
    11 I am satisfied that the offender's involvement in the present offence was an aberration in an otherwise law abiding and respectable life. There is significant evidence that supports this conclusion which it is unnecessary to detail and in respect of which a substantial allowance must be made. 
     
      
    12 The stress for his mother and the shame for the family, with having another brother in gaol together with his adoption of the role of head of the family, regrettably led the offender to agree to help his brother in his attempts to escape justice. I do not doubt that anyone in the offender's position would feel pulled in two directions when faced with the appalling dilemma of denying a younger brother help when he was faced with a lengthy prison term or breaking the law to help him escape. However, of course, the public interest requires citizens to turn their backs even on members of their own family when to help them means that they might avoid the law. 
     
      
    13 At the same time, justice requires fair acknowledgment of the moral dilemma faced by this offender who was otherwise completely innocent of wrongdoing, was not motivated by any desire for gain and whose life was a decent and honourable one. 
     
      
    14 The Crown prosecutor has conceded that the court would not fall into an appealable error if a term of full-time imprisonment was not imposed.  
     
      
    15 Taking into account all these matters the Court imposes a sentence of twelve months imprisonment to commence on 18 December 2003. I order that the whole of the sentence be suspended and the offender be released from custody on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for a term of twelve months. 
     
      
    16 The offender Ka Kan Chan is a close family friend of the Lo's, having gone to school with two of the boys. He was staying with them in May 2001. He was then thirty-one years of age. Whilst with the family he became aware that Ricky Lo was involved in the robbery at the Market City Tavern. He is charged with, and has pleaded guilty to, failing to report that knowledge to police. That crime carries a maximum term of imprisonment in the present circumstances of two years. 
     
      
    17 It is obvious that the offence may be committed in a wide range of circumstances. In my view the culpability of this offender is distinctly at the lower end of the scale and it was actuated by his feelings of loyalty, not so much towards Ricky Lo, but to the family that had taken him in and given him considerable support over the years. 
     
      
    18 The offender, however, kept company with Ricky whilst he was avoiding police and was present when he applied for a passport and bought his ticket for Manila. Most significantly, however, on the night before the anticipated departure he suggested to Ricky that he should give himself up to police, a conversation recorded by electronic surveillance. 
     
      
    19 The offender appears otherwise to have been of good character. He has been hard working and has a family of his own. He spent some five days in custody until he was released on bail, the conditions of which required frequent reporting to police. To a person of otherwise good character an obligation of this kind is a significant intrusion into their freedom and a reminder of the culpability of the criminal behaviour with which they have been charged. 
     
      
    20 Numerous members of the community have provided references commending the offender's honesty, trustworthiness and good character. I consider that his offence should be regarded as a momentary lapse rather than an act of significant criminal culpability. I am satisfied that the offender is contrite. He also pleaded guilty at the earliest practicable opportunity and in sentence would be entitled to the twenty-five per cent discount to which The Queen v Thomson and Houlton adverted. 
     
      
    21 In the result I have decided that it is not appropriate to sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment. Accordingly, I order that he enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for the term of twelve months and that he pay a fine of $1,500. The fine is to be paid within seven days of today.

    1 LEVINE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Barr J.  
     
      
    2 BARR J: Jeremy Kenneth Piltz appeals against convictions recorded in the District Court and seeks leave to appeal against the resulting sentences. He stood trial before a jury and was found guilty on charges that may be summarised as follows- 
     
      
       
        
        1. That on 6 September 2001 at Lismore he detained Deborah Anne Host with intent to hold her for advantage; 
        
       
       
        
        2. That at the same time and place he assaulted the same complainant and committed an act of indecency upon her;  
        
       
       
        
        3. That at the same time and place he assaulted the same complainant and committed an act of indecency upon her; and 
        
       
       
        
        4. That at the same time and place he possessed a loaded firearm so as to endanger the life of another person.  
        
       
      
    3 Judge Blackmore of Senior Counsel sentenced the appellant as follows- 
     
      
       
        
        On the second and third counts concurrent terms of imprisonment for two years commencing on 6 September 2001 and expiring on 5 September 2003. A non-parole period of eighteen months was fixed. 
        
       
       
        
        On the first count imprisonment for a term of eight years commencing on 6 September 2002 and expiring on 5 September 2010. A non-parole period of five years was fixed. 
        
       
       
        
        On the fourth count imprisonment for a fixed term of four years commencing on 6 September 2002 and expiring on 5 September 2006. 
        
       
      
    4 The effective result was a head sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years. 
     
      
    5 The facts were summarised by his Honour in the remarks on sentence in the following way- 
     
      
       
        
        All of the offences involve the victim Deborah Host. On 6 September 2001 Miss Host went to the offender’s premises to deliver a video. She had done that before. The video apparently contained some Christian message on the topic of hope. Both the offender and the complainant regularly attended the Presbyterian Church at Lismore. The complainant was also involved in a Christian group at high school and the videos were used by that group. The offender assisted the group by editing those videos. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The visit to his house was planned, either she or her then fiancé having contacted the offender prior to that day. When she met the offender at the doorway he told her that his mother wanted to speak to her for a second and by that means lured her into the house. She walked into the house and said, “Where is she?” The offender closed the door and she heard a clicking sound. She turned around and saw that he was pointing a gun at her. She said that he used a lever on the gun whilst it was pointed at her. She said she did not know anything about guns. She said it was held at shoulder level. 
         
         
        Miss Host asked the offender what he was doing and he said that he just wanted to talk to her. She said “I can’t talk with a gun in my face”. She moved forward to grab the barrel of the gun and push it up. Then there was some lengthy conversation and interaction between the two whilst they were in the hallway. During that conversation the offender relinquished the gun for a short period of time. The complainant also said she wanted to go home and the offender said she could go soon. For a time they were seated in the hallway. At that time he asked her then to go into the bedroom. She did not want to go but he insisted. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        When they were inside the bedroom they walked to the other side of the partition that was in his room. He showed her some photos of a girl and rolled up his sleeve and showed her some scars on his arm. He said that showed how he loved that girl. The complainant said that she backed out of the door of the bedroom and started for the front door but the offender stood in front of the door and said, “You can’t go yet”. He said that he wanted to see a lady one last time. She said “I am not a lady, I am just a child”. He said “You’ve got everything”. She said she wanted to go and he said no, and said “What if I do this?” and then he pulled out a knife. He put the knife to her throat. She made a noise and tried to get it away from her throat. There was a struggle and they fell to the floor. During that struggle she got control of the knife and said she could have stabbed him but she knew it was wrong. The offender eventually got control of the gun and pointed it directly at her. He said, “Before I asked you to take them off, now I am going to tell you to take them off”. He ordered her back into the bedroom. He went to the video camera which was in the bedroom as if to turn it on and she said “no” and he said “okay”. He then told her to take her clothes off. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Once she was undressed he was looking her up and down and then produced some handcuffs and told her to put them on tight. She put them on loosely so he tightened them. He then ordered her to lie on the bed and he started touching her body. He then touched her buttocks and tried to reach around and touched her on the breast. After the offender had touched her when she was lying on her front he ordered her to roll over on to her back. He then commenced to rub his hands up and down her leg and rubbed his hand over her vagina area and then moved his hands up and was feeling her breasts. He was kneeling over her at this time. 
         
         
        After he had been touching her for a time there was a noise at the door. It was the offender’s mother coming home. He ordered the complainant to be quiet and went out to speak to his mother. His mother told him she would like to see Deborah before she left. The complainant and the offender’s mother had been quite friendly in the past. The offender came back and ordered the complainant to dress and come out. When the complainant came out she spoke to the offender’s mother and then she left. 
        
       
       
        
        She went directly to her church minister’s house. He observed her to be in a very distressed state. She immediately complained to him in terms largely consistent with her evidence. The matter was then reported to the police. 
        
       
       
        
        Later in the day the police approached the offender’s home. Because they believed he possessed a loaded firearm the State Protection Group was called to handle the arrest. Ultimately the offender left the house without any violence. The police searched the house at the invitation of the offender’s mother. They found a number of items that were relevant to the offence. They found a loaded rifle in the offender’s bedroom, two sets of handcuffs, a video camera on a tripod facing the offender’s bed. In addition they found a number of items of a bizarre nature. They found bowls of blood and rifle cartridges apparently with people’s names written on them. There was also some of the offender’s writing that appeared to be of a religious nature. The offender declined the opportunity for an interview with police.  
        
       
       
      
    6 The first ground of appeal is expressed as follows- 
     
      
       
        
        That his Honour erred in permitting the count of possess firearm with intent to endanger life to go to the jury. 
        
       
      
    7 This ground relates to the fourth count, the precise terms of which were not as stated in the ground but were as follows- 
     
      
       
        
        And the Director of Public Prosecutions further charges that Jeremy Kenneth Piltz on 6 September 2001 at Lismore in the State of New South Wales possessed a loaded firearm at 9 Cromer Street so as to endanger the life of another person. 
        
       
      
    8 This count was laid under s93G(1)(a)(ii) of the Crimes Act. The section is as follows- 
     
      
       
        
        (1)Any person who:  
         
        (a) possesses a loaded firearm or loaded spear gun:  
         
          
          (i) in a public place, or 
           
            
            (ii) in any other place so as to endanger the life of any other person, or 
            
           
          
         
        (b) fires a firearm or spear gun in or near a public place, or 
         
          
          (c) carries or fires a firearm or spear gun in a manner likely to injure, or endanger the safety of, himself or herself or any other person or any property, or with disregard for the safety of himself or herself or any other person, 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
          
        is liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the purposes of this section:  
         
          
          (a) a firearm is to be regarded as being loaded if there is ammunition:  
           
          (i) in its chamber or barrel, or 
           
            
            (ii) in any magazine or other device which is in such a position that the ammunition can be fitted into its chamber or barrel by operation of some other part of the firearm, and 
            
           
          (b) a spear gun is to be regarded as being loaded if a spear, or an instrument or thing similar to a spear, is fitted to it. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) A person is not guilty of an offence under this section for possessing or doing anything referred to in subsection (1) if the person satisfies the court that he or she had a reasonable excuse for possessing it or doing it or possessed it or did it for a lawful purpose. 
         
        
       
      
    9 I note the inconsistency between the words of this ground of appeal – with intent to endanger life – and the words of subpara (1)(a)(ii) – so as to endanger the life of another person. 10 During closing addresses counsel took the opportunity upon an adjournment to raise with his Honour directions that were desired. Defence counsel said this about the fourth count- 
     
      
       
        
        Your Honour, the concern that I wished to raise was that clearly the section adds an element to offences under the Firearms Act legislation, that is so as to endanger life aspect. It’s my submission to your Honour that that aspect is clearly an aspect of the matter which, given the penalty, may be considered – your Honour might consider requires full mens rea, that is, that there is shown to be an awareness on the part of the accused person that the conduct concerned is such as to endanger life, or, if that not be the case, that there be at the very least recklessness in that regard. 
        
       
      
    11 His Honour told the jury that the Crown had to prove two elements to succeed on the fourth count. The first was that at the asserted time and place the accused possessed a loaded firearm. The second was that such possession was so as to endanger the life of another person. No issue arose at trial or arises on appeal about the first element, and I can pass over what his Honour said about it. As to the second, his Honour said this- 
     
      
       
        
        The second element requires that you be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that when the accused possessed the loaded firearm he did  
        (so) 
         so as to endanger the life of another person. In this case the other person clearly is the complainant. Further, I instruct you that to endanger someone’s life is to put his or her life in peril. It is not necessary that the gun be actually discharged or that someone was killed or injured. What must be established is that there was a real risk to someone’s life and in this case the complainant’s life…  
        
       
      
    12 His Honour then summarised the evidence, reminding the jury that the Crown case was that the danger or risk was constituted by the accused’s having pointed a loaded gun at the complainant at close quarters. 
     
      
    13 It was submitted on appeal that s93G requires that the possession of the firearm be with the intention to endanger life. Secondly, it was submitted that the evidence was not capable of establishing that the firearm was in a condition to endanger life.  
     
      
    14 Whether an accused person in possessing a firearm intends to endanger life does not seem to depend necessarily upon the answer to the question whether the firearm is capable of endangering life. An accused person might have the state of mind contended for but act upon a mistaken belief about the quality of the firearm possessed. However that may be, two questions seem to have been raised under this ground. 
     
      
    15 The first is whether the section requires the intent contended for. Counsel for the applicant put forward no authority in support of the submission. 
     
      
    16 The principles of construction require the words in a statute to be given the meaning intended by the legislature. Ordinarily this will correspond with the grammatical meaning of the words as they appear. Regard must be had to the context, the consequences of a literal or a grammatical construction and the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute: Hardman v The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2003] NSWCA 130; Project Blue Sky Inc & Ors v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355. 
     
      
    17 In Hardman v The Director of Public Prosecutions the Court of Appeal considered s93G. The issue in that case was not directly relevant to the present appeal but it was convenient for the Court to deal with the purposes of the legislation which, the Court said, were to strike a fair and reasonable balance between safeguarding the community from firearms misuse and providing reasonable though stringent controls for those that wish legitimately to use and possess firearms (second reading speech, Legislative Assembly, 2 March 1989, Hansard 5605.5) 
     
      
    18 S93G concerns itself with possession of a loaded firearm either in a public place or in any other place so as to endanger the life of any other person. In Hardman v The Director of Public Prosecutions the Court was concerned with the question whether the defendant was at the relevant time in a public place: see subpara (1)(a)(i). There was no suggestion or finding in that case that it was an essential element of the offence that the defendant knew that he was in a public place or intended to be in a public place. It followed that the test for what constituted a public place was to be determined objectively. 
     
      
    19 Subpara 93G(1)(a)(ii), under which this charge was brought, creates a similar offence. The same maximum penalty applies to each offence. To read into subpara (ii) a requirement that a defendant has to be proved to have intended to endanger the life of any other person would raise an inconsistency between the elements of the offences created by the two subparagraphs. In the second there would be a requirement that an offender must have intended to have endanger a life whereas under the first the Crown would not have to show that the offender intended to possess the firearm in a public place. 
     
      
    20 Moreover, subs (3) provides a defence where the defendant shows that he or she had a reasonable excuse for the possession in the circumstances or carried out a relevant act for a lawful purpose. A defence of reasonable excuse is consistent with the possession of a loaded firearm which incidentally endangers life but inconsistent with an intent to endanger life. 21 My last reason for concluding that this ground of appeal has not been made good is that the Parliament could easily have said that the relevant intent was necessary to constitute the offence, yet it did not. One can compare numerous sections in the same Act which expressly require proof of a particular intent or state of mind. By way of example only, s33 deals with the wounding, infliction of grievous bodily harm or the discharge of loaded arms with intent, among other things, to do grievous bodily harm. S33A deals with the discharge of loaded arms with intent to do grievous bodily harm. S33B deals, among other things, with the possession of an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence or to prevent lawful apprehension or detention. Each such section makes clear by its terms that the relevant intent must be proved. Unlike s93G, none uses the formula “so as to” lead to the relevant result.  
     
      
    22 The second question that seems to arise is based upon an implied assertion that the verdict on the fourth count is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: Criminal Appeal Act s6. In my opinion there was abundant evidence upon which the jury were entitled to find the accused guilty on this count. It was the complainant’s evidence that the appellant pointed the gun at her and told her that it was loaded. Not long after the police were called they searched the appellant’s house and found the firearm with a round in the breach. The firearm had a safety catch and the evidence left it uncertain whether at the relevant time the catch was released, but in my opinion the jury were not thereby disentitled from concluding that the complainant’s life was endangered. The appellant always denied the incident and gave sworn evidence to the same effect, but the jury were entitled to reject his version as untrue. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion this ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
    24 The remaining grounds of appeal against conviction may be dealt with together. They are as follows- 
     
      
       
        
        2. That his Honour erred in not discharging the jury following the Crown Prosecutor’s address 
        
       
       
        
        3. That his Honour failed to adequately direct the jury as to the submissions of the Crown as to “why would the complainant lie?” 
        
       
      
    25 There was no application that his Honour discharge the jury, so leave is required to rely on the first of these grounds. 
     
      
    26 The evidence showed that the complainant was a young woman who was engaged to be married to a young man. The intended wedding was not far off. The complainant’s evidence was that she had never had any sexual interest in or relations with the appellant. The events she described were as unexpected as they were unwelcome. The appellant’s case was that although the complainant did visit his house on the day in question there was no violence and no use of a firearm or a knife as the complainant had said. Instead he and the complainant had consensual sexual intercourse, much as they had done on a number of occasions in the recent past. His case at trial was that the complainant had told this untrue story knowing that the appellant was likely to tell her fiancé about their relationship. So she intended falsely to conceal from her fiancé the fact that she had willingly engaged in sexual relations with the appellant and put an innocent complexion on the affair.  
     
      
    27 The problems with the defence were obvious. Why would the complainant have taken the trouble of complaining first to her minister if, calm and determined, she could have gone straight to the police to make her false report? Why would she tell a false story to the police at all if she might have hoped for a satisfactory result merely by keeping quiet? Other questions were raised as well, as the Crown Prosecutor told the jury. 28 During his closing address the Crown Prosecutor said this- 
     
      
       
        
        If I can just remind you, that we have to prove are the actual ingredients of the charges, that’s what we have to prove beyond reasonable doubt. We don’t have to prove what colour the car was that Deborah drove to the house for example or a number of other issues that are peripheral to the central issues in this trial, may be proved to you, they may not, they may assist you, they may not. We bear the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt, and you’ll hear that said more than once, but only in relation to the actual ingredients of the charges, which you have before you in the indictment. And if I can just remind you what I said in my opening remarks to you, the first count is detaining Deborah with intent to hold her for advantage to the accused. What I want to say to you in relation to all four counts is that if you accept Deborah’s evidence, all four counts are made out. That is the issue for you, as I said to you in my opening, the Crown case relies entirely on Deborah.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    29 The Crown Prosecutor then recited the facts which the Crown asserted giving rise to each count. He then observed that the complainant and the appellant had given versions which could not stand together and that neither had backed down. He spoke about the assessment of the credibility of witnesses. He continued- 
     
      
       
        
        And as I say to you, and I’ll say it again, we have to prove the case, we have to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that Deborah’s telling the truth. If you decide she’s not telling the truth, then obviously the accused is entitled to be acquitted. If you don’t know whether she’s telling the truth or not, again he’s entitled to be acquitted. If you in my submission to you, accept that she is telling the truth, that she’s a reliable, honest, accurate witness, then according to the oath you took it’s your obligation to convict the accused at the end of your deliberations.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
        What you have here obviously are two conflicting versions. You have the version given by the complainant, which is completely different to the version given by the accused. Again he’s under no obligation to prove anything to you. What I want to do is just ask you a few questions about the contents of her evidence and ask you the question why. Definitely not in such a way as to reverse the onus and suggest that you should be looking at the accused to explain why she would complain about those sorts of things, but to use these questions to assess her credibility in relation to the contents of her statement. Because the scenario that you have is that she did not want any sort of public revelation of the relationship between her and the accused. She didn’t want Simon or anybody else to find out. That’s the accused’s version.  
        
       
      
    30 The Crown Prosecutor asked why, then, the jury supposed that the complainant went to her minister and not to the police station. He dealt with that topic. In dealing with the appellant’s version he said this- 
     
      
       
        
        You have the evidence of how traumatised she was when she got there, that could’ve been made up. It’s a matter for you to determine that. If the accused’s version be accurate, and this was all malicious and all fictitious, and all to get back at him because he was going to tell Simon what was going on, and that she wasn’t traumatised by the violent physical assault upon her, easy, just go 
          
        to the police, you’re not traumatised, you’re not upset, you’re not worried, it’s something malicious, in the five minutes since you leave his house, you’ve decided you’re going to dob him in for some heinous crime, then you might think she might go straight to the police, but she didn’t, she went looking for support and sympathy. When you think about the version she’s given you, there’s just two things that she said to you which I’d ask you to think about very carefully. Assuming that her complete account is malicious and made up, why would she have the accused at the end of the episode saying he was sorry, and why when she was with the Crees would her primary concern be the safety and welfare of Mrs Piltz, why, unless what she said happened actually happened. I’d suggest to you that if she was making up a malicious complaint, they are not the sort of details that you would expect her to incorporate in this sobbing heartbroken account to the Crees. But she did, and she told you here the same thing. Her primary concern when they were discussing whether the police should be called, was not her own safety when she was in the arms of the Church, but the concern for the safety of Mrs Piltz. I suggest to you that speaks volumes about her credibility, and the believability of the story that she gave to the Crees and gave to you.  
        
       
      
    31 Later the Crown Prosecutor said this- 
     
      
       
        
        Now all the “whys” I’m asking you are not to criticise the accused, they’re to ask you to assess the credibility of the complainant. Look at the content of the evidence that she’s given you, the only possible reason you might think that all that is in there, is that it happened to her. She wouldn’t have struck you as being such a creative person that in five minutes she could make up the length and breadth and depth of detail that she gave the Crees and then gave the police the next day, is my submission to you.  
        
       
      
    32 The Crown Prosecutor told the jury repeatedly that it was for the Crown to prove its case. 
     
      
    33 There was an adjournment during the closing address of defence counsel. Counsel said this to his Honour- 
     
      
       
        
        O’CONNOR: 
         Your Honour there’s one other matter if it’s convenient for me to raise, your Honour given the Crown’s submissions relating to a variety of whys, I wonder whether your Honour might consider whether a direction in the terms of Justice Sperling’s direction in Jovanovic’s case might be appropriate.  
        
       
      
    34 Discussion followed. During his charge to the jury the trial judge said this- 
     
      
       
        
        It has been suggested in address to you that the accused cannot explain why the complainant lied. Let me make it clear for you if it is not already clear, that the accused does not have to explain why the complainant might have lied. He can only answer what he has done and what he knows. The accused in a criminal trial does not have to prove anything, the Crown always has the onus of proof upon it. 
        
       
      
    35 In R v Jovanovic (1997) 98 A Crim R 1 this Court was concerned with a state of affairs that often arises in sexual assault cases. Typically an uncorroborated complainant says on oath that the acts constituting the offence took place. Whether by evidence or otherwise, the accused denies those assertions. Sperling J, with whom Priestley JA agreed, said this at 17- 
     
      
       
        
        The gravamen of the question, Why would the complainant lie? is that is suggests an answer and is, therefore, in substance, a positive argument. The argument is that because there is no apparent reason for the complainant to lie, the complainant is likely to be telling the truth and should, therefore, be believed. The reasons why an invitation to follow this line of reasoning is illegitimate in a criminal trial were provided in  
        E 
         (1996) 39 NSWLR 450 at 461-466, and affirmed in  
        Uhrig 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal appeal, NSW, File No 60200, 24 October 1996). For a further illustration of the need to trim the sails of everyday thinking to the winds of the legal principle, see now  
        OGD 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, File No 60480 of 1996, 3 June 1997).  
        
       
       
        
        In  
        E 
         it was made clear that what was said in that case did not prevent argument or comment about a motive to lie on the part of a complainant, where there was direct evidence of an actual motive to lie or evidence from which a specific motive to lie could be reasonably inferred. It is to be noted, however, that any such argument or comment would be adverse to the complainant’s credibility. If the complainant had the alleged motive to lie, that would be a reason for discounting the complainant’s evidence. If the complainant did not have the alleged motive, the complainant’s credibility would be unaffected one way or the other by the lack of it: the complainant might have no motive to lie or an undisclosed motive to lie.  
        
       
      
    36 At 24 Sperling J suggested a form of words a trial judge might include in his charge to the jury, namely- 
     
      
       
        
        It would be natural to ask yourselves why the complainant, X, would make up such serious allegations against the accused. I give you the following directions about that question: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. As you have been told, the essential elements of the Crown case must be proved beyond reasonable doubt or the accused must be acquitted. If the case turns on the evidence of X, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that X has told the truth. 
           
          2. As you have been told, it is your duty to decide whether you accept the evidence of a witness in whole or in part. X is no exception to that. 
           
          3. It would be wrong to conclude that X is telling the truth because there is no apparent reason, in your view, for X to lie. People lie for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it is apparent. Sometimes it is not. Sometimes the reason is discovered. Sometimes it is not. You cannot be satisfied that X is telling the truth merely because there is no apparent reason for X to have made up these allegations. There might be a reason for X to be untruthful that nobody knows about. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    37 The Court in Jovanovic drew a distinction between the case in which there are a simple assertion and denial and no more and the case in which the evidence is capable of showing that the complainant had a motive to lie. Obviously, when in any case it is suggested to the jury that the complainant had a motive to lie that is a matter with which the jury must concern itself. It must consider the strength of the motive. It must consider whether the actions of the complainant are consistent with it.  
     
      
    38 The present case was not one of simple assertion and denial. The defence was at some pains to advance before the jury the theory that the complainant must have lied because she feared that the appellant was going to tell her fiancé about their affair. Since she did not want him to believe that it was consensual she had to lie and say that it was not. Nothing that the Court said in Jovanovic prevented the exploration of the issues thereby raised.  
     
      
       
        
          
        
       
      
    39 Two complaints were made in this appeal. The first was that the damage done by the Crown Prosecutor’s address was incurable, so nothing short of a discharge was enough. In my opinion that complaint has not been made good. I do not say so merely because that idea did not occur to defence counsel. The asserted motive of the complainant to lie was very important to the jury’s consideration of the issues they had to decide. In my opinion the Crown was obliged to invite the jury critically to examine the consequences of the defence reliance on that asserted motive.  
     
      
    40 The second complaint, made in the alternative, was that if the damage was curable his Honour’s direction did not go far enough. It left out the substance of the third paragraph of the direction suggested by Sperling J. I think that there is no substance in that complaint. Obviously a direction of the kind contended for is appropriate to a case where no particular circumstances are pointed to as giving rise to a motive and the complainant to lie. This was not such a case.  
     
      
    41 In my opinion this ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    42 I would refuse leave to appeal on the second ground of appeal and would dismiss the third.  
     
      
    43 The appellant has sought leave to appeal against sentence. There is one submission, namely that the overall sentence and the non-parole period of six years was outside the range of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. It was submitted that the complainant had been released unharmed. There may be a question about that in view of the Victim Impact Statement, which gave some detail of the effect that the activities of the appellant had had upon the mind and emotional wellbeing of the complainant. 
     
      
    44 The sentencing judge found that the offences were at the more serious end of the range. It seems to me that his Honour was entitled to come to that view. There were very serious offences of their kind. The complainant was forced to strip naked and was handcuffed. In my opinion the sentences were well within his Honour’s sentencing discretion and I think that the application in relation to sentence also fails.45 I propose the following orders- 
     
      
       
        
        1.  
        Dismiss the appeal against conviction;

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: I agree with the judgment of Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: The appellant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing six counts. Also arraigned on that indictment were two co-accused, Anthony Melan and John Claude Rahme. The first count on the indictment alleged that on 22 July 2000 the three accused, armed with a dangerous weapon, being a revolver, robbed Mark Allen of certain property including a silver necklace. The second count alleged that on the same date the accused Rahme demanded money with menaces from Mark Allen. The third count alleged that on or about 22 July 2000 the accused Melan had sexual intercourse with KB, who was above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, being 15 years of age. The fourth count alleged that the appellant on or about the same date had sexual intercourse with KB who was then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, being 15 years of age. The fifth count alleged that on or about 27 July 2000 Rahme had sexual intercourse with KB who was then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, being 15 years of age. The sixth count alleged that between 21 July 2000 and 29 July 2000 Rahme supplied a prohibited drug, methylamphetamine. 
     
      
    4 After a trial before Acting Judge Stewart and a jury, guilty verdicts were returned on the first, second, fifth and sixth counts. The jury were unable to agree upon the remaining two counts, including the count alleging that the appellant had sexual intercourse with KB. 
     
      
    5 On 8 November 2002 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years and 4 months to date from 11 January 2002. His Honour specified a non-parole period of 4 years, to expire on 10 January 2006. This Court was informed that, although the appellant had lodged an application for leave to appeal against sentence, that matter was not ready to proceed on the hearing date of the appeal because of some administrative difficulty, being no fault of the appellant. The parties agreed that the Court would proceed to hear the appeal against conviction and the parties would file written submissions in respect of the appeal against sentence. Submissions were received from the appellant on 25 November 2003 and from the Crown on 26 November. Neither party sought to make oral submissions to the Court in respect of the sentence appeal. 
     
      
    6 The grounds of appeal against conviction are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        A. His Honour was in error in failing to sever the counts relating to the incident at Richie Benaud Park from the subsequent incidents relating to the sexual intercourse charge and supply drug charge at various hotels in Parramatta. 
         
         
        B. His Honour failed to give the jury any or any proper directions about the restrictions on the use, if any, to which they could put evidence led in support of one count in any other count. 
         
         
        C. His Honour failed to give the jury any directions about the use to which they could put evidence led against the appellant of uncharged criminal acts. 
         
         
        D. His Honour was in error in failing to discharge the jury on 17 July after [BK] gave evidence that ""after they got back they said that they were going to kill us"". 
         
         
        E. His Honour was in error in failing to stop the cross-examination of [MH] by the Crown Prosecutor from which the implication arose that the appellant had supplied drugs to her. 
         
         
        F. The Crown Prosecutor's conduct of the trial was sufficiently unfair and inappropriate to cause the trial to have miscarried. 
         
         
        
       
      
    7 There had been a previous trial of the appellant and his co-accused before the same judge and a jury but that trial had been aborted before verdict. It was agreed between the parties that rulings made by acting Judge Stewart during the course of that trial would apply to the second trial. One ruling made by the trial judge was a refusal to order separate trials of the various allegations in the indictment. That ruling is the subject of the first ground of appeal. In order to understand that complaint and the other grounds of appeal it is necessary to outline the facts of the Crown case, but not in any great detail. There were some discrepancies and inconsistencies in the accounts given by the Crown witnesses of the events giving rise to the charges but they are of no importance for the determination of the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    8 On 21 July 2000 a young man, Mark Allen, and three females, KB, BK and BU, each of whom was aged 15 years at the time, met by chance another group of young persons at Pennant Hills. The second group consisted of one female, Michelle Hoy, and three males, who can be referred to as “Richo”, “Ricky and “Phil”. The two groups decided to travel together in the one vehicle owned by a member of the second group to a public park in Parramatta named Belmore Park or Richie Benaud Oval. 
     
      
    9 Before they reached the park, KB, BK and BU smoked cannabis and each took a tablet that they believed to be ecstasy. They had purchased these tablets from Richo shortly after they met him. Mark Allen also consumed cannabis and alcohol on the way to the park. Just after midnight Ms Hoy telephoned the appellant and arranged to meet him at the park. 
     
      
    10 Shortly after Mark Allen and the rest of the group arrived at the park, the appellant and Rahme turned up in a motor vehicle. A short time later Melan arrived in another vehicle. Ms Hoy and Richo were at that time sitting on a log fence that surrounded the park and the remaining six members of the group were still in the vehicle in which they had travelled to the park. The appellant briefly spoke to Ms Hoy and then joined Rahme and Melan. 
     
      
    11 The appellant and Rahme approached the vehicle in which the group was sitting and each produced a firearm. The appellant’s weapon was described as small and silver: BK said that it was a .22 Phoenix automatic. Rahme’s weapon was described as a revolver. Rahme ordered the group to remove their valuables and to leave the vehicle. The three girls and Allen were searched and items of property taken from them. The appellant then searched through the vehicle and found a mobile phone that Allen had hidden. Allen was wearing a chain and pendant around his neck. When the appellant asked what it was, Allen removed it and gave it to him. The appellant kept the chain but returned the pendant. The contents of Allen’s wallet were also taken. 
     
      
    12 The robbery of Mark Allen gave rise to the first count on the indictment. There was no charge in relation to the alleged robbery of the three girls. 
     
      
    13 Rahme demanded that Allen disclose his PIN number. Allen told him a number but it proved to be false when one of the other two men tried to access the account. Rahme then threatened Allen with his firearm and demanded that he produce $2,000 or $3,000 the next day. He made threats about what would happen to Allen and his family if he failed to produce the money by midday. Rahme gave Allen a piece of paper with a telephone number that Allen was to ring after he obtained the money. When Allen said he would not be able to produce such a large sum, Rahme held the revolver to his head. 
     
      
    14 At about this time, the appellant discharged his weapon. There was conflicting evidence as to where it was discharged and how many shots were fired. Rahme’s threats to Allen gave rise to the second count in the indictment but there was no charge laid against the appellant for any involvement he may have had in the intimidation of Allen by Rahme. This was notwithstanding evidence given of his participation by threatening Allen with his weapon at the time the demands were made by Rahme. 
     
      
    15 Rahme then said to the three girls, “Why are you hanging around with these losers? You’d better come with us”. BK, KB, and BU went with the appellant and Melan in one vehicle and Rahme left in the other vehicle by himself. Before they entered Melan’s vehicle, Ms Hoy had told the girls that the three men would not hurt them but she gave them the number of her mobile telephone number in case they became frightened. Each of the girls gave evidence that they went with the men because they were scared. 
     
      
    16 Allen went with Richo to Bondi Beach where they waited until daylight. Fearing that Rahme would make good his threats, Allen spent the day walking around Castle Hill and did not return to his home until the next day, 23 July. 
     
      
    17 In the meantime Melan and the appellant took the three girls to the Courtyard Marriott Hotel in Parramatta where Melan rented a room. The appellant, Melan and the girls were joined later in the room by Rahme who brought a container filled with what the girls were told were drugs. He invited the girls to have some and they did so. While they were in the company of the three men, the girls used drugs, both in powder and tablet form, supplied by Rahme on a number of occasions. On his arrest Rahme was found to have a snorter and a plastic bag containing amphetamine powder in the pocket of his pants. His supply of drugs to the three girls gave rise to the sixth count in the indictment. 
     
      
    18 On one occasion while they were at the hotel, Melan ordered KB to run a bath and then to get into it. She complied and was then joined in the bath by Melan. KB alleged that she was required to perform fellatio on Melan in the bath and later while he sat on the toilet seat. This allegation gave rise to the third count in the indictment upon which the jury could not agree on a verdict. 
     
      
    19 KB also alleged that the appellant ordered her to perform fellatio on him. This incident occurred when the appellant was lying naked on a bed in the hotel room. BU was also lying on the bed at the time. KB said she complied with the appellant’s demand because she was in fear arising from the presence of firearms in the room and also because of her drug-induced state. This allegation gave rise to the fourth count in the indictment upon which the jury could not agree on a verdict.  
     
      
    20 Over the next week, BK and KB stayed with the appellant, Melan and Rahme at four different hotels in Parramatta. BU left the group on Sunday 23 July but did not tell anybody of the whereabouts of the other two girls. She said that she was not permitted to leave on the Saturday. 
     
      
    21 On the night of 27 July KB, BK and the three men were staying in a room at the Pacific International Hotel in Parramatta booked in the name of “Rahma”. KB alleged that while Rahme was lying naked on the bed, he sprinkled some powder, which she believed was amphetamine, on his penis. He then ordered her to suck it off. KB gave evidence that she felt she had to comply with this demand because of the presence of firearms in the room. BU gave evidence that Rahme wore a holster on his waist and often played with the gun while lying on the bed. This incident gave rise to the fifth count on the indictment. 
     
      
    22 On one occasion the two girls were taken to a shopping mall and given money by Rahme to buy clothes, provided that they were black. They were allowed to leave the company of the three men but told to return to a designated meeting place in an hour. BK gave evidence that the appellant was carrying a weapon at this time. The girls returned to the place as arranged and left with the three men returning to the hotel room. The girls gave evidence that they did so because they believed that the three men were keeping them under surveillance.  
     
      
    23 On Friday 28 July BK telephoned a friend and asked if she could arrange to have her and KB picked up from the hotel. At about 8 pm that evening police went to the room at the Pacific International Hotel and found the two girls. KB said, “Can we get out of here quick, can we go?” The police removed the girls to Castle Hill Police Station where they were interviewed and then returned to the care of their parents. They were described as being tired, distressed and affected by drugs. At about 10pm that evening police returned to the hotel room and arrested the appellant, Rahme and Melan. A loaded .22 revolver was found under a lounge on which Rahme had been sitting. Some loose ammunition was also located. Rahme admitted that the gun belonged to him. Police also located tablets and powder, later found to contain methylamphetamine. Rahme also admitted ownership of these drugs. 
     
      
    24 KB was medically examined. Traces of amphetamine and methylamphetamine were found in her urine sample. She had an ulcer in her mouth that was consistent with having performed acts of fellatio. 
     
      
    25 The appellant did not give evidence but called Ms Hoy as a witness in relation to the events at Richie Benaud Oval. He also called evidence of his good character. It was his case that no robbery had taken place and that he did not have a gun. Ms Hoy’s evidence was that she saw no person with a gun at the park nor did she see any of the men threatening anybody, including Mark Allen. She said that the three girls went with the men willingly. As one of the grounds of appeal relates to the cross-examination of this witness by the Crown Prosecutor I will return to her evidence in more detail later. 
     
      
    26 In respect of the allegation of sexual assault contained in the fourth count on the indictment, the appellant’s case was that KB had consented to intercourse and that he believed on reasonable grounds that she was over the age of 16 years. If the appellant had proved these facts, they would have provided him with a defence to the charge, see s 77(2) of the Crimes Act (now repealed but current at the time of the incidents giving rise to the counts in the indictment). It was the appellant’s case that the girls were always free to leave the hotels and return home if they wished to do so. 
     
      
       
      Ground A Refusal to grant separate trials 
      
    27 As has already been indicated, there was an unsuccessful application made by the defence before the trial commenced that the counts relating to the alleged incidents at Richie Benaud Oval be separated from the counts relating to the incidents at the hotels involving allegations of sexual offences and the supply of drugs. The trial judge in the exercise of his discretion refused the application. There was no attempt to seek leave to appeal against that determination under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    28 The question before this Court is now, not so much whether the trial judge’s discretion miscarried, but whether in light of all that happened during the course of the trial there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of the joint trial of the various allegations raised by the counts in the indictment. Even had the trial judge’s decision to refuse the application been correct at the time it was made, it does not follow that this Court should not review that decision in light of the evidence and issues that arose during the course of the trial: R v Guldur (1986) 8 NSWLR 12 at 15; Verma (1987) 30 A Crim R 441. Of course, the present appeal is concerned with the appellant’s conviction for armed robbery and whether that conviction may have been rendered unsafe by the admission of evidence relating to the incidents that happened thereafter and the further allegations made by the three girls of what transpired at the hotels in the week following. 
     
      
    29 This ground of appeal is closely bound up with the second ground of appeal contending that his Honour failed to direct the jury as to the relevance of the evidence led in respect of the various counts and what use they either could or could not make of the evidence relating to one count when considering another count on the indictment. Clearly, if there is a likelihood that the jury might misapply evidence relating to one count when dealing with another, careful directions are required to address that possibility. It may be the case that so great is the risk of unfair prejudice flowing from a joint trial of separate, though related, allegations that no direction, warning or caution may be sufficient to ensure a fair trial of each allegation. In such a case a separate trial will be the only remedy. 
     
      
    30 On the hearing of the separate trial application the Crown Prosecutor described the evidence of what happened at Richie Benaud Oval as “background” evidence to the allegations concerned with the incidents at the hotels that gave rise to the third to sixth counts. With respect, to describe the evidence of the activities of the appellants and his co-accused at the park in this way would be a very significant underestimation of the probative value of the evidence. 
     
      
    31 The concept of evidence admitted as “background” to the charges in the indictment has generally been considered in the context of sexual assault trials and the admissibility of uncharged acts of criminality of a similar kind to that alleged in the indictment, see generally Gipp v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 and R v TAB [2002] NSWCCA 274 where the various authorities were considered in detail. It is generally accepted that such evidence can be admitted to give context to the particular allegations set out in the counts in the indictment to assist the jury to understand the evidence of the complainant in respect of the particular allegations upon which the accused stands trial. However, because of the risk of prejudice arising from the introduction of such evidence, limits may be placed upon the scope of the material admitted for that purpose and directions may be required to ensure that the jury understands its relevance. If the evidence cannot provide relevant context, it is not admissible; R v Marsh [2000] NSWCCA 370. 
     
      
    32 But the evidence of what happened at Richie Benaud Oval was not evidence of this nature. It did not simply provide a context or background to the allegations arising from the subsequent behaviour of the appellant and his co-accused. Rather it was highly relevant to an issue that was fundamental to the determination of the allegations contained in the third to fifth counts on the indictment; that is whether the complainant was consenting to the acts of fellatio in the hotel rooms. The issue of consent was relevant because it was part of the defence being raised by the appellant and his co-accused to the sexual assault counts. The defence did not dispute that the acts of sexual intercourse alleged by the complainant occurred. 
     
      
    33 The events in the park were critical to the jury’s consideration of the circumstances in which the three girls left with the three men and this in turn was significant to the jury’s assessment of the circumstances in which KB remained with the appellant and his co-accused for a period of almost a week at different hotels. The allegations of threats of violence, and the use of firearms at the park involved in the first and second counts on the indictment were part of the circumstances relied upon by the Crown as evidence rebutting the anticipated defence that the complainant was consenting to sexual intercourse with each of the accused. 
     
      
    34 In my view there was a connected series of events commencing with the meeting of the two groups at Pennant Hills and ending with the police finding BK and KB in the hotel room. The parties never suggested otherwise. The dispute was about the nature of those events, and, in particular, what occurred at the park that resulted in the three girls leaving with three men whom they had just met there. A jury could not have determined the issues arising from the third to fifth counts without resolving the facts in dispute concerning the events at Richie Benaud Oval. I accept the Crown’s submissions that the allegations of the threats of violence to Mark Allen, the armed robbery of him, and the use of firearms by Rahme and the appellant would have been admissible on a trial of the sexual offences even had the first and second counts not been before the jury. 
     
      
    35 Mr Golding, who appeared for the appellant, acknowledged that the circumstances in which KB left the park with the appellant and Melan was relevant to the issue of consent arising from the fourth count. But he submitted that the admission of this evidence gave rise to a significant issue which involved the jury considering a highly prejudicial and irrelevant matter, being the circumstances in which the other two girls, BK and BU, came to leave the park with the appellant and Melan and whether their wills were also overborne. The argument was that, as BK and BU were not the subject of any count in the indictment, whatever happened to them at the park and their states of mind were irrelevant to any of the charges before the jury.  
     
      
    36 Further, Mr Golding argued that there were at least five considerations that ought to have led to a separate trial of the counts arising from the events at the park from those arising from events at the hotels. These were set out in the written submissions filed for the appellant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “They included whether and/or which aspects of: 
         
         
        (a) the evidence relating to the armed robbery was probative of any of the counts alleging sexual activity against [KB]; 
         
         
        (b) the evidence relating to the sexual activity was probative of the armed robbery count; 
         
         
        (c) the evidence of the kidnapping of [BU] and [BK] was probative of any of the counts in the indictment; 
         
         
        (d) the evidence of the ordeals suffered by [BU] and [BK] at the hotels or the park was probative of any of the counts in the indictment; 
         
         
        (e) the evidence of the supply of drugs was relevant to the armed robbery count.” 
        
       
      
    37 Prima facie the Crown was entitled to indict the appellant and his co-accused as it did. This follows, in my view, from the fact that all the counts arose from a connected set of circumstances. See Criminal Procedure Act s 29. The events at the park were clearly relevant to the issues arising from the third to fifth counts. The sixth count, supplying of drugs by Rahme, was also relevant to the issues arising on those counts. It does not follow that, simply because the events giving rise to the third to sixth counts had no, or little, relevance to the first two counts, there should be a separate trial of those counts. A trial judge would be entitled to sever the indictment only where the joinder of any of the counts could result in an unfair trial of some other count on the indictment. 
     
      
    38 I would not be prepared to accept the proposition that the events occurring after the girls had left the park were totally irrelevant to a consideration of what happened in the park. If the jury concluded that there was a possibility that the girls freely went with the appellant and Melan and then agreed to stay with them in the hotels and participate in sexual activity, such a finding would necessarily raise a doubt about whether their allegations of threats and the use of weapons in the park were true. Nor was the evidence of the possession of weapons during the week when the girls were in the company of the three men irrelevant to the allegations of the use of firearms at the park. 
     
      
    39 It seems to me that the allegations in the different counts in the indictment were inextricably bound together and it would have been unrealistic to have them decided separately and independently by different juries. On the other hand, I find it difficult to see how the jury could misuse the evidence relating to the sexual assault count in determining the armed robbery count, such that the appellant was deprived of a fair trial on that count. The allegations made by the girls were either accepted by the jury to the relevant standard or they were not. 
     
      
    40 There is, in my opinion, no merit in the complaint made about the admission of the evidence of BU and BK. They were witnesses to the events the subject of the counts in the indictment and the Crown was required to call them. While evidence of their states of mind at any particular time was not decisive of the state of mind of the complainant at that point in time, their evidence was clearly relevant as to the surrounding facts and circumstances which were relevant to an assessment of KB’s state of mind. It does not seem to me to matter that the Crown might have laid charges against the appellant or his co-accused in respect of their allegations but chose not to do so. Their evidence does not become irrelevant to the charges the Crown determined to bring against the appellant simply because of a failure of the Crown to charge all the offences that were open on their evidence. The evidence of BU and BK as to the circumstances in which they accompanied the appellant and Melan and stayed with them in the hotels was relevant to a consideration of the circumstances in which KB went and stayed with the appellant and his co-accused. 
     
      
    41 Throughout the appellant’s arguments before this Court there ran an underlying assertion that the Crown either could not, or should not, lead evidence of conduct that might have amounted to a criminal offence unless that offence was charged. Hence there was a complaint that the Crown asserted that the three girls were taken and held against their will even though no charge of kidnapping was laid against the appellant or his co-accused. There was a similar complaint about the admission of the evidence of the appellant discharging his weapon at the time Rahme was allegedly threatening Allen in the circumstance that there was no charge before the jury in respect of that aspect of the appellant’s conduct. 
     
      
    42 I do not accept that there is any limit on the Crown’s right, or duty, to call relevant evidence on the basis that no charge has been laid in respect of the conduct revealed by that evidence. Generally the Crown has a complete discretion as to what charge is preferred on the evidence in its possession; R v Weaver (1931) 45 CLR 321 at 334. Similarly the Crown has a discretion as to the number of charges to be laid in respect of a particular factual scenario, provided that the number or nature of the charges does not lead to unfairness or oppression. It is now trite law that, if evidence is relevant to a charge before the court, it is admissible notwithstanding that it reveals some other criminal offence; Markby v The Queen (1978) 140 CLR 108 at 116; and generally Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590. The only restriction on the Crown leading such evidence is where it is subject to an exclusionary rule under the Evidence Act, such as under ss 97, 98 or 137, or where its reception would otherwise result in a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    43 I am of the opinion that the interests of justice generally justified, if not required, that the trial proceed as it did. The trial judge was right to refuse the application for separate trials and there was no resulting miscarriage of justice. The first ground, therefore, fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground B Absence of directions on the use of evidence 
      
    44 Reference has already been made to the complaint that the refusal to order separate trials was exacerbated by the trial judge’s failure to indicate what use could be made, or could not be made, of the evidence admitted in respect of one count when dealing with the other count or how the jury should approach evidence of uncharged criminal conduct. No request was made by counsel at the trial for any direction, warning, or comment to be made by his Honour as to the matter of which complaint is now made. 
     
      
    45 In a case where evidence has been admitted of uncharged criminal acts on some basis other than as propensity evidence, a trial judge should give directions to the jury as to the relevance of that evidence. In an appropriate case the trial judge must warn the jury against an impermissible line of reasoning arising from the evidence before them. The trial judge would be required to indicate to the jury, not only the way in which they might use the evidence in resolving the question of the accused’s guilt, but also how the evidence must not be used in the course of their deliberations: BRS v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 275. 
     
      
    46 But such considerations did not arise in the appellant’s trial. There was no real risk that the jury could misuse any uncharged allegation made against the appellant, nor could it misapply the evidence relevant to one count when considering the other. A direction or warning is required when it is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of a miscarriage of justice: see generally R v Stewart (2001) 52 NSWLR 301. The complaint in the present case is that jury were given no assistance in relation to how they were to use the evidence of uncharged acts or the evidence relevant to one charge but not the other. One might answer the complaint by asking, “What assistance did they need?” 
     
      
    47 In the written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant the following is stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “His Honour was obliged to tell the jury that they could not use the evidence probative of the appellant’s role in the armed robbery in any way other than going to the state of mind of the victim in the sexual intercourse count and, indeed, it would have been appropriate to direct the jury that whatever state of mind was induced in [KB] as a result of the incident in the park, those factors may not have been operating many days later. Nor could they use the evidence in the sexual intercourse count as any sort of proof in the armed robbery count. The use to which the evidence in the different counts could be put was very limited:  
        BRS v R 
         191 CLR 275”. 
        
       
      
    48 The difficulty that I have with this submission is how the directions sought would have had any practical significance having regard to the facts and issues in the trial. For example, how might the jury have used the evidence relating to the armed robbery for any purpose other than in determining the state of mind of the complainant after she left the park with the appellant? How could the evidence relating to the sexual intercourse of KB, which was not disputed, be used by the jury in any way to determine the allegation of the robbery of Allen? What impermissible line of reasoning did the jury have to be warned against undertaking when determining either of the counts in the indictment by reason of the existence of evidence unrelated to that particular count? 
     
      
    49 This issues before the jury were clearly established by the time they retired to consider their verdicts. They were in my view, despite submissions in this Court to the contrary, relatively straightforward. Underlying the whole of the trial was the credibility of the Crown witnesses as to events at the park. The Crown alleged that the girls and Allen were subject to the threats of violence aided by the use of firearms by Rahme and the appellant. The defence case was that nothing untoward happened in the park. While what happened thereafter was, apart from credibility issues, of limited relevance to the determination of that dispute the jury could not have understood otherwise. 
     
      
    50 In his oral submissions before this Court Mr Golding contended that there was a risk that the jury might have used what they found to be conduct of the appellant that he behaved in a “thuggish, boorish, and violent way, with the vulnerable woman, including an instance of where he exposed from his person a gun to all of them” to reason that “if a young man would behave in that way with three vulnerable young women, then that would increase the probabilities of the facts in issue in the armed robbery as alleged”. 
     
      
    51 I can see no basis upon which the jury might reasonably find the allegations as to misconduct by the appellant following the incident at the park were more likely to be true than were the allegations of his misconduct in the park. For example, the allegation that the accused displayed a weapon to the complainant and her companion in the shopping mall was no more likely to be accepted by the jury than the allegation that he displayed and discharged a weapon in the park. It was not as if the allegations as to later misconduct were corroborated in some way that the allegations in relation to the earlier incident were not. To the contrary, the allegations in relation to the armed robbery were supported by the evidence of Allen. The trial was conducted on the basis that the jury would either accept the evidence of the complainant and her companions to the required degree or they would not.  
     
      
    52 Unlike BRS v The Queen this was not a case where the jury could have used any of the evidence as revealing a tendency or propensity on the part of the appellant against which they were to be warned. The evidence said nothing about the appellant’s conduct on any other occasion than that with which the charges were concerned. Because the charges were part of a connected series of events, the jury were entitled to use the whole of the evidence as bearing upon the issue for their determination arising from both charges. The only way they were likely to use the evidence concerning what happened after the park incident as bearing upon their determination of the armed robbery count was on the issue of the credibility or reliability of the accounts given by the complainant and the two other girls. They were entitled to use the evidence in that way and there was nothing that his Honour needed to say about it in the circumstances of this particular case. 
     
      
    53 Some matters raised by Mr Golding as calling for directions were really matters for comment. For example, the trial judge may have commented on the fact that the state of mind of the complainant at the time of leaving the park might be different from that at the time of the sexual offence. But that matter did not have to be the subject of a direction of law. There is a clear distinction between what needs to be said by way of a direction or warning and what might be said in the trial judge’s discretion by way of comment on facts. See Crampton v The Queen (2000) 206 CLR 161; R v Stewart at 317. The failure of a trial judge to give a direction or warning, even though not requested by defence counsel, might be fatal because of the risk of a miscarriage arising. But the failure to make a comment on a matter of fact will rarely give rise to a miscarriage of justice, especially if no request is made for such a comment. 
     
      
    54 Despite the fact that the trial judge had, when refusing the application for separate trials, indicated an intention to direct the jury about the relevance of the evidence to the different counts in the indictment, there was in my view no requirement that he did so in the circumstances of this particular case. No request was made for him to give any such directions and there is no possibility of a miscarriage of justice arising from his failure to do so. This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground C Failure to give directions concerning uncharged criminal acts. 
      
    55 Complaint is made that evidence was given of criminal acts committed by the appellant which were not subject to any criminal charge and that his Honour failed to direct the jury as to what they should make of that evidence. Specifically the ground relates to two discrete pieces of evidence; the first a reference to a supply of drugs by the appellant in one of the hotel rooms, and the second evidence that he was a participant in the demanding of money from Allen at the park. 
     
      
    56 The first piece of evidence was given in an unresponsive answer to the Crown. It was clear ultimately that the Crown was not relying upon the evidence and there was no charge against the appellant in respect of such an allegation. The evidence arose in respect of the allegation against Rahme of sexual intercourse with KB during the course of the complainant’s evidence in chief as follows (the relevant portion is underlined): 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. …on the second occasion, on the Thursday did something happen? 
         
         
        A. On Thursday night I was lying on the bed with [Rahme] and [BU] and [Rahme] asked me to suck his penis and he asked me to kiss [BU]. 
         
         
        Q. Did you do something to [Rahme]? 
         
         
        A. Yes I did it and.. 
         
         
        Q. What did you do? 
         
         
        A. I sucked his penis and he had white powder all over it. 
         
         
        Q. Did he say something about that, that white powder? 
         
         
        A. Not that I can remember. 
         
         
        Q. You say it was poured all over it? 
         
         
        A. All over his penis and then told us to suck it off. 
         
         
        Q. Did you do that, did you put…. 
         
         
        A. No Nick [the appellant] put it there. 
         
         
        Q. Sorry did you do that, that is suck the penis as you were told to do? 
         
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        
       
      
    57 Following this evidence no application was made for a discharge of the jury and no request was made for any direction in relation to the matter either at the time the evidence was given or later. There was a complaint made by defence counsel based upon an assertion, quite unfounded, that the Crown was in some way responsible for the evidence being given that the appellant placed drug on the penis of Rahme. The trial judge indicated that he might remind the jury that only Rahme was charged with the offence of supply but was concerned that it might draw attention to the evidence. Defence counsel concurred with this observation and did not ask that anything be said to the jury at that time. 
     
      
    58 In the context of the evidence and the issues before the jury, the evidence was of little consequence. In any event, the jury could have made no use of the evidence in relation to either of the two charges against the respondent and no direction was required in respect of it. 
     
      
    59 I have already referred to the fact that evidence was given of the discharge by the appellant of a weapon about the time that Rahme was alleged to have threatened Allen to obtain money from him. I have indicated my view that the evidence was admissible notwithstanding that no offence was charged relating to it. It was part of the events occurring at the park and was clearly relevant to the circumstances in which the girls left with the appellant and ultimately whether the complainant was consenting to sexual intercourse with the appellant. 
     
      
    60 The trial judge directed the jury that the Crown was not alleging that the appellant was guilty of the offence of demanding money from Allen and that the only charge based upon a joint criminal enterprise involving the three accused was the charge of robbery. That was all that was required in the circumstances of this case and nothing more was sought by the appellant’s counsel. 
     
      
    61 This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground D Failure to discharge the jury 
      
    62 There were throughout the trial numerous applications for the discharge of the jury, each of which was adjudicated upon by the trial judge and in each case the application was dismissed. Each decision was the result of a discretionary judgment of the trial judge. This Court should only interfere with such a ruling if it is persuaded that the trial miscarried by the failure to discharge the jury notwithstanding the trial judge’s advantageous position in determining the effect on the trial of the matter that gave rise to the application for a discharge. In effect this Court can only uphold such a ground of appeal if it is of the view that the only course open to the trial judge was to discharge the jury, or where, with the benefit of hindsight, it can be clearly established that a miscarriage of justice arose because the jury were not discharged; R v Ball (1960) 77 WN (NSW) 605 at 607; Domican (No 3) (1990) 46 A Crim R 428 at 448. 
     
      
    63 The ground as argued is that the jury should have been discharged on the 17th day of the trial after BK gave evidence that, when the three men returned to the motel room on one occasion, they said they were going to kill the girls. The evidence arose in an answer by BK when being cross-examined by the appellant’s counsel about a phone call made by KB to a person asking to be picked up and which ultimately resulted in the police arriving at the motel room. In effect counsel was asking the witness to explain why she had not called this person or any other person at an earlier time, such as when she was in the shopping mall. BK said at that time she was high on drugs and had a “memory blank” about the person’s telephone number. The cross-examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Her number was eventually rung wasn’t it? 
         
         
        A. Yes it was. 
         
         
        Q. And were you girls high on – who thought of the number [you] or [KB]? 
         
         
        A. Me 
         
         
        Q. Were you high on drugs when you thought of the number? 
         
         
        A. Yes but my head was a lot clearer. 
         
         
        Q. I see your head was a lot clearer that day? 
         
         
        A. Well I just woke up from a deep sleep and after they got back they said that they were going to kill us so it was urgent for me to call someone. 
         
        
       
      
    64 The application for a discharge of the jury that was made by each counsel was in extravagant terms and hardly likely to assist the trial judge in a dispassionate exercise of discretion. For example, one counsel appearing for a co-accused described this as an allegation of a conspiracy to murder being “the gravest crime known to the common law”. Again the application was made in the context of what appears to me to have been totally unjustified criticisms of the Crown’s lack of objectivity and fairness. 
     
      
    65 The trial judge determined not to discharge the jury, but he directed the jury that the answer was unresponsive and should be ignored. In my view it was within his Honour’s discretion to refuse to discharge the jury in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    66 The defence to both charges was that the complainant and the other two girls were fabricating evidence about any threats of violence by the appellant and his co-accused either at the oval or over the next week in the various hotel rooms. The defence asserted that they were lying about these matters in order to exculpate themselves from having gone voluntarily with the three men and, in the case of KB, that she had indulged in consensual acts of intercourse with them. In light of the evidence given as to the conduct of the appellant and the other two men at the oval, involving as it did the production of firearms and the discharge of a weapon by the appellant, this allegation of some unspecified threat was not, in my view, likely to prejudice the appellant’s fair trial. There is no reason to think that the jury might have been persuaded by that evidence either alone, or in the context of the other evidence before them, to give more weight to the allegations of the three girls about what happened at the oval. There is no reason to assume that the jury would not simply disregard it as being irrelevant to any issue before them as they were instructed to do so by the trial judge. There is no reasonable basis for fearing that the jury might have used it to the appellant’s detriment. 
     
      
    67 I am not satisfied that the failure of his Honour to discharge the jury on any occasion resulted in a miscarriage of justice and the ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground E Cross-examination of Ms Hoy 
      
    68 It will be recalled that Ms Hoy was in the group that met Mr Allen and the three girls at Pennant Hills and went with them to Richie Benaud Oval prior to the arrival of the appellant and the other two men. In the first, and aborted trial, counsel for the appellant indicated that he would object to any evidence being called by the Crown that might suggest that the appellant had supplied drugs to Ms Hoy at the oval. Although the Crown did not intend to call Ms Hoy, it did propose to lead evidence of a phone call between Ms Hoy and the appellant overheard by the three girls, and of the apparent supply of some substance by the appellant to Ms Hoy witnessed by the girls at the oval. 
     
      
    69 Ultimately, as a result of a Crown concession and a ruling by the trial judge, the Crown was not permitted to lead any evidence of a telephone call by Ms Hoy to the appellant before they arrived at Richie Benaud Oval or any other evidence suggestive of the appellant supplying drugs to Ms Hoy. His Honour indicated that, if, and, when Ms Hoy was called in the defence case, he would rule on any question that then arose about such evidence. He did indicate, however, a view that the evidence might be unduly prejudicial under s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    70 Although this Court was provided with twelve volumes of evidence and exhibits for the hearing of the appeal, there is no record of any formal ruling made by the trial judge. It may be that because it was a ruling against the Crown and in light of the extensive oral submissions, his Honour saw no reason to publish separate reasons. But from the transcript of the argument at the time of the ruling and later when the issue arose after Ms Hoy was called by the defence, it is reasonably clear that the ruling was concerned only with evidence being called in the Crown case. 
     
      
    71 In the appellant’s case two witnesses were called. The first was a character witness. The second witness was Ms Hoy. Although she had been called in the prosecution case at committal proceedings, the Crown decided not to call her at the trial, apparently on the basis that she was an unreliable witness. After Ms Hoy’s evidence a testimonial on the appellant’s behalf was read to the jury. 
     
      
    72 In evidence in chief, Ms Hoy volunteered that on the way to the park she “called someone for drugs for Richo”. She agreed with the appellant’s counsel that at the park she met the person whom she had called and Richo brought some drugs from this person. She said that after that person left, the appellant and the other two men arrived. Ms Hoy’s evidence was that she had called the appellant at some unspecified time and arranged to meet him at the park. She gave evidence that she never saw the appellant with a gun on that night, that no weapon was fired and that no person was robbed. She said that the three girls did not want to go home and so they went willingly with the appellant and his co-accused. 
     
      
    73 In cross-examination Ms Hoy told the Crown that she had known the appellant a few months and had seen him mainly when she was shopping at particular commercial complex in Castle Hill. He had been an acquaintance of a former boyfriend and a female friend. 
     
      
    74 When the Crown commenced to cross-examine the witness about her contact with the drug supplier for Richo, counsel for the appellant objected on the basis that the Crown was attempting to elicit the identity of the drug supplier in breach of the trial judge’s earlier ruling. The Crown indicated that it wished to test Ms Hoy’s version of events being that some other person was at the park before the appellant arrived, even though this was not a scenario upon which any of the Crown witnesses had been cross-examined. The Crown alleged that Ms Hoy’s version was inconsistent with her statement to police and her evidence during committal proceedings. The Crown also wanted to investigate the witness’s relationship with the appellant. 
     
      
    75 Defence counsel submitted that on the basis of his Honour’s earlier ruling he had conducted his cross-examination of the Crown witnesses in a certain way. In my opinion that submission should have been rejected. If the defence were intending to call Ms Hoy and knew the version she was going to give in the witness box, counsel had an obligation to put those allegations to the Crown witnesses and his Honour’s ruling in that regard was irrelevant. 
     
      
    76 In ruling against the Crown his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Madam Crown I didn’t choose the charges that these accused have been charged with, you did. The case has been conducted in a certain way because of that. I ruled earlier in a certain way and the case has been conducted on that basis since. I will not restrict you, Madam Crown, in relation to asking questions generally about this witness’s general association with [the appellant] but I will not allow you to ask questions directly or indirectly leading to an inference that he was the supplier of drugs on this evening. Thank you. 
         
        
       
      His Honour also indicated that the Crown could not suggest to the witness that it was the appellant who was there earlier in the evening before the arrival of the two co-accused. His Honour did, however, permit the Crown to question the witness about telephone records in relation to her mobile telephone. 
       
      
    77 From the material before the Court it appears that his Honour may have had an imperfect recollection of the earlier ruling he had made, which only concerned the Crown calling evidence tending to suggest that the appellant had supplied drugs to Ms Hoy at the oval. His Honour had left to one side what ruling he might make if Ms Hoy was called by the defence. That imperfect recollection was induced by what defence counsel said to His Honour when he first raised his concern about the cross-examination. What counsel said about the earlier ruling does not appear to be accurate. The trial judge could be excused for being so misled, as it was a difficult trial with numerous objections taken and applications made by defence counsel, few of which had any merit at all. Further, because there appears to have been no formal ruling, his Honour was having difficulty recalling what ruling he had made. 
     
      
    78 In my opinion the attitude taken by the Crown in relation to the stance of defence counsel was appropriate and in accordance with the earlier ruling or at least her understanding of it. His Honour’s ruling at this stage in the trial was not required by his earlier ruling and was unduly restrictive of the Crown’s right to cross-examine Ms Hoy. 
     
      
    79 When the witness was re-called, the Crown Prosecutor cross-examined her further about the arrangement to purchase drugs for Richo. Ms Hoy said that she contacted the person after she had met Allen and the three girls at Pennant Hills. The person whom she called said that he was at the MacDonald’s Restaurant at North Parramatta. She made two calls to the person and arranged to meet him at the cemetery, which is next to the oval. She said the supplier was there by himself when she, Richo and the others arrived. Ms Hoy’s evidence was that she telephoned the appellant just as the drug supplier left the cemetery after selling drugs to Richo. This was, she said, the first occasion that she had ever phoned the appellant and she did so because she was bored. 
     
      
    80 Ms Hoy was then cross-examined on telephone records relating to her mobile telephone. She accepted that the records revealed that she had phoned the appellant from the vicinity of Thomson’s Corner, which is between Castle Hill and Pennant Hills, at 12.28am. She agreed that she had made five further calls to the appellant’s mobile phone after she had arrived at the oval. 
     
      
    81 After the Crown tendered the phone records, counsel for the appellant again complained that the Crown might be trying to traverse his Honour’s earlier ruling. The Crown Prosecutor denied that she was intending to suggest that it was the appellant who had supplied drugs to Ms Hoy for Richo. No such suggestion was ever made to the witness by the Crown when her cross-examination recommenced after an adjournment. The balance of the cross-examination continued without complaint by defence counsel and without touching upon the evidence concerning the identity of the drug supplier. 
     
      
    82 It should be noted that no formal objection was taken to the cross-examination or any part of it. Defence counsel simply raised concerns at the direction it might take having regard to the earlier ruling. His Honour was not asked to intervene other than as he did by reminding the Crown of the ruling that he believed he had made earlier. 
     
      
    83 The complaint before this Court is that his Honour ought to have intervened to stop the Crown cross-examining the witness in a manner from which, it was said, the jury would have understood that the Crown was alleging that the drug supplier at the oval was the appellant. It was submitted that the cross-examination of Ms Hoy was in breach of his Honour’s ruling and that his Honour allowed it to continue because he failed to appreciate its significance. 
     
      
    84 In my opinion there is no merit in this ground of appeal. The Crown Prosecutor was entitled to cross-examine Ms Hoy in the way that she did. His Honour’s ruling, as best this Court can understand it, was that the Crown could not introduce evidence in its case of the telephone conversation between Ms Hoy and the appellant as it was irrelevant, and, in so far as it might implicate the appellant in supplying drugs, was overly prejudicial. Although his Honour indicated that such evidence might be excluded, even if the defence called Ms Hoy, he appears to have made no such ruling. Nothing the Crown Prosecutor did was contravening any ruling made by his Honour. 
     
      
    85 In my view, it would have been unfair to the Crown to limit the cross-examination of Ms Hoy by such a ruling as the defence contended had been made by his Honour. The appellant had led evidence of good character. Ms Hoy was giving evidence on behalf of the appellant that was inconsistent with her prior statements and the unchallenged evidence of Crown witnesses. The Crown was entitled to test her version and, if that was to the extent of implicating the appellant as a drug supplier, so be it. 
     
      
    86 Ms Hoy was insisting that the person who supplied drugs to Richo was at the oval before the appellant arrived and such a suggestion was completely inconsistent with the evidence given by the Crown witnesses. Ms Hoy volunteered that she had phoned a drug supplier before she arrived at the oval. The evidence was that, contrary to her evidence in chief, she had phoned the appellant in the area of Thompson’s Corner. That was the only call she had made at that time. In any event, the fact that as a result of her call to the appellant the three men arrived at the oval, it did not follow that it was the appellant who was a drug supplier. 
     
      
    87 The defence chose to call the witness and knew the Crown’s attitude and the evidence available to the prosecutor. No ruling had been made upon which counsel for the appellant was entitled to rely in the conduct of the defence case. The Crown should have been free to investigate the true relationship between Ms Hoy and the appellant, whatever that relationship might have been. Ms Hoy had put herself forward as a person who knew the appellant only fleetingly, had never phoned him before that night and had met him only by chance, as it were, at a shopping mall. 
     
      
    88 In any event, I do not believe that any inference arose from the cross-examination that the Crown was alleging that the appellant was a drug supplier. The Crown was simply testing the evidence of the witness to show either that she was unreliable or that she was giving false evidence to support the appellant. The Crown was asserting that there was no person present at the oval when Ms Hoy arrived there. The relevance of the evidence that had been rejected in the Crown’s case would not have been to prove that the appellant was a drug supplier but rather to discredit Ms Hoy’s version of events. 
     
      
    89 In my opinion the appellant’s trial counsel was unjustifiably trying to obtain a tactical advantage by relying on the earlier ruling so as to limit the Crown’s attack upon Ms Hoy’s credit. There was no misconduct by the Crown Prosecutor. Rather she was attempting to assert her right to cross-examine the witness as to her conflicting accounts and her credit. She was faced with intemperate, unfair, and misleading submissions made by defence counsel as to her purpose in the cross-examination of Ms Hoy and the consequence of his Honour’s earlier ruling. The suggestion in the submissions in support of this ground that the prosecutor’s conduct in persisting with her cross-examination of Ms Hoy was “grossly unfair and inappropriate” has no foundation. 
     
      
    90 Notwithstanding that there had been numerous applications for a discharge of the jury by defence counsel during the course of the trial, no application was made in respect of the conduct of the Crown in cross-examining Ms Hoy. It did not apparently occur to defence counsel, despite his repeated and unjustified allegations of misbehaviour by the Crown Prosecutor during the course of his submissions to the trial judge, that a miscarriage of justice had in fact occurred as a result of the cross-examination of Ms Hoy. Insofar as rule 4 applies, leave should be refused to rely upon this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    91 This ground should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground F Miscarriage as a result of the conduct of the Crown 
      
    92 It should be apparent from what I have already written that any reliance placed upon the conduct of the Crown in relation to the cross-examination of Ms Hoy to support an attack on the conviction has no merit whatsoever. 
     
      
    93 Only one other matter was raised in support of this ground. The Crown in her closing address to the jury referred to the appellant as having made a demand upon Mr Allen for money. This was obviously an error and was inconsistent with what had been said to the jury throughout the evidence and said by the Prosecutor herself in another part of her address. The trial judge made it clear in the summing up that the charge of demanding money from Allen was only made against Rahme and not against the appellant. No objection was raised about the prosecutor’s slip and the jury could have had no doubt about the true situation. 
     
      
    94 The ground should be rejected. No ground having been made good, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
      
    95 As has already been noted the appellant was sentenced on the first count in the indictment to imprisonment for 5 years and 4 months and a non-parole period of 4 years was specified. The only ground upon which it is alleged that his Honour erred was in his failure to find special circumstances and, thereby, reduce the non-parole period from the statutory ratio in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act. 
     
      
    96 The appellant was born in Lebanon in December 1979 and came to Australia with his parents in 1982. At the time of the commission of the offence he was living with his family. His parents described him to an officer preparing a pre-sentence report as being “an exemplary son who does not drink or smoke, attends church every Sunday, has good friends and is quiet and loving”. His employer found him to be his best employee who was honest, trustworthy and had a reliable work performance. The appellant had denied to the probation officer that he had any drug or alcohol problem. His only explanation for his involvement in the incident, giving rise to his conviction, was his association with his co-offenders. 
     
      
    97 The appellant had no prior convictions at the time of being sentenced by Acting Judge Stewart. He was 20 years and 8 months at the time of the commission of the offence. There were a number of testimonials from members of the appellant’s community attesting to his good character, integrity, and the esteem in which he was held. 
     
      
    98 Both the Crown and counsel for the appellant filed written submissions on sentence. On behalf of the appellant his counsel conceded that a prison sentence was inevitable. However, his rehabilitation since the offence was stressed and it was submitted that the sentence should encourage that rehabilitation. In particular it was submitted that special circumstances existed justifying a reduction in the non-parole period arising from “[the] relative youth of the prisoner, the fact that this is the first period of imprisonment he has served and his excellent prospects of rehabilitation”. His counsel submitted that a non-parole period of 12 months would be appropriate. These written submissions were amplified orally. 
     
      
    99 In sentencing the appellant, his Honour referred to the subjective matters relevant to the appellant. He specifically mentioned that he took into account the written submissions tendered on the appellant’s behalf. 
     
      
    100 His Honour found that there was no contrition or remorse on the part of any of offenders and found that they were merely sorry for themselves. 
     
      
    101 During the course of his remarks his Honour did not mention the issue of special circumstances in relation to the appellant. However, he sentenced the three offenders at the one time in the one set of sentencing remarks and found special circumstances existed in Rahme’s case by reason of the fact that his Honour was accumulating the sentences for the three offences of which he had been convicted. However, in the overall sentences imposed upon each of the offenders, his Honour maintained the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. 
     
      
    102 The sentencing judge initially sentenced the appellant to six years with a non-parole period of four years. However, due to the fact that he had to resentence Rahme, he also resentenced the appellant in order to achieve parity between the appellant and Rahme. When doing so he took into account that the appellant was the youngest of the three, had never been to gaol before, and had no criminal record. 
     
      
    103 The finding that there are, or are not, special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact. The power of this Court to interfere with such a finding is very limited. In the circumstances of this case the fact that his Honour made no explicit finding in his remarks as to the question of special circumstances should not be taken as indicating a failure by his Honour to consider that issue; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [87]. This is especially so because he made such a finding in Rahme’s case and specifically referred to the written submissions filed on the appellant’s behalf that were primarily concerned with that issue. 
     
      
    104 Further, when resentencing the appellant, his Honour referred to those matters that were, and are now, put forward as giving rise to special circumstances; they being the appellant’s age, his prior good character, and that it was his first term of imprisonment. Mr Golding has conceded that these matters do not necessarily require that special circumstances be found. Unfortunately they are relatively unremarkable and have their principal effect in the determination of the head sentence; Simpson at [93]. 
     
      
    105 A finding of special circumstances is purposive in that it is a warrant for reducing the non-parole period below that arrived at by the statutory formula. While the considerations or the factors giving rise to special circumstances are not limited to the reform of the offender, that will often be the purpose in finding special circumstances. It is the only justification suggested in the present case for making such a finding. But the rehabilitation of the offender is not the sole or even principal consideration in fixing a non-parole period; Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623; Simpson at [59]. The other aspects of punishment such as deterrence and denunciation cannot be overlooked. 
     
      
    106 To a significant extent the rehabilitation of the appellant was well underway by the time he came to be sentenced. While the Court might encourage him further in this enterprise, there was no requirement that it should. The appellant was not motivated to commit his crime by an addiction to drugs or alcohol. There was no suggestion of any mental state that contributed to his criminal behaviour that needed treatment or control. His only explanation was the company he was keeping at the time and the evidence was that he had severed that relationship. He had strong family and community support that, it would be expected, will continue throughout his period of incarceration. There is nothing to suggest that a period of 16 months parole would be insufficient to assist the appellant readjust to life outside prison after four years of incarceration. 
     
      
    107 In my opinion there is no merit in the application for leave to appeal. No error can be shown. The sentence was in my view a relatively modest one having regard to the seriousness of the offence committed. In any event the non-parole period was the least period of imprisonment that could reflect those elements of punishment that arose from the nature of the offence committed. 
     
      
    108 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed, leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SIMPSON J: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: This is an appeal against sentence by the Crown. Ian Ross Cromarty pleaded guilty to each count in the following indictment: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Unauthorised possession of firearms in aggravated circumstances, contrary to s51D(2) Firearms Act 1996 (maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment). 
         
         
        Count 2: Possession of unregistered firearms, contrary to s36(1) Firearms Act 1996 (maximum penalty: 10 years imprisonment). 
         
         
        Count 3: Possession of firearms with defaced identification marks, contrary to s66(b) Firearms Act 1996 (maximum penalty: 5 years imprisonment). 
         
         
        Count 4: Unauthorised possession of prohibited weapons, contrary to s7(1) Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (maximum penalty: 14 years imprisonment). 
         
         
        Count 5: Possession of shortened firearms, contrary to s62(1)(b) Firearms Act 1996 (maximum penalty: 10 years imprisonment). 
        
       
      
    3 Mr Cromarty asked that two matters be taken into account on a Form 1, namely, that he was in possession of ammunition without a licence or permit, and that contrary to s39(1)(a) of the Firearms Act 1996, he did not keep a firearm safe. 
     
      
       
       
      The Sentence. 
       
      
    4 On 24 September 2003, Coolahan DCJ sentenced Mr Cromarty as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Taking account of the matters on the Form 1, to imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 4 October 2003 and expiring on 3 October 2006, with a non parole period of 2 years expiring on 3 October 2005. 
         
         
        Count 2: To imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 4 October 2003 and expiring on 3 October 2004. 
         
         
        Count 3: To imprisonment for a fixed term of 8 months commencing on 4 October 2003 and expiring of 3 June 2004. 
         
         
        Counts 4 & 5: On each count to imprisonment for a fixed term of 16 months commencing on 4 October 2003 and expiring on 3 February 2005. 
        
       
      
    5 His Honour ordered that such sentences should be served by way of periodic detention. He further ordered that the firearms seized by the police should be forfeited to the Crown. The Crown complains that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      The search of Mr Cromarty's premises. 
       
      
    6 The material tendered before the sentencing Judge included a number of statements by the police. On Thursday 28 November 2002, upon the basis of information received by the police, a Chamber Magistrate issued a warrant to search Mr Cromarty's home. The nature of the information given to the police was not the subject of evidence before the sentencing Judge. 
     
      
    7 The following morning the police met at the office of the Firearms Crime Squad in Sydney. An officer gave a briefing. Some nine officers, including three sergeants, then drove to Charlestown, a suburb of Newcastle. They made contact with the local Area Command. Shortly after 9.30 am the police approached Mr Cromarty's home at Charlestown. The warrant was then executed in his presence. A video was made as the search progressed from one section of the home to another. 
     
      
    8 Mr Cromarty's home included a workshop. At the front of the workshop there was, according to Det Martin, a ""standard roller type door"". On the other side of the workshop, presumably giving access to the house, there was another door. Det Martin described it as ""quite a secure door"". He described the upstairs house as a normal suburban home. There were no bars on the windows. There was ""limited security"". There was a ""back to base"" alarm for both the workshop and the home. 
     
      
    9 Mr Cromarty gave evidence on sentence. He said the roller door was much stronger than the usual door. Plates had been welded in position which in some way fortified the door. The house was fitted with deadlocks. There were sensors which detected movement. The premises had been inspected by the police when he first sought a licence. They appeared quite pleased with them. 
     
      
    10 Soon after the search began the police noticed what appeared to be a false ceiling in the garage. They removed a number of panels. They uncovered a large number of weapons, including prohibited weapons. Mr Cromarty was immediately arrested. He was later taken to the Charlestown Police Station. He sought legal advice. He thereafter declined to be interviewed. He was held in custody overnight, being released on bail the following morning. 
     
      
    11 The search was conducted over two days. The police found and seized what was described as the ""largest cache of weapons"" ever taken from a private individual in Australia. The items seized were later tested by a ballistics expert. All but a few were in working order. They included: 
     
      
    · 35 weapons prohibited under Schedule 1 of the Firearms Act 1996. 
     
      
    · 63 weapons prohibited under Schedule 1 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. 
     
      
    · 103 unregistered firearms. 
     
      
    · 10 pistols from which the serial number or identification mark had been defaced. 
     
      
    · 2 shortened self loading rifles. 
     
      
    · 2,850 cartridges of ammunition. 
     
      
    · 147 firearm parts. 
     
      
    · 7 silencers suitable for rifles and pistols. 
     
      
    12 The weapons which the police seized were scattered throughout the home and workshop of Mr Cromarty. A significant number were recovered from the area concealed by the false ceiling. Some of those so concealed were prohibited weapons, including (as described by Det Martin) ""two Thompson automatic submachine guns, a number of pistols and parts for high calibre machine guns ..."". 
     
      
    13 Det Martin, in describing the search on the second day, said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""During this time, the second level of the premises was searched and as a result one loaded, UZI submachine gun, 2 x 30 calibre machine guns, 1 Bren field machine gun, 1 x 50 calibre machine gun, 1 x M14 machine gun, 1 x AR15, Mini 14 rifle and other self loading rifles were located. All of these weapons were left unlocked and were found behind doors, in cupboards and under beds."" 
        
       
      
    14 A large number of pistols were located in two drawers next to Mr Cromarty's bed. Further pistols were found in an armchair in the loungeroom. 
     
      
       
       
      The Legislation. 
       
      
    15 Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 concerned offences under the Firearms Act 1996. That Act replaced the Firearms Act 1989. The Act was part of a national campaign to implement firearms control following the Port Arthur massacre. The Act included the following statement of the principles underlying the statute: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        3 Principles and objects of Act 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The underlying principles of this Act are:

    16 The objects of the Act are stated in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(2) The objects of this Act are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to prohibit the possession and use of all automatic and self loading rifles and shotguns except in special circumstances,

          (e) to ensure that firearms are stored and conveyed in a safe and secure manner."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 The Firearms Act introduced a licensing scheme in respect of firearms (s8). The scheme created five categories of firearms, namely: 
     
      
    · Category A: Which included rim-fire rifles (other than self loading rifles) and shotguns (other than pump action or self loading shotguns). 
     
      
    · Category B: Which included muzzle loading and centre fire rifles or shotguns (other than those which were self loading). 
     
      
    · Category C: A licence for certain prohibited self loading weapons for the licensee's farming or grazing activities, where the Commissioner of Police authorises an eligible person. 
     
      
    · Category D: A licence to use certain prohibited weapons for ""official purposes"", which are defined and must be authorised. 
     
      
    · Category H: Pistols. 
     
      
    18 Prohibited weapons, which include self loading and pump action firearms, are excluded from categories A, B and H. A person may also obtain a Firearm Dealer's licence. Mr Cromarty was authorised to possess firearms in respect to categories A, B and H. He also had a dealer's licence, which extended to all categories of firearms. 
     
      
    19 By s7(1) of the Act, it is an offence to possess a firearm unless the person is authorised by permit. The maximum penalty is five years imprisonment unless the firearm is a prohibited weapon (as defined by Schedule 1) in which case the maximum penalty is 14 years. 
     
      
    20 A person in possession of a firearm or firearms is obliged to register each firearm. The Commissioner of Police has the responsibility of compiling and maintaining the register (s33(1)). The register includes a description of each weapon and the serial number (s33(2)(a)). Mr Cromarty, as part of his business as a gunsmith, acted as the agent of the Commissioner in the registration of firearms. 
     
      
    21 Part 3, Division 2, of the Act deals with offences relating to registration. It is an offence to ""sell, purchase, possess or use a firearm that is not registered"" (s36(1)). The maximum penalty is 5 years imprisonment, unless the firearm is a prohibited firearm or pistol, in which case the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. A licensed firearms dealer does not commit an offence under this section if, within 24 hours of acquiring the firearm, an application is made for registration of the firearm. Mr Cromarty was not able to take advantage of that dispensation, having owned the weapons for some time. 
     
      
    22 Part 4 of the Act makes provision for the safe-keeping of firearms. Category A and B firearms must be stored in a locked receptacle when not being used (s40). Category H firearms (pistols) must be locked in a safe (s41). It is an offence to shorten a firearm or possess a shortened firearm (s62(1)), or to have in your possession a firearm on which any number or identification mark has been defaced or altered (s66). The maximum penalty under s62 is ten years, and under s66 is five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    23 In 2002 the Minister for Police introduced the Firearm Amendment (Public Safety) Act which, amongst other things, inserted the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        51D Unauthorised possession of firearms in aggravated circumstances 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A person who is in possession of more than 3 firearms is guilty of an offence under this subsection if: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) the firearms are not registered, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person is not authorised by a licence or permit to possess the firearms. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person who is in possession of more than 3 firearms any one of which is a prohibited firearm or pistol is guilty of an offence under this subsection if: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) the firearms are not registered, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person is not authorised by a licence or permit to possess the firearms. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 20 years."" 
        
       
      
    24 When introducing the amendment, the Minister said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Firearm-related crime is a major concern for both police and the community. In July 2001 the Government introduced tougher firearm trafficking laws designed to inhibit the illegal supply of firearms, and this bill is a further strengthening of our laws."" 
        
       
      
    25 He added: 
     
      
       
        
        ""To crack down on possession for the purposes of illegal trafficking, proposed section 51D will introduce an offence of possession by an unlicensed person of three or more unregistered firearms. This will mean that criminals warehousing illegal guns for sale on the black market will be liable to up to 20 years in gaol if the firearm is prohibited or is a hand gun."" 
        
       
      
    26 The charge in Count 4 was based upon the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, a companion Act to the Firearms Act. It deals with weapons other than firearms. Prohibited weapons are identified in Schedule 1 which lists a miscellany of lethal weapons, including knives, and explosives. Relevantly, the list includes mortars, grenades and crossbows. 
     
      
    27 The principles underlying the Weapons Prohibition Act are similar to those in the Firearms Act. Section 3(1) is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        3 Principles and objects of Act 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The underlying principles of this Act are: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to confirm that the possession and use of prohibited weapons is a privilege that is conditional on the overriding need to ensure public safety, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) to improve public safety by imposing strict controls on the possession and use of prohibited weapons."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 The objects of the Act are stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""3(2) The specific objects of this Act are as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to require each person who possesses or uses a prohibited weapon under the authority of a permit to have a genuine reason for possessing or using the weapon. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) to provide strict requirements that must be satisfied in relation to the possession and use of prohibited weapons. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) to provide an amnesty period to enable the surrender of prohibited weapons."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 Where there is a genuine reason for possessing such a weapon a permit may be sought from the Commissioner of Police (s10). It is an offence to possess or use a prohibited weapon unless the person is authorised by permit (s7(1)) (maximum penalty on summary conviction 2 years or, on indictment, imprisonment for 14 years). A table of possible reasons which may justify the issue of a permit is included in the Act. The reasons extend to recreational and sporting purposes, theatrical purposes, weapon collection, public museums and the like (s11(2)(a)).  
     
      
       
      The Charges. 
       
      
    30 Count 1 was the most serious offence, alleging possession of firearms in circumstances of aggravation (s51D(2)). It will be remembered (supra para 22) that s51D(1) (the offence without aggravation) required proof that the person charged was in possession of three unregistered firearms and had no licence or permit (the maximum penalty: 10 years imprisonment). The offence in its aggravated form, as alleged against Mr Cromarty, required proof that any one of the three firearms was also ""a prohibited firearm or pistol"" (as defined by Schedule 1 of the Act) (maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment). Here the Crown case on Count 1 involved multiple prohibited firearms, namely:· 4 machine guns 
     
      
    · 4 submachine guns 
     
      
    · 24 self loading rifles 
     
      
    · 3 self loading shotguns 
     
      
    31 Some of the firearms were museum pieces. All were lethal. The description of Det Martin included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""These weapons included WWII Bren Machine Gun, 50 calibre machine gun, 2 x 30 calibre machine guns, M14 machine gun and a AR15 .300 Whisper calibre assault rifle fitted for a silencer and designed and used as a snipers rifle by some American law enforcement agencies."" 
        
       
      
    32 The firearms were unregistered. Mr Cromarty was not authorised by licence or permit to have them in his possession. They were not firearms owned by others which he was working on. His dealer's licence (which extended to categories C and D) did not authorise their possession. 
     
      
    33 Count 2 alleged possession of unregistered firearms (s7(1) Firearms Act) (maximum penalty: 10 years imprisonment). They were firearms which fell within categories A, B or H, which Mr Cromarty was authorised to possess. However, they had not been registered, as required by the Act. The firearms were:· 45 rifles 
     
      
    · 58 pistols 
     
      
    34 Count 3 alleged possession of firearms with defaced identification marks (s66(b)) Firearms Act (maximum penalty: 5 years imprisonment). There were ten pistols which had been defaced. Det Martin said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The defacing of a firearm is achieved by drilling out the serial number or any other feature which would prevent authorities tracing the true origin of the weapon. These weapons are of particular concern to police as these weapons are often stolen from lawful owners and sold to the criminal element."" 
        
       
      
    35 Count 4 was based upon the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998, alleging the unauthorised possession of prohibited weapons (maximum penalty: 14 years imprisonment). The weapons, the subject of this count, were as follows:· a mortar bomb 
     
      
    · 7 grenades 
     
      
    · 1 rocket launcher 
     
      
    · 7 silencers 
     
      
    · 1 crossbow 
     
      
    36 Some of the weapons were less forbidding than their description suggested. The mortar and grenades were relics of World War II. They had been made inert. Major Parker (retired), who spoke highly of Mr Cromarty's character, commented upon media publicity given to the sentencing proceedings in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Much hype was given by the press to the 'rocket launcher' as used by terrorists. This was in fact a harmless inert fibreglass tube that had once contained an anti-tank rocket that the Army describes as 'disposable' and usually sent to the garbage dump at the completion of a practice. It could not be reloaded and used again. The police advised the media of this but truth and facts did not stand in the way of a sensational story."" 
        
       
      
    37 Count 5 alleged a breach of s62(1)(b) of the Firearms Act (maximum penalty: 10 years imprisonment). Mr Cromarty had been found in possession of two prohibited firearms, both self loading rifles, both shortened. 
     
      
    38 The Form 1 matters (taken into account in respect of Count 1) were first, the possession of a significant quantity of ammunition without licence or permit and, secondly, the failure to keep safe a firearm. It is not entirely clear which firearm was not kept safe. The storage of a number of firearms and weapons appeared not to comply with the Act, although not the subject of any charge (and not, as such, to be taken into account on sentence). Presumably the matter, the subject of the Form 1, was the loaded Uzi submachine gun which was found unlocked. 
     
      
    39 In the proceedings on sentence, Det Martin said this: (T6 - 8.8.03) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. With respect to Mr Cromarty himself, your particular crime agency has  
        absolutely 
        , is this correct, had no information of no intelligence to suggest that he is involved in trading in these kinds of weapons, selling, giving them away, conspiring to give them away or anything of that nature, is that correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes sir,  
        none whatsoever 
        .""  
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    40 Mr Duffield, an experienced probation and parole officer, provided a report which included the following: (Exhibit A) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It seems he chose to ignore the illegality of his behaviour, but it is strongly felt that he had no sinister intent."" 
        
       
      
    41 Dr Roger Peters, a psychologist to whom Mr Cromarty had been referred, commented upon possible explanations of Mr Cromarty's conduct in these terms: (Exhibit 1) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I think the answer in this case is quite complex and psychologically convoluted. I think it involves many issues none of which are delinquent or sinister."" 
        
       
       
      Sentencing Remarks. 
       
      
    42 The sentencing proceedings occupied a number of days. His Honour reserved his decision. His remarks painstakingly analysed the nature of each offence and the subjective circumstances of Mr Cromarty. His Honour recognised that the offences were serious, both by reason of the sheer number of weapons and the maximum penalties provided in respect of each offence (R/S 8). His Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... whilst the offender was in flagrant breach of the law in relation to each of the counts on the indictment and whilst he knew because of his experience and long history with the legitimate use of firearms, both as a dealer and a gunsmith, that he was in breach, there is no doubt that this came about not as a result of any desire on his part to profit from the illegal trade in these goods but rather as a result of a passion and obsession with firearms as well as other intricate and precision machinery and an almost morbid unwillingness to part with them, knowing that to do so would see them destroyed."" 
        
       
      
    43 Elsewhere his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... there is no doubt on all the evidence that the offender was not a person who in any sense could be described as a criminal or an associate of criminals and certainly not someone who was prepared to engage in the illicit trade in firearms."" 
        
       
      
    44 The Crown submitted that the criminality of Mr Cromarty objectively ""fell towards the upper end of seriousness of offences of this sort"". Referring to that submission, his Honour said this, speaking of the Crown prosecutor: (R/S 24) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... he referred to the sheer size of the cache, the nature and type of weaponry recovered, and the fact that most of it was in working order. He pointed to one of the factors of sentencing being to deter other people from committing like offences and he said that this was particularly important here. It was his submission that there was no place for the type of weapons seized to be in the hands of a private citizen."" 
        
       
      
    45 His Honour added: (R/S 24) 
     
      
       
        
        ""To a large extent I agree with the submissions of the learned Crown Prosecutor. However, as I said, it must be borne in mind that, particularly in relation to the weapons described in count 2 in the indictment, by virtue of his licence the offender was perfectly entitled to possess them had he simply registered them. 
        
       
       
        
        I am unable to agree with the learned Crown Prosecutor that the criminality involved here is in the upper bracket."" 
        
       
      
    46 Nonetheless, his Honour noted that Mr Cromarty ""was well aware of the (relevant) legislative provisions and deliberately flouted the law..."" (R/S 28). He added: (R/S 28) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I also have regard to the number and type of weapons seized, including the fact that some were silencers and two were shortened firearms. Whilst I accept that the offender had no intention of ever dealing in these arms in an illegal manner and whilst I accept that in relation to some of them at least had he registered them he was entitled to possess them, the real danger is that they may have fallen into the hands of the criminal element, notwithstanding the security provided for them by the offender."" 
        
       
       
      The Subjective Case. 
       
      
    47 Mr Cromarty is aged 61 years. He was born on 28 June 1942. He trained as a fitter and turner. For many years he worked at BHP in Newcastle. He had a lifelong interest in guns. In 1982, or thereabouts, he became a licensed gunsmith. He conducted his business from home in suburban Charlestown.  
     
      
    48 Mr Cromarty joined the Newcastle Pistol Club in 1977. His wife was also interested in shooting. He remained a committee member of the club for almost ten years. He competed successfully. He won two Australian awards, six State championships, and was a place-getter on many occasions. He had a Range Officer's status at National level. He was also an Instructor. 
     
      
    49 Mr Cromarty was highly regarded by club members. A number gave evidence before the sentencing Judge. Others provided references. He had a good reputation for safety in handling firearms. He was regarded as a mentor to young shooters. He maintained and repaired firearms belonging to members, usually without fee. He was much admired for his craftsmanship. 
     
      
    50 Mr Cromarty also collected stamps, cigarette cards, coins, car parts and fine machinery. He had a keen interest in the history of firearms used in both World Wars and had many publications dealing with that subject. He was described as a ""quiet, caring family man"".  
     
      
    51 Since the confiscation of his collection of firearms and weapons, Mr Cromarty has lost all interest in firearms. Mr Duffield, a Probation Officer, said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""That pistols and shooting and working on weapons was a major part of the offender's life is an understatement, and he currently exhibits signs of significant grief and loss."" 
        
       
      
    52 Dr Roger Peters thought that Mr Cromarty was suffering from a reactive anxiety best described as an ""adjustment disorder"". He was otherwise well adjusted and not suffering from any psychiatric or psychological conditions. He suffered from a measure of depression. His licence as a gunsmith had been revoked (s11 Firearms Act). Dr Peters said this: (Exhibit 1: 4/5 ) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In fact I would make one further observation and that is that had he handed in his collection when amnesties were proclaimed - he would have had no opportunity of replacing it and this collection seems to have been one of the main reasons he was living. Not to put (too fine a) point on it, his collection provided him with a reason for living and that its loss would have been devastating. I doubt he could even face the thought of handing in his collection, let alone taken any action to actually do anything. Thus the threat of resultant depression and psychological trauma from its loss would have been overwhelming, ironically the very situation he now finds himself in."" 
        
       
      
    53 Finally, dealing with Mr Cromarty's subjective circumstances, there was evidence that he suffered from osteoarthritis. Further, his Honour determined that Mr Cromarty would not re-offend. He believed, therefore, that personal deterrence should not play a part in determining an appropriate sentence. Mr Cromarty pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. His Honour allowed a 25% discount on sentence. 
     
      
    54 His Honour said that he regarded the case as ""somewhat exceptional and unique"" (R/S 29). Taking account of Mr Cromarty's subjective circumstances and the objective criminality, his Honour said this: (R/S 28) 
     
      
       
        
        ""So far as the nature of the sentences are concerned, I am of the view that custodial sentences are called for. However, for reasons which I will give shortly I am of the view that the longest of those sentences relating to count 1 in the indictment should be a sentence of three years and should be served by way of periodic detention."" 
        
       
       
      The Complaints of the Crown. 
       
      
    55 The Crown submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, both in its overall length and in the manner in which it is to be served. It drew attention to the size and nature of the weaponry in respect of each count. Whilst Mr Cromarty may not have been trafficking in illegal weapons, he was certainly conscious of his obligations under each Act, and understood the security risk that he ran. The fact that he was obsessed by firearms may be an explanation for his offending behaviour. It is not, in the Crown submission, a matter in mitigation. 
     
      
    56 It was further submitted that his Honour erroneously characterised the sole objective of s51D of the Firearms Act as the punishment of criminals warehousing illegal firearms. The objective was much broader than that. It included ""the illegal firearm market"". Firearms may find their way onto that market through the stockpiling of weapons where the stockpile is vulnerable. 
     
      
    57 His Honour, it was suggested, placed too much weight upon the subjective features of Mr Cromarty's case and too little on the objective seriousness of his offending behaviour. Moreover, in his description and assessment of the subjective case, his Honour, according to the Crown, erroneously characterised certain aspects as mitigating features. The Crown said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The legislation provides ample room for those with a legitimate interest in firearms for sporting, occupational or historical purposes to satisfy those interests. The fact that the respondent is distressed by the lawful seizure of these weapons and by the fact that he must now face the consequences of his behaviour was erroneously treated by the sentencing judge as a mitigating feature."" 
        
       
      
    58 Finally, the Crown drew attention to Count 3 which concerned the ten pistols in Mr Cromarty's possession where the serial number had been erased. Mr Cromarty, on any view, was a meticulous man. He cleaned and repaired each weapon as it was received. He would have noticed at once the erasure of the serial number. On the Crown submission, this was a worrying aspect of his behaviour, given the attraction of such weapons to criminals. It justified some accumulation in the sentences which were imposed. 
     
      
       
      The Respondent's Submissions. 
       
      
    59 It was submitted on behalf of Mr Cromarty (the respondent) that, properly assessed, the objective criminality of Mr Cromarty was ""towards the lower end of the scale of criminality for offences of this kind"". There was no evidence whatever that he traded in guns. Both the probation officer and the psychologist emphasised that he had ""no sinister intent"". Accordingly, the penalty imposed was within sound sentencing discretion. Mr Cromarty was a decent and honest, if somewhat reclusive, individual, who was well regarded within the community. His house was a ""virtual fortress"". He was rarely absent from the premises. ""Virtually nobody knew of his collection.""  
     
      
    60 His Honour, in the respondent's submission, provided lengthy and careful reasons, having reserved his judgment. His Honour well appreciated, according to counsel for Mr Cromarty, the potentially serious consequences of the respondent's conduct. However, he also recognised that no actual harm had been caused. No error has been shown or, alternatively, the Court in its discretion, would refrain from disturbing the sentence which had been passed. 
     
      
       
      The Objective Criminality of Mr Cromarty. 
       
      
    61 His Honour accurately characterised the offences as serious. The maximum penalty under Count 1 was 20 years imprisonment. Significant terms of imprisonment have been fixed in respect of the remaining counts. In R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, Howie J said this: (para 11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the sentencing court must be reminded that the maximum penalty is a reflection of the seriousness with which the public through the legislature considers the type of criminal conduct with which it is concerned:  
        H 
         (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65. It is through the maximum penalty that the legislature manifests its policy and it is the initial consideration when determining the appropriate sentence:  
        Oliver 
         (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177."" 
        
       
      
    62 Elsewhere his Honour made the following statement in R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253: (para 19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... a consideration of the maximum penalty prescribed by an offence is fundamental to a determination of the appropriate sentence to be imposed ... it represents the public's view of the seriousness of the crime."" 
        
       
      
    63 Nonetheless, the maximum penalty is plainly directed at the worst class of case (Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451/2). The offences committed by Mr Cromarty cannot be so described. How serious, then, were these offences? 
     
      
    64 First, it is important that Mr Cromarty knew that he was in breach of the law. It was, as his Honour remarked, ""a flagrant breach"". Mr Duffield, the probation and parole officer, said this: (Exhibit A) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is no doubt Cromarty would have been quite aware of the illegal nature of his activities. He is very well versed on the gun laws and has very strong negative views about them. It seems he chose to ignore the illegality of his behaviour but it is strongly felt he had no sinister intent."" 
        
       
      
    65 Secondly, the following statement by his Honour significantly understated, to my mind, the criminality in respect of Count 2 (the possession of 45 rifles and 58 pistols which were unregistered): (R/S 24) 
     
      
       
        
        ""However, as I said, it must be borne in mind that, particularly in relation to the weapons described in count 2 in the indictment, by virtue of his licence the offender was perfectly entitled to possess them had he simply registered them."" 
        
       
      
    66 The Firearms Act was part of a national initiative. Registration of each firearm, and authorisation to possess that firearm by an appropriate licence or permit, were the chosen means of control. When applying for a licence, an applicant was obliged to provide the following information: (s18(2) Firearms Act) 
     
      
       
        
        ""18(2) A licence must: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) contain a recent photograph of the person to whom it is issued (such photograph being obtained in accordance with arrangements determined by the Commissioner), and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) bear the signature of the licensee, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) specify the licence category, and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) specify (except in the case of a firearms dealer licence) the registered firearm or firearms to which the licence relates, and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) specify the genuine reason for which the person was issued with the licence, and 
        
       
       
        
        (f)  
        (Repealed) 
        
       
       
        
        (g) specify (in the case of a firearms dealer licence) the premises where the firearm is authorised to be kept, and 
        
       
       
        
        (h) contain a reference to the requirements under this Act relating to the storage and safe keeping of the firearm, and 
        
       
       
        
        (i) contain such other detail as may be prescribed by the regulations."" 
        
       
      
    67 A licence, when issued, may be subject to conditions (s19(1)), including requirements in respect of the safekeeping and storage of firearms (s19(2)(a)). The refusal of Mr Cromarty to comply with these provisions defeated the attempt by this legislation to impose strict control upon possession and safe keeping of firearms (cf s3(1) of the Firearms Act: supra paras 14 and 15). 
     
      
    68 Thirdly, it cannot be doubted that Mr Cromarty well appreciated the security risk which his arsenal created. In 1996 Mr Cromarty's home was invaded by three masked intruders, one armed with a sawn-off 12 gauge shotgun. Mr Cromarty described what occurred in these words: (T24) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. ... all I was told was get down. They want me on the ground and then fortunately the bloke decided that he didn't like what he'd seen and he left, tripping over his mates doing it."" 
        
       
      
    69 Mr Cromarty elaborated: (T24) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. ... I had a safe there, full of guns, and the police asked me what were they there for and I said I don't know, all that was said to me was get down and I said to the officer that actually took the statement that you are glad that they didn't get the safe open, that is what they wanted. Because on the following Friday, that was Tuesday night, and the following Friday they robbed the National Australia Bank in Warners Bay, with a sawn-off shotgun and with a knife I think the other bloke was supposed to have had. I would say it was the same people."" 
        
       
      
    70 Mr Cromarty recognised that authority to possess the firearms which were prohibited under Schedule 1 would not be given unless the firearms were rendered permanently inoperable. He also recognised that to register the weapons which were not prohibited would draw attention to the extent of his collection. He said this: (T21) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. ... I had a good relations with the police, I minded my own business and kept out of their way and they left me alone as such, and you just don't want to draw attention, getting checks and all that all the time. That's the reason I didn't actually apply."" 
        
       
      
    71 With some hyperbole, the respondent's submissions described Mr Cromarty's home as ""a fortress"". It certainly was not a fortress. It was a suburban home with limited security. The back to base alarm, even were it activated, inevitably involved delay. It may offer little protection if, as occurred in 1996, intruders entered the premises whilst Mr Cromarty was there. The premises, moreover, were unoccupied from time to time, although less often after the home invasion than before. To some degree, after that invasion, Mr Cromarty became a prisoner in his own home, precisely because he recognised the security risk which his stockpile created. 
     
      
    72 The following submission was made on Mr Cromarty's behalf: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Virtually nobody knew of his collection - it was kept a closely guarded secret. The respondent himself was only rarely away from the premises."" 
        
       
      
    73 It may be accepted that nobody, apart from Mr Cromarty, knew the full extent of his collection. However, it cannot be doubted that many knew that Mr Cromarty had an extensive collection. He had acquired the firearms and weapons in that collection over a number of years. His account of the way in which that occurred was vague. People would come to his home because they knew of his interest in guns. That reputation, and the sheer size of his collection, suggests, to my mind, that the existence of the collection was not ""a closely guarded secret"". One would also infer from the operation of the police, when they executed the search warrant, that they had information suggesting a significant violation of the provisions of the Act. 
     
      
    74 These are matters which go to the objective seriousness of the criminality in these offences. However, on the credit side, two things should be said. First, although there was unquestionably a risk to public safety through the accumulation and possession of such an arsenal, that risk did not materialise. The weapons did not fall into the hands of criminals. They were seized by the police. 
     
      
    75 Secondly, his Honour, as mentioned, also found that Mr Cromarty was not engaged in the trade in illegal weapons. The Crown challenged that finding, drawing attention to the following statement in the report of Dr Peters: (Exhibit 1: 5) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Ian has no other financial plan in respect to his superannuation, but rather has invested all his money in developing a collection that would only increase in value as years passed. In taking this away he has lost his 'nest egg' for his later years. Likewise revoking his license has effectively prevented him from making a living. At his age he is quite unlikely to be able to turn his hand to anything else."" 
        
       
      
    76 The ""nest egg"" was valued at something like $300,000. Quite how it was to have been realised was not explored, either by Dr Peters or during the sentencing hearing. During argument on the appeal there was discussion about possible ways in which the ""nest egg"" could have been lawfully realised. One way was by surrendering the weapons during any renewed amnesty (and accepting compensation at the then market value), or opening a museum. Prohibited firearms within a collection must be rendered permanently inoperable (as prescribed by regulation) and all other firearms temporarily inoperable by the removal of the bolt or firing mechanism or the use of an approved trigger lock (s20 Firearms Act). 
     
      
    77 Two other possibilities were canvassed, neither attractive. It was said that it may have been possible to sell the firearms or weapons interstate or overseas. That would seem unlikely, since the legislation was passed as part of a national drive to control weapons throughout Australia. The legislation interstate is broadly similar to that in New South Wales. There are penalties in the Firearms Act for conspiring to commit offences outside New South Wales (s51C). 
     
      
    78 The second suggestion was no more attractive. It involved Mr Cromarty selling his firearms and weapons to a compliant dealer who would then have 24 hours (without committing an offence) to register them, at which point they could be sold. 
     
      
    79 It is clear on the evidence that Mr Cromarty had not, in the past, engaged in the trade of unregistered or prohibited weapons. The position in the future is less clear. However, it is reasonable to suppose that Mr Cromarty would not sell into the black market. One infers that he had not quite thought through how he might benefit from the collection which he had amassed.  
     
      
       
      Principles to be Applied. 
       
      
    80 Before dealing with the Crown's submissions, and the response made on behalf of Mr Cromarty, it is useful to state briefly the principles which should guide the resolution of these issues. 
     
      
    81 The principles in respect of Crown appeals are not in doubt. They were stated by this Court in R v Allpass (1994) 72 A Crim R 561 (Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and McInerney J) in these terms: (at 562) 
     
      
       
        
        ""1. A Court of Criminal Appeal which is dealing with an appeal against sentence does not simply embark upon the task of sentencing afresh, substituting its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge, and increasing the sentence if it considers it to be inadequate, or decreasing the sentence if it considers it to be excessive. An appellate court will only interfere if it is demonstrated that the sentencing judge fell into material error of law or fact. Such error may appear in the reasons given by the sentencing judge, or the sentence itself may be manifestly excessive or inadequate, and thus disclose error. However, the facts and circumstances of individual cases are often such that sentencing judges have a substantial discretion, and the appellate court does not intervene simply upon the basis that the members of that court would have exercised their discretion differently from the judge at first instance. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Crown appeals against sentence are relatively infrequent. The High Court has said that such appeals 'should be a rarity':  
        Griffiths 
         (1977) 137 CLR 293 at 310;  
        Malvaso 
         (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234; 43 A Crim R 451 at 456. One reason for this is the element of double jeopardy that is involved in such appeals. Rules designed to safeguard against double jeopardy are deeply embedded in our system of criminal justice: eg  
        Dodd 
         (1991) 56 A Crim R 451;  
        Environment Protection Authority v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd  
        (1992) 28 NSWLR 502. Thus, for example, there is usually no right of Crown appeal against an acquittal at a trial. 
        
       
       
        
        3. If a Crown appeal against sentence is successful, and the appellate court resentences the respondent, it does so in the light of all the facts and circumstances as at the time of resentencing. Events which have occurred after the original sentencing may be relevant. 
        
       
       
        
        4. When, in response to a Crown appeal, the court decides to resentence an offender, it ordinarily gives recognition to the element of double jeopardy involved (in twice standing for sentence) by imposing a sentence that is somewhat less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance. 
        
       
       
        
        5. An appellate court has an overriding discretion which may lead it to decline to intervene, even if it comes to the conclusion that error has been shown in the original sentencing process. In this connection the conduct of the Crown at the original sentencing proceedings may be a matter of significance."" 
        
       
      
    82 In determining an appropriate sentence, his Honour was obliged to have regard to the principle of proportionality, that is, that the sentence was required to encompass all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender considered together (R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, per Spigelman CJ at 276). In Whyte the Chief Justice said this: (at 277) 
     
      
       
        
        ""153 The role of objective circumstances in the test of proportionality was emphasised in the joint judgment of the High Court in  
        Hoare v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354: '... a basic principle of sentencing law is that a sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court should never exceed that which can be justified as appropriate or proportionate to the gravity of the crime considered in the light of its  
        objective 
         circumstances'. [Emphasis in original.]"" 
        
       
      
    83 Spigelman CJ then stated the further implication of the principle of proportionality in these terms: (at 277) 
     
      
       
        
        ""156 The reasoning in  
        Hoare 
         appears to me to necessarily involve separate consideration of the sentence appropriate to the objective circumstances of the offence. Although expressed as an upper limit - a sentence cannot be greater than the objective circumstance suggest - it has been applied to create a lower limit - a sentence should not be less than the objective circumstances require."" 
        
       
      
    84 In R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349, Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J in a joint judgment, said this: (at 354) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... making due allowance for all relevant considerations, there ought to be a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and we consider that it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place. Each crime, as  
        Veen (No 2) 
         (198) 164 CLR 465 at 472; 33 A Crim R 230 at 234 stresses, has its own objective gravity meriting at the most a sentence proportionate to that gravity, the maximum sentence fixed by the legislature defining the limits of sentence for cases in the most grave category. The relative importance of the objective facts and subjective features of a case will vary: see, for example, the passage from the judgment of Street CJ in  
        Todd 
         [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 quoted in  
        Mill 
         (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 64; 36 A Crim R 468. Even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case."" 
        
       
      
    85 In R v Zamagias (supra) Howie J included a useful exposition on the separate issues which a sentencing Judge must confront under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999. Paraphrasing his Honour's words, the following propositions can be stated. 
     
      
    · First, there are a number of steps in the determination of an appropriate sentence. Each step requires a consideration of the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender. 
     
      
    · Secondly, a preliminary question must be asked and answered, namely: Are there any alternatives to a term of imprisonment? 
     
      
    · Thirdly, if the Court determines that there is no alternative to imprisonment, it must then determine the length of the term of imprisonment. That determination must be made without regard to the manner in which the sentence may be served (whether by home detention or periodic detention) or whether the term should be suspended. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, the Court should then consider if an alternative to full time custody is appropriate. In making that determination the Court must recognise that the alternatives to full time custody involve a significant element of leniency. The appropriateness of an alternative to full time custody will depend upon many factors including, importantly, whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment, including deterrence and denunciation. 
     
      
       
       
      Was there error? 
       
      
    86 There is no question that his Honour faced a difficult sentencing task. I believe three criticisms can be made of his Honour's sentencing remarks. First, his Honour, to my mind, appeared seriously to understate the criminality involved in failing to register firearms and weapons which he was authorised to possess (supra para 64). Secondly, although the primary object of s51D, introduced in 2002, may have been the punishment of criminals who warehouse illegal firearms, the objective was, I believe, broader than that. The measures, as the Minister announced in his Second Reading Speech, were ""designed to inhibit the illegal supply of firearms"". The purpose of the amendments extended to the stockpiling of weapons, as happened here, where that stockpile was vulnerable and, if violated, may feed the market in the illegal supply of firearms. Thirdly, I accept the Crown's submission (supra para 56) that his Honour appeared to regard certain matters as mitigating features (the grief at the lawful seizure of his collection of weapons) whereas in truth they were not. 
     
      
    87 I have characterised each of these matters as a criticism of his Honour's remarks, rather than an error. His Honour's lengthy and careful remarks did not misstate any sentencing principle. The ""criticisms"" may suggest that his Honour may have undervalued the objective gravity of the criminality of Mr Cromarty or overvalued his subjective case. 
     
      
    88 Turning, then, to whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate, being new legislation there is little guidance from the caselaw or statistics (cf Wood CJ at CL in R v Penisini [2003] NSWSC 892, paras 96-100). It also has to be acknowledged, as his Honour said, that the case is unusual. 
     
      
    89 However, to my mind the objective gravity of these offences, and especially Count 1, was such that they called for a sentence which unmistakably denounced the conduct, a sentence which would operate as a deterrent to likeminded offenders. A sentence to be served by way of periodic detention did not achieve these objectives. I believe, with respect, that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. To my mind error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
       
      Resentencing. 
       
      
    90 I believe the Court should intervene to resentence Mr Cromarty. Being a Crown appeal, the sentence that should now be imposed is not simply one which the Court may otherwise believe appropriate were it sentencing the offender for the first time. The fact of double jeopardy is recognised. The sentence substituted should be towards the lower end of the range of available sentences (Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321, per Kirby J at 341). The Crown at first instance did not oppose a finding of special circumstances. The Crown has reaffirmed that attitude on this appeal, were a sentence of full time custody imposed. I believe a finding of special circumstances is justified. Mr Cromarty is now 62 years old. He has health problems. He has not previously been in custody. 
     
      
    91 Mr Cromarty, in accordance with the sentence imposed by his Honour, has attended each Friday for periodic detention. He first did so on 4 October 2003 at the Detention Centre at Tomago. The dislocation to his life in doing so extends beyond the actual days of incarceration. Although there is an element of leniency, I would propose that the sentence should commence on 4 October 2003. 
     
      
    92 I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. That the appeal be allowed. 
       
       
      2. That the sentence imposed by Coolahan DCJ on 24 September 2003 be quashed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Simpson J: I agree with Sperling J. 
     
      
    2 Sperling J: Following a trial before Murrell DCJ and a jury, the appellant was convicted on five counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 10 years of age, four counts of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16 years and two counts of indecent assault. 
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against conviction. 
     
      
    4 In passages from the summing up and the transcript quoted in this judgment I have substituted “the complainant” for the name of the child and “the father” for the name of her father. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    5 The principal evidence on which the appellant was convicted was that of the complainant, who was 14 years of age at the time of the trial, and that of her father. The critical evidence was, however, that of the complainant herself. This was made clear by the trial judge in the following passages in the summing up to the jury.  
     
      
       
        
        18 In this trial, in the case of each charge, the Crown case depends upon you accepting in substance the evidence of one person, that is the complainant... Therefore you should scrutinise all of the evidence of the complainant on each charge very carefully. Before determining whether you are prepared to accept her evidence on the critical matters about which she has given evidence, you should examine the complainant’s evidence in the context of the accused’s evidence and the other evidence in the case. 
        
       
       
        
        19 Apart from the complainant’s evidence, the rest of the Crown evidence in the trial is peripheral and is there to assist you to resolve the fundamental question of whether, in relation to each alleged incident, you are prepared to accept the evidence of [the complainant] in relation to the critical aspects of that evidence. 
        
       
      
    6 In the course of her evidence, the complainant gave evidence, in general terms, of a course of sexual conduct on the part of the appellant towards her which were not themselves the subject of any one or more of the charges. I will refer to that evidence as “relationship evidence”.  
     
      
       
      Addresses 
       
      
    7 In his address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor said only the following concerning the relationship evidence (Tr 17.3.03, pp 2-3): 
     
      
       
        
        Overall if you look at what she says it is of a history of sexual molestation over a long period of time. Shorn of its detail and in summary that’s what it is that was the proposition that [the father] says he put to the accused at that meeting and which he says the accused admitted. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not an admission to any particular charge but of the nature of the relationship that had existed an inappropriate sexual relationship. Similarly the phone call in which the accused, according to [the father], offered to pay for the counselling which was being undertaken by [the complainant] at that time I suggest again is an admission of that relationship, a consciousness of guilt, if you like, of that relationship.  
        
       
      
    8 In his address to the jury, the appellant’s counsel said only the following concerning the relationship evidence (Tr 18.3.03 p 9): 
     
      
       
        
        Taken at its highest for the prosecution, that is accepting every word of [the father]’s version and rejecting every word of Kenneth Hagarty’s, what is the value, what is the significance of this evidence? It is not a confession to the events of any count in the indictment. It is placed before you by the prosecution as one strand of what the prosecution contend for as evidence of the relationship, the context of the relationship between [the complainant] and Mr Hagarty. 
        
       
       
      Directions 
       
      
    9 In her summing up, her Honour gave the following directions to the jury concerning the relationship evidence given by the complainant. 
     
      
       
        
        32 I am now giving you directions about this evidence of general sexual incidents which are not the subject matter of a particular charge. If you accept the complainant’s evidence that these other incidents did occur, then you may see them as providing a background to the alleged offences, as showing the nature of the relationship between the accused and the complainant at the time of the alleged offences, and as placing the complainant’s allegations in a realistic context in that the alleged offences were not isolated incidents which occurred out of the blue. 
        
       
       
        
        33 However, even if there was a background of other incidents of sexual impropriety occurring, that background cannot be relied on as tending to establish that any of the particular offences in fact occurred. You cannot use the evidence as tending to show that, at the time of the alleged offences, the accused had wrongful sexual feelings towards the complainant and, therefore, it is more likely that he committed the offences in question. 
        
       
       
        
        34 The evidence of general sexual impropriety is just background which puts the alleged offences into context in that, if you accept that this background of sexual impropriety existed, the alleged offences did not arise out of the blue. 
        
       
      
    10 The evidence of the complainant’s father was summarised in the summing up as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        35 I now intend to talk to you about the way in which you should approach the evidence of [the father] concerning alleged admissions made by the accused to him. Now, in this case … the complainant’s father gave evidence that in early August 1994 he confronted the accused with the allegation that the accused had been sexually molesting [the complainant] for some time and the accused said “Yes, Bob, that’s true.” He also said, “I don’t know what got into me, I’m truly sorry.”, and he offered to help. The accused, according to [the father], then asked [the father] whether he intended to report the matter to police and [the father] says that some days later there was an offer to pay for counselling for [the complainant]. 
        
       
      
    11 Her Honour directed the jury concerning the limited use they could make of that evidence. 
     
      
       
        
        38 If, after considering the warning which I have given, you do accept the evidence of [the father] and find that the statements were made by the accused, then you could treat them as admissions by the accused that he engaged in sexual molestation of [the complainant] for some time. The accusation was put to [the complainant] in very general terms and nothing said by the accused could be interpreted as an admission that a particular act of sexual misconduct occurred. You could treat the admissions as corroborating or backing up [the complainant]’s evidence that there was an improper sexual relationship between herself and the accused, i.e. that there was a background of incidents of sexual impropriety. However, you could not use the accused’s admissions as tending to establish that any particular offence actually occurred because the admission was made to an accusation put in such general terms. You could not use the accused’s admissions as tending to show that it was more likely that he committed particular offences. 
        
       
       
      Further direction sought 
       
      
    12 In the course of the summing up, counsel for the appellant sought a direction that the standard of proof applicable to the relationship evidence was proof beyond reasonable doubt. Her Honour declined to give that direction. 
     
      
       
      The ground of appeal 
       
      
    13 The notice of appeal specifies a single ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
        The trial judge erred in directing the jury that, if they accepted the evidence that the appellant had made admissions, they could use the evidence to prove that the appellant had an improper sexual relationship with the complainant. 
        
       
      
    14 There was no application to amend or supplement that ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The law relating to relationship evidence 
       
      
    15 In B (1992) 175 CLR 599 Deane J said (at 610): 
     
      
       
        
        The evidence that the applicant had committed acts of sexual indecency upon his infant daughter in the past was, in my view, admissible against him on his trial for similar acts of sexual indecency which he had allegedly committed upon the same daughter while she was still under sixteen years. Once that evidence was adduced, the jury was entitled to use it against, as well as for, the applicant. It was, on any approach, the key to an assessment of the relationship between the applicant and the daughter and, as such, constituted part of the essential background against which both the daughter’s and the applicant’s evidence of the alleged offences necessarily fell to be evaluated (See, eg,  
        Plomp v The Queen 
         (1963), 110 CLR 234, at p 242). Particularly in a context where the applicant was accused of unnatural acts (See, eg,  
        Mutual Life Insurance Co of New York v Moss  
        (1906), 4 CLR 311, at p 317;  
        Plomp v The Queen  
        (1963), 110 CLR, at p 249), it was capable of being seen by the jury as important evidence of motive, namely, sexual gratification. The jury was also entitled to accept it as providing corroboration of the daughter’s evidence: it supported the truth of the allegation which was implicit in the whole of the daughter’s evidence, namely, that the applicant entertained an unnatural passion for her. 
        
       
      
    16 Plomp, referred to in the foregoing passage, so far as is relevant, was a decision relating to motive, particularly at the page references specified by Deane J in the foregoing passage. 
     
      
    17 Wickham (Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 December 1991, unreported) involved two charges of carnal knowledge of the appellant’s daughter. Gleeson CJ (with whom Carruthers and Mathews JJ agreed) reviewed the facts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The alleged acts of carnal knowledge the subject of the first trial took place in 1983 and 1984, when the complainant was aged fourteen and fifteen years respectively. As is not uncommon in cases such as this, the complainant did not suggest that these were two isolated instances but, on the contrary, asserted that the appellant had intercourse with her regularly from early 1983 until August 1984. There was, moreover, a much more extensive history of sexual contact between the appellant and the complainant which, she said, began when she was about four years of age and continued thereafter. 
        
       
       
      Later in the judgment, Gleeson CJ said in relation to evidence of conduct other than the offences charged –  
       
       
        
        In many cases it will go beyond merely demonstrating a propensity or disposition to commit crime, or crime of a particular kind. 
        
       
       
        
        As in the present case, such evidence will often be relevant, and tend to make more credible the evidence of the complainant, in at least two ways. (Questions of fact and degree may be involved, and these two ways are not intended to be exhaustive). 
        
       
       
        
        First, the evidence may establish a sexual relationship which makes the complainant’s allegations more likely to be true. 
        
       
       
        
        … … … 
        
       
       
        
        The relationship in question need not be completely mutual, and the emotions or tendencies involved need not be shared for there to be a relevant relationship. The expression “guilty passion” is sometimes used in relation to an accused. It conveys an idea that most people would recognise as being of significance in determining whether a particular incident of a sexual nature has occurred. If past conduct shows that a child is an object of a parent’s sexual desire then that may well make more credible an allegation that a particular alleged sexual incident occurred between them. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the evidence may constitute an essential aid to the understanding of an account or description of words or conduct. It will often be the case that it would be difficult, or impossible, to understand, or appreciate the full significance of, a complainant’s account of the events relating to a particular incident without knowing what had gone before. A bare description of the conduct the subject of a particular charge may be difficult to evaluate, and perhaps misleading, if it stood alone as an account of an apparently isolated incident. As pointed out earlier, the present case provides an example. 
        
       
      
    18 In Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510, Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Finlay and Levine JJ agreed) said (at 515): 
     
      
       
        
        The true bases for the admissibility of evidence of sexual activity between the complainant and the accused other than that which is the subject of the charge were analysed in some detail most recently by this Court in  
        R v Wickham 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 17 December 1991, unreported). The evidence is admissible, first, in order to establish a sexual relationship which makes the complainant’s allegation more likely to be true. The “guilty passion” of the adult for the child which such conduct shows may well make more credible the complainant’s evidence that the sexual activity took place upon the particular occasion which is the subject of the charge. In other words, it makes it more likely that the offence charged was in fact committed:  
        Martin v Osborne 
         (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 376 (Dixon J);  
        Harriman v The Queen 
         (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 631 (McHugh J);  
        B v The Queen 
         (at 602, 609, 610-611, 618). Secondly, the evidence is admissible in order to place the evidence of the offence charged into a true and realistic context, in order to assist the jury to appreciate the full significance of what would otherwise appear to be an isolated act occurring without any apparent reason.  
        R v Wickham  
        provides a very good example of how the act of sexual intercourse which was the subject of the charge would have appeared to be astonishing, and almost unbelievable, if the jury had not been made aware of the existing sexual relationship between the adult accused and the child complainant. Such evidence provides the key to an assessment of the relationship between them and, as such, constitutes part of the essential background against which the evidence of the complainant and the version of the accused necessarily falls to be evaluated:  
        B v The Queen 
         (at 610): see also (at 602-603; 605). 
        
       
       
      (The last reference to  
      B 
       is curious. At each of the pages there specified, the court was dealing with evidence about motive, which is germane to the first of the two bases mentioned by Hunt CJ at CL rather than to the second.)  
       
      
    19 The first of the two bases specified in Beserick, upon which it was said that relationship evidence may be admissible, corresponds with what was said in that regard in Wickham but, as to the second of those bases, the concept is more expansive in Beserick. In Wickham, it was said that the evidence of what went before may be relevant as an aid to the understanding, in its full significance, of an account or description of words or conduct constituting the offence charged. In Beserick, the relevance of such other evidence was also supported as rendering plausible what would otherwise be implausible.  
     
      
    20 Whatever the provenance and rationale of the formulation of principle in Beserick, that formulation has become entrenched in the law of evidence in this state: see for example MM (2000) 112 A Crim R 519, per Powell JA (with whom Hulme and Dowd JJ agreed), at 537-8.  
     
      
    21 In Gipp (1998) 194 CLR 106, it was said, by Gaudron J at [12] and by McHugh and Hayne JJ at [73], that, in the circumstances of that case, the history of sexual conduct by the appellant towards the plaintiff was relevant and admissible as helping to explain the complainant’s apparent lack of surprise about the appellant’s conduct on the occasion relied on as constituting the offence charged, and as helping to explain the complainant’s failure to mention the incident to her mother and the appellant’s apparent confidence that the complainant would regard the incident as nothing unusual.  
     
      
    22 Obviously enough, the way in which relationship evidence may be relevant will vary from case to case. 
     
      
    23 A clear distinction has, accordingly, been drawn by the authorities between the use of relationship evidence as evidence of what has variously been described as tendency or propensity evidence and the use of such evidence for other purposes. As stated by McHugh and Hayne JJ in Gipp (at [77]), if the evidence is tendered to prove propensity, there is a need for careful direction in accordance with principles emphasised in numerous cases such as Pfennig (1995) 182 CLR 461. Where such evidence is admitted for other reasons, a different kind of direction is required. What is needed in relation to that direction appears from the following extract from the judgment of McHugh and Hayne JJ in Gipp:  
     
      
       
        
        77 Moreover, as  
        BRS v The Queen 
         (1997) 191 CLR 275 shows, if evidence admitted for reasons other than propensity in fact reveals a criminal or reprehensible propensity on the part of the accused, a trial judge must carefully direct the jury as to the use which they can make of the evidence  
        (BRS  
        at 305-306). In  
        BRS 
         (at 
          
        305) 
        , 
         McHugh J pointed out:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            “If the evidence is admitted for a reason other than reliance on propensity, the judge must direct the jury that they can use the evidence for the relevant purpose and for no other purpose. In some cases, the judge may need to be more specific. He or she may need to direct the jurors that they cannot use the evidence for an identified purpose. If the evidence is admitted because the Crown wishes to rely on the accused’s propensity as an element in the chain of proof, it is especially necessary that the judge give the jurors clear directions as to the manner in which they may use the propensity evidence.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        78 In this case, the learned judge correctly directed the jury that the background evidence went to show the nature of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant so that they could understand the context of the incidents that were the subject of the charges. No doubt, it would have been better if his Honour had gone further and expressly told the jury that, if they found that there was a previous or continuing history of incidents, they were not to use that finding to reason that the accused committed the offences charged. But his Honour’s failure to take that further step does not mean that he necessarily misdirected the jury or that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory or that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Having regard to the conduct of the case and the rest of his Honour’s summing up, there is no reason to suppose that the jury might have used the general behaviour evidence as propensity evidence. Neither counsel nor the judge suggested that course. Furthermore, the whole thrust of the summing up was that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant’s evidence in respect of each incident was reliable. 
        
       
      
    24 As to burden of proof, the following are extracts from the judgment of McHugh and Hayne JJ in Gipp: 
     
      
       
        
        76 If the evidence of sexual history had been directed to specific incidents, although not the subject of charges, the learned judge would have been entitled to direct the jury that if they found one or more of those incidents proved, they could use such a finding or findings as proof of a “guilty passion” in support of the charges in the indictment  
        R v Ball 
         [1911] AC 47 at 71;  
        O’Leary v The King 
         (1946) 73 CLR 566 at 575, 577, 582;  
        R v Hissey 
         (1973) 6 SASR 280 at 288-289. In that event, it would have been necessary to direct the jury that these incidents as well as the charges had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        … … … 
        
       
       
        
        79 No doubt it would also have been better if his Honour had made no mention of the standard of proof when referring to the background evidence. But his Honour’s statement was not a misdirection. It is the charge, not the surrounding facts, that must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Sometimes, a fact may be so indispensable to a finding of guilt that it is necessary to direct the jury that that finding be proved beyond reasonable doubt even though that fact is not one of the ultimate facts that constitute the offence. But, as Dawson J pointed out in  
        Shepherd v The Queen  
        (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579 where:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            “the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so.”  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          That statement was made with respect to circumstantial evidence but is equally applicable to a case such as the present. 
          
         
        
       
      
    25 A distinction is sharply drawn. Where, as here, general evidence of prior conduct is led otherwise than as evidence of tendency, the criminal standard of proof does not apply. 
     
      
       
      First argument against conviction 
       
      
    26 It was submitted that the jury should have been instructed not to make any finding of fact at all concerning the conduct which was the subject of the relationship evidence in this case. It was argued that evidence of that kind should be received for no more than the assertions made in the witness box and not as evidence of the truth of what is asserted.  
     
      
    27 There was said to be an analogy with the law concerning evidence of complaint as it was prior to the Evidence Act 1995. Such evidence was then received as evidence of the fact of making the complaint at the time when the complaint was made, but not as evidence of the truth of what was stated in the complaint.28 The analogy is inapposite. Relationship evidence is not relevant for the fact that the assertions are made when the evidence is given. It is relevant for the facts asserted in the evidence.29 Rule 4 applies, but the argument should be rejected for lack of merit. 
     
      
       
      Second argument against conviction 
       
      
    30 It was submitted that the trial judge should have directed the jury that the legal standard of proof concerning relationship evidence is proof beyond reasonable doubt.31 The argument is outside the scope of the ground of appeal but, in the absence of objection, the court received it. 
     
      
    32 As indicated above, the direction was sought at the trial. So Rule 4 does not apply.33 The relationship evidence in the present case was not relied on as tendency evidence and was not indispensable to the proof of guilt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt was not required. 
     
      
    34 This argument should accordingly be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Third argument against conviction 
       
      
    35 In relation to the evidence of the complainant’s father concerning the appellant’s admission of having molested the complainant, it was submitted that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that they should not use the evidence as tendency evidence in sufficiently clear and affirmative terms. 
     
      
    36 This argument was outside the scope of the ground of appeal. Again, however, in the absence of objection, we entertained the argument. 
     
      
    37 No further direction along these lines was sought at the trial. Rule 4 applies. However, the argument can suitably be dealt with by leave on its merits. 
     
      
    38 At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the applicant submitted a draft direction as a convenient way of conveying to the court what was asserted to be the deficiency in the trial judge’s directions. The draft was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The only use which you may make of this evidence is to support the evidence of the complainant regarding a history of sexual molestation, which as I explained is only put before you to place the complainant’s allegations in a realistic context in that the alleged offences were not isolated incidents which occurred out of the blue. The evidence of this improper sexual relationship is relied upon by the Crown to explain what otherwise might be incomprehensible, that is, the complainant’s apparent lack of surprise and reaction to the incidents charged, why she continued to remain in contact with the accused and why she failed to complain until she was 12 years old. 
        
       
       
        
        I direct you that you may not use the evidence in any other way than the way I have indicated. You may not use the evidence as  
        [The word  
        “direct” 
         was added here in the course of oral submissions.]  
        evidence of the accused’s guilt of the offences charged. In particular, you are not permitted to, and must not, reason that the evidence tends to show that the accused had improper sexual feelings for the complainant and, therefore, it is more likely that he committed the offences alleged against him. While you might be attracted to such reasoning, I direct you as a matter of law that you are not permitted to reason in this way. You may only use the evidence to explain what otherwise might be incomprehensible about the complainant’s account. 
        
       
      
    39 The draft has three features which distinguish it from the directions given by the trial judge concerning the evidence of admissions by the appellant. First, it refers to “sexual molestation” and to “improper sexual relationship” whereas the trial judge’s direction refers consistently to “sexual impropriety”. The trial judge’s phraseology was preferable. Secondly, the draft direction contains a fuller statement of the use which the jury was entitled to make of the relationship evidence. Secondly, it contains a more stringent direction not to use the evidence of admissions made in that regard as evidence of tendency.40 It does not follow, however, from the second and third differences that the directions given by the trial judge were deficient. In my opinion they were not. The directions in paragraphs 32 and 34 of the summing up sufficiently conveyed to the jury the way in which the relationship evidence given by the complainant could be used otherwise than as tendency evidence. In that regard, the directions incorporated the approach stated as the second basis for admissibility of such evidence in Beserick. The trial judge cannot be criticised for not going further than that, particularly in view of the scant attention given to this topic in the addresses to the jury by counsel for the accused and the Crown Prosecutor and the absence of any request for further directions. 
     
      
    41 As to the direction not to use that evidence as evidence of tendency, paragraph 33 of the summing up provided the necessary instruction with clarity and precision in relation to the complainant’s evidence. It complied fully with the requirements for such a direction laid down in Gipp. 
     
      
    42 When it then came to the evidence of admissions made by the appellant, the trial judge, in paragraph 38 of the summing up, correctly limited use of that evidence in the same way and repeated the instruction against using the evidence as evidence of tendency. Taking what appears in paragraph 38 with what appears in paragraph 33 in the same connection, the criticism of the summing up is unsustainable.43 This argument accordingly fails. 
     
      
       
      Result and proposed order 
       
      
    44 The arguments advanced in support of the appeal having failed, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    45 Bergin J: I agree with Sperling J.

     Regina v Belal HAJEID 
      
    The appellants appeal against convictions following their joint trial in the District Court before Judge Michael Finnane QC and a jury. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all Counts. The charges relate to events that happened in Northcote Park at Greenacre in the evening of 10 August 2000. At that time Bilal Skaf was aged 18, Mohamed Ghanem was 17 and Belal Hajeid was 18. All three lived at Greenacre and were friends. A joint indictment charged 14 offences alleged to have been committed upon two Year 12 students, Ms F and Ms P, who had met a group of eight males (one of whom offered to give them marijuana and lift home) at Chatswood shopping centre. Ms F and Ms P went with four of the males in a white van. One of these males was Bilal Skaf. Four other males followed in a red car. They included Ghanem and Hajeid. They all ended up at Northcote Park, where Ms F and Ms P were forced to participate in numerous acts of oral intercourse. After this the males left and Ms F and Ms P notified the police. GROUNDS OF APPEALBILAL SKAF was convicted of 14 counts involving both Ms F and Ms P. Paragraphs 4 – 41 of this judgment outline the events giving rise to each of the counts. Skaf argued five grounds of appeal. Each ground fails. Ground 1 – Skaf argued that (some of) his criminal history should not have been admitted at trial and should not have been used to establish his credibility (or lack thereof). Judge Finnane ruled that there were convictions that could enable the jury to conclude that Skaf was a person of bad character and was dishonest (para 208). The judge also was required to rule on whether the evidence of his prior convictions bore upon Skaf’s credibility. He was satisfied that the probative value of the evidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice (see para 210). The Judge ultimately did rule that the evidence was prejudical but that the issue was unfair prejudice (see para 228). The Court finds no appellable error in Judge Finnane’s rulings. The ground fails (para 230).Ground 1(a) – Skaf argued Judge Finnane was wrong to not direct the jury as to the proper use of evidence of Skaf’s bad character. However, Skaf’s counsel effectively agreed (see para 237) with a proposed direction that the criminal history could be referred to on the basis that it went to Skaf’s credit. There was no request by Skaf’s cousel for a redirection of the jury. The Court finds that no miscarriage occurred (see paras 238 – 239). The ground fails.Ground 2 – Skaf argued that Dr Humphrey’s expert opinion evidence should not have been admitted as evidence consistent with the histories given by Ms F and Ms P, who were examined by him. He said no ‘abnormal findings’ were revealed on physical examination. The Court finds that the doctor gave evidence in relation to Ms P which offended the Evidence Act (see para 297) and had the effect of bolstering Ms P’s credibility by implying that an expert opinion in some way supported her evidence. The Court finds the doctor’s evidence was neutral. The Court finds that this evidence should not have been led. If there is a Crown practice of leading such evidence whether or not the defence indicates it takes no point about the matter, it should stop (see para 298). However, the Court finds that this ground still fails (see para 299). Ground 3 – Skaf argued that cross-examination of him by Counsel caused a miscarriage of justice. Ghanem’s counsel put questions to Skaf (see para 240) that in the absence of the jury he made a cutting of the throat gesture to Chami (the driver of the red car). The Court finds the questions relevant. It was being suggested that Skaf would go to great lengths to protect his brother Mohammed and his brother’s friend Tayyab Sheikh. [Ghanem’s counsel suggested but did not establish that Chami had nominated Skaf’s brother and his friend Tayyab Sheikh as “two of the 8” people at Northcote Park (see para 90)]. The Court finds that Skaf is correct to submit that the question asked by Ghanem’s counsel was in effect an allegation of serious misconduct. But it was an allegation that had a bearing on Skaf’s credibility, a matter of vital concern to Ghanem (see para 247). The ground fails.Ground 3 (a) – Skaf argued that Judge Finnane was wrong to refuse to discharge the jury based on Ghanem’s Counsel’s address. He argued that Ghanem’s Counsel invited the jury to conclude that Skaf had made threatening gestures to Chami. The Court finds that Judge Finanne was correct in concluding that there was no irremediable prejudice to Skaf. Judge Finnane noted that Ghanem’s Counsel’s submissions involved a logical fallacy, and that he would tell the jury this “in fairly strong terms”. The Court finds that the Judge’s decision to refuse a discharge was open to him. The ground fails.MOHAMED GHANEM was convicted of 10 charges involving Ms F and Ms P. Paragraphs 4 – 41 of this judgment outline the events giving rise to each count. Ghanem argued six grounds of appeal. Each ground fails. Ground 1 – Ghanem argued that it was wrong of Judge Finnane to admit evidence of Ms F’s photoboard identification of Ghanem. The Court finds that Judge Finnane did not make a mistake when he decided to admit the evidence of Ms F’s identification. The ground fails (see paras 117 – 127).Ground 2 – Ghanem and Hajeid argued that Judge Finnane made errors in direction (para 128—158). They argued that the Judge did not inform the jury about the reasons for caution concerning identification evidence and linking that caution to specifics of the trial. The ground fails.Ground 3 – Ghanem and Hajeid argued that Judge Finnane gave inadequate directions in relation to Skaf’s evidence and that the Judge failed to give a warning as to its unreliability (para 159). The Court finds that the jury were obviously aware that Skaf’s credibility was under serious attack from all quarters, and with good justification in light of the content of his two police interviews (ERISPs). There were frequent reminders during the summing up. The clearest indication that the jury viewed him as a man of little credibility lies in the verdicts they brought against him (para 163). Ghanem and Hajeid feared that the jury drew some support from Ms F and Ms P’s evidence against them from its partial corroboration by Skaf. Ghanem argued that Judge Finnane should have told the jury that Skaf fell within a particular category and that they should use caution in deciding to accept his evidence for that reason (para 165). The Court finds no miscarriage stemmed from this unrequested warning. The ground fails.Ground 4 – Ghanem argued that the verdicts on Counts 2 (detain for advantage), 11 (physical assault – aiding and abetting) and 12 (sexual intercourse without consent, in company) were unreasonable and could not be supported on the evidence at trial. This is a complicated area of the appeal. Ghanem’s submissions are at paragraphs 254. The appeal involves submissions about the directed verdicts (paras 255 – 261) and the indictment (now amended)(see para 261). The amended indictment led to the jury being told that the man with the plaited hair who slapped Ms P “was not on trial here”. Ultimately, the Court finds this ground fails.Ground 5 – Ghanem and Hajeid argued that they should have had a separate trial. The Court finds that their trial did not miscarry because Judge Finnane refused to order a joint trial for them separate from Skaf’s trial or to discharge the jury (see paras 111 – 116). The Court finds that the interest of justice in avoiding the risk of inconsistent verdicts and in having regard to the trauma involving Ms F and Ms P participating in separate trials (if that trauma could be avoided consistent with ensuring that each acscused received a fair trial) called for a joint trial of the several counts in the indictment (para 112). The ground fails.Ground 6 – Ghanem argued that Judge Finanne gave incorrect directions about Ghanem and Hajeid’s failure to give evidence. They also argued that Judge Finnane gave incorrect directions that Tayyab Sheikh was mistaken for Hajeid (see paras 177 – 198). This is a long and quite complicated part of the appeal which cannot be satisfactorily summarised. The Court finds that Judge Finnane gave ‘exemplary’ directions. (para 197). The ground fails.BELAL HAJEID was convicted of nine counts involving Ms F and Ms P. Paragraphs 4 – 41 outline the events giving rise to each count. Hajeid argued seven grounds of appeal. Each ground fails. Ground 1 – Refusal to separate trial of Ghanem and Hajeid (see Ground 5 of Ghanem above)Ground 3 – Errors in direction (para 128 – 158) (see Ground 2 of Ghanem above)Ground 4 – Directions re: Skaf (para 159 – 176) (see Ground 3 of Ghanem above)Ground 5 and 5A – (see Ground 6 of Ghanem above)Ground 8(b) and 8(c) – Hajeid argued that his verdicts were unreasonable. Hajeid accepts that there was evidence that he was present at the park. Evidence of three phone calls from Skaf to Hajeid support the case that Hajeid was in the red car (see para 275). However, Hajeid submits that it was unreasonable to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he was an accessory to the offences against Ms F (Counts 1, 4 – 9). The Court finds that there is sufficient evidence to sustain the convictions on the way the case was fought at trial (see para 277). FORMAL ORDER OF THE COURTEach appeal against conviction is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
     
    1 THE COURT: The appellants challenge convictions following a trial in the District Court before Judge Finnane QC and a jury. 
     
      
       
      
    2 The charges relate to events that happened in a park at Greenacre in the evening of 10 August 2000. At that time the appellant Bilal Skaf was aged 18, the appellant Mohamed Ghanem was aged 17 and the appellant Belal Hajeid was aged 18. All three accused lived at Greenacre and were friends of each other. A joint indictment (as amended) charged 14 offences alleged to have been committed upon two young women, Ms F and Ms P. 
     
      
       
      
    3 In brief, the complainants were Year 12 students who were at Chatswood shopping centre. There they met a group of eight males one of whom offered to give them marijuana and a lift home. The complainants went with four of the males in a white van. One of these males was Skaf. Four other males followed in a red car. They included Ghanem and Hajeid, according to the disputed identifications of the complainants. They all ended up at Northcote Park Greenacre, where the complainants were forced to participate in numerous acts of oral intercourse. After this the males left and the complainants notified the police. 
     
      
       
        
       The Crown case in detail 
       
      
    4 The Crown case, based on the evidence of the complainants as accepted by the jury, was as follows. 
     
      
       
      
    5 The complainants were approached at Chatswood at around 9pm by a group of four young males. One, who called himself Adam, offered Ms P a cigarette and a lift home. They exchanged names and there was talk of “going for a bong”. Adam showed the girls a small plastic bag of marijuana. Ms P decided to go with the men. Ms F did not want to go with them but decided to stay with her friend. 
     
      
       
      
    6 During the conversation another four males joined them. They all walked to the car park where the two girls got into a white van with four of the males. Before they left the car park a red four-door Pulsar hatchback pulled up behind the van. It had four occupants. The men from the two vehicles exchanged words in a foreign language. Before driving off, one man in the red car (Hajeid, on the Crown case) yelled out to Ms F to catch her attention. He said to her “you’re sexy.. speak to you later”. 
     
      
       
      
    7 It is not in issue that the man sitting beside Ms P in the back of the van was the appellant Skaf. He gave the name of Adam, which was established to be a first name that he used in certain circumstances. 
     
      
       
      
    8 It was the Crown case that both Ghanem and Hajeid were in the red car.  
     
      
       
      
    9 Several mobile phone calls were made during the trip from Chatswood to Greenacre. Some were between occupants of the two vehicles, others between an occupant and a third person elsewhere. Evidence about the parties to these calls and their locations was part of the Crown case led at trial in support of the narratives of the two complainants. It will be necessary to return to the detail. 
     
      
       
      
    10 Police had set up a checkpoint with speed camera for cars travelling west along Parramatta Road at Glebe. A red Toyota Corolla hatchback was stopped at 9.50pm. The car contained four men of “Mediterranean” appearance. The driver who produced his licence was Mahmoud Chami. The police descriptions of two other passengers were capable of fitting Ghanem and Hajeid although there were discrepancies that were drawn to the jury’s attention. A fourth occupant was described as obese in build. 
     
      
       
      
    11 The white van stopped at McDonalds at Stanmore to wait for the car. At that stage, the two men in the front of the van got out. So too did Ms F and the man who had been seated behind her who had made several unwanted advances to her prior to that stage of the journey. 
     
      
       
      
    12 ”Adam” and Ms P remained in the van. He asked her “give me a head job”. She said “No”.  
     
      
       
      
    13 The man who had been seated behind Ms F made a similar proposition, outside the van. She said she “wasn’t interested”. This couple was then joined by the other two males who had also got out of the van. The three men in the presence of each other repeatedly asked Ms F for a “head job”. She told them that “she didn’t want to and … wasn’t interested”. The girls got back into the van, which was driven to Northcote Park, Greenacre. 
     
      
       
      
    14 Counts 1 and 2 were kidnapping charges involving Ms F and Ms P respectively. We shall return to them. 
     
      
       
      
    15 “Adam” (Skaf) grabbed Ms F’s hand and headed towards an area in the park described as the pergola. He walked in front of her, pulling her along. He asked her for a “head job”. She said “No” and told him that “I don’t want to go, I don’t want to do anything”. Skaf led Ms F to some metal seats. He again asked for a “head job”. When she refused, he told her that it was in her best interests to do it before the other car came, because he would tell them to leave her alone and not bash her. They would listen to him because he was the oldest. 
     
      
       
      
    16 At that point the car pulled up behind the van. “Adam” told Ms F to give him “a head job” before they came over. He pulled out his penis and motioned her with his hand on her shoulder to sit on the seat, from which position she fellated him. Count 3 charged Skaf with having sexual intercourse with Ms F, without her consent, knowing she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company with the three other males who had been in the white van. 
     
      
       
      
    17 Ms F stopped fellating Skaf when the males from the car got close to them. She stood up and walked towards the road where the vehicles were parked. She saw “four males from a vehicle [come] running towards me … one of them tackled me to the ground” (Tr p325). Some of the men started to kick her while she was still on the ground. She was helped to her feet by one of them. One of them then picked her up over his shoulder. She was screaming. He threw her into a bush. She then got up, crying, and walked over and sat on one of the metal seats. 
     
      
       
      
    18 Count 4 charged Skaf, Ghanem and Hajeid with assault in connection with the tackling of Ms F. The case left to the jury was that one of Ghanem, Hajeid and the two other men from the red car had tackled Ms F and that Skaf and his two co-accused (if not the tackler) had aided and abetted them by being present at the park ready to assist. The Crown case invited the jury to infer that Ghanem and Hajeid came in the red car. 
     
      
       
      
    19 At this stage “Adam” (Skaf) said to the others “look what you’ve done guys, you’ve made her cry”. There were five men there at that stage, including Skaf. Skaf then came over to her and motioned the others away. They moved away a short distance to near the bushes into which the complainant had been thrown. Skaf then said to her “I told you what would happen. I warned you what they would do. So do it now… do you want to get bashed or not”. Skaf then pulled down his pants and moved her head towards his penis whereupon Ms F again fellated him. He ejaculated into her mouth and she spat the semen onto the ground. He then walked away and other males then came over to her. 
     
      
       
      
    20 Count 5 charged Skaf, Ghanem and Hajeid with having sexual intercourse with Ms F, without her consent, knowing she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company with the other five men at the park. This count was left to the jury on the basis that Skaf had sexual intercourse, with the other accused aiding and abetting him. 
     
      
       
      
    21 Several men surrounded Ms F, all telling her to give them “head jobs”. She started to cry again, saying that she wanted to go home. One (described as the “fat male”) pulled out a knife, which one of his companions told him to put away. Ms F said that the “fat male” was one of the men she had seen at Chatswood and as an occupant of the Pulsar. 
     
      
       
      
    22 After this, one of the men claimed that he should be next because “I’m the one with the WRX”. The other three men then walked away. The “WRX man” then told her “to give him a head job or he would bash” her. 
     
      
       
      
    23 Ms F then ran behind some seats. The fat man came running over and told her to give him a “head job”. The WRX man walked away. The fat man spoke to her and then another man came over. The fat man went away. This other man threatened her with a bashing if she did not give him oral sex. He put on a condom. During his sexual intercourse he shouted out to others “she’s not doing it right. This chick’s shit at head jobs”.  
     
      
       
      
    24 The fat man then ran over demanding a “head job”. He raised his fist at Ms F and said “do you want me to do it ‘cause I’ll do it”. Ms F was scared at this threat to bash her and she submitted to his demand for oral sex. Having achieved ejaculation he walked away saying “thanks for nothing you cheap slut”. 
     
      
       
      
    25 This was part of a body of evidence indicating that the group involved in the successive acts of sexual intercourse with Ms F and Ms P remained in close vicinity or in earshot of each other while each “took his turn”. No complaint is raised about the direction to the jury that the several perpetrators involved with Ms F would be aided and abetted by others who stood in the vicinity, speaking to her and each other, intending (in the words of his Honour’s written direction to the jury) “to give aid or encouragement to the person actually committing the offence”. It was of course essential to the Crown case concerning the assaults inflicted on Ms F after she had been tackled by one of the occupants of the red car that it be demonstrated that the appellants Skaf, Ghanem and Hajeid were involved as perpetrators or aiders and abetters in relation to each of the relevant counts. 
     
      
       
      
    26 Counts 6, 7 and 8 each charged the three appellants in identical terms. The charges were that they had sexual intercourse with Ms F, without her consent, knowing she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely being in company with each other and four other males. Those counts went to the jury on the basis that the actual perpetrators were severally the WRX man, a man with a condom and the fat man. The three appellants were said to have aided and abetted each assault by their presence and willingness to assist if called upon. 
     
      
       
      
    27 Immediately after the fat male walked away, uttering his disgusting remark, Ms F was approached by the man who, on the Crown case, was Ghanem. Ms F described him as “the male with the pony tail … that I saw at Chatswood” (Tr p352). She told him that she didn’t want to do any more and he told her that she was not leaving “until he got one”. He told her that he would also bash her if she did not submit. She did. Count 9 was in similar terms to the earlier counts. It was left to the jury on the basis that Ghanem was the perpetrator with Skaf and Hajeid aiding and abetting. 
     
      
       
      
    28 Following conversations and incidents that are not of present relevance Ms F saw men get into the van and drive off. Shortly before this she observed her friend Ms P chasing a man. Another man (who had just robbed Ms F of her watch and phone) pushed Ms P over, before he ran towards the van. 
     
      
       
      
    29 Counts 10 to 14 involved Ms P. 
     
      
       
      
    30 Count 10 charged Skaf with sexual intercourse without consent with Ms P, in company. The charge was left to the jury on the basis that “another male person” was the actual perpetrator (SU 26, 45) with Skaf being there as an aider and abetter. This offence occurred after the arrival of the white van but before the arrival of the red car. When everyone got out of the van, a man described as having worn a “Champion jumper” and identified as Mohamed Sanoussi put Ms P’s neck in a headlock and took her behind a toilet block. The man demanded a “head job” to which Ms P said “No”. He then pushed her on to her knees by pushing down on her shoulders with his hands where she was forced to give him oral sex. The two other occupants of the white van were the persons present with Skaf and Sanoussi when this offence took place. 
     
      
       
      
    31 Ms P then went to the front of the toilet block at the park. The red car had arrived and parked near the van. About six men then stood around her all saying “give me a head job”. She asked where her friend was and a thin man spoke to her. She described him as being about 19 years old and referred to by the others as “Sammy”. The Crown says this man was Hajeid. Ms P had first seen this man at Chatswood and she described him as having short dark curly hair with blond streaks. She identified Hajeid as “Sammy” when she saw photo arrays in late 2000. “Sammy” grabbed Ms P’s arm and took her behind the toilet block. Count 11 charged Skaf, Ghanem and Hajeid with this (physical) assault of Ms P. The count was left to the jury on the basis that Hajeid was the assailant, with the other appellants aiding and abetting. 
     
      
       
      
    32 “Sammy” demanded a “head job” to which Ms P said “No”. She started to walk away. The man with whom she had first performed oral sex then walked towards her and grabbed the neck of her jumper breaking her necklace. “Sammy” then pulled her around the back of the toilet block, pushed her on to the ground on her knees and forced her head onto his penis. This incident was the basis of Count 12 which charged Skaf, Ghanem and Hajeid (“Sammy”) with the sexual intercourse of Ms P, without her consent, in company with the other males at the park. 
     
      
       
      
    33 The written directions handed to the jury at the commencement of the summing up indicated that, in count 12, the sexual intercourse alleged was that of Hajeid, but that the other two were said to be guilty on the basis of aiding and abetting. 
     
      
       
      
    34 During this time the driver of the red car was telling “Sammy” to hurry up.  
     
      
       
      
    35 Ms P then walked to the front of the toilet block. About this time, the red car drove off. A man she described as fatter than the others, with short dark spiky hair, tackled her to the ground.  
     
      
       
      
    36 “Adam” (Skaf) then grabbed her arm and pulled her behind the toilet block. He demanded a “head job”. He was at that time joined by two other men – one of whom had light brown hair plaited at the back which came to just under his collar. The man with the plait said “if you don’t do it worse things will happen to you” and slapped her across the face.  
     
      
       
      
    37 Count 13 charged Skaf with this assault on the basis that he was present, aiding and assisting the actual assailant.  
     
      
       
      
    38 Skaf then pushed her on to her knees and pushed her head towards his penis, forcing her to engage in oral sex. Count 14 charged Skaf with sexual assault on Ms P without consent, in company. This went to the jury on the basis that Skaf (“Adam”) was the actual perpetrator. 
     
      
       
      
    39 Ghanem was originally charged as the assailant with the plait who slapped Ms P in the face. Hajeid and Skaf were also charged as aiding and abetting this assault (count 18 of the original indictment). Ghanem and Hajeid were also charged as aiders and abetters in Skaf’s sexual assault on Ms P (count 19 of the original indictment). There was a directed verdict on those counts in favour of those two accused which occurred in circumstances recounted in detail below. A fresh indictment was presented, containing the fourteen counts summarised in this section of our reasons.  
     
      
       
      
    40 Counts 1 and 2 charged each appellant with detaining Ms F (count 1) and Ms P (count 2) with intent to hold them for advantage to themselves and four other males. These kidnapping charges went to the jury on the basis that the offending conduct occurred after they arrived at the park: it was not alleged that the complainants were detained against their will when they were in the van. 
     
      
       
      
    41 The appellants were found guilty on each charge. 
     
      
       
        
       Events prior to trial 
       
      
    42 Skaf participated in two records of interview. Each was tendered against him at the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    43 The first interview occurred on 6 December 2000. For the most part, Skaf exercised his right of silence in relation to questions about his involvement in the sexual assaults upon the complainants. Having answered four questions ""no comment"" he was asked whether he wished to participate in an interview or not. He answered ""No. I haven't done nothing, mate, I don't know what you're talking about"".  
     
      
       
      
    44 On 13 March 2001 Skaf was informed that the police had DNA evidence which linked him to items found at the park. He spoke to his barrister, contacted the police, and came for a lengthy second interview on 3 April 2001. What follows is a summary, re-arranged chronologically: 
     
      
       
        
       • Skaf said that Mahmoud Chami had a four-door red Corolla and that he had met him at his house. His cousin Ali Skaf was also there, having driven his white van. Eight men went to Chatswood where they met the two girls.  
        
        
       • Skaf named the others, apart from himself and his cousin, as the two Sanoussis, Ali Harris, Hajeid, Ghanem and Chami. He said that all of them went to the park, although he emphasised that anything that may have involved the others occurred after he had gone home. 
        
        
       • He said that ""we"" came across two girls at Chatswood. The girls asked whether they had pot. His cousin, Ali Skaf, offered them marijuana  
       ""but youse got to look after us” 
       .  
       The girls go 
       ,  
       “Yeah, why not"" 
       . The girls were also offered a lift home. He also thought that Hajeid had shown the girls pot  
       “so they can come along” 
        (p73). 
        
        
        • The girls, the two Sanoussis, Ali Skaf and Skaf got into the van. The red car was occupied by Chami as driver, Harris, Ghanem and Hajeid.  
        
        
       • Chami was stopped by traffic police. The van pulled into the Stanmore McDonalds. Skaf spoke to someone in the car by mobile telephone,  
       “maybe Ghanem” 
        (p47). Later he said that he spoke to Hajeid (pp89-90).  
        
        
       • The van got to Northcote Park, 15 to 20 minutes before the car. One of the girls asked for the marijuana. Ali said  
       “You gotta fix us up first … do my cousin first.” 
       . Skaf asked  
       “the skinny one” 
        if she wanted to have sex (meaning thereby vaginal sex) and she told him that she did not. He then said  
       ""what about a head job?” 
        She started laughing and said  
       ”Yeah, I don't care, something like that. She goes, As long as you have protection as well”  
       (p61). They had oral sex with Skaf using a condom. He threw the condom and a tissue he had used to wipe his penis on the ground. While this was happening ""the other guys"" (from the van) were standing about 40 metres away. It was dark but Skaf thought that they would have known what he was doing.  
        
        
       • The other girl was  
       ""with someone else, I can’t remember who she was with"" 
        (p64). This was behind the toilets.  
        
        
       • Skaf said that his cousin Ali Skaf also took the fat girl over behind the toilets. Skaf said at one stage that he walked straight home  
       “after Ali done what he done with her” 
        (p5). Ali Skaf told him she had given him a head job behind the toilets. This was  
       “just before I went” 
        (p70). Later he said that he learnt this from a telephone call from Ali the next day (p71). 
        
        
       • Chami arrived either just before or shortly after Skaf had sex (p65). Skaf spoke to Chami who was angry about  
       ""the fines, what happened to him"" 
        (when the police had stopped his car). He (Chami) took off home by himself, leaving his passengers Harris, Ghanem and Hajeid at the park. After Chami had left, Skaf spoke  
       ""to the boys as well"" 
        (p67) before he, Skaf  
       ""took off home as well"" 
        (ibid). The boys he was talking to included Ali who had previously gone off [for sex] with  
       ""the big one, the fat one, I'm not sure, I'm not positive"" 
        (p69).  
        
        
       • A short time later Skaf took off home as well, as did Hajeid shortly after (p87). Skaf said that Belal Hajeid lived across the road from the park and that Hajeid went home when he did. He added  
       ""I don't know, I don't know whether he done something with her or not"" 
        (p6). 
        
        
       • Skaf denied that he had used the named Adam that night. He said that Mohamed Sanoussi had introduced himself with that name  
       ""when he was sleeping with her in the back of the van, laying with her"" 
        (p76). Skaf admitted that he occasionally used the fake named Adam, corresponding with the fake licence be used to have [in the name of Adam Newlan], but he denied going around telling people that his name was Adam. 
        
        
       • He denied that he had done anything to the other girl. He said that he was  
       ""the first one with that skinny one"" 
        (referring to Ms F), but he did not touch the other one or have anything to do with her (p80). 
        
        
       • Skaf described his relationship with the other seven men, indicating that he had been to school with Hajeid and that he had known Ghanem for a couple of years. 
        
        
       • Skaf said he did not see Hajeid or  
       “no one” 
        doing anything with the girls (p87). 
        
        
       • The next day he phoned Ali and was told that  
       ""we didn't take 'em home"" 
       . Ali also told him that Mohamed Sanoussi kicked a girl and took her phone and money (pp5-6).  
        
        
       Course of the trial 
       
      
    45 Each accused was separately represented. 
     
      
       
      
    46 Before the jury were empanelled counsel for Ghanem and Hajeid applied to be tried together but separately from Skaf. The court was informed about Skaf's records of interview and DNA evidence linking him with the scene of the crimes. There was no similar evidence concerning the other two accused, who had been identified by the complainants in circumstances that his Honour was told would be the subject of later, separate argument. It had been indicated by that stage that the Crown did not propose to adduce evidence from Chami. The applicants for the separate trial argued that there would be prejudice stemming from the inadmissible evidence contained in Skaf's second record of interview. The Crown prosecutor pointed out that Skaf did not actually implicate his co-accused beyond leaving them at the scene. The prosecutor also observed that Skaf's evidence did not put his co-accused with the complainants and that they could not be convicted merely on the basis of being at the park. 
     
      
       
      
    47 Judge Finnane indicated that he did not propose to separate the trials. He foreshadowed that he would give his reasons later, adding: 
     
      
       
        
         
         All that I will say at this point is, that either counsel, or any counsel, can, at any time during the trial, make any application that seems to him or her should be made in relation to evidence. If I consider that the evidence against one of the accused is so tenuous that a jury properly instructed could not convict, I might well direct an acquittal. I am not prepared at this point to order a separate trial. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    48 One of the challenges raised by Ghanem and Hajeid about the refusal to order separate trials is complaint about the paucity of these reasons. Alternatively, it is submitted that the reasons betray error because they indicate that his Honour confused the issue of a separate trial with the issue of a directed verdict. Neither complaint does justice to what his Honour said, or its context. He clearly intended at that stage to give reasons later. As it turned out he did not do so, possibly due to oversight or because the matter was overtaken by a later application (see below). The judge was not reminded of the oversight during the trial. The remark concerning the possibility of a directed verdict was entirely proper and in no way undercut or contradicted the distinct issue as to separate trials. 
     
      
       
      
    49 The jury had been empanelled and was waiting for the trial to begin. It was entirely understandable that his Honour deferred giving reasons at that stage. In any event, he was entitled to reserve and to formulate his reasons at greater leisure if he chose to do so. 
     
      
       
      
    50 Another complaint is the suggestion that the decision was vitiated because of failure to weigh the strength of the separate Crown cases and the related issues of prejudice. This is also misdirected in our view. For one thing, the applicants had foreshadowed that they would be making separate challenges to the admissibility of the complainants’ identification evidence. This in fact occurred two days later. The other issues relating to the refusal to separate the trials will be addressed later in these reasons.  
     
      
       
      
    51 Not long after the opening address by the prosecutor and immediately before Ms F entered the witness box, counsel for Ghanem and Hajeid renewed their applications for a separate trial (Tr p254). Counsel emphasised the relative strengths of the Crown case against Skaf as opposed to the case against their clients. The application was dismissed brusquely:  
     
      
       
        
         
         ... For the reasons I have given before I don't propose to separate the trials. The Crown case against Hajeid and Ghanem is as to joint criminal enterprise. I do not know what the strength of the case is against them. If in the end there is insufficient there I will tell the jury that. But at this stage I would not separate the trials.  
         
        
       
       
        
         
        
       
      
    52 This brevity is understandable. Ms F was about to be called to the stand to commence testimony which had been delayed for several days while interlocutory applications were dealt with. Applications to exclude identification evidence from the two complainants had been heard and determined two hearing days earlier. Some had succeeded, some had not. His Honour was obviously seized of the challenges that would be made at the trial concerning Ms F's identification of Ghanem and Ms P's identification of Hajeid. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that he gave no consideration to these matters. (Once again, we defer until later the consideration of whether the trial miscarried due to the ultimate refusal to separate Skaf from his co-accused.) 
     
      
       
      
    53 The reference to ""joint criminal enterprise"" was a shorthand expression that had previously been used in argument (cf Tr p254) to refer to the way in which the Crown prosecutor had opened the case. That opening relied upon accessorial liability. If there ever was any suggestion that the Crown case would be based upon pre-concert it was never pressed. This was confirmed before the final addresses and the summing up proceeded accordingly. 
     
      
       
      
    54 It appears that his Honour had forgotten that reasons for refusing separate trials had not been given earlier. Perhaps he thought that indications given during argument were sufficient. Once again nothing turns on this, given that it was entirely appropriate in the circumstances that Ms F should commence her testimony without further delay. 
     
      
       
      
    55 Ms F recounted the events of the drive to the park in the white van and the events involving her at the park as we have summarised them above. This included the evidence of the assault by Skaf near the pergola, followed by the incident in which one of the four men who got out of the car tackled her to the ground. She recounted the particular assaults involving the ""WRX man"", the man who used a condom and the ""fat male"". After the fat male walked away another man approached her and forced her to have oral sex. She referred to him as:  
     
      
       
        
         
         ""the male with the ponytail… the male that I saw at Chatswood....[ He]had the same jacket on and he looked like the same person that I saw at Chatswood"".  
         (Tr p352) 
         
        
        
       
      
    56 Ms F went to the police station on 8 November 2000. She was shown two photoboards, each containing 15 photographs. She identified a photograph of Skaf. (Evidence of this and the other photoboard identification involving each complainant was also given by the police officers involved. The jury had videotapes of the entire identification processes.) 
     
      
       
      
    57 Ms F returned to the police station the following day and was shown three more photoboards. As regards two of them she made no identifications and positively excluded a number of persons depicted. On the third photoboard she identified a photograph of Ghanem, putting a circle around that photograph. She said that she recognised the person as the one with the ponytail. The photoboard containing the circled photograph of Ghanem was admitted over objection and it became exhibit C7 (Tr p377). 
     
      
       
      
    58 Ms P gave evidence of the drive to the park. “Adam” offered her marijuana for oral sex when they were at McDonalds and also at the park. Ms P heard Adam telephone “Bill” (Tr pp535, 643). 
     
      
       
      
    59 Ms P recounted the assaults at the park, first at the hands of the man in the white Champion jumper who dragged her in a headlock to the toilet area; then (after the arrival of the red car) by “Sammy”. During the latter incident, the driver of the red car was telling Sammy to hurry up (Tr p562). The red car drove away shortly after (Tr pp563, 617). Ms P had no idea how many people departed in it (Tr p619). 
     
      
       
      
    60 Then “the guy Adam who was originally with [Ms F]” grabbed Ms P and forced her to have oral sex. During this incident Adam answered a mobile phone call. Ms P said that two other men had walked behind the toilet block by that time. One of them had light brown hair and it was plaited at the back (Tr p567). 
     
      
       
      
    61 Ms P gave evidence about identifying “Adam” (Skaf) and “Sammy” (Hajeid) from photoboards. 
     
      
       
      
    62 The cross-examination of each complainant on behalf of Ghanem and Hajeid concentrated upon issues relating to identification. For obvious reasons, no version of events occurring at the park was put to the complainants by counsel representing these two accused. 
     
      
       
      
    63 Counsel representing Skaf at trial put to each of Ms F and Ms P that she had engaged in consensual oral sex with Skaf at the park. 
     
      
       
      
    64 There was evidence that the complainants made very early complaint generally consistent with their trial testimony. 
     
      
       
      
    65 Evidence from various police officers provided details of the layout of the park and the location of objects found there. These included the discovery of a condom and a tissue near the pergola and a liquid substance near the toilet. DNA evidence linked these three objects to Skaf. It was established that Skaf was told in general terms about the DNA linkage on 13 March 2001 (Tr p940). He gave his longer, incriminating record of interview on 3 April 2001.  
     
      
       
      
    66 The police evidence established that neither Ghanem nor Hajeid made any admissions when they were spoken to by the police. They provided buccal samples for DNA testing and permitted themselves to be photographed. The photograph of Ghanem used in the photoboard shown to the complainants was taken on 21 October 2000. The police had come to Ghanem's house to execute a search warrant. At that time Ghanem had his hair in a ponytail, but he loosened it immediately before being photographed. 
     
      
       
      
    67 Items located during the execution of a search warrant at Skaf's house established that he used the name ""Adam Newlan"". These included a driver's licence with Skaf's photograph.  
     
      
       
      
    68 There was evidence based upon telecommunications data that showed the approximate location of persons who made and received mobile telephone calls that evening. This was linked to evidence about the ownership and/or possession of those telephones. This telephone evidence had a dual function. It corroborated the complainants as to calls made during the journey and at the park. And it linked Ghanem to Skaf and Hajeid, both by showing that Skaf conversed with each of them during the trip from Chatswood and by showing that this occurred in the Ashfield area. This was vital and compelling evidence that tended to place Ghanem and Hajeid in the red car that proceeded along Parramatta Road until stopped for speeding at Glebe and thence to the park.  
     
      
       
      
    69 Ms F said that ""Adam"" used his mobile phone during the drive from Chatswood to Greenacre. One call involved him speaking to someone in the red car and telling him that the van was pulling over at McDonald's, Stanmore (Tr pp298, 303-4). Ms P said that Adam phoned “Bill” while stopped at McDonalds, Stanmore. Skaf gave evidence that he spoke by phone to “one of my other friends in the red car” (Tr p1061). He named Hajeid and said that they spoke twice to inquire about the police having stopped the red car and to confirm that it would meet them at the park. 
     
      
       
      
    70 There was significant corroboration of this oral evidence from the telecommunications data.  
     
      
       
      
    71 Exhibit C22, admitted without objection, showed that the SIM card of Skaf's mobile phone listed the mobiles of ""Bill Hadjid"" and Ghanem in its directory listing. Ghanem's and Hajeid's mobile phone listings also included Skaf's number. Chami's phone records also included Skaf and Ghanem as contacts. 
     
      
       
      
    72 Detective Porta gave evidence about information obtained as to the parties to calls made and received during the evening in question and the telephone transmission towers that were engaged. Exhibit C23 as explained by this witness (Tr pp889ff , 939ff) shows that: 
     
      
       
       - Ghanem phoned Skaf at 2109hrs (picked up at Chatswood Mall tower), 2134hrs (picked up at Millers Point tower) and 2213hrs (picked up at Annandale tower). [The police stopped Chami's car at Glebe at about 2150hrs: see below.] 
        
       - Skaf phoned Hajeid on three occasions between 2151hrs and 2208hrs, all of which were picked up by the Annandale tower. 
        
       
      
    73 [In light of this evidence, the direction that the case against Ghanem and Hajeid depended solely on identification evidence (SU 13) was particularly favourable.] 
     
      
       
      
    74 Mobile phone records also corroborated aspects of Ms P's evidence, including her evidence that Skaf answered a call from home while engaged in sexual intercourse with her at the park. 
     
      
       
      
    75 Sergeant Adams was performing speed enforcement duties at Parramatta Road, Glebe on the evening of 10 August 2000. At about 2150hrs officers stopped a red Toyota Corolla hatchback that was speeding. The driver produced a photo licence indicating that his name was Mahmoud Chami. There were three male passengers of “Mediterranean” appearance. The vehicle was searched, with nothing of concern being found in it. All passengers were requested to alight the vehicle to allow this to happen.  
     
      
       
      
    76 Sergeant Adams gave descriptions of the three occupants. One (Ghanem, on the Crown case) was described as a male about 22-23 years of age, 175 to 180 centimetres tall, thin to medium build. He had light brown hair with a fringe pulled back and plaited into a ponytail that was about 15 to 20 centimetres long (Tr pp818,820). The second passenger (Hajeid, on the Crown case) was described as being about 19 to 22 years of age, about 165 to 170 centimetres tall, of thin to medium build and with dark brown hair tightly curled and streaked slightly. The third passenger was described as being about 20-22 years of age, 165 to 170 centimetres in height, of large to obese build and with short black hair. The driver was issued with a traffic infringement notice and a defect notice.  
     
      
       
      
    77 Formal admissions were made at trial by Ghanem and Hajeid that they had been school friends together and that they had thereafter remained friends who socialised with each other. It was also admitted that each was acquainted with Skaf. 
     
      
       
      
    78 Skaf gave evidence at the trial. He denied that he was guilty of any of the charges. He said that eight men went to Chatswood: Chami, Ghanem, Hajeid and himself in the red car driven by Chami; Ali Skaf, Mohamed Harris and the two Sanoussi brothers in the white van driven by Ali Skaf. The initial contact with the two girls at Chatswood was made by Ali Skaf and Belal Hajeid. Skaf then introduced himself to them, saying that his name was Adam (Tr p1049). Ms P asked for marijuana and Hajeid produced some from his pocket. Ali Skaf asked the girls to come for a drive and to smoke some marijuana. 
     
      
       
      
    79 Skaf said that the girls wanted to stay together. They got into the white van with Ali Skaf, the two Sanoussis and Skaf. The other four men got into Chami's red car. Hajeid had tried to persuade them to go in the red car. Skaf sat next to Ms P and they began hugging, kissing and touching each other. This started before they crossed the Harbour Bridge. The red car was pulled over by the police and the white van drove into McDonald's at Stanmore. Everyone got out except Skaf and Ms P. Skaf telephoned Hajeid in the red car to inquire about what had happened when the red car had been pulled over by the police. Later Hajeid reported to Skaf by telephone that they had left the police and were on their way. The white van drove off after it had been agreed that it would go to the park. At this stage Skaf sat next to Ms F and the two of them started to get intimate, kissing and touching. Ms P was in the back with Mohamed Sanoussi. 
     
      
       
      
    80 When the van got to the park at Greenacre Ms P asked Ali Skaf for the marijuana and was told ""you have to fix us up first "" (p1070). Ali said to Ms F ""you go off with my cousin and fix him up"" (Tr p1071). Skaf said he walked hand-in-hand with Ms F across the park to the seats at the pergola area. She asked ""whether she, she had to do, to do the guys....Do I have to do all those guys too?” (referring to the occupants of the van) (Tr p1075). Skaf said ""No, that's entirely up to you, whatever makes you feel comfortable"". He asked whether she wanted to have sex in the sense of penile-vaginal intercourse. She declined, but agreed to have oral sex. She asked him if he had a condom. He produced one. She started playing with his penis and then put the condom on his penis and gave him oral sex. He ejaculated into the condom which he removed with a tissue and threw on the ground. He then walked back to the van.  
     
      
       
      
    81 Skaf denied in terms Ms F's version of the forced sexual intercourse that took place between them. He was asked by the trial judge why he walked away, leaving Ms F there. What was he thinking? He said (Tr p1083): 
     
      
       
        
         
         I was thinking - she mentioned to me after that she'd have to do the other boys. I'm saying, telling her: ‘It's whatever you want as long as you feel comfortable’. She stayed waiting for some other guy to come along and do something with him. 
         
        
        
       
      
    82 Skaf said that his friend Ghanem was approaching as he was walking back to van. ""I looked back and pointed out where she was"" (Tr p1084). He became aware that the red car had arrived when he was with Ms F at the pergola and she was performing oral sex on him.  
     
      
       
      
    83 After he got back to his friends standing near the parked car and van, he asked Ali about the other girl (Ms P) and was told that she was behind the toilet block. She had been walking across the park at the same time as Skaf had walked to the pergola with Ms F (Tr p1087). She was with Mohamed Sanoussi at the time (Tr p1091). When Mohamed came back he told Skaf ""she gave me a head job"" (Tr p 1092). At one stage, Skaf called out to Sanoussi to find out how long he was going to be. Skaf then asked Ms P, near the toilet block, whether she would give him ""a head job"". She agreed and asked him to put on a condom which he did. Skaf's mobile phone rang while sex was taking place. It was a call from his brother asking where he was and how long he was going to be before getting home. He told his brother he would be home soon. He told Ms P to ""keep going"" while he attended to the telephone call. After she finished performing oral sex he wiped his penis and ejaculated onto the ground. He then walked over to his friends. These included his cousin Ali, Ghanem and Hajeid. He said goodbye and walked home. He assumed that his cousin Ali would take the girls home. 
     
      
       
      
    84 Skaf denied that he had tackled Ms P or dragged her behind the toilet block. 
     
      
       
      
    85 Skaf’s evidence in chief was in serious conflict with much of the account he had given in the second ERISP, most notably because he now admitted having oral sex with Ms P and because he admitted to remaining at the park while Ali Skaf and Mohammed Sanoussi had oral sex with Ms P. 
     
      
       
      
    86 Skaf was first cross examined by Ms McSpedden, counsel for Ghanem. The opening volleys of this cross-examination are particularly relevant to the Skaf’s grounds of appeal concerning the admission of evidence of his prior convictions. They are also relevant to certain directions later given by his Honour which the appellants Ghanem and Hajeid submit compromised their right of silence. 
     
      
       
      
    87 We set out the bulk of Ms McSpedden's brief, vigorous cross-examination of Skaf (Tr p1108): 
     
      
       
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. Mr Skaf, you’re prepared to tell lies when it suits you, aren’t you? 
          
         A. No. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         Q. You initially were interviewed by police on 6 December 2000, is that right? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That was the first ERISP in which you participated? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At that time you didn’t say anything to police about having had sexual intercourse with the two girls on the night in question, is that right? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. On that night you said you didn’t know anything about the events at the park on that night? 
          
         A. Let me rephrase that to you: When I made that interview, I had called my solicitor and he had told me not to say anything. Do not say anything to them. So, when I didn’t know anything about what youse are talking about, I was saying I didn’t know anything about it just to get out of the mess I was in. And all I was thinking, I was going through stress, depression, I was angry. I just didn’t want to say nothing to this. Those are the words that came out of my mouth at that stage. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. But you did say something to them, didn’t you? 
          
         A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you were advised not to say anything, to partake in an interview, you didn’t say: “No, I do not wish to be interviewed”, did you? 
          
         A. No, I didn’t say that. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. It was an interview in which you say, although you’d been advised not to say anything to the police, you lied and said you didn’t know anything about the girls in the park on the night in question? 
          
         A. Excuse me, don’t call me a liar. I did not lie. They’re the words that came out of my mouth and they’re the words out --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’re saying they’re the truth? 
          
         A. What? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’re saying they’re the truth? 
          
         A. The first statement I made? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. 
          
         A. They’re the words. You can play the tape and listen to it. They’re the words I used to get out of this. I’ve never been charged with anything. They’re the first charges I’ve ever had. Other than a driving offence. 
         
        
        
         
         HEALEY: Can I just ask this: If one has reference – I take my learned friend to that question. 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. You were asked these questions, I suggest, and you gave these answers, page 49 as it is recorded in the transcript: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “Q. Okay. You’ve been identified as being one of the people involved in the sexual assault upon [Ms F]…” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         And you say: 
         
        
        
         
          “A. Who? 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Ms [F] and Ms [P] at Northcote Park Greenacre on 10 August where both girls were sexually assaulted by a number of males. What can you tell me about that?” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         And you say: “No comment”. Then, I suggest to you, you were asked: 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           “Q. Do you know anything about that sexual assault? 
           
          
         
         
          A. No comment. 
         
        
        
         
          
           
           Q. Do you know where you were on 10 August 2000? 
           
          
         
         
          A. No comment. 
         
        
        
         
          Q. Okay. Is it the case that you don’t wish to be interviewed in relation to this matter as well? 
          
          A. No comment mate. 
         
        
        
         
          Q. Well, do you wish to participate in an interview or not? 
          
           
           A. No. I haven’t done nothing mate. I don’t know what you’re talking about.” 
           
          
         
        
        
         
         A. Exactly. I raped no girls. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. And that wasn’t true, was it, you did know something about the two girls in Northcote Park on that evening, didn’t you. 
          
         A. I didn’t know anything about those two girls. I don’t recall what I remember on that day. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were prepared to give an answer that was convenient when you said: “I don’t know nothing about it mate”? 
          
         A. Yeah, I don’t know nothing about it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. However, your memory improved when you went on legal advice on 3 April 2001 for the second interview, and in that interview you indicated that you’d sexual intercourse with consent with one of the girls, is that correct? 
          
         A. Yes, that’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And that was because you knew when you made that interview that there had been a match in relation to your DNA with the DNA found at the scene? 
          
         A. I didn’t know they had DNA on me till that day. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Before the interview? 
          
         A. I was going there to make an interview. I did not know they had DNA on me. And I was seeking legal advice about that when I got there. They told me they got DNA on me. That’s when I knew they had DNA on me, when I was going down to make the interview. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you made the admission that you did in the interview, about how you had sexual intercourse with one of the girls because you knew then that the DNA had been found? 
          
         A. I was going there to make a statement and to tell them what happened. Not because I knew there was DNA on me. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. But you knew that before you made the statement? 
          
         A. I knew there was DNA. They had told me. 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. On your version, Mr Ghanem was at the park that night and he wore his hair in a plait that night, is that right? 
          
         A. Mm hmm. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. Don’t say “Mm hmm”. Does that mean yes? 
          
         A. Yes. Yes. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         … 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. And what do you mean by a plait, that hair style you are referring to? 
          
         A. A plait is when you get three pieces and you plait it (witness indicated). 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Not like he’s wearing his hair in the dock now? 
          
         A. No, not like that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’ve been sitting next to him every day of this trial? 
          
         A. Yes, I have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you have observed his hair tied back and then bunched up in a bunch, doubled up under? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see, you say that Ali Skaf was at the park that night, don’t you? 
          
         A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And he’s your cousin? 
          
         A. That’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you also have a brother named Mohammed? 
          
         A. Yes, I do. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And does Mohammed have a best friend called Tayyab, T-A-Y-Y-A-B, Sheikh, S-H-E-I-K-H?  
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. I think you indicated that Mr Chami was at the park that night, is that right? 
          
         A. Yeah, that’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And it had been his red car that had gone to Chatswood? 
          
         A. Yeah, that’s right. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, I want to suggest to you very clearly that Mr Ghanem was not at Northcote Park on that night? 
          
         A. That’s not true. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see, early in this trial on a day when some legal argument was taking place, when the jury was not present, Mr Chami came into the Court room and you saw him, didn’t you. 
          
         A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you saw him, as he was in the Court, in the body of the Court, walking into the Court --- 
          
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. -- you looked across to him from where you sat in the dock and you drew your finger under your chin in a gesture like I’m making now (as indicated), as if to indicate a cutting of a throat, didn’t you? 
          
         A. No, I don’t recall that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you not recall or do you say you didn’t do it? 
          
         A. No, I didn’t do that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q You knew when you did that, you knew that Mr Chami had previously been interviewed by police in relation to this matter, didn’t you? 
         
        
        
        OBJECTION. 
        
        
         
         HEALEY: He has not agreed that he did that and knew it at the time with the situation my friends’ putting. 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: I will rephrase the question. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I think that’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. When you saw Mr Chami in the Court on that day, you knew that on a previous occasion he had been interviewed by police in relation to this matter, didn’t you? 
          
         A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you knew that he had told police that of the eight people, Tayyab Sheikh and Mohammed Skaf were two of the eight? 
          
         A. No, that’s not right. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Q. I’m sorry? 
          
         A. That’s not right. It’s not true. They, they --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You may be at cross purposes. She’s not actually putting to you whether that’s true or not. What she’s putting to you is that Mr Chami had made a statement claiming that and you knew Mr Chami had made a statement claiming that. She’s not saying it is true at this point. She may later. At this point she is asking did you know Mr Chami had made that claim? 
          
         A. I didn’t. I didn’t know that Mahmoud Chami said that Tayyab and Mohammed was there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Sorry? 
          
         A. I didn’t know that Chami had said that in that statement. 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. I suggest to you that you did know that and you made that gesture at Mr Chami because of your feelings about him nominating your brother? 
          
         A. That’s not true. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You are prepared to nominate Mr Ghanem as being at the scene rather than somebody else you are protecting, isn’t that the case? 
          
         A. That’s not true. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Haven’t you said to Mr Ghanem during the conduct of this trial: “If I go down, I’ll take you down with me”? 
          
         A. No, that’s not true. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mr Ghanem on that night at Chatswood didn’t have his hair in a plait? 
          
         A. Yes, he did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Mr Ghanem wears his hair bunched up as he’s worn it everyday during the conduct of this trial and as you saw it in the interview? 
          
         A. He wasn’t afraid to release his hair and have it as he used to have it. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And you are prepared to wrongly name Mr Ghanem as being present at the part that night in order to --- 
          
         A. He was at the park. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Implicate somebody else? 
          
         A. He was there. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Thank you. 
          
         A. Thank you. 
         
        
       
      
    88 Pausing here, it may be observed that counsel: 
     
      
       
        
       (1) suggested that Skaf told a lie in his first ERISP when he said that he did not know anything about the events that took place in the park on the night in question; 
        
        
       (2) suggested that the change of stance between the first and second ERISPs was prompted by Skaf's knowledge that the police had found DNA material linking him to the scene; and 
        
        
       (3) established that Chami had been present in court in the absence of the jury earlier in the trial and that Skaf knew at the time that he had been interviewed by the police. 
        
       
      
    89 It was properly open to the jury to accept these three matters. Skaf did not agree with suggestions (1) and (2), but his denials were in the teeth of the evidence and can only have (properly) undermined his credibility before the jury. Proposition (3) was admitted by Skaf. 
     
      
       
      
    90 Ms McSpedden also suggested (but did not establish) that Chami had nominated Skaf's brother Mohammed and his friend Tayyab Sheikh as ""two of the 8"" people at the park. It was further put to Skaf that he had wrongly named Ghanem as being at the park in order to ""implicate"" (sic, obviously the cross-examiner meant to say ""exculpate"") somebody else. The cross-examiner's suggestion that Skaf had made the threatening gesture to Chami was also denied by Skaf. This cross-examination, the use made of it in final address by Ms McSpedden, and the trial judge’s response are the contextual backdrop to various grounds of appeal that will later be addressed. 
     
      
       
      
    91 For the present, it is pertinent to observe that what was not put to Skaf in cross-examination by Ghanem’s counsel included:  
     
      
       
        
       (1) that Skaf's evidence about Ghanem being with the group at Chatswood and in the red car was untrue; 
        
        
       (2) that Chami had, when allegedly including Mohammed Skaf and Tayyab Sheikh, excluded Ghanem from the group at the park or even from the passengers in his car when it left Chatswood; 
        
        
       (3) that, to Skaf's knowledge, his brother Mohammed and/or his brother's friend Sheikh were at the park;  
        
        
       (4) that Skaf's evidence as to his friendship with Ghanem was false; or  
        
        
       (5) that Skaf would have some reason to implicate Ghanem even if he was concerned to exculpate his brother and his brother's friend.  
        
       
      
    92 [We have not overlooked that it was put to Skaf that he said to Ghanem during the trial ""if I go down, I'll take you down with me"". Skaf denied this. It should also be remembered that Skaf first named Ghanem as a passenger in the red car and at the park in his second ERISP.] 
     
      
       
      
    93 Skaf was next cross-examined by Ms Langley, who represented Hajeid. It was put to Skaf that he was prepared to tell lies if it suited him. [This line of questioning was well open in light of the changes between the first and second ERISPs and between the second ERISP and the trial testimony.]  
     
      
       
      
    94 It was suggested that Hajeid was not in the group that went in the cars from Skaf's home to Chatswood. It was suggested that the nickname of Tayyab Sheikh, his brother's friend, was ""Sam"" or ""Sammy"". Skaf denied these propositions. Skaf was challenged as to the evidence he gave about Hajeid having spoken to the girls at Chatswood. He adhered to his testimony. He denied that he had said a number of times during the trial that if he went down he would take Hajeid down with him. He repeated his evidence about his mobile phone calls with Hajeid during the journey from Chatswood. He said that he was sure that he spoke to Hajeid twice that night. Skaf said that Hajeid did not leave the park in the red car, he walked home, which was about half a minute's walk away. 
     
      
       
      
    95 In his cross-examination, the Crown prosecutor also put to Skaf that he had not told the truth at his first interview with the police. He got the witness to repeat his testimony about having had consensual oral sex with Ms F near the pergola and Ms P near the toilets. Skaf was then confronted with why he had not told the police about the second incident (with Ms P) at the longer interview on 3 April 2001. He said ""I didn't want to open more doors. I was in enough trouble with one girl. I didn't want to get involved with the other one."" (Tr p1141). It was then put to him that he was lying when he said that the sex with Ms P was consensual. He agreed that he had lied about Ms P when speaking to the police, but adhered to his evidence that he had consensual sex with her. 
     
      
       
      
    96 The further hearing of the trial was interrupted for a period. Upon resumption, there was debate in the absence of the jury about the prosecution being able to cross-examine Skaf concerning his criminal history. It will be necessary to return to this issue in relation to one of the grounds of appeal raised by Skaf. Judge Finnane ruled that Skaf could be cross-examined about two of the five matters, confined to those that bore upon his honesty and credibility. 
     
      
       
      
    97 After the cross-examination resumed Skaf volunteered that he had used the named Adam when he first met the girls at Chatswood. 
     
      
       
      
    98 There was further cross-examination directed at Skaf’s willingness to tell lies. He was then taken to the evidence given under cross-examination by Ms McSpedden, who had put to him that he had told lies at the first police interview. His attention was drawn particularly to the answer which included the words ""I've never been charged with anything. They're the first charges I've ever had. Other than a driving offence."" The cross-examination that followed is relevant to Skaf's ground of appeal concerning the wrongful admission of evidence of his earlier convictions. In essence, he was confronted with material about recent convictions and he denied any memory of them. The Crown was permitted to prove the convictions in reply. The use made of this material is a ground of appeal by Skaf. 
     
      
       
      
    99 Skaf denied having made threats to his two co-accused and he generally denied having had sex with either complainant against her will. 
     
      
       
      
    100 In re-examination Skaf reconfirmed that Ghanem had a ""plait in a ponytail"" (Tr p 1195) on the night of the incident. He also denied that his brother Mohammed Skaf or his brother's friend Tayyab Sheikh were at the park. He identified their photographs on the photoboards that had been shown to the complainants but not identified by the complainants as persons whom they remembered having been involved in the assaults. 
     
      
       
      
    101 Skaf was the only person who gave evidence in his case. No evidence was called in the cases of his co-accused. 
     
      
       
      
    102 Counsel for Hajeid and Ghanem devoted much of their closing addresses to emphasising the difficulties of the Crown case against their respective clients, dependent as it was upon the photoboard identifications of the complainants. There were, however aspects of the two addresses that have particular relevance to issues in the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    103 In her address, counsel for Hajeid, Ms Langley took the jury to the photoboard in which Ms P had identified Hajeid. Counsel reminded the jury that she had put to Skaf in cross-examination that Tayyab Sheikh was also known as Sam or Sammy. Counsel invited the jury to compare the photographs of Hajeid and of Sheikh, observing that Sheikh had short, dark, curly hair with blond streaks (which had been Ms P's description of the person she described as Sammy).  
     
      
       
      
    104 Counsel for Ghanem, Ms McSpedden, reminded the jury that the Crown had opened the trial on the basis that Ghanem was the man who slapped Ms P behind the toilet block; and that he had been present, aiding and assisting at the time when Skaf sexually assaulted her in the same area. The original indictment had charged Ghanem accordingly in its 18th and 19th counts. There had been a directed verdict in favour of those two accused (see Tr p 1022-1023) in circumstances to which we shall return in addressing Ghanem’s challenge to the verdicts as unreasonable. A fresh indictment had then been presented, containing the fourteen counts summarised earlier in these reasons. Counsel for Ghanem invoked these matters in support of the wider challenge to Ms P's identification of her client. We imply no criticism in this observation. The same argument forms one strand of submissions in this Court by Ghanem's senior counsel. 
     
      
       
      
    105 Counsel suggested to the jury that Ms P had been mistaken in her identification of Ghanem. She also raised the possibility that Ghanem might have been in the group of people at Chatswood, but that he was not the man at the park with the plaited hair. 
     
      
       
      
    106 Ms McSpedden then attacked Skaf's evidence which had stated that Ghanem was at the park. Unlike her predecessor, counsel for Hajeid, Ms McSpedden did not concentrate upon Skaf's lies in the contradictory accounts he gave to the police and at the trial. Ms McSpedden made a more direct attack on Skaf. It is necessary to set it out, because of its bearing upon several of the grounds of appeal. Ms McSpedden said (Tr p1270-1):  
     
      
       
        
         
         No other evidence in respect of Mr Ghanem, apart from what Mr Skaf says, and you will recall the cross-examination. I put to Mr Skaf in particular the gestures of threat he had made to a man called Chami, when Chami walked into a courtroom on an occasion when you members of the jury were not in court. I suggested to him the reason for that attitude being that he knew that Mr Chami had implicated his brother, Mohamed Skaf, and his cousin, Tayyab Sheikh, to the police in relation to this matter, and suggested that he was scripting in Mr Ghanem in order to protect another person. 
         
        
        
         
         I also put to him he had threatened Mr Ghanem that he would drag him down. I suggest you wouldn’t believe anything that Mr Skaf says about his version of what occurred at the park. 
          
         
        
       
      
    107 This submission should not have been made. There was no evidence that Skaf had made the threatening gesture to Chami. Ms McSpedden had put to Skaf that this had occurred, but he had denied it and there was no other evidence on the matter. The impropriety was compounded when counsel put to the jury the equally unsubstantiated submission that ""the reason for that attitude"" (ie the threatening gesture and what it indicated) was that Skaf ""knew"" that Chami had implicated Skaf's brother and his cousin Mr Sheikh. There was no evidence of this either. The improper submission was further compounded by reminding the jury that counsel had also put to Skaf that he had threatened Ghanem that he would drag him down. The question had been put, but the suggestion had been denied.  
     
      
       
      
    108 It was not open to counsel to make this attack in this form. 
     
      
       
      
    109 Immediately after these addresses, counsel for Skaf sought the discharge of the jury in respect of his client on the basis that blame was being attributed to him on the basis of no evidence. Mr Healey, representing Skaf, objected to counsel's reliance upon unanswered questions put to his client. His Honour declined to discharge the jury, but indicated that he would tell the jury “in fairly strong terms” that the questions were evidence of nothing (see Tr p1274 and judgment of 18 December 2001 at p2). 
     
      
       
      
    110 There was also discussion with counsel about the appropriate response to Ms McSpedden's submissions, on the basis that they were not supported by any evidence, something that was not in dispute (see Tr pp1273ff). His Honour understandably decided that some directions had to be given to the jury while Ms McSpedden's submissions were fresh in their mind and before counsel for Skaf was called on to make his final address. This is the context in which the first directions were given about which the appellants Ghanem and Hajeid complain in their grounds of appeal concerning their right of silence and the Crown's onus of proof (discussed below).  
     
      
       
        
       Refusal to separate trials of Ghanem and Hajeid (Hajeid Ground 1; Ghanem Ground 5) 
        
       
      
    111 The trials of Ghanem and Hajeid did not miscarry in consequence of Judge Finnane's refusals either to order a joint trial for them separate from Skaf's trial or to discharge the jury. The relevant principles are well-known (see R v Fernando [1999] NSWCCA 66. See also Darby v The Queen (1982) 148 CLR 668, Chami (2002) 128 A Crim R 428, which are the authorities relied upon by the appellants). 
     
      
       
      
    112 The interests of justice in avoiding the risk of inconsistent verdicts and in having regard to the trauma involved in the complainants participating in separate trials (if that trauma could be avoided consistent with ensuring that each accused received a fair trial) called for a joint trial of the several counts in the indictment. The offences charged were (with minimal exceptions) conduct in which the three appellants were involved either as perpetrators or aiders and abettors of each other and/or third persons. The key witnesses were the complainants who gave narratives linking the three accused in a composite set of events occurring at the same time and the same place. It was in the interests of the several accused and of justice generally that the testing by cross-examination of the complainants on several different issues could be taken into account in the overall assessment of their credibility. 
     
      
       
      
    113 The jury were directed that Skaf’s out of court admissions could not be used against his co-offenders (SU 15). They were also told that each charge was to be dealt with separately and that a verdict of guilty against one accused did not necessarily mean all were guilty (SU 4, 41). 
     
      
       
      
    114 The principal matter raised by Ghanem and Hajeid concerns the imbalance between the Crown case against Skaf and the case against his two co-accused. Ghanem and Hajeid point to the contestable identification evidence against them as compared with the overwhelming and undisputed evidence that Skaf was at the park for at least some of the time.  
     
      
       
      
    115 It is not suggested, nor could it be, that merely because Skaf's second record of interview stated that Ghanem and Hajeid were at the park meant that the jury were incapable of complying with the trial judge’s repeated directions that they should not use this evidence otherwise than in their assessment of the case against Skaf. This ERISP material remains relevant to the issue of separate trials, but its significance should not be exaggerated. For one thing, Skaf's admissions did no more than place Ghanem and Hajeid in the red car and at the park. The jury would have to accept the testimony of the complainants, including their identification evidence, before they could convict Ghanem or Hajeid of the charges laid against them. Directions to that effect were given (SU 14). There was also the compelling circumstantial evidence of the phone calls between Ghanem and Skaf and between Hajeid and Skaf at locations and times that was used to show that Ghanem and Hajeid were in the red car between Chatswood and Annandale. 
     
      
       
      
    116 The task of an appellate court is to consider whether the trial miscarried in light of everything that transpired (Verma (1987) 30 A Crim R 441). In this regard, it is relevant that Skaf entered the witness box and gave evidence that was consistent with his record of interview (at least as regards the limited role he attributed to Ghanem and Hajeid). Counsel for those two co-accused took up the opportunity to cross examine him, indeed with such vigour as to be the basis of some of Skaf's own grounds of appeal. Senior counsel for Ghanem and Hajeid in this Court urge us to recognise that this merely demonstrates the inherent problem of this particular joint trial. Conscious of the need to avoid circularity of reasoning in this regard, we are nevertheless unpersuaded of any error or ensuing miscarriage as regards the joint trials.  
     
      
       
       Wrongful admission of Ms F's photoboard identification of Ghanem (Ghanem Ground 1) 
        
       
      
    117 An application was made before the trial commenced for Ms F to be cross-examined on the voir dire concerning her identification of Ghanem. Its refusal is not a matter of appeal. In her later evidence before the jury, Ms F described the part played by the man whom the Crown alleged was Ghanem (see the above summary relating to the various counts involving Ghanem). Ghanem was one of the eight males who spoke to the two girls at Chatswood and who got into the ""small red car [that] drove up behind the van"" (Tr p265). Ms F said that the one of the males in the red car had a ponytail and she estimated his age to be about 21. The hair was shaved underneath, like an undercut. She estimated the ponytail to be about 20 to 25 centimetres long. As indicated previously, evidence as to Ms F’s identification of Ghanem (from herself, the police and as shown in a video) was admitted over objection. 
     
      
       
      
    118 The objection had been based on the inherent unfairness of the identification process because of the lapse of time and the nature of the photos contained on the particular photoboard. However, the weight of the objection needs to be considered in the context of the total evidence of the identification processes involving Ms F. This includes the identification process that occurred the previous day in which she had identified Skaf from a different photoboard and the evidence about the occasions when no photoboard identification occurred. The issue should also be considered on the basis that the jury were to have placed before them videotapes and transcripts of the entire identification processes (save for portions edited out due to rulings favourable to the accused). 
     
      
       
      
    119 Ghanem submits that the photoboard and the video of Ms F identifying his photograph ought to have been excluded under ss137, 138 or 135 of the Evidence Act 1995. The complainant had described the person she saw at Chatswood and at the park as having a ponytail with hair tied back, not plaited, and 20 to 25 centimetres in length. Only eight of the 15 photographs shown on the particular photoboard with Ghanem’s picture showed persons who had hair that was shoulder length or longer. No photograph depicted any person wearing his hair in a ponytail or a plaited ponytail (not even Ghanem’s, it should be added). The photograph of the appellant was said to be distinctive when compared to the other photographs because of the greater length of hair visible compared with that shown in the other photographs.  
     
      
       
      
    120 It is submitted that the complainant later confirmed in cross-examination that it was the difference in the hair of the photograph of Ghanem, compared to the other photographs on the board, that caused the photograph to stand out. This submission is not in fact supported by the passage cited (Tr p460) or by Tr p467 which is probably intended to have been cited.  
     
      
       
      
    121 A second basis of objection was that Ghanem’s photograph was in the same position on the board and had the same number (14) as the photograph of Skaf that the complainant had identified on the previous day from a different photoboard. This is unfortunate, but it was not suggested at trial or on appeal that there had been any misconduct on the part of the police. Nor was it put to the complainant that this factor had influenced her in making the identification. We therefore put this matter aside. 
     
      
       
      
    122 Thirdly, Ghanem points to differences between Ms F’s description of the man with the ponytail and Sergeant Adams’ recollection of the man with a ponytail in the red car he stopped for speeding at Glebe. We do not consider these differences to be significant and certainly not destructive of the admissibility of Ms F’s evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    123 In our view, the trial judge has not been shown to have erred in his decision to admit the evidence of Ghanem’s identification. There is nothing particularly distinctive about Ghanem's appearance on the photoboard apart from the fact that his long hair is showing. (He had opted to be photographed in this way.) The videotape of the identification enabled the jury to assess the whole process on that day and the day before it. There were, as His Honour observed, a number of other men depicted on the photoboard whose hair was long enough to have been put in a ponytail. 
     
      
       
      
    124 In R v Nathan Lee (NSWCCA, unreported, 5 May 1997) Cole JA (with whom Dowd and Sperling JJ agreed on this matter) said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         It is not a satisfactory basis of challenge to identification evidence to seek to render it tenuous by seeking to exclude from the array of photographs produced all those with a feature or features different to the precise description previously given to police. Whilst the photographs must bear a relationship to the description given, it is always a matter of judgment whether they constitute an appropriate and sufficient panel from which any selection may be made. 
         
        
        
       We agree. 
        
       
      
    125 The circumstances of Ms F's identification and the possibilities of mistake on her part were matters to be explored in cross-examination calling forth a need for proper directions. But the decision to admit the evidence of the positive identification of the appellant did not miscarry. This ground of appeal must be rejected. 
     
      
       
      
    126 So too must the submission that the trial miscarried because the identification evidence was not excluded in light of the cross-examination of Ms F. It should be added that no such request was made at trial. 
     
      
       
      
    127 It was common ground that s115 of the Evidence Act did not preclude the admission of the evidence. No question of an identification parade arose in this trial. 
     
      
       
        
       Errors in directions on identification evidence (Ghanem Ground 2; Hajeid Ground 3) 
        
       
      
    128 Section 116 of the Evidence Act requires the trial judge to inform the jury that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence; and of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
       
      
    129 At the time when Ms F gave her evidence of Ghanem's photoboard identification the jury were told (Tr p379):  
     
      
       
        
         
         ... you've always got to be careful in evaluating identification evidence. 
         
        
       
       
        
         
         In evaluating evidence of identification you will have to have regard to such things as the opportunity the person had of observing the person who is identified and that takes into account things like lighting, the length of time the person identified was in the company of the person who was doing the identification, opportunity to observe, accuracy of observation, the circumstances in which any identification is made, did the person who identified have the capacity at the time to form a clear judgment, did that person have an opportunity to have a clear view, the reliability of the witness doing the identifying. All those are matters. They are not the only matters that you look at, but you certainly look at those matters. There are many cases where people have been wrongly identified, sometimes as a matter of enormous certainty by someone who has claimed to have had a great deal of opportunity to observe and it’s been shown that that person is wrong. I’m passing no judgment in saying this. I’m merely saying you have to exercise great caution. You have to look at it carefully and you have to evaluate those matters and you have to be aware that the experience of the Courts over centuries is that people often mistakenly identify the wrong person. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    130 In the Summing Up, the judge gave the following warning (SU 10-12): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Just before we adjourn, the Crown case has been disputed by Messrs Ghanem and Hajeid particularly in relation to identification. I will come back to the cases against them in detail, but largely, in a broad sort of a way, you might think they do not dispute that each of the complainants was the subject of sexual intercourse without consent in the park, nor do they dispute any of the other charges. In a general sense they don’t dispute these things happened but they do dispute that they were there, that they had anything to do with it. So each of Messrs Ghanem and Hajeid have, through their counsel, put to you that they were not there. 
         
        
        
         
         Now if they were not there they could not possibly be guilty of anything. Let me make that a clear proposition. Unless they were there they could not be guilty. Firstly, it is said against each of them that each of them committed direct offences against [Ms P and [Ms F], and I will get to the detail of that later, and it is said that they are guilty because, being there with others who were committing offences, they were present aiding and abetting and encouraging these others to commit offences. If they were not at the park on the night they could not commit the offence, any offences. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether they were there, you are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that they were there or you are so uncertain you are not really sure, then they must be acquitted of all charges, because only if they were there could they be convicted. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence against them that implicates them in the charges is evidence of identification, and I have to warn you that there are many many cases, unfortunately, where people have been wrongly identified, sometimes by people who state the identification with utter certainty, “I have no doubt whatever that is the man or that is the woman, I would remember their faces forever, it is imprinted on my mind”, you will hear those sorts of expressions. And, long experience in the courts teaches that it is very very common for people to make mistaken identifications. Counsel have pointed out to you how often is it that you could approach someone in the street and think it is someone you know well and then at the last minute realize it’s not, even though you think they look exactly the same. 
         
        
        
         
         So a person, a witness can give perfectly honest evidence, completely honest evidence but be mistaken. You have to look very carefully at the evidence of identification. The evidence of identification is given by [Ms F] and by [Ms P]. In the case of Mr Ghanem and in the case of Mr Hajeid that evidence of identification is not supported by anything else, there is nothing else to link those two people to what occurred in the park. 
         
        
        
         
         You have to consider anxiously when you are looking at that evidence whether it is reliable evidence, there is no suggestion the persons concerned were not being truthful, is it reliable, is it a proper basis for it to be concluded that a citizen is guilty of serious criminal offences? If having given the matter anxious consideration you are uncertain, then you should give the benefit of that uncertainty to the accused and the accused are entitled to be acquitted. On the other hand, if having considered the evidence of identification you consider it is reliable, you then go on to consider the other matters in the case. 
         
        
        
       
      
    131 The appellants could not and do not suggest that there was an inadequate informing and warning of the jury as regards identification evidence generally. Their complaint is that the judge did not inform the jury about the reasons for caution in the circumstances of the particular case. In other words, he failed to link the general warning to the particular issues confronting the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    132 In R v Eldridge [2002] NSWCCA 205 James J (with whom Heydon JA and Kirby J agreed) said (at [42]-[44]): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         [42] … In sum, what was put was that in order for his Honour to comply with s.116 of the Evidence Act, it was incumbent on him to direct the jury concerning the absence from the evidence of matters said to be important or possible inconsistencies between witnesses on such matters and to describe those matters as ""weaknesses in identification"". Section 116 contains no such express requirement. Section 116 reads as follows:-  
          
          
         ""1. If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury:-  
          
          
           
           (a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence; and  
            
           (b) of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case.  
           
          
          
         2. It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in so informing the jury.""  
          
          
         [43] However, in  
         Domican v. The Queen  
         (1992) 173 CLR 555, the High Court in reference to the warning required under the common law held at 561-562:-  
          
          
           
           ""The terms of the warning need not follow any particular formula. But it must be cogent and effective. It must be appropriate to the circumstances of the case. Consequently, the jury must be instructed 'as to the factors which may affect the consideration of [the identification] evidence in the circumstances of the particular case'. A warning in general terms is insufficient. The attention of the jury 'should be drawn to any weaknesses in the identification evidence'. Reference to counsel's arguments is insufficient. The jury must have the benefit of a direction which has the authority of the judge's office behind it. It follows that the trial judge should isolate and identify for the benefit of the jury any matter of significance which may reasonably be regarded as undermining the reliability of the identification evidence.""  
           
          
          
         [44] Assuming, but not deciding, that the requirements of s.116 correspond entirely with those of  
         Domican  
         (supra), that decision does not require the judge to lend the judicial office to a characterisation of matters of evidence as showing weaknesses in fact. For a judge to do would be to intrude into the realm of the jury. It requires the jury to be instructed on matters of significance which the jury might consider might undermine reliability as the closing sentence of the passage cited makes clear. (See also  
         Festa v The Queen  
         (2001) 208 CLR 593, Gleeson CJ at [26], McHugh J at [80], Kirby J at [173] and [176] and Hayne J at [217-219].) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    133 It is not necessary for a judge to lend judicial authority to every argument available to defence counsel on the evidence. Nor is it necessary for the judge to draw attention to every disparity in observed physical features of the alleged offender as noted by different witnesses (R v Cook NSWCCA, unrep, 24.8.98, Eldridge at [56]). 
     
      
       
      
    134 The general submission that the judge failed to relate the warning about identification evidence to the facts of the case must be rejected. His Honour said (SU 13-14): 
     
      
       
        
         
         In the case of the other two accused it is purely identification evidence. In considering that identification evidence you must consider all of the circumstances in which the identification is made. You have the videos again to look at if you wish to. You have to consider the opportunity that each of them had to observe these persons on the night. You have to consider whether in fact either of them identified or had sufficient opportunity to clearly identify them at Chatswood for a start, being the first place they saw them, and then later at Northcote Park, being the second place. In between times on the evidence Messrs Ghanem and Hajeid were not in the van. Hence the opportunity to observe them was in two locations. 
         
        
        
         
         Did they have sufficient opportunity, what did they observe? You look at things like the lighting in both places and what they were doing at the time. Were they looking at them, were they distracted, could they be confusing them with somebody else? There were eight men on this night involved in the incident on the evidence. Could they have been confusing them with one of the other eight or with some other person? 
         
        
        
         
         [Ms P] referred to a friend of hers. Is that a sound basis for identifying a person; I have a friend who looks just like that therefore that is him? Think about it. That may be in a particular case and then again it may be a very good example how difficult it can be to be certain about identification. 
         
        
        
         
         In relation to the events at Chatswood counsel for Messrs Ghanem and Hajeid put to you things like did they have any particular reason to observe either of them, what were they doing at the time, were they talking to other people? Was their attention diverted by Mr Skaf, were they really talking to him and not noticing the others? What was so significant about them anyway? Was there any particular reason for remembering two people out of eight? 
         
        
        
         
         You have to consider that this case involves not only Messrs Skaf, Ghanem and Hajeid on the Crown case having sexual intercourse without consent, but other persons, other men who are unidentified, they could not identify anybody else. Then you look at things like the description and the photographs that were identified. You weigh up all these things and consider in the end, are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the identification has been a proper one. If you are, you should then go on to consider the next aspects of [the] case. If you are not, you should think no more about the case because unless each of them is identified to your satisfaction then each of them is entitled to be acquitted. 
         
        
        
       
      
    135 When the judge was separately considering the identification issues involving Ghanem and Hajeid, he reiterated them in detail and in strong terms, albeit without repeating the word “warning”. The jury were reminded to look at the video recording of Ms F’s identification of Ghanem and were asked to consider it in the context of the occasions when she identified nobody (SU 56-7).  
     
      
       
      
    136 As regards Ghanem, the judge said (SU 57-8): 
     
      
       
        
         
         In relation to Mr Ghanem, she was asked why she placed the circle around the number 14 and she said she recognised him on the night she was assaulted. “He was the one with the pony tail”. She said “I saw him at Chatswood and the park”. 
         
        
        
         
         Well now, that is evidence that that was Mr Ghanem. You can look at the way in which she gave it to the police. You can compare what she said to the police and the way she did it by looking at the video with what she said in the witness box. 
         
        
        
         
         You can decide for yourself whether she was certain in identifying or doing it hesitantly, looking carefully at it. There is evidence that Mr Ghanem wore a pony tail on other occasions. There was a search of the premises he lived at. You have been shown a video which is in evidence which has no sound on it showing police going through these premises and Mr Ghanem, as I remember him first of all appearing with a big hood on his head and a cap. He wears that for some time. Eventually he takes it off and you see what looks like a pony tail. That is hair tied up at the back with a rubber band or string or something around it. 
         
        
        
         
         The photograph taken, his hair was hanging loose. In court he appears to be wearing much the same form of hair style. That is her identification. You have to look at her evidence and the opportunity she had for making the observations. It has been put on behalf of Mr Ghanem that she had very little opportunity, that he was only there briefly at Chatswood in her vision. The park itself was dark. How could you be certain of it. She never met him before. You have seen him sitting here. You can form your own opinion of how he looks. You may think he is a very distinctive looking man and he wears his hair style in a very distinctive way. Was he wearing it that way on the night? That is a matter for you to decide. 
         
        
        
         
         Did she, having regard to the meeting in the park, the lighting at Chatswood, her opportunity to observe, distractions, really clearly identify. It has been put to you and you should think about that, that by the time it is said Mr Ghanem actually sexually assaulted her quite a few other men had sexually assaulted her. She had been crying. On her own evidence she was crying. She was upset. She may well have been very confused. She has given evidence that suggests that confusion. Was she with one man after another coming to her, as she described, was she really in a position to clearly identify any. Think carefully about it, as I said to you identification has always brought with it peril. People have been wrongly identified in the past by people who are utterly certain and yet sometimes years later are shown to be wrong. 
         
        
        
         
         You should convict someone based on identification only if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the identification is accurate, that the person who gives the identification was reliable and accurate, had the opportunity to observe, did observe and what she has told you is accurate. As I said, there is no attack on the truthfulness as such. 
         
        
        
       
      
    137 His Honour reiterated Ms McSpedden’s submissions, on behalf of Ghanem, in relation to the identification issues (SU 62, 63). 
     
      
       
      
    138 Ghanem accepts that the trial judge informed the jury of the special need for caution before accepting identification, and generally of the reasons for that need. He submits nevertheless that the judge erred in failing to inform the jury why there was a special need in the circumstances of this case.  
     
      
       
      
    139 The submissions implicitly accept that the judge gave directions that included the need for careful evaluation in a number of specifics related to the particular facts. The submissions seek to build an appeal on additional matters, some of which were addressed at trial, others of which were not the subject of complaint at trial. 
     
      
       
      
    140 The arguments developed by Ghanem in the written and oral submissions focused upon (a) the evidence given by a police officer, Sergeant Adams who had stopped the red vehicle on Parramatta Road; (b) certain evidence of Ms P; (c) the ramifications stemming from the possibility that Ms F was mistaken in saying that the long-haired man who assaulted her had a pony tail, not a plait and (d) a displacement effect. 
     
      
       
      
    141 As to (a), Sergeant Adams described each of the occupants of that vehicle, according to his recollection as prompted several weeks after the event. He described one of the occupants as being of Caucasian appearance with his hair in a plaited ponytail. It is submitted that the contrast between this description and Ms F’s description of the man with a (mere) ponytail should have been spelt out to the jury in the summing up. In fact it was. Judge Finnane reminded the jury (at the request of Ms McSpedden) of the description given by the police officer who stopped the red car at Glebe. It was to the effect that one of the occupants had plaited hair and not a pony tail flowing (SU 67). Rule 4 should apply to the uncertain extent that any more should have been said. 
     
      
       
      
    142 As to (b) and (c), Ghanem’s complaint is that Ms P gave evidence of a man with a plaited pony tail assaulting her and sexually assaulting her after the occupants of the red car had left the park. We deal with this issue later, where we consider the submission that the judge should have reminded the jury in the summing up about the basis for having directed a verdict in Ghanem’s favour as regards counts 18 and 19 of the old indictment. For the moment, we point out that there was a direction on this matter at SU 49. And we add that the complaint raised first on appeal that the summing up was defective for not spelling out particular possibilities concerning the different pictures on the photoboard containing Ghanem’s photograph is in our view meritless. 
     
      
       
      
    143 Issue (c) is Ghanem’s complaint about the difficulties associated with photoboard identifications and the risk of the “displacement effect” where a witness subconsciously permits a photograph to displace his or her memory of the offender, leading to a false identification at a later identification parade (Alexander v The Queen (1981) 145 CLR 395 at 409, Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414 at 429). This was not the situation that arose in the present case. No identification parade was offered either before or after the photoboards were shown to the witness. The photograph identified was incontrovertibly that of Ghanem. 
     
      
       
      
    144 Two photoboards, each containing 15 pictures were examined on 8 November, the occasion when Skaf was identified. Three photoboards of similar content were examined on 9 November, when Ghanem was identified. On the latter occasion Ms F said ""he actually, like he had his hair tied back the night he assaulted me but I recognise the face. But he also made me give him oral sex."" The complainant was asked about this evidence in re-examination. She said that ""he was the face I saw at Chatswood and at the park"" (Tr p505). Earlier, in cross-examination, Ms F denied the possibility that she had seen the man identified at Chatswood but not at Greenacre (Tr p466). Ms F acknowledged that photograph 14 on Ex C7 was the only picture of a man with long hair out loose, but she denied that she picked that photograph because it stood out as being a bit different from all the others (Tr p 467). Over half of the men shown on that photoboard had longish hair, albeit not visibly as long as Ghanem’s (for some of them the hair was pulled back in such a way that it was not possible to determine its length). 
     
      
       
      
    145 Ghanem relies heavily on Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414 at 429-30 as to the appropriate form of directions that should have been given. 
     
      
       
      
    146 There was evidence, including videotape evidence, that Ms P made photo identifications of ""Adam"" (Skaf) on 16 November 2000 and of Hajeid on 8 December 2000. It is the latter identification that is relevant as regards Hajeid’s ground of appeal on this topic. The transcript of the video identification (omitting preliminaries) shows Ms P identifying Hajeid's photograph after having been asked to indicate ""if you are able to positively identify any person whose image is in this presentation"". She said “Yep, number 6” on the basis that she recognised the person identified on the basis that he was one of the group that approached the girls at Chatswood and who had made her give him oral sex at the park at Greenacre. She said that he was the man referred to as Sammy and he had travelled in the red car. His hair and his mouth were particular features about his face that stood out. She said that ""he reminded me of a friend and so that's, like he was similar to someone that I knew, so, I recognise him.... Like, cause when I met him, he reminded me of my friend and there's just something about... "". This was evidence of a positive identification. 
     
      
       
      
    147 Ms P gave evidence about this identification, linking the identified person with the man called Sammy about whom she had earlier given evidence concerning an act of forced oral sex that took place near the toilet at the park. She said that the photograph ""looks like Sammy"", an expression that she explained in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""well, he's got the same features as Sammy did but I can't say, like, people look different when you see them in person."" (Tr p577 ). 
          
         
        
       
       
       Asked what she meant by this, she said: 
        
         
         “Well, it looks like him as far as I can tell”. 
          (Tr p578) 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    148 In cross-examination Ms P agreed that she had given a description of Sammy as having curly hair with blond streaks. She also agreed that the photograph she had identified (ie Hajeid’s photo) did not have blond streaks (Tr p664). That was as far as the cross-examination took the challenge in relation to the photoboard identification.149 The crown prosecutor reexamined and elicited the following (Tr pp664-5): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. Why did you pick the photo? 
          
         A. Because it looks like Sammy. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What do you mean by that? 
         
        
        
         
         OBJECTION (LANGLEY) QUESTION ALLOWED 
         
        
        
         
         A. Because on the night at Chatswood I remember he looks like someone I knew, reminded me of someone I knew already, and that is how I could remember him. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what was it about the photograph which you have circled that caused you to circle it? 
          
         A. I just looked at the photo and then I pictured the night and that is who it looks like. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Excuse me? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: She said, “I just looked at the photograph, I pictured the night, and that is who it looks like.” 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Like who? 
         
        
        
         
         A. Sammy, it looks like Sammy. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And what, if anything, is there that effects on your view that it looks like Sammy if there are no blond streaks in the hair? 
          
         A. What do you mean? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What difference does it make that there is or isn’t blond streaks, in the photograph? 
          
         A. It doesn’t make a difference. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Why not? 
          
         A. Because it looks like him, his face. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. What bits? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: She said “His face”. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Of his face, what bits? 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, I think we have gone into this enough. 
         
        
        
       
      
    150 As regards Hajeid, the abovementioned warnings and directions were supplemented with the following (SU 58-59): 
     
      
       
        
         
         In relation to Mr  
         Hajeid 
         , again, the major case or the most important element of the case against him is identification. Again you will be able to look at the video cassette and see how certainly it was that Miss P… identified him. 
         
        
        
         
         Look carefully at both these pieces of evidence, the video concerning both women. See how they approach the task when looking at the photo boards. In her evidence in this court she said when shown the photo board that had Mr  
         Hajeid 
          on it, “It looks like Sammy, it has the same features as Sammy did but I can’t say, like people look different when you see them in person, it looks like him as far as I can tell.” In the video she was asked by the police “please indicate if you are able positively to identify any persons, images in this presentation” and her answer was “yep, number six”. She was asked by the Crown in evidence “why did you say that”. She said “because I think it is him”. Now again, Mr  
         Hajeid 
         ’s counsel, Ms Langley, criticised this identification evidence and invited you to look very carefully at it. “Is it sufficient”? “Are the circumstances sufficient”? There is evidence that he was the one who asked [Ms P] to get in the car at Chatswood. Is that something that draws attention to him. But certainly, from the time he got into the car and indeed by the time Ghanem got into the car they were not seen again by either of these women until they got to Northcote Park and you have to take into account that both of them were seen only after many other events, of a sexual nature, had occurred to both women. 
         
        
        
       
      
    151 Later, when summing up Hajeid’s case his Honour said (SU 62): 
     
      
       
        
         
         [Ms Langley, counsel for  
         Hajeid 
         ] says you wouldn’t believe a word Mr Skaf says because he is a liar and I have explained to you before why she says that. Miss F… did not identify Mr  
         Hajeid 
         . Why is that if he was there? Why would she not identify Mr  
         Hajeid 
          and the other one would? She says the claim by Mr Skaf in the witness box that he rang Mr  
         Hajeid 
          is just false. There is nothing to support it, he is just doing it to make life difficult for Mr  
         Hajeid 
         . She said as far as Mr  
         Hajeid 
          is concerned, Miss P… had little opportunity to observe him. She had no reason to memorise the faces of any of the men. She was just someone who was going forward, together with Miss F…, to have a lot of fun. She had no more than six or seven minutes to observe Mr  
         Hajeid 
         , and at the time she was distracted by other events at Chatswood. Mr  
         Hajeid 
          was not in the white van, there were no lights in the park. The park was dark. On the video it took her 29 seconds to identify Mr  
         Hajeid 
         . You look at it. I didn’t bother counting it myself, but the seconds were shown on the screen, you can certainly count it up, if you want. She says suspicion is not enough, certainty is needed. These things are true and you consider what she has said. 
         
        
        
       
      
    152 Hajeid’s submissions concerning the directions about Ms P’s identification of him as “Sammy” commence with the complaint that this evidence should not have been characterised as ""identification evidence"", but was properly to be seen as ""resemblance"" evidence (cf Pitkin v The Queen (1995) 130 ALR 35, R v Cook NSWCCA unrep, 24.8.98). Strictly speaking, this is a submission touching the admissibility of the evidence and not the directions that should have accompanied it. In any event, we cannot accept this characterisation of the complainant’s evidence set out above.  
     
      
       
      
    153 Pitkin was quite unlike the present case. No question of excluding evidence arose. At issue was whether a conviction was “unsafe and unsatisfactory”. The conviction rested on the fact that a witness who had seen the offender identified three photographs of the appellant with the comment “This looks like the person”. The High Court held that this was consistent with an absence of positive identification and therefore incapable of sustaining the conviction. By contrast, Ms P’s identification was clear and specific, being bolstered and not undermined by her explanation about Hajeid reminding her of a friend.  
     
      
       
      
    154 Cook was a case where the identification was explained contemporaneously on the basis that “He looked extremely like the person that was in the car”. No objection was taken at trial and r4 was applied in the dismissal of the appeal. The conviction in Cook was not “unsafe or unsatisfactory”, for reasons that cast no useful light in the present appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    155 Hajeid also submits that the directions were inadequate because they provided no assistance on how the jury should approach evidence that the appellant “looks like” the alleged offender. It is submitted that the judge should, at a minimum, have noted that the evidence was (or could reasonably be regarded as) evidence of resemblance only; that the jury should be careful before inferring that it was a positive identification; that even if it was a positive identification that they must still approach it with care; and that there may be many people who “look like” the offender, particularly given the general nature of the description of the offender. R v Turner (2000) 76 SASR 163 at [16]-[20], [36]-[40] and [101]-[102] is cited, but examination of those passages discloses that there is no similarity between the facts of that case and the present appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    156 The summing up made clear to the jury that they had to be satisfied that a positive identification had been made and that they had to consider general and particular issues requiring care in their evaluation. The directions are not to be faulted for additional factual arguments that might have been canvassed but which were not the subject of any requested redirection. 
     
      
       
      
    157 Nor were the jury misdirected, as Hajeid submits, when invited to look carefully at the video of the photographic identification process to “see how certainly it was that [Ms P] identified him” (SU 58). It would have been unrealistic and wrong to instruct the jury to consider only the complainant’s evidence at trial as to her thought processes then or at the earlier time of the photoboard identification. No such direction was ever sought, for the good reason (we assume) that none was needed as to how the jury should go about their task of weighing these two items in evidence. The “real” evidence embodied in the video provided the more accurate window into what actually happened at the moment of identification, supplemented as it was by the complainant’s later testimonial commentary and the opportunity to cross-examine generally. Jurors are capable of weighing this sort of material without special assistance unless the situation raises particular problems likely to be beyond the lay capacity to reason and assess evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    158 The directions are also challenged for having failed to refer to the evidence of Skaf and for having failed to give a warning about the risk of Skaf having made a mistaken identification. We deal with this aspect of the identification directions below. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions re Skaf; Failure to give warning about Skaf’s evidence (Ghanem Ground 3; Hajeid Ground 4) 
        
       
      
    159 Ghanem and Hajeid submit that the trial judge gave inadequate directions in relation to Skaf’s evidence and that he failed to give a warning as to its unreliability. 
     
      
       
      
    160 Skaf's sworn evidence implicated his co-accused, to a degree. He did not say that they committed any offences or even that they had sexual relations with the complainants. Nevertheless, he placed them in the scene at Chatswood, in the red car as it proceeded on its interrupted journey from Chatswood to Greenacre, and among those who got out of the car when it arrived at the park. Skaf also said that Ghanem had plaited hair at the park (Tr p 1104) and he adhered to this in cross-examination (Tr pp1112, 1113). 
     
      
       
      
    161 As indicated above, Skaf was vigorously cross-examined by counsel for his co-accused who also addressed the jury that he was a liar with a motive to implicate them as part of a scheme to exculpate his brother and his brother's friend. 
     
      
       
      
    162 Skaf fell within s165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act, but there was no request for a warning in terms of subsection (2) thereof. The appellants submit nevertheless that the judge had a duty to warn the jury in light of Webb v The Queen, Hay v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41. Reliance is also placed on Chen (2002) 130 A Crim R 300 at 324 [58]. The Crown cites R v JGW [1999] NSWCCA 116 at [62] and R v Clarke (2001) 123 A Crim R 506 at 526-9 as to the fact that a warning was not requested indicating strongly that the summing up was not defective (at least if there was experienced trial counsel). 
     
      
       
      
    163 The jury were obviously aware that Skaf's credibility was under serious attack from all quarters, and with good justification in light of the content of his two ERISPs. There were frequent reminders during the summing up. The clearest indication that the jury viewed him as a man of little credibility lies in the verdicts they brought in against him. 
     
      
       
      
    164 The appellants Ghanem and Hajeid fear that the jury drew some support for the complainants’ evidence against them from its partial corroboration by Skaf. This is indeed possible and it therefore forms the background against which these grounds of appeal come to be addressed. The jury had been given conventional directions as to their capacity to accept part of a witness's evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    165 The nub of the complaint formulated on appeal is that the trial judge should have told the jury that Skaf fell within ""a particular category"" (of suspect witness) (Ghanem submissions, par 46) and that they should use caution in deciding to accept his evidence for that reason. 
     
      
       
      
    166 In our view, no miscarriage stemmed from the absence of this unrequested warning. This was not a case in which an accomplice had made admissions out of court that were unable to be tested in court (contrast Williams v The Queen (2000) 119 A Crim R 490). Nor was Skaf the common type of co-accused who had something to gain by implicating accomplices (such as occurs with an indemnified Crown witness). It is true that these appellants suggested that Skaf was concerned to protect his brother and his brother's friend Sheikh. But as we point out elsewhere, this defence lacked any evidentiary basis. More to the point, nothing was shown at trial or on appeal to explain how implicating Ghanem and Hajeid assisted in some scheme on Skaf's part to get his brother and his brother's friend off the hook. On all versions, there were eight young men in the two vehicles and at the park. 
     
      
       
      
    167 Nor was this a case where Skaf’s evidence stood alone. At its highest, it added weight to the evidence of the complainants. 
     
      
       
      
    168 It may not be conclusive, but it is nevertheless significant in considering whether there was a miscarriage, to note that neither appellant made the request contemplated by s165(2). One suspects that no warning was thought necessary because the attack on Skaf's credibility was so patent. That attack came from both the Crown and the co-accused. There would also have been real difficulty in formulating the missing explanation that the appellants now contend should have been given as the focus of the judicial warning. There was simply no evidence to support the theory that Skaf was seeking to protect his brother and his brother's friend. What was the judge to say in these circumstances? What could have been hypothesised about Skaf having a false motive to implicate his co-accused in a manner that was both fair to Skaf and consistent with the evidence? It is difficult to see how naming Ghanem and Hajeid enhanced Skaf’s credibility, as Ghanem and Hajeid now submit. 
     
      
       
      
    169 Skaf’s evidence about the presence of Ghanem and Hajeid did not have the effect of downplaying Skaf’s own role or increasing that of the others (contrast R v Diez-Orozco, [2003] NSWSC 1050 at [14]). To have suggested or even hinted otherwise would have been unfair to Skaf without materially advancing the legitimate interests of his co-accused. 
     
      
       
      
    170 Webb's and Hay’s Case does not assist the appellants. A man (Webb) and woman (Hay) were charged with the murder of a man with whom they had been drinking. Hay gave evidence that although she was involved in the violence against the deceased, it was Webb that delivered the fatal blow. Webb did not give evidence. The judge warned the jury that, for the purpose only of determining Webb’s guilt, they should treat Hay’s evidence as that of an accomplice, and should not rely on it in the absence of corroboration or unless they were convinced it was reliable. The High Court held that this accomplice warning had not prejudiced Hay’s defence. The balance between the interests of Webb and Hay was appropriately maintained. The leading judgment on this issue was given by Toohey J, who pointed out (at 95) that Hay was, on her own evidence, clearly an accomplice to the killing of the deceased. The directions confined the warning to the use which might be made of Hay’s evidence to convict Webb (see also Deane J at 81). 
     
      
       
      
    171 The judgments in Webb and Hay stressed that the need for and terms of an appropriate warning in such a case had to be determined with reference to the particular facts. These principles do not assist Ghanem and Hajeid, who did not seek the warning they now invoke. 
     
      
       
      
    172 Hay’s situation was also different to that of Ghanem and Hajeid in that a warning in Webb’s interest was required because Hay was obviously inculpating Webb by exculpating herself. She was clearly an accomplice who had much to gain by implicating her co-accused (see per Brennan J, dissenting at 64-5). Skaf’s naming of his co-accused was not of that character. 
     
      
       
      
    173 One passage in the summing up is raised as a matter of particular concern by Ghanem. His Honour said (SU 64): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Their presence, their proved presence would of course create great difficulties for them, if you considered that the other evidence was established. So if you considered that Mr Skaf correctly put them in the park, even if you did not accept the identification evidence of Ms F… and Ms P…, you could accept evidence that they were there. You could also accept that they were there, having got there in a red car, because of the evidence of Mr Skaf again that they arrived in the same red car that they had been in at Chatswood. If you accept Mr Skaf’s evidence, even if you do not accept the identification evidence, then the other evidence still stands against them that they were there. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    174 Ghanem submits that this indicated to the jury that they could convict him based on Skaf’s evidence, even if they rejected the identification evidence of Ms F. This is a forced reading of a passage that was not the subject of any requested redirection. At its highest, the direction informed the jury that Skaf's evidence of identification of his co-accused was in fact evidence. In the opening sentence of the passage complained of and elsewhere in the summing up, the jury were told that they could not convict without accepting the identification evidence of the complainants (see SU 12, 13-14, 58-9). It is inconceivable that the jury would have done otherwise. 
     
      
       
      
    175 Hajeid's submissions generally followed that of his fellow appellant in this regard. One particular submission, namely that there was error in failing to give a warning regarding the possibility that Skaf was mistaken in identifying Hajeid, is quite absurd in the circumstances. The two men were friends from their schooldays, well known to each other. Their telephone numbers were coded into each other’s mobile phones and they spoke to each other on the night in question when the cars stopped in the Annandale area. Dhanhoa v The Queen (2003) 77 ALJR 1433, [2003] HCA 40 is a welcome reaffirmation that the Evidence Act is to be applied as a working tool in the context of the adversary system. To suggest that Skaf’s role of co-accused was sufficient in itself (by analogy to s165(1)(d)) to call forth a duty to give an unrequested warning about the risk of him making a mistaken identification is quite fanciful. Skaf may have been lying when he implicated his co-accused to the extent that he did, but he could not have been mistaken and no such suggestion had been put to him in cross-examination. The logic of the argument would require such a warning to be given if one brother testified against another about the latter’s role in a joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
       
      
    176 The failure to give these unrequested directions did not lead to a miscarriage of justice. Rule 4 should be applied in relation to this particular complaint and these two grounds of appeal generally (see generally Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 319, R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174). 
     
      
       
        
       Directions in relation to the failure of Ghanem and Hajeid to testify; directions in relation to the possibility that Tayyab Sheikh was mistaken for Hajeid (Ghanem Ground 6; Hajeid Grounds 5 and 5A) 
        
       
      
    177 Section 20(2) of the Evidence Act permits a judge to comment on a failure of an accused to give evidence. What is not permitted is for the judge to “suggest” that the accused failed to give evidence because he or she was guilty, or believed that he or she was, guilty of the offence charged. 
     
      
       
      
    178 These grounds of appeal relate to certain directions given to the jury before the summing up and between the addresses by counsel for Ghanem and Skaf. The directions arose out of what we have characterised as the improper remarks made in the final address by counsel for Ghanem. Final addresses for the accused were given in the order: Hajeid, Ghanem and Skaf.  
     
      
       
      
    179 Ms P had identified Hajeid as the man called “Sammy” who had assaulted her at the park. Counsel for Ghanem suggested to Skaf in cross examination that he was seeking to protect his brother and his brother’s friend Tayyab Sheikh by implicating Ghanem. This in turn was linked to the allegation that Skaf had made the threatening gesture towards Chami because he knew that Chami had nominated Mohammed Skaf and Tayyab Sheikh among those present at the park (Tr pp1112-3). Counsel for Hajeid cross-examined Skaf and put to him that a friend of his brother was known as “Sam” or “Sammy” (Tr p1120). Skaf had denied all of these matters and there was no further evidence on them.  
     
      
       
      
    180 Notwithstanding, these matters were raised in final addresses on behalf of Hajeid and Ghanem, culminating in Ms McSpedden’s broadside attack on Skaf’s credibility based upon reminding the jury of her cross-examination of Skaf in which she put these matters to him. 
     
      
       
      
    181 As indicated above, counsel for Skaf promptly sought a discharge of the jury; alternatively, protective directions before he commenced his address. He was concerned to have the poison removed quickly from the jury’s mind and he had a legitimate interest to know what would be said on the topic in case he might have to address it in his own submissions. There was more than a suggestion that he would make his own comment about the failure of Skaf’s co-accused to give evidence unless the judge took matters in hand. 
     
      
       
      
    182 In this context his Honour gave the directions now objected to by Ghanem and Hajeid. The full passage is set out below, with emphasis upon the portions of which Hajeid and Ghanem complain on appeal. His Honour said (Tr p1291): 
     
      
       
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Ladies and gentlemen, before Mr Healey starts, I want to say something. In submissions that were just put to you, submissions were made about possibilities. Mrs Langley put to you in the context that in her submission to Mr Skaf was a liar, that Mr Skaf had denied Tayyab Sheikh was Sammy. Indeed, that was so, he was cross-examined and the question was put to him; “you know Tayyab Sheikh to be Sammy”. And he denied Tayyab Sheikh was Sammy. It was put Mr Skaf is a liar. So it was put to you as a possibility Mr Skaf being a liar that it may be that Tayyab Sheikh was Sammy and there was a wrongful identification. 
         
        
        
         
         Can I just say this: That submission is not founded on any fact. If a witness has a proposition put to him and denies it, then unless other evidence is called there is no evidence to support it and it is illogical, absolutely illogical to say that because someone isn’t telling the truth about some matter generally, because he denies something, that proves it is true. It is illogical and wrong. The only way which it could have been established that Mr Tayyab Sheikh was known as Sammy would have been the calling of evidence to establish that fact; none was called. You can conclude, therefore, there is no evidence whatsoever that Mr Tayyab Sheikh is Sammy. 
         
        
        
         
         Similarly the possibility raised that Mr Sheikh may, indeed, have been at the park is supported by no evidence. Mr Skaf denies it, whether he be regarded by you as lacking credibility, there is no evidence he was there. Evidence could have been called to establish that, if it was a matter of importance, but none was called, therefore it can be concluded that there is no evidence that Mr Sheikh was at the park. 
         
        
        
         
         That proposition was also referred to by Miss McSpedden in her address, that was the claim that Tayyab Sheikh may have been the assailant. And it was put in the context that in her submission Mr Skaf is an undoubted liar therefore it was said you could consider that as an issue. I tell you now there is no issue for you to consider on that.  
         There is no evidence whatsoever that Mr Tayyab Sheikh was at the park. There was no evidence that Mr Tayyab Sheikh had anything to do with any of the events on this night. And if the persons who wish to assert that was so, Mr Ghanem and Mr Hajeid, wish to establish as a fact that he was there and that he had, they could have given evidence or they could have called him. No evidence was called, therefore you can conclude there is no such evidence that Mr Sheikh was at the park. You thereafter should disregard those possibilities, there being no basis in evidence for those possibilities. 
         
        
        
         
         I say this now because Mr Healey has to address you and therefore I have given you that ruling. I direct you on those matters and he need not. If he wishes to go over it he may but he need not deal with these matters because they are matters that are irrelevant. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence as to Sammy is the evidence of the trial. The only evidence given as to Sammy was given by Miss P..... and it was given in the trial. There is no other evidence to suggest anybody else was Sammy. 
         
        
        
         
         I will have something to say later on about Mr Skaf and his credibility. That is all I wish to say this at this point. Remove altogether from your minds the notion that you have to consider possibilities based on no evidence. In general terms I can tell you, and it applies to anything said in the trial, if there is any matter of importance that is not the subject of evidence, then you can draw no conclusion about it. It would be unfair to do so. You are not permitted to speculate. The only evidence as to who was at the park is the evidence given in this trial. 
         
        
        
         
         HEALEY  
         [counsel for Skaf] 
         : Your Honour, there are just two issues on which I invite your Honour to address the jury on the same basis as part of your all encompassing direction. That is the suggestion that Mr Skaf said words to this effect to his co-accused, “If I go down you are coming with me”, that the jury only has Mr Skaf’s denials in respect of that. And secondly, that was put by Miss Langley, and secondly my learned friend Miss McSpeddon spoke about the threats to Mr Chami and that Mr Skaf said Mr Ghanem was there to protect another person. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: In evidence in the trial when Mr Skaf was being cross-examined it was put to him by Ms McSpedden that during a hearing that occurred in your absence, a hearing that concerned the admissibility of evidence, a Mr Chami came into the courtroom to give evidence at that hearing. And it was put to him that Mr Skaf looked across to him from where he sat in the dock and drew his finger under his chin, in this fashion that I am indicating to you now from left to right, to indicate that the cutting of a throat. And Mr Skaf said, “No, I don’t recall it”. The question was put, “You don’t recall it, or you say you didn’t do it?” and he answered, “I didn’t do that”. It was put that Mr Chami had told police that Tayyab Sheikh and Mohammed Skaf were two people of the eight at the park. Mr Skaf denied that proposition that Mr Chami said that. And it was put to him that in these terms “You are prepared to nominate Mr Ghanem being at the scene rather than somebody else you are protecting, isn’t that the case?” And he said, “That is not true”. Now, members of the jury, if Mr Skaf moved his hand across his throat in a way that suggested he would cut the throat of a potential witness, he would in fact be committing a serious crime. He would be attempting by intimidation to prevent a witness from giving evidence. That was a crime known as the perversion of the course of justice. Mr Skaf has denied doing any such thing. I might say the hearing was before me. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no evidence in this trial that he did any such thing. And yet there are people present at the trial who were here during that session of evidence. Those people include counsel, solicitors for the parties, and the two accused other than Mr Skaf. As well as that there have been people in the gallery, all witnessing what occurred during that time. Not one person has been called to substantiate the claim that Mr Skaf sought to intimidate a witness in a hearing before me or by threatening that he would cut his throat. And you are entitled to conclude from the absence of the calling of any evidence that indeed there is no evidence whatsoever that any such thing occurred. Had there been evidence of such a thing occurring it no doubt would have been called. 
         
        
        
         
         Similarly, it is said a threat was made to Mr Ghanem. If such a threat was made, Mr Ghanem could have given evidence of that threat. If that was important to his case. It must have been important to his case, because his counsel suggested to Mr Skaf that the threat had been made. Mr Skaf denied making any such threat. Mr Ghanem did not give evidence that any such threat was made. You can therefore conclude that there is no evidence of any such threat and no such threat was made indeed, because if it had been, evidence would have been given. Counsel operate on instructions from their clients. The client gives instructions that something happened. Counsel acts on the assumption it did happen. 
          It carries the consequence that if it is to have any weight before a jury, evidence has to be given to support it, none was given. Therefore you must disregard any suggestions of these matters that I mentioned bearing on Mr Skaf’s credibility. 
         
        
        
         
         There is no evidence that Mr Skaf threatened anybody. There is no evidence that Tayyab Sheikh was at the park or was involved in any way. And another person that was mentioned in this context was Mohammed Skaf who is a brother of Mr Skaf. There is no evidence Mr Mohammed Skaf was at the park or any way involved although you were referred by Miss Langley to a photograph this morning which is a photograph of Tayyab Sheikh which shows somebody with curly sort of hair and streaks. There is absolutely no evidence that that person was the person known as Sammy. So you must disregard those submissions in the absence of any evidence to support them and you must draw the conclusion that Mr Skaf made no threats and those persons were not present. 
         
        
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: In that last set of directions to the jury Your Honour indicated to the jury that they would be entitled to positive conclude that no such threat, that was the threat in terms of Mr Chami, was in fact made. I would ask your Honour to withdraw that observation. In my submission what the jury is entitled to conclude is that there is no evidence in the trial to conclude that such a threat was made --- 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I decline to withdraw that.  
         If a positive assertion is made that a particular event has occurred by the person who could give evidence about it and that person refuses or declines to give any evidence about it then the jury can conclude the event did not occur. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    183 In the first bolded section, the judge inferred that Ghanem as well as Hajeid had suggested that Sheikh was at the park. Strictly speaking this was wrong, because the highest that Ghanem’s counsel went was to suggest that Skaf was motivated to lie because he knew that another person (Chami) had implicated Sheikh in a statement to police. The two matters were different, but the distinction is a fine one in the context. If the particular factual error was perceived at trial it was allowed to pass without a request for redirection. Even if this was not a deliberate stance it is difficult to see what difference the factual correction would have made beyond drawing further attention to the matter. Rule 4 should be applied as regards this criticism. 
     
      
       
      
    184 In this Court Ghanem and Hajeid submit that the bolded portions involved an impermissible comment upon their failure to testify. They take no point about the balance of the direction, which was an emphatic statement to the jury about the absence of evidence to support the defence hypotheses concerning Mohammed Skaf and Tayyab Sheikh being in the park, or Skaf having threatened Chami when the latter came to court. 
     
      
       
      
    185 It was submitted that these directions breached fundamental accusatorial principles (RPS v The Queen (2000) 199 CLR 620, Azzopardi v The Queen (2001) 205 CLR 50, Dyers v The Queen (2002) 210 CLR 285). They invited the jury to conclude that certain events did not occur and to reason towards that conclusion by an impermissible manner. 
     
      
       
      
    186 The “events” were that Tayyab Sheikh and Mohmmed Skaf were at the park and that Sheikh’s nickname was Sammy. There was no evidence of this and the judge was admittedly entitled to tell as much to the jury in emphatic terms. It would also have been open to Skaf to have gone further and suggested that his co-accused had not given evidence because they believed that they were guilty of the offence concerned (cf s20(2)). Skaf’s counsel was foreshadowing that he would weigh in strongly in his address unless the judge gave an adequate protective direction. 
     
      
       
      
    187 In light of these considerations it is difficult to see that any miscarriage resulted. But the prior question is whether the judge’s remarks contained the suggestion prohibited by s20(2).  
     
      
       
      
    188 The directions given in the general summing up that followed Skaf’s counsel’s address were exemplary as regards the Crown’s onus. The jury were told that there was no onus on the accused to prove anything (SU 2). His Honour also said (SU 15-16):  
     
      
       
        
         
         The other two accused exercised a right to give no evidence, that is their entitlement. They also exercised a right to call no evidence, that is their entitlement. I have already commented on one aspect of the exercise of that right. That was to say Mr Skaf was attacked and a possible scenario was suggested where other persons were present in the park and one was said to have been Sammy. Hence it was put Mr Hajeid was not Sammy, it may have been somebody else who was Sammy. I have commented on the fact that as they called no evidence about that, they gave no evidence, those were clearly just assertions about which there is no evidence. You can not hold it against them that they have given no evidence. All you can say is that by giving no evidence they put nothing forward to you to assist you in the case. They have relied on what emerges from the Crown case and what criticisms can be made of it. 
         
        
       
      
    189 This exemplary direction elicited no request for redirection. It also neutralised any sting from the earlier direction. We reject the submission that the jury were being reminded of the stronger terms of the direction given the previous day in the interlude between the addresses for Ghanem and Skaf. 
     
      
       
      
    190 Hajeid submits that merely because there is no direct evidence of a hypothesis consistent with innocence does not mean that the jury may disregard the possibility. Accordingly, Judge Finnane should not have told the jury to disregard the possibility that Tayyab Sheikh was at the park. R v Al Khair (NSWCCA 20.6.94). R v Osman, NSWCCA, 10 March 1998 and Adler [2002] NSWCCA 180 are cited. It is submitted that the defence was entitled to put forward the hypothesis that the appellant had been mistaken for another man. However, the hypothesis being addressed by counsel at trial went much further, and it rested upon an evidentiary basis that was wholly absent. In any event, this particular submission does not really address the s20(2) issue, because the appellants accept that it was open to the judge to instruct the jury that there was no evidence of the Tayyab Sheikh hypothesis. 
     
      
       
      
    191 The three cases cited all deal with a situation where the evidence is “susceptible of a reasonable explanation other than that the accused committed the crime” (Al Khair at p38 per Priestley JA, Gleeson CJ and Wood J concurring). This Court has recently emphasised that a hypothesis must be both “reasonable and available on the evidence” (R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 203 at [56] per Shaw J, Ipp JA and Buddin J agreeing). Since there was no evidence and since counsel’s submission was quite improper, it was well open to the trial judge to make the comment – so long as the prohibition in s20(2) was not breached (another matter entirely). 
     
      
       
      
    192 The two appellants submit that the direction invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from the failure of the defence to call evidence on the issue, thereby contravening Dyers. There was in terms no direction along the lines of Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298. Nevertheless, this was not a case in which the facts were peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, sufficient to attract the reasoning in Weissensteiner v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 217 as explained in Azzopardi at 74 [64]. It follows that the general rule applied, prohibiting a direction that the accused would be expected to give evidence personally or call others to give evidence (see Dyers at 291[5], 305[52], 328[121]). 
     
      
       
      
    193 Ghanem and Hajeid also submit that the direction was unfair because it was capable of being seen by the jury as judicial criticism of the manner in which they had each conducted their case at trial. In a sense it obviously was, but the thrust of the submission was that the criticism was unjustified and that the jury were being invited to reason that Ghanem and Hajeid were guilty of the offences charged because they failed to adduce evidence in support of the hypotheses raised by their counsel in the addresses. 
     
      
       
      
    194 These appellants also submit that the reference to counsel operating on instruction from clients carried a suggestion that the client told lies to his counsel (cf R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 690-2, 702-3). We do not agree. If this inference had been conveyed in the atmosphere of the trial, one would have expected counsel to have raised this particular complaint at the time. 
     
      
       
      
    195 In our view, the direction given to the jury shortly before counsel for Skaf addressed did not offend s20(2) or otherwise cause the trial to miscarry. The context was specific and confined to scotching the improper suggestion raised in counsel’s address. The directions given at that stage of the trial and the terms that were used would not have suggested anything to the jury beyond despatching from their minds the Mohamed Skaf/Tayyab Sheikh hypothesis and the unproven springboard upon which it had been raised. In other words, the comment did not suggest that the defendants had failed to give evidence on the hypothesis raised by their counsel because the defendants were, or believed that they were, guilty of the offence charged. 
     
      
       
      
    196 Hajeid submits that the real sting in the tail was the direction that, in the absence of evidence to support the submissions of counsel, the jury “must draw the conclusion that …. those persons [Mohammed Skaf and Tayyab Sheikh] were not present” (Tr p1294). This “bottom line” as it were is unfortunately expressed in the form of a direction to find a fact, but it does not infringe s20(2). It is really just an emphatic direction that the jury rely on the evidence and only the evidence. The submissions of counsel with their illogical hypotheses erected upon Skaf’s denials were not to be used as a substitute for evidence. There was no evidence about these two men being in the park, end of question. This did not suggest anything about the appellant’s guilt or his belief as to guilt. 
     
      
       
      
    197 The exemplary direction in the summing up did not only omit any problems associated with the earlier direction. It corrected the earlier direction by instructing the jury not to hold it against the appellants that they gave no evidence on the issue that their counsel had sought to raise. 
     
      
       
      
    198 We therefore reject these grounds. 
     
      
       
        
       Wrongful admission of evidence of Skaf’s convictions (Skaf Ground 1) 
        
       
      
    199 As indicated above, the Crown Prosecutor was given leave to cross-examine Skaf as to those of his prior criminal convictions that the judge considered went to his credibility. And, when Skaf did not admit them (professing lack of memory) the Crown was permitted to prove the convictions in reply. 
     
      
       
      
    200 The full context in which Skaf gave the evidence found to have raised his good character has been set out above. We shall briefly recapitulate.  
     
      
       
      
    201 Skaf was being cross-examined by counsel for Ghanem, who was putting to him that he was a liar. This was based mainly upon the change of stance between the first and second ERISPs.  
     
      
       
      
    202 In the first record of interview Skaf generally declined to answer any questions directed specifically at the complainants’ allegations. But, towards the end he said: “I haven’t done nothing, mate, I don’t know what you’re talking about”. In our view, Ghanem’s counsel was entitled to see this answer as going beyond invoking the right to silence and to cross-examine Skaf on the basis that he lied in the first ERISP. (That is not to say that Skaf was disentitled from putting a different interpretation on the matter, particularly as he was being assailed for having given a knowingly false answer. This in effect was what Skaf was endeavouring to do at the critical point of the cross-examination.) 
     
      
       
      
    203 There was the following exchange in response to questions putting to Skaf that he had lied at the first interview (Tr p1109, emphasis added): 
     
      
       
        
         
         McSPEDDEN: Q. It was an interview in which you say, although you’d been advised not to say anything to the police, you lied and said you didn’t know anything about the girls in the park on the night in question? 
          
         A. Excuse me, don’t call me a liar. I did not lie. They’re the words that came out of my mouth and they’re the words out --- 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’re saying they’re the truth? 
          
         A. What? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You’re saying they’re the truth? 
          
         A. The first statement I made? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes. 
          
         A. They’re the words. You can play the tape and listen to it. They’re the words I used to get out of this.  
         I’ve never been charged with anything. They’re the first charges I’ve ever had. Other than a driving offence. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    204 At this stage the prosecutor applied for leave to cross-examine Skaf about a number of convictions, relying upon ss110 and 112 of the Evidence Act. (Tr p1153). 
     
      
       
      
    205 It was common ground that Skaf had “blurted out” his assertion that he had never been charged with anything other than a driving offence (see Tr p1154. See also SU 53). Thereafter the paths diverged. The Crown urged that the witness gave a non-responsive answer with intent to convey to the jury that he was both a person of good character and inexperienced in his dealings with the police. The prosecution argued that it should therefore be permitted to show that Skaf was in truth a person of bad character and that his refusal to admit the offences reflected adversely on his credit (Tr p1154). The defence submitted that the answer did not involve a “bold statement of character as such”.  The witness was doing no more than entering into an argument with the cross-examiner. Alternatively, s192(2)(b), (c) and (d) were invoked. 
     
      
       
      
    206 At trial, counsel for Ghanem and Hajeid indicated that they supported the Crown in this matter.  
     
      
       
      
    207 The trial judge gave the prosecutor the leave sought. In his reasons, his Honour summarised the exhibit tendered by the Crown on the voir dire and held that it established that Skaf had not told the truth in saying that he had not been charged with anything. The exhibit revealed five quite recent, separate matters involving charges laid against Skaf and resulting in what may neutrally be termed adverse outcomes. These were: 
     
      
       
        
       (i) “Findings of guilt” made at the Bidura Children’s’ Court on 23 September 1997 for driving a conveyance taken without the owner’s consent and driving without a licence; 
        
        
       (ii) A charge of larceny at the Bankstown Local Court on 8 October 1998 resulting in a fine; 
        
        
       (iii) An appearance at the Downing Centre Local Court on 2 December 1998 for a series of driving offences, the most serious of which was driving in a manner dangerous to the public. These resulted in a fine and disqualification from driving; 
        
        
       (iv) An appearance at the Lidcombe Children’s’ Court on 12 November 1998 for maliciously destroying or damaging property; 
        
        
       (v) An appearance on 20 July 2001 at the Bankstown Local Court for shoplifting goods said to be valued at $2,000. 
        
       
      
    208 Judge Finnane held that there were convictions which could enable the jury to conclude that (a) Skaf was a person of bad character and (b) he was dishonest. We read his Honour as indicating that the dishonesty stemmed in part from Skaf’s false assertion in his evidence that he had never been charged with anything. The witness’ honesty bore heavily as an issue in the case and it affected both the Crown and the co-accused.  
     
      
       
      
    209 The reasons make it plain that his Honour appreciated that leave had been sought and that it could be given on terms, taking into account the matters specified in s192(2) of the Evidence Act. His Honour also considered whether he was required to refuse to admit the evidence on the ground that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice (s137). 
     
      
       
      
    210 His Honour placed particular weight on the fact that Skaf’s honesty was a critical matter in the trial. It was critical both as regards the Crown case and as regards the case of the other accused who were partially implicated by Skaf’s sworn evidence. Judge Finnane concluded that the evidence was important because it bore upon Skaf’s credibility. He was satisfied that its probative value outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. Pursuant to s192 the Crown was directed to limit its cross-examination to the matters at the Bankstown Local Court and the Lidcombe Children’s Court. It is apparent that this was done because Skaf had admitted to having had a driving offence and because the matters on which cross-examination was permitted were seen as being capable of affecting his credibility. 
     
      
       
      
    211 No submission had raised the fact that Skaf was a minor when some of the adverse matters occurred. The failure to consider such a possibility cannot be regarded as vitiating the judgment referable to s137, particularly since all of the events had taken place within approximately three years of the trial. 
     
      
       
      
    212 Skaf’s cross-examination resumed. Some time later the prosecutor asked him whether he remembered being charged at Bankstown Local Court with larceny and being fined $450 plus court costs of $51. It was not put to him that there had been a conviction, simply that the charge had been found proven (Tr p1175). Skaf said that he did not remember that charge at all. Nor did he remember being in the Lidcombe Children’s’ Court in relation to a matter of maliciously destroying or damaging property. Skaf was asked whether he remembered a court appearance at the Bankstown Local Court on 20 July 2000 on the shoplifting charges. He said he could remember that (Tr p1177), but he adhered to his earlier evidence that he did not remember the earlier charges. 
     
      
       
      
    213 The Crown then sought and was given leave to prove three matters (Tr 1201). The evidence was led in such a way as to avoid disclosure of anything suggesting that Skaf had given a false name or address when charged. A police officer gave evidence concerning the criminal history of Skaf obtained from computer records. The officer stated that the database showed records of a ""conviction"" for larceny at Bankstown Local Court on 8 October 1998, resulting in a fine of $450 plus court costs; an ""entry"" showing that proceedings at the Lidcombe Children's Court on 12 November 1998 for the offence of maliciously destroying or damaging property had resulted in a fine of $300; and a ""conviction"" on 20 July 2000 at the Bankstown Local Court for the offence of shoplifting of property to a value of less than $2000, resulting in a fine of $350 plus court costs.214 The orders made by the Bankstown Local Court were referred to as ”convictions” without objection, but this label was not given to the “outcome” of the Children’s Court proceedings. This complied with an earlier direction by Finnane DCJ (see Tr p1200) and was not the subject of any objection at trial. 
     
      
       
      
    215 This Court has received affidavit evidence from the appellants and the Crown in relation to the matters that were put to Skaf in cross-examination and proved through the evidence of the police officer called in the case in reply. This material does not cast any doubt on the fact that Skaf was dealt with by various courts as established at the trial.  
     
      
       
      
    216 The new evidence casts some additional light on the issues. It shows firstly that the convictions or orders resulted from the process known as court attendance notices (cf Justices Act 1902, s100AB). Secondly, it shows that Skaf was taken to a police station, photographed and fingerprinted in relation to the three matters put to the jury. Thirdly, it shows that the matters were disposed of in the absence of the defendant, who did not appear (cf s75B). Fourthly, it shows in the case of the proceedings at Bankstown Local Court that Skaf had given a false address and, in one case, a false name (“Adam Newlan”) when first apprehended, and that the court attendance notices had been framed accordingly. Fifthly, the Court Attendance Notices issued to “Bilal Charmy” and “Adam Gihad Newlan” were proved to have been handed to Bilal Skaf. This proof came in the form of police evidence plus signed acknowledgements of receipt (see Additional Crown Submissions §§34-41). 
     
      
       
      
    217 This material obviously cuts both ways.  
     
      
       
      
    218 In this Court, Skaf submits that the rebuttal evidence did not disclose the fact that he had been “charged” as opposed to being summonsed or made the subject of a court attendance notice. In our view this is a distinction without a relevant difference. The material relied upon by the Crown in support of the application for leave to cross-examine had referred to s75B of the Justices Act. It appears that everyone involved in the trial overlooked the import of that provision (cf Tr p1154). 
     
      
       
      
    219 Skaf also argues, as we understand it, that the recording of the false address would tend to explain why he was genuinely ignorant of the outcomes and fines, because any notification thereof would not have got back to him.  
     
      
       
      
    220 The Crown for its part points to the evidence of the false addresses and false names as indicating why Skaf may have lied when professing ignorance of these matters when cross-examined about them. The likelihood that this was so is increased in light of the evidence that the court attendance notices were sent out after Skaf had been taken to a police station, photographed and fingerprinted on two of the occasions. These are not experiences likely to have been forgotten. (It should be said at the outset that nothing was ever conveyed to the jury about these aspects of the convictions. All that was put in cross-examination and established in evidence was that Skaf had been dealt with for these offences at the places, dates and in the manner indicated.) 
     
      
       
      
    221 The primary and logically anterior submission in this Court is that Skaf had not “adduced” evidence to prove good character, with the consequence that s110(2) was not engaged. Unless it was, the Court would not need to consider issues arising under ss137 and 192. 
     
      
       
      
    222 Little attention was paid to this threshold issue at trial. There is no doubt that the prosecutor invoked s110(2) and that the Crown recognized that leave was required before that aspect of the cross-examination could proceed. There were submissions in the most general terms about the matter, but the point was taken on Skaf’s behalf that good character had not been raised (Tr pp1154-5) In granting leave, the judge implicitly accepted that the threshold was passed, but his reasons concentrate on ss137 and 192. Skaf submits that the reasoning is flawed because it does not address the s110 threshold.223 Skaf submits that his assertion that he had not been “charged” with any offence apart from a driving offence did not raise character, intentionally or otherwise. To say that someone has not been “charged” is not to assert that he or she is a person unlikely thereby to have committed the subject offence. Skaf further submits that good character was not raised deliberately (citing Gabriel v The Queen (1997) 76 FCR 279 and R v Fuller (1994) 34 NSWLR 233). At most, he was endeavouring to explain why lack of experience led to the form of the answers he gave at his first ERISP. 
     
      
       
      
    224 In our view, these submissions do not do justice to the answer that Skaf gave, or the context in which it was given. Skaf may well have been intending to assert his inexperience in dealing with the police, but the words he used went beyond this. Implicitly but clearly, they asserted that his only adverse dealings with the police involved a single driving offence. Not everyone who is charged is found guilty, but to say that someone has not even been charged (when that word is used, as it was here, generically) is to assert that nothing has even occurred to set in train the wheels of a prosecution. In Finnane DCJ’s words, Skaf had “put forward that he [had] no previous untoward brushes with the law” (Reasons, 17 December 2001, p4).  
     
      
       
      
    225 Skaf was doing more than asserting that his inexperience in dealing with the police was the explanation for his coy answers at the first ERISP. He was asserting among other things that he should not be viewed as a liar, because of his general good character. His answer was evidence “adduced to prove” good character generally, whether or not he blurted the answer out without much thought. This was the trial judge’s implicit assessment in his judgment of 17 December 2001. His Honour was well placed to form this view in the atmosphere of the trial. It is the conclusion we would also draw from reading the transcript. The suggestion that he had lied in his first ERISP had been put much earlier to him. It would not have been a surprise to him that the cross-examiner was labouring the point. 226 The principles were discussed recently by this Court in R v Bartle & Ors [2003] NSWCCA 329 at [115]-[146]. At [145]-[146] Mason P and Barr J indicated (obiter) that s110 required proof of a subjective intent to raise good character before it could be held that evidence had been “adduced by a defendant to prove … good character”. This can occur in cross-examination, if there is a non-responsive answer that amounts to more than an emphatic denial of guilt. Skaf’s answer in the present case satisfied these criteria, in our view. 
     
      
       
      
    227 The evidence being admissible, did the judge err in failing to exclude it because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Skaf (cf s137) or in failing to restrict the Crown in its use (cf s192)? The former consideration involves a balancing as distinct from a discretionary analysis, with the focus being upon “unfair” prejudice. The latter consideration involves the exercise of discretion, with consequential impact as regards appellate review. 
     
      
       
      
    228 We do not consider that Judge Finnane erred in the manner he addressed these issues. He referred to each section in terms. He concluded that the evidence was important, effectively because Skaf’s credibility was important. His Honour confined himself to the issue of fairness to Skaf, taking into account that evidence about his honesty generally affected the Crown and the other accused “in a way which perhaps is a little unusual”. The judge observed that the evidence was prejudicial, correctly noting that the issue was unfair prejudice. He concluded that the probative value outweighed the question of unfair prejudice. 
     
      
       
      
    229 The use of the material was limited pursuant to s192. The driving offence, the Bidura Childrens’ Court and Downing Centre Local Court matters were excluded. The reason appears to be that Skaf had admitted to having had a driving offence, with the result that there was no cause to rebut a (dishonest) denial. 
     
      
       
      
    230 We detect no appealable error in this analysis. This ground fails. We next address the related issue of the directions referable to this material. 
     
      
       
        
       Directions about proper use of evidence about Skaf’s character (Skaf Ground 1(a)) 
        
       
      
    231 Skaf submits that the judge erred in failing to direct the jury as to the proper use of the evidence of bad character that had been adduced. This ground was added during the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    232 Judge Finnane gave the following direction in the summing up (SU 52-53): 
     
      
       
        
         
         You must take into account the fact that he has given that evidence. During the course of that evidence he said when being pressed in cross-examination that he had never been charged with anything. As it turned out he has been charged with two offences of dishonesty, stealing and another offence of malicious damage to property. 
         
        
        
         
         What use can you make of that information? Well you can use it in a number of ways. The first thing is it does impinge or affect credibility. He says “I am someone to be believed” and if you believe him or if you have a reasonable doubt even that he might be telling the truth you would be bound to give him the benefit of that doubt. If a person is shown to be a thief you might think little reliance in general terms to be placed on his words. Thieves by the very definition are not honest, but, of course, it is a matter for you to assess. We do not know the circumstances of these convictions; one was for shoplifting and the other was stealing. He was fined in each matter by a Magistrate at a Local Court. 
         
        
        
         
         You can take that into account when you are assessing credibility and so, does this, in my opinion affect his credibility? Does it make his evidence less believable? Does it mean I believe nothing of what he says? Before you come to the conclusion you believe nothing of what he says you should look at all the evidence and weigh up carefully his words. Counsel for Messrs Ghanem and Hajeid have both pressed upon you that you should reject him as a liar and believe nothing of what he says. If you believe nothing of what he says then his evidence that they were both there, of course, is something you would reject. That is why they invite you to take that course. However, you do not have to reject everything he says. You can look at what he says and you can accept some things and reject other things. You can look indeed at why he might make false claims. 
         
        
        
         
         It has been said that he in his second record of interview did not mention Miss P…. Well, you look at the document, you consider for yourselves is it the case he did not mention her or is it a case where he said things to the police which on a reading of it would suggest that he had nothing whatever to do with her, thus was he creating a false picture deliberately to the police? 
         
        
        
         
         He has said yes he did tell lies to the police and he did it because, to use his words, “He was in enough shit” and he did not want to mention somebody else. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that may be why he said it. That answer itself may cause you to think twice about accepting him as a credible witness, that answer itself. On the other hand, you may think that is why he said it. I’ll still look at his evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         He blurted out that he had no charges. Why did he say it? You might think because he was in a bit of a corner and he wanted to make himself look a bit better than perhaps he was looking at the time. 
         
        
        
       
      
    233 The judge’s statement that the information could be used “in a number of ways” is unfortunate; as is his statement that the “first thing” was as regards Skaf’s credibility. The jury were not instructed as to any way they might or might not use this evidence other than as touching Skaf’s credibility. Nor were they instructed not to use it by engaging in propensity reasoning, ie proceeding from the supposition that if Skaf had committed crimes of dishonesty this increased the probability that he committed the offences charged (cf Eastman v The Queen (1997) 158 ALR 107 at 154). 
     
      
       
      
    234 This is the gravamen of the present ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      
    235 As to the last point, we think it is highly unlikely that the jury would have engaged in such reasoning process. The nature of the earlier offences was completely different to the offences charged. 
     
      
       
      
    236 There is one matter relevant to this lately added ground of appeal to which the Court’s attention was not drawn during submissions. We referred earlier to the unfortunate and improper submission concerning Skaf made by counsel representing Ghanem at trial. This was when she suggested to the jury in final address that Skaf had made the threatening gesture to Chami and that he had done so in connection with Chami having implicated Skaf’s brother and his brother’s friend Tayyab Sheikh. Counsel for Skaf (Mr Healey) was to give the next and third address to the jury. He sought and obtained the directions that were given at that stage in the trial and about which the appellants Ghanem and Hajeid complain in other grounds of their respective appeals. 
     
      
       
      
    237 In the submissions leading up to those directions that took place in the absence of the jury there was incidental discussion about the issue of lies (Tr p1279ff). The prosecutor indicated that he did not seek a direction that lies could be used as corroboration as to guilt. The Crown sought to rely upon Skaf’s lies only as going to his credit. In this context there was the following exchange (Tr p1280-1): 
     
      
       
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: That’s what I would have thought. Certainly it goes to his credit. 
         
        
        
         
         CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s all the Crown seeks. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: It must go to his credit. 
         
        
        
         
         HEALEY: It does and within the confines of what is said in the High Court. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: It goes to that. It goes to whether they believe him. They have also got to consider that anybody who tells lies in the witness box – certainly it goes to that. The other thing is his criminal record. It seems to me again the first thing is he raises what appears to be a false proposition that he has never had any previous charges. So there is a lie told in the witness box. That may have been blurted out without thinking. If they came to the conclusion that he was deliberately stating that, then there is a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Secondly, his criminal record establishes he had been dealt with by the Court for offences by Bankstown Local Court and Lidcombe Children’s Court for offences that could be regarded as ones of dishonesty. If a person is dishonest, then you are less likely to be able to believe what he says. 
         
        
        
         
         HEALEY: Dishonesty can have another meaning. Dishonest in relation to taking people’s property. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: Would you believe the word of a thief? I would find it very difficult to believe what somebody, who was a thief, said about something because stealing is a fairly conscious act of dishonesty. Therefore, they can take that into account in deciding how they weigh up this credibility. I don’t propose to go on to say it shows something about bad character because I think that gets into a very complicated area and I don’t want to say anything about character, merely to say it is an issue of credit. 
         
        
        
         
         HEALEY: I certainly would not embrace your Honour to say anything more than that. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: That is all I would be saying. I am not going to go on and say for the purposes of discussing with you, I am raising what can flow. I am not going to say to them that any person who steals cannot be believed. All I would say is that they have to look at it, look at the question of whether his credit is affected by that. If it is, that may bear on whether they accept his explanations. If they do not accept his explanations as being true, then he is in a bit of hot water. 
         
        
        
         
         HEALEY: If one deals with it on the issue that if they do establish it is a lie, one really has to look at whether that compounds him on the issue of guilt. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: I think it is more credibility. He has given evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         HEALEY: Surely the issues relating to his criminal history cannot have any bearing upon the issues of guilt in this trial. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: They don’t. They have an issue bearing on his credibility. They don’t act to corroborate the evidence against him or make the case against him stronger. Rather, they damage his credibility. He comes before the Court as someone who on occasions steals and he come to Court as someone who on occasions tells lies, and the propositions put to him by the Crown and by the other accused counsel that he has lied in the witness box. There is a very live issue and in considering if they do not just have the answers, they have these two other pieces of evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         HEALEY: The Crown at least had some material to work with. 
         
        
        
         
         HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    238 This passage reveals Skaf’s counsel effectively agreeing with a proposed direction that the criminal history could be referred to on the basis that it went to his credit.  
     
      
       
      
    239 When this is coupled with the absence of any request for redirection of the jury along the lines that they should not use the evidence about Skaf’s convictions to reason towards a finding of guilt in the proceedings before them, it is apparent that no miscarriage occurred. To have solemnly told the jury that convictions for offences of dishonesty did not establish a propensity for sexual assault would have been a most obvious proposition. 
     
      
       
        
       The cross-examination of Skaf by Ghanem’s counsel caused a miscarriage of justice (Skaf Ground 3) 
        
       
      
    240 This relates to the following portion of Ms McSpedden’s cross-examination of Skaf (Tr p1112): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Q. You see, early in this trial on a day when some legal argument was taking place, when the jury was not present, Mr Chami came into the Court room and you saw him, didn’t you. 
          
         A. Yes, I did. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you saw him, as he was in the Court, in the body of the Court, walking into the Court --- 
          
         A. Yeah. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. -- you looked across to him from where you sat in the dock and you drew your finger under your chin in a gesture like I’m making now (as indicated), as if to indicate a cutting of a throat, didn’t you? 
          
         A. No, I don’t recall that. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Do you not recall or do you say you didn’t do it? 
          
         A. No, I didn’t do that. 
         
        
        
         
        
       
      
    241 Skaf submits that the questions should not have been put and that a miscarriage resulted from them. 
     
      
       
      
    242 In our view, the questions were relevant and this explains why they were not objected to at trial. It was being suggested on behalf of Ghanem that Skaf would go to extreme lengths to protect his brother Mohammed and his brother’s friend Tayyab Sheikh. 
     
      
       
      
    243 Chami had been called on a voir dire by the Crown but was not later called to give evidence in the trial. The jury had no information as to what evidence he might have been going to give. It was put to Skaf by Ghanem’s counsel that Chami had nominated to the police that Skaf’s brother had been present in the park at the relevant time. Skaf had denied that he had been aware of any such allegation by Chami. The cross-examination set out above suggested that he had made the threatening gesture at Chami because of hostility towards him for having nominated his brother and/or to deter him from persisting in any intention to give such evidence to the jury. The full context of this material has been set out above. 
     
      
       
      
    244 It is submitted in the appeal that the cross-examiner’s question was in effect an allegation of serious misconduct (of a criminal nature) extraneous to the events which were the subject of the trial. So much may be accepted, but it does not follow that the questions were irrelevant or improper. The questions went to more than Skaf’s credit (cf s104(2)). They were part of an attempt to suggest that Skaf had wrongly implicated Ghanem in order to exculpate his brother and his brother’s friend. We have already discussed that scenario. The particular defence argument was lacking in logic and (ultimately) evidence, but it was open to counsel to attempt to mount it. 
     
      
       
      
    245 The questions may also have been admissible in rebuttal of the good character that Skaf had raised shortly before (see Skaf Ground 1), although leave was required before cross-examination could proceed on this basis. 
     
      
       
      
    246 No objection was taken to these questions. 
     
      
       
      
    247 Skaf is correct to submit that the question asked by Ms McSpedden was in effect an allegation of serious misconduct. But it was an allegation that had a bearing on Skaf’s credibility, a matter of vital concern to Ms McSpedden’s client. There is no basis for thinking, nor is any submission raised, that Ms McSpedden had not satisfied the ethical restraints on counsel putting such a serious matter to a witness.  
     
      
       
      
    248 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
       Error in refusing to discharge the jury as a result of Ghanem’s counsel’s address inviting the jury to conclude had made threatening gestures to Chami (Skaf ground 3a) 
        
       
      
    249 It was a different matter when Ms McSpedden addressed the jury and referred to her cross-examination of Skaf about the threatening gesture to Chami, when Skaf had denied making that gesture and when there was no other evidence on the topic. 
     
      
       
      
    250 We have already indicated our views as to the impropriety of this portion of counsel’s address. And we have considered its impact on a fair trial for Ghanem and Hajeid. 
     
      
       
      
    251 The present ground complains about the Judge’s refusal to discharge the jury in light of that address. The circumstances have been discussed above. 
     
      
       
      
    252 Judge Finnane did not err in concluding that there was no irremediable prejudice to Skaf. He noted that the submissions of Ghanem’s counsel involved a logical fallacy, and said that he would tell the jury this “in fairly strong terms”. The decision to refuse Skaf a discharge of the jury was well open to the trial judge. This ground fails.  
     
      
       
        
       Verdicts on counts 2, 11 and 12 unreasonable (Ghanem Ground 4) 
       
      
    253 Ghanem submits that the verdicts of guilty in respect of counts 2, 11 and 12 are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. These are the offences involving him and Ms P. 
     
      
       
      
    254 The submission proceeds as follows: Ms P did not identify Ghanem as one of the persons at the park. Her evidence of the sexual assault that was relied upon to support count 12 related to something that occurred behind the toilet block in which she and ""Sammy"" (Hajeid) were the only persons (immediately) present (Tr pp656, 620). It was dark at the time. Ms F gave no evidence as to the location within Northcote Park of the person referred to as the man with the ponytail, nor as to what that person was doing, at the time of the assaults relied upon to support counts 11 and 12. Mere presence at the park would be insufficient to support the conviction of the appellant (Osland v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 316 at 342). Ms P said that she was slapped in the face by a man with a plait and that Bilal Skaf’s sexual assault occurred after the slapping. But this was after the red car had left. Ms F said that the man she identified as Ghanem had his hair in a ponytail, not a plait. Ghanem received directed verdicts in relation to the counts involving those assaults that were the subjects of Counts 13 and 14 in the amended indictment. In these circumstances, the verdicts of guilty in relation to the counts concerning Ghanem's involvement in offences against Ms P were unreasonable and such that they cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
     
      
       
      
    255 It is necessary to look closely at the way that directed verdicts on the original indictment came about. The Crown case had closed and an application on behalf of Hajeid for a directed verdict had been rejected. Much of the next day was taken up with discussion in the absence of the jury about the nature of the Crown case in light of the evidence that had emerged (Tr p998ff). Judge Finnane was anxious to understand how the counts in the original indictment were to go to the jury. 
     
      
       
      
    256 In the original indictment, count 18 charged each of the three appellants with the assault upon Ms P when the long-haired man slapped her; and count 19 charged each with sexual assault in circumstances of aggravation when Skaf had forced oral sex with Ms P behind the toilet block. 
     
      
       
      
    257 During the discussion about the nature of the Crown case Ms McSpedden and Ms Langley asked for the withdrawal of counts 18 and 19 as regards their clients on the basis that the red car had departed the scene by that stage. The implicit reasoning was that the men who came in the red car left in it (Tr p1010-1011). Ms McSpedden submitted that Ms P’s evidence was that the red car left prior to the man with the plait assaulting her, and that the sexual assault involving Adam (Skaf) occurred later. Ms Langley adopted this submission (Tr p1011) and she added that Ms P had not identified the man with the plaited hair as Ghanem. Ms Langley also submitted that there was no evidence that Ghanem was in the park after the red car had driven off. 
     
      
       
      
    258 Judge Finnane asked the prosecutor for his submissions in relation to counts 18 and 19. His Honour asked whether Ghanem and Hajeid could be responsible for further acts after they had left the park, in a context where the Crown case on accessorial liability was being put on the basis of presence ready to assist as distinct from pre-concerted plan to assault. The prosecutor said that he did not seek to change horses midstream or to argue a case against Ghanem and Hajeid that did not involve them arriving in the red car. The prosecutor indicated that he did not seek to persuade Finnane DCJ to leave old counts 18 and 19 to the jury on the basis of Ghanem and Hajeid being at the park at the time, adding that it was mere assumption that those two accused got in the red car and left (Tr p1014). Since, however the Crown would have to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the only available inference was that they did not leave in the red car, the Crown accepted that counts 18 and 19 would not be pressed on the basis that Ghanem and Hajeid were involved as the perpetrator of the face slapping (Ghanem), the aider and abettor thereof (Hajeid) or as persons aiding and abetting Skaf in his sexual assault of Ms P in company behind the toilet block. 
     
      
       
      
    259 In light of Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207 these directed verdicts must be viewed as based upon a generous concession by the Crown. They cannot be treated as based upon the absence of evidence or even on a ruling to that effect, and then used as a springboard for a different attack.  
     
      
       
      
    260 Arrangements were made for directed verdicts on some of the charges in the original indictment (see Tr p1017ff). This included directed verdicts in favour of Ghanem and Hajeid as regards old counts 18 and 19 in light of the discussion set out above. Judge Finnane told the jury (Tr pp1021-1022): 
     
      
       
        
         
         Now in relation to 18 and 19. Count 18 is a slapping across the face by someone who is described as man with the plaited hair. There has been evidence against Mr Ghanem that he was the man with the pony tail and he has been identified as the man with the pony tail. However Ms [P] did not identify him in any way whatsoever, Miss [F] did. 
         
        
        
         
         This unknown person with a plait, on the evidence, could not have been Mr Ghanem. The reason I say that, members of the jury, is that there is evidence that the accused Hajeid, count number 16,  
         [this became count 12 in the amended indictment] 
          sexually assaulted Miss [P]. 
         
        
        
         
         The evidence shows that immediately after that he departed from the park. At the time he was committing this assault others in the red car were yelling out to him to hurry up, the car motor was running, he hurried up, he finished, he went to the car, the car left. That was the red car that brought Messrs Ghanem and Hajeid to the park, so it left. 
         
        
        
         
         On the evidence, then, at the time this slapping across the face occurred, Messrs Ghanem and Hajeid had left. Therefore they could not be party to an assault by someone who remained, they just weren’t there. 
         
        
        
         
         The case against Mr Skaf though remains because he remained, and the assault is clearly related to some sexual purpose. She was slapped across the fact by the man with the plait for the purpose of encouraging her to give oral sex, which then followed with the man Mr Skaf, known to her as Adam. 
         
        
        
         
         So, in number 19 also, there is a clear case against Mr Skaf. She has identified him as having sexual intercourse with her without consent but at that point the red car had gone, so the other two on trial here were not there. Others were, but we don’t know who they were. So they could not be guilty of those offences because they were not there. 
         
        
        
       
      
    261 The directed verdicts were pronounced by the jury and the indictment was later amended to its current form. 
     
      
       
      
    262 The jury were later told that the man with the plaited hair who slapped Ms P across the face was “not on trial here” (SU 19. See also SU 26, 48-9).  
     
      
       
      
    263 It is possible that the jury were mystified by this. We certainly are. Our reading of the evidence does not accord with what was put by trial counsel for Ghanem and Hajeid (and accepted by the judge) about Ghanem and Hajeid having left the park in the red car immediately after “Sammy’s” sexual assault of Ms P. Ms P had not numbered or identified the men who left in the red car (see Tr pp562-3). She said that she had no idea how many people departed in the red car (Tr p619). There was evidence that both Ghanem and Hajeid lived within easy walking distance of the park (Ex C23), so it was wrong to assume readily that if they came in the red car from Chatswood to Greenacre, they would have got in it again after the events that took place. Ms P had also given evidence that she was tackled by someone after Adam had sexually assaulted her (Tr pp568-9, 659) and at a time when “most, all the guys start running towards the car” (Tr p568). She later agreed that the number could have been 4, 5 or 6 (Tr p659). 
     
      
       
      
    264 This said, the Crown submissions in this Court go some distance towards accepting Ghanem’s starting position. The Crown has indicated that it became the Crown case at trial that the person who assaulted Ms P after the red car left was a different man to that seen in the red car by police, who was Ghanem. Whilst the police description was a little different to that given by Ms F, the jury were entitled to conclude that either the police officer was mistaken as to the plait or that Ghanem had loosened his hair by the time he came to assault Ms F (Crown Submissions §93). In oral submissions for the Crown on appeal, Dr Power SC adhered to the position that Ghanem and Hajeid left in the red car, with the consequence that Ms P was hit by another man - the ninth man, for want of a better description (CCA Tr p86). 
     
      
       
      
    265 In these circumstances, it is appropriate to look at the issue through this prism that remains common ground (much as we doubt it). Does it undermine the verdicts against Ghanem referable to Ms P that were based upon events that preceded the departure of the red car? 
     
      
       
      
    266 We think not. 
     
      
       
      
    267 It remained open to convict Ghanem on the counts dealing with matters before the red car departed having regard to: 
     
      
       
        
       - the identification evidence involving Ms F (who identified Ghanem)  
        
        
       - Not every witness drew a sharp distinction between a ponytail or a plait in describing the hair of the driver of the red car. Alternatively, there was a level of confusion, which the jury were required to address in deciding whether the case against Ghanem was proved b",2004-04-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: John Joseph Mostyn appeals against his convictions on 18 March 2003 after a trial in the District Court at Sydney before her Honour Judge Hock and a jury. The appellant was found guilty by the jury of two offences: an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Gina-Marie Miner on 24 November 2001 at Kemps Creek contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Count 3) and, secondly, an offence of assaulting Gina-Marie Miner on 24 November 2001 contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900 (Count 4). Section 35 of the Crimes Act provided for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years. Section 61 provided for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for two years. The appellant was sentenced on 6 June 2003. He also seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
    2 The offences of which the appellant was convicted arose from a chain of incidents alleged to have occurred on the appellant’s rural property at Kemps Creek on 24 November 2001. Prior to the jury being empanelled the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge related to the last of those incidents, being an offence of using an offensive weapon (a .22 calibre rifle) with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension contrary to s 33B of the Crimes Act. Section 33B provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twelve years. 
     
      
    3 The appellant stood for sentence on 6 June 2003 on the two matters in respect of which the jury had convicted him and the one matter in respect of which he had pleaded guilty. On that day he was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 4: s 61  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 
        
      (NSW) 
       
       
      Ten months imprisonment to commence on 22 June 2002 and expire on 21 April 2003. 
       
       
      Count 3: s 35  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 (NSW) 
       
       
      Three years imprisonment to commence on 22 February 2003 and to expire on 21 February 2006. Non-parole period of two years and three months to commence on 22 February 2003 and expire on 21 May 2005. 
       
       
      For the offence of use offensive weapon with intent to avoid apprehension to which the appellant had pleaded guilty on a separate indictment (taking into account Form 1 matters): 
       
       
      Four years imprisonment to commence on 22 February 2005 and to expire on 21 February 2009. Non-parole period of two years and four months to commence on 22 February 2005 and to expire on 21 June 2007. 
       
      
    4 Thus his total sentence was 6 years and 8 months with an effective non-parole period of 5 years dating from 22 June 2002. 
     
      
    5 The grounds of the appeal against the convictions are: 
     
      
       
      1. Her Honour erred in law in directing and/or failing to direct the jury adequately or properly: 
       
       
       (a) as to assault in Count 4; 
       
       
       (b) as to “recklessly” in Count 3. 
       
       
      2. Her Honour erred in law in failing to direct as to the evidence applicable to: 
       
       
       (a) maliciously in Count 3; 
       
       
       (b) “recklessly” in Count 3. 
       
       
      3. Her Honour erred in law in admitting into evidence the conduct, conversations, statements and threats of the appellant on and after the arrival of the police and in the directions and failure to direct thereon, if admissible. 
       
       
      4. Her Honour erred in law in not directing the jury that where they entertained a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing her truthfulness or reliability generally or similar direction. 
       
       
      5. The convictions of the jury on Counts 3 and 4 were unreasonable or cannot be supported on the evidence causing them to be unsafe and unsatisfactory giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    6 The grounds of the application for leave to appeal against the sentences are that the sentences were excessive: 
     
      
       
      (a) in not being in accordance with the principles of totality; 
       
       
      (b) in not reflecting the discount apportioned; 
       
       
      (c) in not being in accord with authority. 
       
       
       
      The material facts of the offences 
       
      
    7 The indictment presented against the appellant contained four charges. He was found not guilty of the first two charges. The charges in respect of which he was found not guilty were first, that on 24 November 2001 at Kemps Creek he assaulted Gina-Marie Miner (s 61 Crimes Act) and secondly, that on the same day he did maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon Gina-Marie Miner with intent to do grievous bodily harm to her (s 33 Crimes Act). The Crown as an alternative to Count 2 presented Count 3 on the indictment in respect of which the accused was found guilty. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case at trial 
       
      
    8 The complainant first met the appellant in 1992. They were married in December 1995 and moved to Kemps Creek in 1999. Their relationship had a history of arguments and violence on the part of the appellant towards the complainant. In May 2001 the appellant assaulted the complainant “pretty bad” about her face and head. She reported the incident to a Constable Grasso. In cross-examination the complainant explained that this incident had involved the appellant smashing her head into the dashboard while he drove the car. After this incident the complainant became very frightened of the appellant. In re-examination the complainant said the incident had been prompted by the fact that she was late picking up the appellant from work. From May 2001 until November of that year, their relationship was very violent and volatile but she was too afraid to go to the police because the appellant threatened to kill her.  
     
      
    9 The complainant was a shift worker at Campbelltown Railway Station. She finished work in the early hours of Saturday, 24 November 2001. She arrived home at about 4.00 am. No one was at home. She observed a .22 rifle lying across the arms of a reclining chair in the lounge room. There was a small round metal tin containing small metal pellets on the seat.  
     
      
    10 The complainant telephoned her husband’s mobile telephone to ascertain his whereabouts because she was worried. He said he was at the Colyton Hotel drinking with friends. She said she would join him. He sounded very drunk. When she hung up the telephone she thought better of going to the hotel and, instead, changed into her pyjamas and sat on the lounge watching a movie. 
     
      
    11 Between 4.00 and 5.00 am the appellant and a friend, Lionel Greentree, arrived home. The appellant was drunk and unsteady on his feet. The complainant told him to “be quiet and let me watch my movie”. He verbally abused her and called her amongst other things “a cunt” and “stupid bitch”. 
     
      
    12 I now set out the Crown case in relation to each individual Count. 
     
      
       
      Count 1: 
       
      
    13 The complainant said the appellant sat next to her on the lounge and hit her shoulder a number of times asking “what her problem was”. Mr Greentree suggested to the appellant he leave her alone to which the appellant responded: “shut the fuck up or I’ll knock you out”. The complainant moved down the lounge away from the appellant and tucked herself into a foetal position. The appellant then started hitting her forehead and the top of her head with an open hand.  
     
      
    14 The complainant ran to the bedroom and while she heard the appellant and Greentree talking in the lounge room changed into some clothes. She ran back into the lounge room, grabbed her car keys and ran out to the car. She drove to a petrol station where she bought a newspaper and then drove back and parked about 1½ kilometres from the house. Ultimately the need to go to the toilet caused her to drive back to the property. She looked in a window and saw the appellant asleep on the lounge. Greentree had left. She went to the bathroom and then sat on the end of the lounge and had a cigarette. The appellant woke up and ordered her out of the house “or I’ll kill you”. She protested she had nowhere to go. He then dialled directory assistance, asked to be put through to St Mary’s Police Station and told the police “he wanted his wife removed because she is insane” and gave his address. She yelled out in the background that he had a gun.  
     
      
    15 He then told her he intended shooting her “and he is going to put me in the dam … and that he might not even both (sic) wasting bullets. He might just put me in the dam”. She told him to “f off” and then he started hitting her head, back, and stomach “wherever” with his fists to the point where he tired himself out.  
     
      
    16 He then called the police again on the telephone but did not finish his conversation with them but hung up. She then said “no sweetie we need the cops here”. He then threatened to shoot her and “the cops” if the police were called. She then dialled 000 and was put through to St Mary’s Police and told them “my husband has already called you guys twice to come out here and I need you guys out here right now”. 
     
      
       
      Count 2 (in the alternative Count 3): 
       
      
    17 While she was speaking on the telephone sitting on the lounge, the appellant stood over her. She then felt intense pain in her lower back and fell to the floor. She cried out that he had broken her back. He told her to get out of his house “cunt” and kicked her in the head, ribs and stomach. She found it difficult to walk. She crawled to the back door while he circled her, kicking her, and at one stage when she was outside he grabbed her hair and smashed her head into the ground a couple of times.  
     
      
    18 When she got to her car he went inside. When she got into the car she realised she did not have the keys and so she locked the doors. 
     
      
       
      Count 4: 
       
      
    19 The appellant then reappeared and with his fist or elbow broke the passenger window and said that he was going to kill her and “started to come after me in the car”. She then opened the driver’s door and went to the neighbour’s house. She banged on the door but nobody answered.  
     
      
    20 Due to her back injury, the complainant could not stand upright and was doubled over. She heard the appellant calling out: “come out, come out wherever you are cunt”. She found a hiding place in one of the sheds on the property where there was some wood and a stack of tractor tyres which concealed her. She heard the appellant then talking to someone saying: “have you seen my cunt anywhere, I’m hunting”.  
     
      
    21 The appellant walked past the shed in which the complainant was hiding and at one stage came into the shed and looked around. One side of the shed was completely open. The shed was made of corrugated iron and had a lot of pieces missing. She saw he had a rifle in his hands with one hand on the trigger and what looked to be a pistol shoved down the front part of his pants and a bayonet in one of his belt grips.  
     
      
    22 The complainant then heard the appellant yelling at someone: “get in the car or I’ll blow your fucking heads off”. Suspecting the police had arrived she came out of her hiding place and headed towards the road. She met a female police officer who pulled her behind a police car. She saw the appellant had the butt of the rifle up against his shoulder, his right hand on the trigger. She heard him yelling at the police “to get in the car or he’d blow their fucking heads off”.  
     
      
       
      Medical evidence 
       
      
    23 The complainant was placed in an ambulance and taken to Nepean Hospital. Dr Nair, a specialist in neuro-surgery, examined her at the Nepean Hospital Emergency Department. He observed that she had a bruise to her left forehead and a bruise to her upper lip on the left. She was complaining of tenderness over the left lumbar region and of left hip pain. X-rays of her lumbar spine revealed transverse process fractures through L1 and L2 on the left. A CT scan also showed she had a blood clot around the area of the fracture. The blood clot indicated to Dr Nair that the fracture was a relatively fresh injury. He said significant force was required to have caused the fracture of the vertebrae.  
     
      
       
      Other Crown evidence 
       
      
    24 Lionel Greentree gave evidence. He said he drove the appellant home from the Colyton Hotel leaving there about 4 to 4.30 am. He said the appellant sat down next to the complainant who was watching television and an argument broke out. The complainant got up, smashed all of the beer bottles off a table in front of the lounge chair and went to her bedroom. She stayed in there for a while and then came out yelling, picked up the car keys and left. She got into the car and drove away. 
     
      
    25 Mr Greentree said he then took the appellant to the toilet where the appellant vomited. The appellant returned to the lounge chair and “crashed out”. Mr Greentree put a blanket over him leaving him asleep. Mr Greentree left the house and went to work. Mr Greentree said the appellant remained his friend. 
     
      
    26 A 000 call was received at Sydney Police Centre at 7.45 am on 24 November 2001. The operator who took the call gave evidence that the entry she made onto her computer at the time she took it was: “female screaming into the phone being assaulted by a male call terminated”. The call originated from the appellant’s home. The operator was unable to recall whether the information came from the conversation in the call itself or from a “central line indicator”. The tape recording of the call was no longer in existence having been taped over after six months. 
     
      
    27 Constable Grasso gave evidence that he had been stationed at St Mary’s for about three years before 23 November 2001. He said he received two telephone calls that morning. The first was at 7.45 am from the appellant who said that his wife had “mental problems, she just got out of a mental place in Penrith. If you cunts don’t fucking get out here soon I’m going to kill her and throw her in the fucking dam”. The second was five minutes later again from the appellant who said: “where are you fucking cunts. If you fucking cunts don’t get here I will shoot her”. Asked if he had a gun he said: “yeah I have a .22 rifle. I won’t use it, I have no bullets for it”. He said the gun was in the cupboard and that his wife was outside and that he had locked her out. 
     
      
    28 Constable Grasso said he had taken a statement from the complainant in May 2001 about an assault by the appellant that night and had also taken a photograph of her at the time. Exhibit B was the photograph he took. A couple of weeks later the complainant wrote a letter to the prosecuting authorities withdrawing this complaint. She said she wrote the letter because of threats from the appellant and his father. 
     
      
    29 Constable Jeans, who was one of the police officers called to the house by police radio, gave evidence. He received the radio message at 7.55 am and arrived at the house at 8.13 am with other police. There were three police cars, all fully marked. As Constable Jeans approached the rear of the house he saw the appellant in front of the house. He yelled out: “there is a man with a rifle” and he and the other police took cover. The appellant had been pointing the rifle at the police. The appellant yelled out: “back off or I’ll blow your head off”. Another police officer yelled out: “stop and put the rifle down” to which the appellant replied: “back off or I’ll kill you”. A short time later the appellant put the rifle down, together with a bayonet and a small silver handgun and was arrested. The officer took a statement from the complainant later that day at Nepean Hospital and photographed her (Exhibits C1 – C5). Constable Eaton who arrived in the same police car as Constable Jeans gave similar evidence. 
     
      
    30 The rifle had no bolt nor was it loaded with ammunition. Bullets were, however, found by police. The officer in charge, Detective Ralph, gave evidence that bullets were found in the appellant’s bedroom. They included ten small bullets which appeared to be .22 bullets, but he was not 100% sure. 
     
      
    31 The complainant agreed that she had been diagnosed at one stage with bipolar depression at Nepean Hospital. She denied, in fact, that she suffered from it. She said that she had post traumatic stress syndrome. She agreed that she had been admitted to hospital after attempting to take her own life. She said that she was depressed because of the appellant’s constant violence and verbal abuse towards her. She had suffered broken noses and black eyes at his hands. 
     
      
       
      The case for the appellant 
       
      
    32 The appellant gave evidence. He said that he and Mr Greentree had arrived at the Colyton hotel at about 9.30 pm on Friday night. They had earlier been at another hotel for half an hour. The Colyton Hotel was a good half hour drive from his home. He got the telephone call from his wife at about 3.15 am. He said he had drunk a “hell of a lot” and when he left the hotel around 4.00 he was very drunk. He did not remember getting into the car. Lionel Greentree drove. When they got into the house his wife was watching a video. They sat on the lounge drinking and talking. He did not remember what they spoke about or what he or Mr Greentree drank. He remembered his wife had a couple of beers on the table. He and his wife got into a verbal argument but he could not remember what it was about. 
     
      
    33 The appellant got into the bathtub where he vomited. He then lay on the lounge, Mr Greentree covered him with a blanket and he fell asleep. He was then awoken by his wife who was prodding him, screaming: “wake up you prick, wake up”. He saw the barrel of a gun being prodded around his face and shoulders. He grabbed the barrel of the gun and pushed it backwards, causing the stock to hit his wife in the right cheek. She stumbled over the coffee table and fell back over a green recliner lounge chair onto the floor. The rifle finished up lying on the floor. He then dialled 12 455 and asked for St Mary’s Police. Constable Grasso answered the phone. The appellant recounted the conversation in his evidence in the following terms: “Oh you’re the bloke who arrested me once before … I wanted my wife removed from the house … she had bipolar disorder and I wanted her removed from the house that she was attacking me”. The police officer told him to keep calm and hung up. Whilst he was on the telephone, his wife was punching him. 
     
      
    34 He then picked up the gun and put it in the laundry cupboard, whilst his wife continued to hit him. She then ran out the back door and he locked it behind her. He returned to the lounge room. His wife then came to the lounge room window and screamed at him: “I’m going to kill you” and gestured by forming her hand in the shape of a pistol held at her temple. 
     
      
    35 Fearing for his safety, he telephoned 12 455 and again asked for St Mary’s Police. Again Constable Grasso answered. The appellant asked: “where the fuck are you” and said to hurry, to which the police officer replied they would be there soon. He told the police officer he had “her gun” and “there was no bullets for it” and that he had locked her outside. The police officer instructed him to stay in the house and leave her outside. 
     
      
    36 The appellant said his wife had originally brought the rifle to the house from work for fox control, but “there was no bolt or ammunition for the rifle at all”. 
     
      
    37 The appellant said his wife then kicked the back door in. It was secured by two Yale locks but only one worked properly. She attacked his head and shoulders with punches and he responded by pushing her backwards. He retreated to the kitchen to escape her. He then heard her pick up the phone and ask for St Mary’s Police but could not hear the conversation. He heard her pick up car keys and then the back door slammed. He looked out the kitchen window and saw her run up the footpath to the gate, place her hand on the top of the gate and “try and spring over the gate”. In doing so, she fell over the gate. Her feet landed on the hood of a car parked next to the car and she landed on the ground. She got up and took off. 
     
      
    38 He said he telephoned his father, a solicitor, to ask his advice and was told: “just sit there, don’t leave the house, wait for the police”. 
     
      
    39 The appellant waited and then heard and saw three police vehicles coming up the driveway.  
     
      
    40 He made this observation from his front door. He retrieved the rifle from the laundry in order to take it out and give it to the police. He also picked up a bayonet which was in a cupboard and a cigarette lighter which was in the form of an imitation pistol. He then walked out the back door and through the gate. 
     
      
    41 When he walked through the gate, he saw police vehicles and police in bullet-proof vests with their guns drawn, which made him “freak out”. He said: “I didn’t know what was going on”. 
     
      
    42 He then put the rifle to his shoulder, pointed it at police and said: “back off”. The police told him to “drop the gun or they’d shoot”. 
     
      
    43 He did not comply with the police demand but, instead, pointed the gun in the direction of the police for a period of “less than five minutes”. Eventually he threw the rifle, bayonet and cigarette lighter down and put his hands in the air. He was then hit by a police officer with a baton quite a few times.  
     
      
    44 The appellant said that rather than being violent towards the complainant in the preceding periods in 2001 before the alleged offence, “if anything it was the other way round, she would be drunk all the time and she would just go ballistic and attack me for no reason and then it would take days before she’d calm down. She just had this uncontrollable rage”. He said he hit her once across the face with an open hand “when we were having the argument about the affair that she had at her work”. 
     
      
    45 He said that prior to the alleged offence and in October 2001, he came home to find the complainant half lying on the floor and the lounge with an empty bottle of bourbon and empty Arapax medication lying beside her. Upon waking her from her drowsy state she said: “yeah I’m trying to kill myself”. He said this event had not been preceded by any “traumatic incident between the two of them”. He took her to Nepean Hospital. He said that she had done this before but no previous incident had required him to take her hospital.  
     
      
       
      The summing-up 
       
      
    46 The trial judge commenced her summing-up on the sixth day of the trial. She provided the jury with a document (MFI 10) setting out the elements of the offences on the indictment to which she drew the jury’s attention in the course of her summing-up. I have set out the terms of that document in the Schedule to this judgment. 
     
      
    47 I will deal with the relevant passages of the summing-up as I deal with the appellant’s complaints. 
     
      
    48 Before I turn to consider the individual grounds of appeal, I note that the Crown asserts that Criminal Appeal rule 4 applies to grounds 1(a) (Count 4), 2 and 4. The appellant does not challenge that assertion. It is appropriate at the outset, therefore, to make some general observations about the operation of that rule. 
     
      
    49 Criminal Appeal rule 4 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence, given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission, or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.  
        
       
      
    50 The purpose of rule 4 has been well rehearsed in earlier judgments of this Court. The rule gives recognition to the commonsense proposition that the fact that no objection has been taken to the manner in which the trial judge summed up to a jury is “cogent evidence … in most cases, that counsel absorbed in the atmosphere of the trial saw no injustice or error in what was done”: Tripodina & Morabito v R (1998) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191 per Yeldham J (with whom Carruthers and McInerney JJ agreed).  
     
      
    51 The rule is intended to discourage “the practice of subjecting a summing up, after the trial is over, to a minute and detailed textual criticism in the hope of finding something on which to base an argument”: Tripodina at 192. It is for those reasons that the Court, while “astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law”, should equally “be astute also to ensure that points, especially those of little or no merit, which were not thought by counsel appearing at the trial to be of any great significance, should not be raised for the first time on appeal”: Tripodina at 195.  
     
      
    52 The leave required by rule 4 will not be “lightly granted” and, generally speaking, “will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings: Tripodina at 195; see also R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536 per Hunt J (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed and with whose reasons Mahoney JA generally agreed).  
     
      
    53 An appellant seeking leave pursuant to rule 4 bears the onus of demonstrating that by reason of a misdirection “he lost a real chance (or a chance which was fairly open to him) of not being found guilty”: R v Yuill (1994) 34 NSWLR 179 at 186.  
     
      
    54 One of the purposes of rule 4 is to ensure that the trial judge receives the assistance from counsel to which any trial judge is entitled in the task of giving appropriate directions to the jury: R v Yuill at 185. In R v Roberts (2001) 53 NSWLR 138 at 150 – 151 [62] ff Carruthers J drew attention to the numerous cases in which the Court had exhorted trial counsel to be faithful to the positive obligation rule 4 imposes to assist the Court in the conduct of a trial and the significance failure to seek directions may have in an appeal from conviction. While despairing that such pleas appeared in many cases to have fallen on deaf ears, Carruthers J also referred (at [67]) to the desirability of the trial judge at the conclusion of the summing-up inquiring of counsel in the absence of the jury whether he or she had overlooked any directions of law or warnings which should be given to the jury as well as hearing submissions on the correctness or otherwise of directions of law which had in fact been given. 
     
      
    55 In this case, the Court’s exhortations, at least insofar as counsel for the appellant is concerned, have yet again fallen on deaf ears. 
     
      
    56 However the trial judge undertook the precautionary course of inquiry to which Carruthers J referred, not merely at the conclusion of her summing-up but also during its delivery. She made that inquiry of counsel at the luncheon adjournment after she had given the jury the usual general directions and directed them as to the matters of law and the issues of fact which related to counts 1 and 4. Counsel for the appellant made no complaint about the matters which now form the basis of grounds 1(a), 2 and 4.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1(a): Count 4 
       
      The wrong/no direction ground:  
       
      
    57 This ground of appeal complained that her Honour erred in law in directing and/or failing to direct the jury adequately or properly as to assault in Count 4.58 The appellant complains that her Honour’s direction in relation to Count 4 was inadequate. The complaint as set out in the appellant’s written submissions was that her Honour ought to have directed the jury that to constitute assault, the accused had to have a present ability to effect his purpose or, to put it another way, that “an offer to strike a person at such a distance as to make contact impossible is not an assault”. 
     
      
    59 As developed in oral submissions, the complaint about the trial judge’s direction in relation to Count 4 was expressed as being that the trial judge did not direct the jury that, in order to prove that the appellant had assaulted Ms Miner, the Crown had to prove that Ms Miner apprehended the infliction of immediate unlawful force to her person.  
     
      
    60 The appellant relies on Knight v R (1988) 35 A Crim 314 to support his complaint that her Honour ought to have directed the jury that the accused had a present ability to effect his purpose or, to put it another way, that “an offer to strike a person at such a distance as to make contact impossible is not an assault”. 
     
      
    61 Knight was an appeal from a conviction, inter alia, of assault under s 61 of the Crimes Act. The assault was said to be constituted by words spoken by the appellant on the telephone. The Crown case in relation to the charges of assault was based on the evidence of the recipients of the calls as to what was said by the caller the nature of which, as described by Lee J (with whom Carruthers and Loveday JJ agreed), was threatening death or bodily injury to the recipients as well as being extremely abusive. Apart from that evidence it appears the jury also had before them the fact that the calls had been made from an unknown address to a caller who took the call an appreciable distance away. This, as the Crown conceded on appeal (at 316), was a “long way out of firing distance”.  
     
      
    62 The Court quashed the conviction because the evidence was not sufficient to constitute evidence of assault, for there was nothing in the Crown case from which any conclusion could be drawn that any of the recipients of the calls were ever in any danger of immediate violence. As Lee J put it (at 317): 
     
      
       
        
        “But as to there being any evidence that those threats were threats of immediate violence it is clear that they were not. They were mere threats which may have been executed at any time, if at all”. 
        
       
      
    63 His Honour considered Taylor J’s decision in Barton v Armstrong [1969] 2 NSWR 451. He accepted (at 318) Taylor J’s view that “a threat of violence made over the phone could be a threat of immediate violence in given circumstances, and thus an assault and accordingly I am not to be taken as saying that merely because a threat is made by phone it could thereby constitute an assault”. 
     
      
    64 In Knight, it was the absence of any evidence that the threats were threats of immediate violence which resulted in the appellant’s successful challenge to his conviction of assault. 
     
      
    65 It has long been held that threats which put a reasonable person in fear or apprehension of physical violence may constitute an assault even though the victim did not know when that physical violence may be effected: Barton v Armstrong [1969] 2 NSWR 451 at 454 – 455. In the latter judgment Taylor J made it clear that the essence of an assault constituted by threat rather than actual striking was the “expectation of physical contact which the offender creates in the mind of the person whom he threatens”. While his Honour acknowledged that in some cases an immediate ability to carry out the threat was one way of creating the fear of apprehension (455.45), his Honour also held that if the threat produced the fear or apprehension of physical violence then the law was breached even though the victim did not know when that physical violence may be effected. It was in that context that his Honour held that threats uttered over the telephone which produced the fear or apprehension of physical violence may constitute an assault even though the victim did not know when that physical violence may be effected (455.50).66 Another illustration of the circumstances in which an assault might be constituted by a verbal threat sufficient to raise a reasonable apprehension of violence in Ms Miner’s mind can be seen from Zanker v Vartzokas (1988) 34 A Crim R 11 to which the Crown referred. 
     
      
    67 In that case, a woman accepted a lift from the accused. While the van was moving, he offered her money for sexual favours. She rejected the advances and demanded to be let out of the vehicle. The accused accelerated, saying ""I am going to take you to my mate's house. He will really fix you up"". She was put in fear and jumped out of the moving vehicle. The magistrate dismissed a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the basis that there was no fear of immediate violence, but fear of future violence. On appeal, White J held the woman was put in fear of relatively immediate imminent violence which continued to have effect as the vehicle continued toward the threatened destination while she was unlawfully imprisoned and at the mercy of the accused. That was sufficient for the charge of assault to be made out.  
     
      
    68 His Honour referred (at 14) to the fallacy in the defendant's argument as being “the assumption that the words had effect only at the time when they were uttered and heard whereas they were ringing presently in her ears as a continuing threat, without the necessity for repetition, second by second as they progressed towards the house.”  
     
      
    69 After referring to various authorities, including Barton v Armstrong which required immediacy or imminence of the feared physical violence to constitute assault, White J gave the following illustration (at 17-18): 
     
      
       
        
        “During the course of argument, some examples were canvassed. In a hypothetical example, I asked counsel to assume that the defendant was threatening the victim in a remote scrub area where he was stalking her and calling out threats to rape her if and when he caught her. I also asked counsel to assume that the defendant could catch her and carry out his threat at any time he wished and that both he and she knew this was so. While he was taking no immediate steps to carry out his threats he continued to pursue her because he enjoyed the prolongation of her fear. I expressed the opinion that his original words uttered in those circumstances constituted an assault, for the reasons already given, namely because her fear was a continuing fear induced by his original words in a situation where he remained in a position of dominance and in a position to carry out the threatened violence at some time not too remote, thus keeping the apprehension, the gist of assault, ever present in the victim's mind. The facts in the present appeal are closely analogous to the facts in the hypothetical situation.”  
        
       
      
    70 This is an apt analogy. Indeed, as the Crown submitted, it might be thought the violence threatened to Ms Miner was even more immediate than it was in Zanker, because the appellant “had already been violent towards [Ms Miner] in the house and had a short time before come at her in the car.” 
     
      
    71 I accept the Crown’s submissions. The authorities are clear that a threat to strike a person even at such a distance as to make contact impossible may constitute an assault if it instils a fear of immediate violence in the mind of the hearer.72 The appellant’s challenge to the judge’s summing-up based on the proposition that “an offer to strike a person at such a distance as to make contact impossible is not an assault” is wrong as a matter of law. 
     
      
    73 I next turn to consider the appellant’s complaint that the trial judge did not direct the jury that in order to prove that the appellant had assaulted Ms Miner, the Crown had to prove that Ms Miner apprehended the infliction of immediate unlawful force to her person.  
     
      
       
      The directions given – Count 4 
      
    74 The trial judge directed the jury as a matter of law that Count 4 required the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had assaulted Gina-Marie Miner. She explained that “assault” was a “word in common everyday use” and that it might conjure up in the jury’s mind “the image of a person striking another person physically whether with a hand, a fist or some hand-held implement”. She directed the jury that there are differences between the law and everyday parlance. She then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        For example, if I raised my hand at you in a menacing fashion and thereby caused you to fear that you were about to be struck then the law says that I have assaulted you. 
         Ordinary use of the word assault would probably not have extended that far … alternatively, and this is relevant in respect of Count 4, an assault can be a threat of striking, touching or application of force. That is the threat of those things occurring again without consent, be (sic) intentional, not an accidental threat and it is without lawful excuse … in Count 4 what the Crown relies on is the threat of an assault, the threat of an application of force and then the other elements 2, 3 and 4.” (Emphasis supplied) 
        
       
      
    75 The latter reference was a reference to MFI 10 where, in relation to the definition of assault and, in particular, an assault constituted by a threat of striking, touching or application of force, elements 2, 3 and 4 were set out as: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. It is without consent. 
        
       
       
        
        3. It is intentional (not accidental). 
        
       
       
        
        4. It is without lawful excuse.” 
        
       
      
    76 When dealing with the facts in relation to Count 4, the trial judge reminded the jury that the Crown relied upon the “threat of striking, touching or application of force”. She reminded the jury that the Crown relied on the continuing threat, according to Ms Miner’s evidence, that the accused had said he was going to kill her when she was out in the car, that he smashed the car window, that she ran away but could not stand up and was bent over with her head at her knees and that she heard the accused calling out: “come out, come out wherever you are”, that Ms Miner had hidden in a shed in a stack of tyres and heard the appellant say words to two men in the shed to the effect of “I am hunting”, and saw the accused with a rifle in his hands, a pistol down the front of his pants and a bayonet in one of his belt loops with his right hand on the trigger of the rifle and the left hand supporting the barrel. She drew the jury’s attention to the fact that the accused completely denied hunting the complainant and said he had remained in the house at all times until the police attended the property. 
     
      
    77 After recounting these facts the trial judge said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “That evidence the Crown relies on to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused threatened the complainant with immediate and unlawful violence. That is again that there was no consent, it was intentional and it was without lawful excuse which, as I say does not arise in circumstances as alleged by the Crown”. 
        
       
      
    78 She then reminded the jury of the accused’s complete denial of ever hunting the complainant in the early hours of 24 November 2001. 
     
      
    79 In my view her Honour’s direction to the jury adequately identified the elements of the offence. It might be accepted that in her direction of law she did not parrot the words “immediate violence” but she used the phrase “about to be struck”, which, in my view, is synonymous. That was a correct statement of the law.  
     
      
    80 The jury would clearly have understood her explanation of the concept of an assault constituted by a threat rather than an actual blow as requiring a sense of immediate apprehension of violence. Indeed, the fact that the appellant’s counsel did not complain to her Honour about this direction makes it clear that in the atmosphere of the trial that was the sense conveyed by her remarks.  
     
      
    81 Further, when dealing with the facts, her Honour expressly explained that the Crown relied upon the evidence she had summarised to satisfy them beyond reasonable doubt that the accused threatened the complainant with immediate and unlawful violence – thus their attention was expressly drawn to the requirement of immediacy. 
     
      
       
       
      The inadequate direction as to the facts ground 
       
      
    82 The appellant also argued, rather faintly I thought, that the trial judge had not set out the facts in relation to each element of the offence charged under Count 4. Mr Papayanni referred to Piazza v R (1997) 94 A Crim R 459. In Piazza (at 460) Hunt CJ at CL referred to the trial judge’s obligation “to present to the jury the issues of fact which they have to determine, and to do so with such reference to the facts of the case as is necessary to assist them in that task”. Hunt CJ at CL referred, in turn, to Zorad v R (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105 where this Court pointed out that a summing-up should “include a collected résumé of the evidence which relates to each of [the] ingredients [of the offence which the Crown has to establish]”. 
     
      
    83 In my view this submission should be rejected. I have already outlined the trial judge’s summing-up on the facts in relation to Count 4. She made it clear those facts related to Count 4 in respect of which she had already given the jury directions of law. In my opinion that summing-up presented to the jury the issues of fact they had to determine and complied with Piazza and Zorad. 
     
      
       
      The no evidence ground 
       
      
    84 The appellant also complained that the evidence was not sufficient to convict the appellant of assault. Mr Papayanni submitted that the complainant had given no evidence that she feared immediate violence and that it was not open to the jury, absent such evidence, to infer that that was her state of mind.  
     
      
    85 In my opinion that submission should be rejected for two reasons. First, although it must be accepted that Ms Miner did not state, in relation to the events which commenced with the smashing of the Laser’s passenger window, that she feared the appellant was about to wreak violence upon her, her actions were those of a frightened person. She had fled a house in which (on her account) the appellant had struck her repeatedly. She had first sought refuge in her car, then (unsuccessfully) in a neighbour’s house. When she was unable to raise the neighbours she hid in a shed under truck tyres. She remained hidden while observing the appellant moving nearby calling out for her whilst carrying a rifle, what appeared to be a pistol and a bayonet. She did not emerge from her hiding place until the police arrived. Her reaction to the appellant’s conduct was compelling evidence upon which the jury could rely to infer that she was afraid the appellant was about to apply force to her in some manner, whether by using the weapons with which he was armed or by striking or kicking her as he had earlier in that morning’s episode. 
     
      
    86 Once again it is significant that no complaint was raised by counsel who appeared for the appellant at his trial (who was not counsel who appeared on the appeal). The appellant’s present complaint that there was no express evidence that the complainant feared immediate violence appears to me to have been developed as a result of the deplorable practice of subjecting a summing-up, after the trial is over, to a minute and detailed textual criticism in the hope of finding something on which to base an argument. In my view this complaint has no merit. It was of no significance to counsel at the trial and it should not be permitted to be raised on appeal. 
     
      
    87 I would not give the appellant leave to raise any grounds of appeal in relation to Count 4. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1(b) and 2: Count 3: 
       
      
    88 Count 3 was the charge that the appellant had maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Ms Miner contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act. It related to the Crown’s case that the appellant had broken Ms Miner’s back.  
     
      
    89 In these grounds of appeal the appellant complained both that her Honour erred in law in directing and/or failing to direct the jury adequately or properly as to “recklessly” in Count 3 and, further, that her Honour erred in law in failing to direct the jury as to the evidence applicable to “maliciously” and “recklessly” in that count. 
     
      
       
      The wrong/no direction ground 
       
      
    90 The appellant complains that the trial judge’s direction was inadequate because she did not direct the jury that “maliciously” required an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that was in fact done or recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not. The appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed that the accused had to foresee that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet had gone on to take the risk of it. He relied upon R v Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396 and R v Stones (1955) 56 SR (NSW) 25 at 33 – 34. 
     
      
       
      The summing-up 
       
      
    91 MFI 10 defined “maliciously” as meaning “with an intention to cause some physical injury or recklessly – that is with foresight of the possibility that some physical harm might be inflicted”. When directing the jury in relation to Counts 2 and 3 (which it will be recalled were presented in the alternative), the trial judge referred them to that definition, then explained that the Crown’s case was that “whatever blow it was, by what ever means that blow was occasioned the accused must have intended some physical injury to be caused and relies on the evidence of Dr Nair in that regard”.  
     
      
    92 Dealing specifically with Count 3 her Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Count 3 … if the Crown does not satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused who inflicted the grievous bodily harm, he is not guilty straight away of Counts 2 and 3 because that first element is essential. In respect of Count 3 the Crown must only satisfy you that the accused acted maliciously at the time he inflicted the grievous bodily harm to Ms Miner and I have already referred you to the definition of maliciously. The Crown only has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to cause some physical injury at the time the blow was inflicted or that he foresaw, he had foresight of the possibility that some physical harm might be inflicted by that blow being occasioned …”. 
        
       
      
    93 In R v Cunningham, above at 399 – 400, the English Court of Criminal Appeal approved, as an accurate statement of the law, the statement that: 
     
      
       
        
        “In any statutory definition of a crime malice … [requires] either: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) an actual intention to do the particular kind of harm that in fact was done; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not (ie, the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done and yet has gone on to take the risk of it)” 
          
         
        
       
      
    94 Later in their judgment (at 401) the Court made it clear that the words “particular injury” in the statement they had approved was satisfied by proof that the accused foresaw the possibility of physical injury, rather than the specific injury (in this case the fractured vertebrae) which actually resulted. 
     
      
    95 In Stones the Court (Street CJ, Roper CJ in Eq and Herron J) said (at 471): 
     
      
       
        
        “Generally speaking, malice aforethought means only intention … the important thing is not the desire of consequence, ie. motive or intent, but merely foresight of consequence which is the common factor to intention and recklessness. Every crime involving  
        mens rea  
        requires one or other factor, so that if it does not positively require intention, it requires either intention or recklessness; and particularly is this so in crimes involving malice. … the state of a man’s mind as to intent in a criminal case can ordinarily be proved only by inference from the circumstances, and the ordinary method of inquiry is to ask what were the probable consequences of the act. Thus the standard test of a man’s mind in the commission of an act is the foreseeable consequences. If he applied his mind to the consequences, and without concluding that they would probably happen (which is criminal intent) his state of mind was that he did not care whether they happened or not, that is recklessness. The task of a jury is to infer to what extent the accused appreciated the consequences of his act.” 
        
       
      
    96 The passage in R v Stones to which I have referred was referred to recently by this Court in R v Grant (2002) 55 NSWLR 80 at 94 [60] by Wood CJ at CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreed) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As was made clear in  
        R v Stones  
        and  
        R v Cunningham  
        … and, as s 5 of the  
        Crimes Act  
        also makes clear, crimes of malice require either intention or recklessness, each of which calls for a foresight of the consequences, in addition to the mental element required for basic intent”. 
        
       
      
    97 In Coleman v R (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 at 471 Hunt J (with whom Finlay and Allen JJ agreed) approved a trial judge’s direction to a jury on the concept of recklessness as being “a realisation of the possibility that some such injury [such as was in fact caused] might result but nevertheless proceeding to act”. Hunt J said that in that direction, the trial judge had followed what had long been accepted as the correct direction based upon the decision in R v Cunningham. 
     
      
    98 It is true that the trial judge’s direction on the issue of recklessness did not incorporate the passage I have underlined. However, in my view, in the facts of the present case, those words add little in a case where there was ample evidence that the appellant inflicted a blow intending to inflict some physical injury – it might be thought that, in such circumstances, the issue of recklessness was moot.  
     
      
    99 It was clear from the direction her Honour gave that the jury should consider on the issue of recklessness whether the appellant realised some injury might be inflicted by his blow, but nevertheless struck Ms Miner. 
     
      
    100 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
       
      Ground 2: directions concerning the evidence in relation to Count 3 
       
      
    101 I turn then to the appellant’s complaint that the trial judge did not adequately address the evidence on the issues of maliciously and recklessness. No complaint was made of these directions at the trial. 
     
      
    102 The appellant complained that there was no evidence as to what he was alleged to have done which was said to have caused the intense pain in the complainant’s back. He submitted that absent such evidence his conduct could not be examined nor could his opportunities for knowledge to determine whether or not he was reckless.  
     
      
    103 In directing the jury in relation to Counts 2 and 3 (which the Crown presented as alternatives), the trial judge related Ms Miner’s evidence that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… whilst she was on the phone to the 000 operator the accused was standing close to her and … she was bending over with her back exposed at about 45 degrees to the accused … that she suddenly felt an extremely intense pain in her lower back and that she threw the phone down and fell to the floor … (and) cried out ‘you’ve broken my back John, you’ve broken my back’ and he said: “I don’t care get out of my house” and started kicking her about the head, ribs and stomach as she crawled away and then said to her: “get out of my house get out of here while you still can”.  
        
       
      
    104 The trial judge drew the jury’s attention to the fact that Ms Miner could not say how the appellant had inflicted the injury upon her because she did not see what happened as she had her back to him. She pointed out that the Crown relied upon Ms Miner’s evidence to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused who inflicted the injury and that if they did not accept that evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, then the accused was entitled to be acquitted. In terms of the accused’s intention the trial judge directed the jury that his intention might be inferred or deduced from the circumstances in which the act occurred and from the accused’s conduct before or at the time he did the specific act which the Crown relied upon as causing grievous bodily harm to Ms Miner. She pointed out: 
     
      
       
        
        “In some cases a person’s acts may themselves provide the most convincing evidence of his intention. Where a specific result is the obvious and inevitable consequence of a person’s act and where he deliberately does that act you may readily conclude that he did that act with the intention of achieving that specific result”. 
        
       
      
    105 The Crown submitted that the appellant’s complaint that there was no evidence regarding what the appellant did to the complainant’s back had no substance. The Crown drew attention to Ms Miner’s evidence that a short time before the incident which formed the subject of Counts 2 and 3, the appellant had struck the complainant on her head, back and stomach with his fist to the point where he “literally tired himself out”. The incident when she was telephoning the police occurred immediately after these blows had been struck.  
     
      
    106 The Crown noted that the appellant implicitly criticised the trial judge’s description of what allegedly occurred as a “blow”. It submitted that on any view of the matter if the complainant was to be believed as she clearly was, a “blow” inflicted by the appellant was a perfect description of what had occurred – whether or not the blow had been inflicted by a fist, a kick or an implement. What was important, the Crown submitted, was the force of the blow. It relied upon Dr Nair’s evidence that the injury inflicted upon Ms Miner required a significant amount of force and a direct trauma to the part of her body where he identified the fractured vertebrae. 
     
      
    107 In my view there was abundant evidence before the jury from which it could infer that it was the appellant who had inflicted the blow which fractured Ms Miner’s back. The trial judge drew the jury’s attention to that evidence.  
     
      
    108 Finally I note that Mr Papayanni referred to a passage in Glanville Williams’ Criminal Law (without identifying the edition or year of publication) the only significance of which, in the present context, could be the proposition that the fact that on the occasion in question the accused was drunk might be relevant to the issue of recklessness. In this context, the Crown pointed out that Count 3 charged an offence under s 35 of the Crimes Act which is not an “offence of specific intent” as referred to in s 428B of that Act. In such circumstances, s 428D(a) meant that as the appellant’s intoxication was self-induced, it could not be taken into account in determining whether the appellant had the mens rea for the offence in question.  
     
      
    109 I would not give the appellant leave to raise Ground 2.  
     
      
      Ground 3 
       
      
    110 Ground 3 complains that the trial judge was in error in admitting as evidence the conduct, conversations, statements and threats of the appellant after the police arrived at the property. It also complains of the fact that the trial judge did not properly direct the jury as to how it could use that evidence in respect of any count. 
     
      
    111 Counsel for the appellant conceded before the trial judge that the Crown could educe evidence that the appellant had a rifle when the police arrived. He objected to the Crown educing evidence that the appellant had pointed the rifle at police, that the police had then taken cover and that the appellant threatened the police to “back off or I’ll kill you”. 
     
      
    112 Defence counsel had earlier advised the trial judge that the defence would be that the complainant’s injuries happened either in the course of the accused defending himself or by the complainant tripping over a coffee table within the house or outside the house, falling over a fence or gate. Essentially the case which the accused proposed to advance was one that he was acting in self defence. 
     
      
    113 The trial judge gave a brief ruling about the admissibility of the statements. Save to identify those portions of the police officer’s statements which were admissible, she did not give reasons for her ruling. 
     
      
    114 The appellant complained that the police officer’s evidence was inadmissible, that it went to propensity, that it was not part of the res gestae and that it did not add to the Crown evidence save in a manner which was impermissibly prejudicial to the appellant. He submitted that all incidents upon which the charges went before the jury had been completed by the time the police had arrived. He submitted that his attitude towards the police was not relevant to what had happened save to confirm that he did have the gun, the toy-pistol and bayonet in his possession. He submitted that that fact could have been proved without admitting the conduct and conversations by the appellant. He relied upon Harriman v R (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 627 – 635. 
     
      
    115 The Crown submitted that the evidence was admissible on the grounds to which her Honour referred as well as on a number of others. The Crown submitted that the appellant’s behaviour when the police arrived was inconsistent with his defence that he had been the victim of violent attacks at the hand of the complainant and had sheltered in the house until the police arrived. The Crown submitted that the evidence of the appellant’s conduct in relation to police was independent of the complainant’s evidence and was capable of corroborating her evidence as to the events of the evening. The Crown also submitted that the evidence of the appellant’s threat to the police supported the proposition that he was in an aggressive state at the time he was hunting the complainant, which hunt was interrupted by the arrival of the police. The Crown submitted that the threats uttered to the police were the continuation of the aggressive state of mind the appellant had exhibited towards the complainant moments earlier before they arrived. The Crown submitted that, in such circumstances, the evidence was not propensity evidence but was admissible relying upon O’Leary v R (1946) 73 CLR 566 at 577 – 578 per Dixon J; Adam v R [1999] NSWCCA 189 at [25]; (1999) 106 A Crim R 510 at 515; R v Player [2000] NSWCCA 123. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: consideration 
       
      
    116 At common law, evidence of conduct that forms part of a relevant transaction (“transaction evidence”) will itself be relevant because “without [evidence of such conduct] the transaction of which the [fact in issue] formed an integral part could not be truly understood and, isolated from it, could only be presented as an unreal and not very intelligible event”: O’Leary per Dixon J at 577. In O’Leary B and others took part in a drunken orgy which commenced on Saturday morning and continued until late on Saturday night. O’Leary was found guilty of the murder of B. At the trial evidence was admitted that at various times during the orgy O’Leary had violently assaulted other persons. Some of these assaults were unprovoked and all consisted of brutal blows to the head. During the afternoon O’Leary had aimed a blow at B. The High Court, by majority (Latham CJ, Rich, Dixon and Williams JJ) held that the evidence of O’Leary’s earlier behaviour was admissible as being relevant to the issue whether O’Leary murdered B on the ground that it disclosed a connected series of events which should be considered as one transaction.  
     
      
    117 In Adam, the Court (per Spigelman CJ, James and Bell JJ) held at [25]-[26] that the principle in O’Leary had not been abolished by the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) and that transaction evidence would satisfy the test of relevance under s 55, Evidence Act. 
     
      
    118 Despite being relevant, the use of transaction evidence may be restricted if it involves “tendency” or “coincidence” reasoning within the meaning of the Evidence Act, or “propensity evidence” in common law terms. If it is relevant for a use which does not involve tendency or coincidence reasoning, for example being evidence relevant to a person’s state of mind or evidence of conduct forming part of a relevant transaction, it may be admitted for that use, subject to the discretions in ss 135 and 137, Evidence Act. 
     
      
       
      Evidence relevant to a person’s state of mind 
       
      
    119 Transaction evidence will be admissible whether it occurred before or after the alleged offence. 
     
      
    120 In Adam, the appellant was found guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm to an off-duty police officer in a hotel car park. The Crown alleged that the appellant was one of the group involved in the attack. It sought to rely on evidence that the appellant had earlier displayed aggressive behaviour in the hotel as evidence of the appellant’s state of mind at a time sufficiently proximate to the time of the alleged offence to be capable of demonstrating the appellant’s state of mind at the time of the alleged offence. 
     
      
    121 The Court held at [30] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… evidence of conduct by an accused person evincing a particular state of mind at a time so proximate to the time of the commission of the alleged offence as to permit an inference that the same state of mind continued up to the time of the offence is not evidence of conduct by an accused person “in the past” or evidence tending to show that he has a particular “disposition” or “propensity” or “inclination” and no direction that the jury should not engage in tendency reasoning is required (although in a particular case a direction of some sort might be required).” 
        
       
      
    122 Thus it does not involve tendency reasoning to use evidence of a state of mind in existence at one point in time to suggest that the same state of mind may well have been in existence a short time later or a short time earlier. 
     
      
    123 In Player, the accused was charged pursuant to s 195(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) with maliciously damaging property belonging to another, namely a shop window at a fruit market in Rawson Street, Epping. The Crown alleged that while in a drunken and aggressive state the appellant smashed a glass fruit shop window. To prove the offence the prosecution had to establish that the appellant, in breaking the window, acted maliciously. The Crown sought to rely on evidence that the appellant was in an aggressive state when seen in close vicinity of the fruit market shortly after the sound of glass being smashed, submitting that this was evidence of conduct by the appellant evincing a particular state of mind at a time so close to the commission of the alleged offence as to permit an inference that the same state of mind was in existence at the time of its commission. It submitted that the aggressive state of mind which did not baulk at damaging or attempting to damage a sign and bins was but a continuation of the accused’s earlier state of mind when the window was broken.  
     
      
    124 Priestley JA (with whom Foster AJ agreed) held at [22] that the evidence was admissible as going to the appellant’s state of mind at times relevant to the commission of the alleged offence. 
     
      
    125 Smart AJ (with whom Foster AJ also agreed) followed Adam at [26] and [30]. His Honour also noted at [10] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Regina v Beserick 
         [1993] 30 NSWLR 510 at 520 Hunt CJ at CL said: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘It is but a very familiar principle of the law of evidence that subsequent behaviour may be regarded in order to indicate the state of mind which existed at an earlier time.....and it matters not whether [the acts] precede the time of the offence charged: (ibid) or succeed it.’ ” 
        
       
       
      Evidence of conduct which forms part of a relevant transaction 
       
      
    126 In O’Leary, (at 581-2), Williams J (who formed part of the majority), drew a distinction between transaction evidence and propensity evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not merely evidence that the appellant was a violent man who was likely to commit the crime, in which case it would have been inadmissible. It is evidence of certain significant incidents which took place in a series of connected occurrences which commenced with the drunken orgy on the sixth of July and concluded with Ballard’s death in the early morning of the seventh.”  
        
       
      
    127 In Adam, in addition to arguing that the evidence of the appellant’s earlier aggressive behaviour went to his state of mind at the time of the attack on the police officer, the Crown also argued that it was admissible as being O’Leary transaction evidence. The Court held that if evidence of some event “was an integral part of a connected series of events … which included [an event in issue] and which could not truly be understood without reference to the evidence” then such evidence would be relevant under s 55 Evidence Act and would not be tendency evidence: Adam at [26]-[27]. 
     
      
    128 In Player the Crown contended, relying on O’Leary and Adam, that the smashing of the window by the appellant was part of a transaction consisting of connected events. The “transaction” was a rampage. The Crown alleged that the appellant, after leaving the hotel in a drunken state, embarked upon a course of aggressive and destructive conduct. It submitted that without the challenged evidence the conduct which constituted the offence charged could not truly be understood and, isolated from it, could only be represented as an unreal and not very intelligible event. The impugned evidence put the conduct which constituted the offence charged into context. Smart AJ followed Adam, holding at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        “This resolves the admissibility point. The smashing of the window was part of the same connected series of events, namely “a drunken aggressive and destructive rampage in the early hours of Saturday morning”. The material in question was admissible.” 
        
       
       
      Harriman v R 
       
      
    129 The appellant’s reliance upon Harriman v R (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 627-635 affords him no comfort. In Harriman the High Court (Brennan, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) held that evidence of the accused's prior involvement with X in the sale of heroin was admissible on the ground that it was highly probative of the criminal character of the accused's association with X in Thailand in April 1987.  
     
      
    130 McHugh J dealt with the issue of the admissibility of evidence disclosing other criminal acts by an accused person in the passages upon which the appellant relies. While his Honour accepted (at 627) the general proposition that “[u]pon the trial of a criminal charge, evidence proving that the accused has been guilty of other criminal acts is not admissible if it does no more than prove that the accused has a general criminal disposition which makes it likely that he committed the offence with which he is charged”, he then identified a number of exceptions to that proposition.  
     
      
    131 The first exception was evidence of facts forming part of the same transaction as that under inquiry (i.e. part of the res gestae): Cross on Evidence, 3rd Aust ed (1986), at 1004 and see R v Bond [1906] 2 KB 389, at 400; R v Herbert [1916] VLR 343, at 346, 348-349; O'Leary v R (1946) 73 CLR 566, at 575-577, 582; R v Evans (1950) 34 Cr App Rep 72, at 77-78; R v O'Regan [1961] Qd R 78, at 87, 98; Bell v R (1985) 63 ALR 433, at 439-440; Williams v R (1986) 84 Cr App Rep 299, at 301-302. (Harriman at 628); 
     
      
    132 The second exception was evidence of collateral facts tending to prove the facts in issue (i.e. circumstantial evidence) (Harriman at 628) even though revealing other criminal conduct. Such cases included:  
     
      
       
      (a) evidence relating to the accused and the alleged victim (""the relationship cases""), which “tends to prove how or why the conduct the subject of the charge arose or because it makes it more probable than not that the conduct occurred at the time or place or in the way alleged.” ( 
      Harriman  
      at 630); 
       
       
      (b) evidence which although it discloses criminal conduct on the part of the accused… “tends to corroborate the truth of part of a witness' evidence.” ( 
      Harriman  
      at 632);  
       
       
      (c) evidence which rebuts any suggestion of ambiguity or uncertainty in a witness' evidence. ( 
      Harriman  
      at 632) 
       
      
    133 McHugh J also held (at 633) that “[I]f evidence which discloses other criminal conduct is characterised as part of the transaction which embraces the crime charged, it is not subject to any further condition of admissibility. Evidence which directly relates to the facts in issue is so fundamental to the proceedings that its admissibility as a matter of law cannot depend upon a condition that its probative force transcends its prejudicial effect.” 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    134 In my view the evidence concerning the appellant’s behaviour when the police arrived at the property was admissible. It falls squarely within the principles enunciated in O’Leary, Adam and Player. It did not involve tendency reasoning.  
     
      
    135 The evidence of the appellant’s subsequent aggressive behaviour towards the police was relevant to the appellant’s state of mind at the time of the alleged earlier assault on the complainant. It was also transaction evidence. The appellant’s subsequent behaviour towards the police and his alleged aggressive behaviour towards the complainant were in very close temporal proximity. 
     
      
    136 The appellant’s complaint that the trial judge did not direct the jury as to how this evidence could be used is incorrect. In the course of her summing-up the trial judge directed the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown also relies on the accused’s behaviour when the police arrived at the property. Ms Miner gave evidence that the accused had said to her: “ ‘if you call the cops I’ll shoot you and then I shoot the cops’ and then you will recall the evidence is that at the time the police arrived at the property, the accused said to them that he blow their heads off. The Crown relies on the fact that the accused was armed with a rifle, a bayonet and an imitation pistol and that provides support the Crown says for Ms Miner’s account that he was hunting her”. 
        
       
      
    137 I have already referred to Adam, where this Court said (at [30]) that it was not mandatory to give a direction that the jury should not engage in tendency reasoning and that whether such a direction was given in a case where “state of mind” evidence was admitted depended upon the particular case. I am satisfied that the direction the trial judge gave the jury was sufficient to direct the jury’s mind to the issue to which the Crown said it went, namely the corroboration of Ms Miner’s evidence. 
     
      
    138 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: 
       
      
    139 In the fourth ground of appeal the appellant complained that the trial judge erred in law in not directing the jury that where they entertained a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of the complainant’s evidence in relation to one or more counts, that must be taken into account in assessing her truthfulness or reliability generally or a similar direction. 
     
      
    140 The appellant referred to R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at 121 [182]; (2001) 125 A Crim R 186 at 221 – 223. In those passages, Spigelman CJ referred to the fact that it would often be prudent and sometimes necessary to assist the jury where: 
     
      
       
        
        “The circumstances might be such that the jury should also be instructed that if they hold a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of a complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, whether by reference to the complainant’s demeanour or for any other reason, they must take that into account in assessing the reliability of his or her evidence in relation to other counts”. 
        
       
      
    141 The appellant submitted that some such warning as was referred to by Spigelman CJ was essential to restore “a balance of fairness” (Markuleski at [187]).  
     
      
    142 The Crown submitted that it was desirable, but not necessarily fatal, that a Markuleski direction be given in a word against word case. The Crown submitted, however, that this was not “a word against word case” but, rather, that there was significant evidence capable of corroborating the complainant’s evidence on each of the counts for which the appellant was found guilty. In relation to Count 3, the Crown referred to that evidence as including: 
     
      
       
      (a) Dr Nair’s evidence that the complainant had a bruised forehead, upper lip, and fractured vertebrae in her lower back and accompanying pain; 
       
       
      (b) Evidence from the 000 operator that at 7.45 am she had entered on her computer: “female screaming into the phone being assaulted by a male – call terminated”. 
       
      
    143 In relation to Count 4, the Crown said the corroborative evidence included: 
     
      
       
      (a) The complainant’s evidence that the appellant threatened to shoot her or “the cops” if the police were called and the fact that when the police arrived he threatened to “blow their heads off”; 
       
       
      (b) Evidence from Constable Grasso that he had received two telephone calls from the appellant that morning in which the appellant threatened to kill the complainant if the police did not get there quickly;  
       
       
      (c) That what the appellant told Constable Grasso over the telephone he would do to the complainant if the police did not hurry was the same threat he made to the complainant namely he was going to kill her and throw her in the dam; 
       
       
      (d) That when the police arrived the appellant was armed with the rifle, a bayonet and a small silver hand gun; 
       
       
      (e) That the appellant’s behaviour upon the arrival of the police was inconsistent with his account of being a victim of violent attacks at the hands of the complainant and sheltering in the house; 
       
       
      (f) That the appellant displayed an aggressive attitude to the police which demonstrated a continuation of his state of mind earlier when threatening the complainant. 
       
      
    144 The Crown also submitted that the evidence isolated in relation to each count overlapped so that some of the matters relevant to Count 4 were also relevant to Count 3. 
     
      
    145 At the commencement of the trial the trial judge told the jury in her opening remarks that the four counts were being heard together for convenience and that a separate verdict was required in respect of each. The trial judge drew the jury’s attention to the fact that the second and third counts were alternatives. She reminded the jury again in her summing-up that the counts were being tried together as a matter of convenience. The Crown submitted that, in the light of those remarks, it was clear to the jury that all charges need not necessarily result in the same verdicts.  
     
      
    146 The Crown also drew attention to the fact that the Crown case relied upon the complainant’s evidence and that it was “important that you look very carefully at her evidence … (and) be satisfied of the truth and accuracy of her evidence before you act on it”.  
     
      
    147 In written submissions, counsel for the appellant drew attention to the fact that the trial judge had directed the jury in respect of Counts 2 and 3 that unless they accepted the complainant’s evidence in respect of those counts that the injury incurred in the way she had described “you could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the Accused who inflicted grievous bodily harm to her”. The appellant’s written submissions stated, in relation to that direction, that “her Honour … apparently intended that her direction cover an acquittal on all counts if the jury did not accept the complainant”. 
     
      
    148 The Crown struggled, understandably, to identify the point intended to be made in this submission. To the extent that it appeared to complain that the trial judge had indicated that she would give a Markuleski direction but had forgotten to do so in relation to the four counts, the Crown submitted that that was not a fair interpretation of the course of the trial as revealed by the transcript. The transcript, the Crown submitted, indicated the trial judge’s direction was intended to focus the jury’s mind upon the issue of self-defence which the appellant had raised and with which she dealt in the passage I have set out above. The Crown submitted that the fact that the trial judge had not indicated that she would give a Markuleski direction was confirmed by the fact that counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial did not seek any such redirection. 
     
      
    149 R v Markuleski concerned a case in which the appellant was arraigned in relation to six offences of a sexual nature. He was convicted of five out of the six counts. The case was “in large measure one of word against word, that is of the complainant against that of the appellant” (at [2]). The appellant complained that the verdicts of guilty in relation to the five counts were unreasonable or could not be supported in terms of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) because of the not guilty verdict in relation to the sixth count. The appellant relied upon Jones v R (1997) 191 CLR 439.  
     
      
    150 In Jones a man was convicted on two out of three counts on an indictment charging him with sexual intercourse with a female child. In holding that the convictions should be set aside, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ pointed out (at 453) that “the jury’s finding of not guilty on the second count damaged the credibility of the complainant with respect to all counts in the indictment”. If that was so then, in their Honours’ view, it was “difficult … to see how it was open to the jury to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant with respect to the first and third counts”. According to their Honours there was “nothing in the complainant’s evidence or the surrounding circumstances which [gave] any ground for supposing that her evidence was more reliable in relation to those counts than it was in relation to the second count”. 
     
      
    151 Their Honours were also concerned that the delay in the complaint and the lack of any corroborative evidence made it necessary for a reasonable jury to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with considerable care. 
     
      
    152 In Markuleski, Spigelman CJ observed (at [31]) that “Nothing in Jones casts any doubt on the appropriateness of a jury accepting a witness’ evidence in one respect, whilst retaining a reasonable doubt about the commission of events about which that same witness is the only substantive witness”.  
     
      
    153 In Markuleski, Spigelman CJ conducted a comprehensive review of the cases on inconsistent verdicts particularly in the context of sexual assault cases and observed (at [185]) that case law indicated that there was a recurring difficulty where the circumstances of the case were such that if a jury held a reasonable doubt concerning the reliability of a complainant’s evidence on one or more counts, that doubt should be taken into account in assessing the reliability of the complainant’s evidence in relation to the other counts. In the light of those cases, Spigelman CJ indicated that it was “desirable” that the traditional separate consideration warning (KRM v R (2001) 206 CLR 221 at [36] per McHugh J) should be supplemented by a direction which referred to “the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury [found] itself unable to accept the complainant’s evidence with respect to any count”. While the Chief Justice said that (at [187]) some such direction should be given “as a general rule”, his Honour also observed that failure to give such direction was “not necessarily fatal” and, moreover, that “the ‘general rule’ does not apply ‘where the peculiar facts of the case and the conduct of the trial do not suggest the need for a warning to restore a balance of fairness’”. 
     
      
    154 In my view the appellant’s complaint that the trial judge failed to give a Markuleski direction should be rejected. Although it is true that Spigelman CJ did not confine his observations concerning the desirability of a direction concerning the effect of rejecting a complainant’s evidence in relation to one count upon a jury’s consideration of the other counts, this was a case, in my view, in which the circumstances were such that the facts of the case and the conduct of the trial did not suggest the need for a warning “to restore a balance of fairness”. Indeed, counsel for the appellant frankly conceded that the desirability of such a direction only became apparent after the jury had acquitted the appellant in relation to Count 1.  
     
      
    155 I would not give the appellant leave to raise Ground 4.  
     
      
      Ground 5: miscarriage of justice 
       
      
    156 The appellant submitted that the fact that the jury did not accept the complainant on the first count combined with its complaints about the directions in relation to Counts 3 and 4, meant that the convictions in relation to Counts 3 and 4 were “unsafe and unsatisfactory”, relying upon s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 
     
      
    157 The Crown submitted that the finding of not guilty in relation to Count 1 could be explained by the fact that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt because of Mr Greentree’s evidence. It drew attention to the fact that the jury was given the traditional direction that they were entitled to accept the whole or part of what a witness said. 
     
      
    158 It submitted that the jury’s acquittal on Count 1 was rationally explained in the words of Winneke P and Charles JA in R v J (No 2) [1998] 3 VR 602 at 628 referred to with approval in Markuleski at [92]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the jury was prepared to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt in respect of particular offences alleged on the presentment where there was acceptable evidence from independent sources pointing to the possibility that the offence had not occurred at the time or in the circumstances particularised in the relevant count. The verdicts, so viewed, do not in our opinion demonstrate inconsistency, nor do they demonstrate that the jury regarded the complainant, on matters of substance, as other than a witness of truth."" [Emphasis added] 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    159 The Crown also submitted that the fact the jury found the appellant not guilty on Count 2 indicated it entertained a doubt about whether he intended in fact to do grievous bodily harm to Ms Miner. The Crown referred to the evidence independent of the complainant which, it submitted, corroborated her evidence. It also submitted that the appellant’s account of the events lacked credibility in significant respects, suggesting I infer that the jury was entitled to reject it. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    160 Where a complaint is made that a verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act, the test the court applies is “whether [the court] thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."": MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 77 ALJR 139 at [25] per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ; at [52]-[58] per McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ. 
     
      
    161 The appellant’s submissions under this head amounted to the bald assertion to which I have already referred. 
     
      
    162 I have already set out the evidence upon which the Crown relied in dealing with the other grounds of appeal. In my view it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty in relation to Counts 3 and 4. 
     
      
    163 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    164 In my view the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    165 I agree with Justice Howie’s reasons and orders in relation to the appellant’s appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    166 STUDDERT J: I have read the judgment of McColl JA in draft form, and I agree that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed for the reasons stated by her Honour. 
     
      
    167 I agree that the sentences imposed should be quashed and that the appellant should be resentenced as proposed by Howie J for the reasons which his Honour has expressed. 
     
      
    168 HOWIE J: I have read in draft the judgment of McColl JA and I agree, for the reasons given by her Honour, that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    169 The appellant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him. The submission made on behalf of the appellant is that the initial starting point chosen by her Honour before she applied certain discounts, to which reference will be made shortly, was excessive. It is unnecessary for me to again set out the facts upon which the applicant was to be sentenced and I gratefully adopt the summary of the Crown case contained in the judgment of McColl JA. 
     
      
    170 The appellant was to be sentenced for three offences, all arising from the one incident of criminality. They were as follows: maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty being 7 years imprisonment; assault contrary to s 61, maximum 2 years imprisonment; use an offensive weapon with intent to avoid his apprehension contrary to s 33B, maximum 12 years imprisonment. In addition the appellant asked her Honour to take into account three related matters arising from his misuse of a firearm and an offence of carrying a cutting weapon. As her Honour noted, the criminality of the three matters on the Form 1 relating to his misuse of a firearm was substantially reflected in the offence under s 33B. 
     
      
    171 In respect of the s 61 offence, the fourth count in the indictment, her Honour sentenced the appellant to a fixed term of 10 months to date from 22 June 2002 and which expired on 21 April 2003. In respect of the s 35 offence, the third count on the indictment, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years to date from 22 February 2003 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months expiring on 21 May 2005. In respect of the s 33B offence, the fourth count, and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years to date from 22 February 2005 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 4 months to expire on 21 June 2007. 
     
      
    172 The overall sentence was thus one of 6 years and 8 months imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of 5 years, both dating from 22 June 2002. The date upon which the appellant will be eligible to be released to parole is 21 June 2007. 
     
      
    173 It is clear that her Honour approached the construction of the sentence in accordance with the practice adopted in this State following the decision in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. Her Honour determined what she considered to be the appropriate sentence for each offence taken separately and then, having considered the totality of the criminality involved, made orders providing for partial concurrence of the three sentences. The appellant submits that each sentence imposed exceeded that which was required and the total length of the overall sentence was excessive. 
     
      
    174 There were two matters taken into account by the sentencing judge that resulted in a discount being applied to the sentences that might otherwise have been appropriate for the offences for which the appellant was convicted. The first was the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty to the s 33B offence at the commencement of the trial and was remorseful in respect of his conduct toward the police that gave rise to that offence. 
     
      
    175 The second matter was the assistance that the appellant had provided while in custody to police and the prosecuting authorities in respect of the commission of a very serious offence by other prison inmates. Although this was not a case where the appellant had given an undertaking to give evidence for the prosecution, material placed before her Honour indicated that it was expected that he would do so. Her Honour determined that, as a result of that assistance, there should be a discount of 40 per cent in respect of the sentences for the trial matters. That assistance and the plea of guilty resulted in a discount of 50 per cent for the s 33B offence. 
     
      
    176 There is no challenge to those discounts by the appellant: nor could there be. On the basis that this Court might be called upon to re-sentence the appellant, the sealed envelope that was before her Honour was tendered before us. The Crown, having read the material at the Court’s invitation, declined to make any submission as to the quantum of the discount. 
     
      
    178 The material placed before her Honour indicated that the appellant was not seeking to be placed on protection but wanted to be classified to a minimum security prison outside the Sydney Metropolitan Area. Apparently the Crime Commission, the body investigating the offence for which assistance had been given, had promised him that he would be sent to some such institution. Her Honour was initially asked to make recommendations for his protection in prison pending sentence but understood that shortly thereafter he was to be transferred to a prison for protected prisoners. At that stage Junee Correctional Centre was in contemplation. I do not believe that in those circumstances a discount of the order as that given by her Honour was justified, notwithstanding the value of the information and the seriousness of the allegation, in respect of which the assistance had been given. 
     
      
    179 The material raises once again the issue of what mitigation of a sentence should be made on the basis that the offender might spend all or some of his sentence in protective custody. The matter has been recently considered in R v Totten [2003] NSWCCA 207 and R v Durocher-Yvon [2003] NSWCCA 299. It can no longer be assumed that a prisoner, by reason of the fact that he will serve his sentence on protection, will find prison life more difficult or onerous than other prisoners in the general prison population or that the prisoner will be deprived of amenities or opportunities for self improvement courses and education. The present is another instance where a sentencing judge has presumably taken into account in favour of the offender the fact that he will serve his sentence under the harsh conditions and deprivations of protective custody, but that has not proved to be the case. It is an example of the difficulty of a sentencing court taking into account possible executive or administrative action in respect of a prisoner’s custody when predicting how a sentence will be served. Although in Durocher-Yvon the Court indicated that a sentencing judge was entitled to assume that an informer would find himself in strict protection for the best part, if not the whole, of his sentence, that assumption would have proved to be erroneous in the present case. 
     
      
    180 As was recognised in Totten, the court is placed in a difficult position. On the one hand, the sentencer should take into account the conditions of the prisoner’s custody where it appears that they will be unduly onerous because of some matter particular to that prisoner. This requires that, at the time of sentence, the court make some prediction about the nature of the custody that will be endured by the prisoner. On the other hand, the courts should now be aware that assumptions or predictions, which have been made in the past about the nature of an offender’s custody because, for example, the offender has given assistance to the authorities, no longer hold good. But the vagaries of prison life are such that it could never be confidently assumed or predicted that a prisoner will serve the whole of his sentence in any particular type of custodial arrangement. 
     
      
    181 It is unnecessary in the present case to do more than refer to this conundrum without trying to solve it, but if this Court is required to re-sentence the appellant, it cannot ignore the fact that he is not apparently serving his sentence under any more onerous conditions than any other prisoner in the general population and is unlikely in the future to do so. To the contrary, we are asked to take into account the progress he has made in prison by undertaking courses to address those problems that might have given rise to the present offences. Although the assistance proffered, and so far given, is of considerable benefit to the community in relation to a very serious offence, the Court cannot overlook the fact that the detriment suffered by the prisoner as a result is not as significant as might have been assumed in the past or with other prisoners. 
     
      
    182 A further matter that arises in this regard is the fact that the prisoner has never been required to give a formal undertaking as to future assistance. However, he gave evidence before Judge Hock that, at the date of sentence, he still intended to assist the authorities and that this assistance would involve his giving sworn evidence at a trial. I would be prepared to accept, as her Honour did, that this was in effect an undertaking to give evidence, but with respect I do not think that it is a satisfactory way of dealing with the matter. It is of some concern to me that a discount of 40 per cent was given, part of which no doubt was for future assistance, but the prosecuting authorities did not seek to have the appellant give an undertaking as to the evidence he was prepared to give. It is not clear whether the appellant understands that a failure to give future assistance by way of evidence in accordance with the statements he has made, would result in the loss of some part of the discount he has been granted by the trial judge. 
     
      
    183 Be that as it may, the appellant’s challenge is principally to the starting point that her Honour chose before applying those discounts. The sentence for the assault, before the application of the discount for assistance, was imprisonment for about 16 months; that for the s 35 offence was imprisonment for 5 years; and that for the s 33B offence imprisonment for 8 years. The written submissions on behalf of the appellant contend that her Honour sentenced the respondent to a total sentence of over 14 years and 4 months against an overall maximum penalty for the three offences of 21 years. This calculation, however, overlooks the fact that there was an overlap of five months between the sentences by reason of them being made only partially cumulative, so that the overall undiscounted sentence was, therefore, one of 13 years and 11 months. 
     
      
    184 Her Honour appropriately described the offences as “extremely serious”. She noted that the injury to Ms Miner was a very painful one and resulted in her requiring the aid of a walking stick for about 7 months after the attack. There was no evidence as to how that injury was inflicted but it required a significant amount of force being applied to the victim’s back. The jury’s verdict meant that the appellant had applied that force in circumstances when the victim was unable to ward off the blow or otherwise protect herself. Even if one assumes that the injury was inflicted recklessly rather than intentionally, it was still a serious instance of the offence notwithstanding the appellant’s intoxicated state. By the date of the sentencing proceedings the victim had returned to Canada and there was no victim impact statement before the court as to the state of her injury at that time. 
     
      
    185 Although the s 61 offence did not involve any physical touching of the victim, it was a grave example of an assault because it involved a significant threat of violence to the victim for a not insignificant period of time. Although the “hunting” of the victim was in all probabilities merely intended to scare her, there was no doubt that it did so to a very substantial degree at a time when she was suffering from her painful back injury. 
     
      
    186 It is unnecessary to emphasise once again the serious nature of the s 33B offence or to refer to decisions of this Court that have emphasised the importance of general deterrence when sentencing for offences directed at police officers who are simply carrying out their duties. The offence was aggravated by the fact that, as a result of the offence, one of the officers suffered from a Post Trauma Distress Disorder that left him permanently disabled so far as his police duties were concerned. Her Honour described this as “catastrophic” for the officer. 
     
      
    187 It was clearly a serious example of the offence notwithstanding that the firearm could not be discharged. The officer was obviously not aware of that fact and the rifle was pointed at him for a significant period. The officer was placed in the highly stressful position of being confronted with the possibility of having to shoot the appellant in order to defend himself from what he perceived as a real and present danger to himself. It must be every police officer’s nightmare that he or she will attend a domestic disturbance and find one of the occupants brandishing a firearm in his or her direction. Persons who put police officers in that position must expect the courts to react with severe sentences. 
     
      
    188 The appellant was aged 39 years at the date of sentence. He has a criminal record from May 1985 for firearms offences and was sentenced in 1991 to imprisonment for 3 months. The sentencing judge noted that this sentence did nothing to deter the appellant from further offending by the misuse of firearms and that specific deterrence was a relevant sentencing consideration. There was also a breach of a domestic violence order in 1991 for which the appellant was placed on a bond. However, as her Honour noted, otherwise his record is of little relevance and she assessed the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation as “reasonable”. 
     
      
    189 There was a pre-sentence report before the sentencing judge. It indicated that a person, who had previously been in a de facto relationship with the appellant, stated that he had never displayed violence toward her and she was surprised by the commission of the offences. Under the heading “Factors relating to offending” was the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Attitude to offending:  
        [The appellant] stated that he accepts responsibility for his actions and acknowledged that alcohol had been a significant factor in his offending behaviour. In explaining the offence, [the appellant] stated that at the time he and his ex-wife were experiencing marital problems, claiming that she had an affair with a work colleague. [The appellant] stated that his doctor put him on anti-depressant for depression. On the day of his offending, he stated that he had not taken his medication for over a week and to cope with the stress he consumed alcohol. He had not consumed alcohol for the past ten years and when he did so things got out of hand. He said [he] now regrets his behaviour. 
        
       
       
      The officer reported that her inquiries revealed that the appellant was normally a social-drinker and that “his pattern of alcohol consumption is rare”. 
       
      
    190 The appellant gave evidence before the sentencing judge. He said that at the time leading up to the commission of the offences he had not been taking anti-depressant medication because the victim had hidden his prescription and he had thus turned to alcohol. He had not consumed alcohol for about 8 years before the offences were committed. He said that, when released from custody, he intended to undertake a course in veterinary science. Before his arrest he had made application to undertake a TAFE course in this field. He said that he regretted his behaviour that night and, while he accepted that his conduct resulted in a serious injury to his wife, he denied inflicting the injury or assaulting her. 
     
      
    191 The sentencing judge accepted the appellant’s evidence as to his alcohol consumption and indicated that she was treating it as a mitigating factor. Although her Honour found that there were special circumstances in respect of the last sentence by reason of it being accumulated on the other two sentences, she determined that no lesser non-parole period than that she fixed, a period of five years, would be sufficient to reflect the objective seriousness of his conduct. 
     
      
    192 In a matter such as the present where the only complaint is that the sentence is manifestly excessive, the Court must act on its own assessment of the sentence and to that extent it must be a subjective reaction to the sentence imposed having regard to the objective features of the crime, the subjective features of the offender and the purpose of punishment; being ultimately the protection of the community. However, the Court does not substitute its own assessment of the appropriate sentence for that made by the sentencing judge unless it comes to the view that the sentence was beyond the sentencing judge’s discretion. That is not a conclusion that should be lightly reached and more than lip service should be paid to the fact that it is the sentencing judge’s task to determine the weight to be given to the various aspects of sentencing in a particular case and the relevant facts that impinge upon that determination. The deference to be paid to the sentencing judge’s discretion and fact-finding applies both to the head sentence and the specification of the non-parole period.  
     
      
    193 In the present case I am left with the very strong impression that the overall starting sentence is too high. Whether this is because the individual sentences are too severe or there was insufficient concurrence of the sentences to reflect the fact that each of the offences arose from a single incident is probably not important. But in a case where her Honour accepted that the criminal conduct was as a result of the appellant’s intoxication and that this was a mitigating factor, a total sentence of almost 14 years as against a statutory maximum of 21 years seems to me, with respect, to be outside the discretionary range for a single episode of criminality, especially when it is accepted that it arose when the appellant was uncharacteristically heavily intoxicated. 
     
      
    194 I have remarked that the offences were serious but none of them required an undiscounted sentence towards the top of the range, even if each offence was considered in isolation. Yet the sentences imposed for the s 35 offence and the s 33B offence were at the higher end of the available discretionary range having regard to either the maximum sentence provided by statute or the actual range of sentences imposed by the courts and as disclosed in the available statistics. In addition there was, with respect, an inadequate amount of overlap between the individual sentences notwithstanding that they were all part of the one criminal enterprise arising from a relatively short period of time. The overall undiscounted sentence is, in my respectful opinion, outside the discretionary range open to her Honour. The resulting sentence is also excessive notwithstanding the overly generous discount applied to the trial matters. 
     
      
    195 In my view the sentences are manifestly excessive and this Court should intervene. The discount for the trial matters, however, should have been about thirty per cent, and half of that due to the promised future assistance. The discount for the s 33B offence should remain at 50 per cent with 20 per cent due to future assistance. 
     
      
    196 In my opinion the sentence for the s 61 offence should remain as it is. I believe that the starting sentence of 16 months was appropriate and although the discount was excessive, it should not be varied so as to have the result that the sentence is increased. The sentence, therefore, remains at 10 months. 
     
      
    197 The starting sentence for the s 35 offence should be 4 years and, with a discount of 30 per cent, results in a sentence of 2 years 10 months. 
     
      
    198 The starting sentence for the s 33B offence, taking into account the matters on the Form 1, should be 6½ years reduced to 3 years 3 months by reason of the 50 per cent discount. 
     
      
    199 The overall sentence should, therefore, be 5½ years with a non-parole period of 4 years. This preserves approximately the statutory relationship between the overall sentence and the non-parole period and allows the appellant a parole period of 18 months which, in my view, is the appropriate period for the applicant to be on parole if he is released at the expiration of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    200 I propose, therefore, that the sentences imposed by her Honour for the s 35 and s 33B offences be quashed. In respect of the s 35 offence the appellant is to be sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years and 10 months that sentence to commence on 22 December 2002 and to expire on 21 October 2005. In respect of the s 33B offence, the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months to commence on 22 September 2004 with a non–parole period of 1 year and 9 months to expire on 21 June 2006 the date upon which the appellant is eligible to be released to parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HIDDEN J: This is an unusual case in which, in my view, a non-custodial penalty would not have been inappropriate. However, I am not prepared to say that a term of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention was outside the bounds of a legitimate exercise of discretion although, as Kirby J has pointed out, a non-parole period should have been fixed. It was to that issue that argument in the application was primarily directed. 
     
      
    2 I agree with the orders proposed by Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: Joe Hakim (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ on 24 April 2003. Mr Hakim pleaded guilty to having been an accessory before the fact to break enter and steal (Crimes Act 1900, s112(1) and s346). He was sentenced to two years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention, commencing 3 May 2003. 
     
      
       
      The facts. 
       
      
    4 On 15 March 2002 at about 2.30 am two police officers were patrolling in an unmarked police vehicle in an industrial estate at Seven Hills. They noticed an unattended Toyota van parked by the side of the road. They made enquiries to determine whether the vehicle had been reported as stolen. They were told there had been no such report. The vehicle was registered in the name of Joe Hakim. 
     
      
    5 Shortly after the police observed a male in a Commodore sedan drive past the Toyota van and turn around. The vehicle parked nearby. The police approached the driver of the vehicle. They asked his name. It was Joe Hakim (the applicant). 
     
      
    6 The police immediately recognised the name as the registered owner of the Toyota van. They questioned Mr Hakim further. He gave what the sentencing Judge described as ""transparently unsatisfactory answers"" as to why, at 3.00 am, he was in the area with a vehicle belonging to him parked nearby. 
     
      
    7 Mr Hakim then made a number of admissions. With one exception, he later repeated those admissions in a video recorded interview. He admitted that he had loaned his vehicle to his cousin, Tannous Abboud. He knew that his cousin, and a person known to him as ""Simon"", planned to steal air conditioners from a company within the industrial estate. He also knew that Simon worked for that company. According to the police, he acknowledged that he was acting as ""look out"" for his cousin and Simon, which he later denied in the recorded interview, suggesting that his words had been misunderstood. 
     
      
    8 Mr Hakim was arrested. He was placed in the police vehicle. A search was then undertaken for his cousin and Simon. Mr Abboud was later seen approaching the Toyota van. He had the keys to the van in his hand. Within the vehicle there were bolt cutters. Mr Abboud was also arrested. 
     
      
    9 The police later determined that a company within the estate had been broken into. Air conditioners and electrical goods had been stolen, exceeding $60,000 in value. Also stolen were tools belonging to subcontractors valued at about $11,000. Initially Mr Hakim was charged with the offence of break, enter and steal, and alternatively with being an accessory before the fact in respect of that offence. The Crown ultimately accepted a plea to the latter charge. His Honour dealt with Mr Hakim upon that basis. He said this: (p2/3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is apparent that the prisoner knew what was to take place and was a willing facilitator in the lending of his van. It is equally true I think I should say, in agreement with the submission made by Mr Meakin for the prisoner, that there is nothing to suggest that he was any more central to the operation of this quite large, sophisticated and unfortunately successful breaking and entering."" 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour added: (p3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Nonetheless his role in lending transport is an important one and it is, objectively, one which requires the imposition of a term of imprisonment, in my view."" 
        
       
      
    11 There was no evidence that Mr Hakim knew of the scale of the operation. He did know, nonetheless, that the target was a factory in a remote industrial estate, that the operation was being undertaken late at night, and that his cousin had the assistance of someone who worked at the factory. It may be inferred that he knew that the value of the goods to be stolen was likely to be significant. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case. 
       
      
    12 Mr Hakim was a young man. He was born on 9 July 1983. At the time of the offence, he was 18 years old. At the time of sentence he was 19 years. He lived at home with his parents and older sister. He did not take drugs. He occasionally drank alcohol. He had pleaded guilty once the Crown had indicated that they were prepared to accept a plea to the lesser charge. 
     
      
    13 Before his involvement in this offence, Mr Hakim had led an exemplary life. He had no criminal record. He was involved with his church, organising youth activities. He had completed the Higher School Certificate and a number of TAFE courses in Information Technology. 
     
      
    14 Mr Hakim worked full time. He was employed as a contract courier. His employer, knowing of this offence, provided a reference. He said that he regarded Mr Hakim as honest, reliable and trustworthy. He valued him as an employee.  
     
      
    15 A number of other persons provided references in similar terms. He was described as having ""a strong work ethic"". His involvement in this episode was said to be out of character. A number said that he felt deep shame and remorse at his involvement. 
     
      
    16 A pre-sentence report was prepared by the District Officer of the Probation and Parole Service. The Officer spoke to Mr Hakim's employer who made the following comment in relation to the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He noted however, that Mr Hakim was still naive in his judgment of other people, tending to see them all as good."" 
        
       
      
    17 The District Officer's assessment of Mr Hakim was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Hakim presented as a quiet, slow-thinking person whose involvement in the current offence has made him aware that there is a need to protect himself from persons who may take advantage of his generosity."" 
        
       
      
    18 Consideration was given by the Probation and Parole Service to alternatives to full time custody. The following was said as to the possibility of a suspended sentence with entry into a good behaviour bond (s12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999): 
     
      
       
        
        ""If a Good Behaviour Bond or Suspended sentence is imposed, supervision by this Service is not considered necessary as Mr Hakim has adequate family and social support."" 
        
       
      
    19 Mr Hakim was assessed as suitable for community service or periodic detention. 
     
      
    20 There was delay in Mr Hakim being sentenced (not being brought about by the applicant himself). He was therefore reassessed by the Probation and Parole Service and a further report of 18 February 2002 provided, reaffirming the comments previously made. 
     
      
    21 His Honour, in his remarks, made the following comments on the subjective features of Mr Hakim's case: (p3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In favour of the prisoner he is now aged nineteen, he will turn twenty this July. He was eighteen at the time of the commission of this offence. He has no criminal history; he has, indeed, a store of positive history in his favour and there is a wealth of material which indicates that apart from this endeavour he had been hard working, law abiding and a positive asset to the community."" 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour added: (p3) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is for those reasons that I think it is permissible to convert the period of detention which I would otherwise have imposed to periodic detention rather than full time. Nonetheless it seems to me this crime requires, if not salutary at least serious punishment. I note that he has given no undertaking to give evidence against his relative but it is likely that he will be a witness of some significance in the Crown case."" 
        
       
       
      The Notice of Appeal. 
       
      
    23 The Notice of Appeal raised four grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1: 
         The Learned Judge erred in determining that the offence ""objectively required a sentence of imprisonment"" and erred in law and principle in the manner in which he made that determination, and failed to give proper and adequate consideration to other sentencing disposition."" 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2:  
        The term of imprisonment imposed by the Learned Judge was more than was required to reflect the objective gravity of the offender's conduct. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3: 
         The Learned Judge failed to give appropriate weight to factors standing in the applicant's favour in determining that there was no penalty appropriate other than a sentence of imprisonment, and in determining the length of the sentence, and in determining not to suspend the term. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 4: 
         The Learned Judge erred in not fixing a non parole period, or alternatively, in not giving reasons for not doing so."" 
        
       
       
      Grounds 1, 2 and 3. 
       
      
    24 It is convenient to consider the first three grounds together. The applicant drew attention to a number of passages from R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 where Howie J described the step required when sentencing under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Paraphrasing his Honour's words, the following propositions can be stated (cf R v Cromarty [2004] NSWCCA 54 at para 85): 
     
      
    · First, there are a number of steps in the determination of an appropriate sentence. Each step requires a consideration of the objective gravity of the offence balanced against the subjective circumstances of the offender. 
     
      
    · Secondly, a preliminary question must be asked and answered, namely: Are there any alternatives to a term of imprisonment? 
     
      
    · Thirdly, if the Court determines that there is no alternative to imprisonment, it must then determine the length of the term of imprisonment. That determination must be made without regard to the manner in which the sentence may be served (whether by home detention or periodic detention) or whether the term should be suspended. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, the Court should then consider if an alternative to full time custody is appropriate. In making that determination the Court must recognise that the alternatives to full time custody involve a significant element of leniency. The appropriateness of an alternative to full time custody will depend upon many factors including, importantly, whether such an alternative would result in a sentence that reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfils the manifold purposes of punishment, including deterrence and denunciation. 
     
      
    25 Here it was argued that his Honour made a number of fundamental errors. First, he had not addressed what Howie J described as the ""preliminary question"", that is, whether there was an alternative to imprisonment. Secondly, in determining the penalty to be imposed, his Honour had regard only to the objective seriousness of the offence. He failed to take account of the strong subjective case of Mr Hakim. He announced his conclusion that a custodial sentence was required before he made any reference to the subjective case.  
     
      
    26 His Honour gave an extempore judgment. The sentencing remarks, in the sequence of paragraphs, may appear to support the submissions made by the applicant. However, I do not accept that his Honour was in error in the manner suggested. The matter came before his Honour at Penrith on 24 April 2003. There were short submissions, during which material was tendered, both by the Crown and counsel for Mr Hakim. His Honour then adjourned to read the material. Having done so, he passed sentence. His remarks extended over a little more than three pages. 
     
      
    27 The material handed to his Honour included the two pre-sentence reports. The reports set out, in the usual way, a commentary upon sentencing options, including alternatives to imprisonment, such as community service. The material tendered included the many character references and other documents concerning the achievements of Mr Hakim. I have no doubt that his Honour considered this material as he addressed, in his own mind, the sequence of issues identified by Howie J, set out above. His Honour obviously knew, before he began his remarks, the sentence he was about to impose. It is wrong, in these circumstances, to attach too much importance to the sequence of paragraphs in the remarks themselves. I would infer that his Honour determined that there was a need for a custodial sentence, having considered the alternatives, and having taken account the objective and subjective material. 
     
      
    28 Mr Hakim had assisted in the commission of a serious offence. It was a significant lapse of judgment. It was open to his Honour, notwithstanding the strong subjective case, to regard the matter as warranting a custodial sentence. Indeed, the submission made by the applicant, that it was ""a classic case for a suspended sentence"" implicitly recognised that a custodial sentence was appropriate, as made clear from the sequence of the questions identified by Howie J in Zamagias (supra para 24). It was, nonetheless, reasonable that alternatives to full time custody should have been considered, given the youth of the offender, his plea of guilty, the absence of a criminal record, and his strong subjective case. His Honour determined that periodic detention was appropriate. Others may have regarded a suspended sentence as appropriate. In my view, a sentence of periodic detention for a term of two years was within the range of sound sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    29 There is, in my opinion, no substance in grounds 1, 2 or 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: No non parole period. 
       
      
    30 His Honour, however, did not set a non parole period, nor give reasons for not doing so. 
     
      
    31 In R v Parsons & Poore [2002] NSWCCA 296, the issue arose whether a sentencing Judge was obliged to fix a non parole period where a term of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention had been imposed. Here, the issue must be considered in the context of s44 and s45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, as it then stood (the Act having since been amended). Smart AJ, having considered legislative changes to the role of the Parole Board, said this: (para 84) 
     
      
       
        
        ""84. The Parole Board is not empowered to set a non-parole period. It is for the judge when sentencing the offender initially and imposing a term of imprisonment to fix a non-parole period."" 
        
       
      
    32 The Court (Sully J agreeing) determined there was error where the sentencing Judge failed to fix a non parole period, or failed to give reasons for not having done so. The conclusion of Smart AJ has since been cited with approval by Bell J (with whom Wood CJ at CL and Dowd J agreed) in R v Meyer (2002) 135 A Crim R 438 at 442 (para 9) and by Wood CJ at CL in R v Stephen [2003] NSWCCA 377 (at paras 21-22 and 31). 
     
      
    33 There was therefore error in not fixing a non parole period. It is necessary that this Court should now do so. The Crown has urged that the usual division be made, as suggested by s44(1) of the Act, namely, a non parole period of 75 percent of the term imposed, in this case a period of 18 months. Counsel for Mr Hakim submitted that special circumstances should be found, based upon Mr Hakim's youth and excellent prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    34 Our attention was drawn to R v Hoang [2003] NSWCCA 380, which was an appeal against sentence in respect of serious offences. A lengthy term of imprisonment had been imposed. One of the complaints against the sentence was the failure on the part of the sentencing Judge to find special circumstances. The offender was aged 18 years. Wood CJ at CL (with whom Smart AJ agreed) said this: (para 56) 
     
      
       
        
        ""56. I am, however, persuaded that special circumstances should have been found, arising from the applicant's age and his demonstrated commitment to rehabilitation."" 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour continued: (paras 59-62) 
     
      
       
        
        ""59. Quite separate considerations are involved in determining whether special circumstances exist. The most relevant consideration in this case concerns the desirability of providing for the opportunity of an extensive period of release on parole:  
        R v Fong 
         [2002] NSWCCA 320. In that regard, care does need to be exercised to ensure that the reduction in a non-parole period does not result in a period of potential release that is so lengthy as to be likely to achieve little in the way of supervised assistance.  
        
       
       
        
        60. In its later years, on the other hand, an extended period on parole, which includes a period where supervision has been withdrawn because it is no longer considered necessary, may still have a very real significance for a young offender. It can operate as a continuing and effective constraint, since the offender remains subject to the risk of revocation of parole and return to prison for the balance of parole, if he or she re-offends.  
        
       
       
        
        61. What is needed is a considered balance to ensure that the non-parole period remains proportionate to the objective and subjective criminality of the offender and also provides a real encouragement and opportunity for rehabilitation.  
        
       
       
        
        62. In this case, the length of the sentence, the youth of the applicant, the favourable prospects for his rehabilitation, and the fact that this was his first time in custody, were matters that should, in my view, have been found to constitute special circumstances."" 
        
       
      
    36 There are obvious differences between that case and the case of Mr Hakim. The offender in that case faced a long sentence. He was to be given supervision by the Probation and Parole Service at least for part of the parole period (which is not contemplated here). Although there are those differences, I am nonetheless persuaded that it is appropriate to find special circumstances and fix the non parole period of 15 months. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    37 The order I propose therefore is as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. That leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      2. That the appeal be allowed against the sentence imposed by Freeman DCJ to the extent that the sentence of 2 years imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention be varied by adding that there be a non parole period of 15 months beginning on 3 May 2003 and ending on 2 August 2004.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 5 December last, the offender pleaded guilty to two counts on an indictment. The first count alleged that on 17 October or thereabouts, at Newcastle, he knowingly took part in the supply of methylamphetamine in an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity for such drug. This offence usually carries a maximum penalty of twenty years’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The second count on the indictment was one which alleged on 23 September 2001, at Murwillumbah, he knowingly took part in the supply of methylamphetamine in an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity for such drug. That also, of course, is an offence which carries a maximum penalty of twenty years. 
     
      
    3 On the face of it, an offender who had pleaded guilty to two such offences would expect, and the public would expect, that he would receive a very significant prison sentence, one probably getting towards double figures. That will not be the outcome in this particular case because of the somewhat extraordinary and unusual circumstances in which the offences were committed and the criminality which is alleged against the offender. Any person who in subsequent times considers the sentence and the outcome of it could understand that it is an extraordinary case with very special facts and that in no way does this sentence represent what would, generally speaking, be a proper form of punishment for offences of this nature. 
     
      
    4 The two offences arise from a relationship that the offender had with a man named Walsh. For a period covering the two charges, Walsh was a major supplier of methylamphetamine in the Newcastle area. He was a high ranking member in the Nomads motor cycle club who used that position to distribute drugs to members of the club and other members in the community for a long period of time with complete immunity. He was, on the evidence that I have heard in other cases, a man who could resort to violence, if necessary, in order to either obtain his way, or to punish those who had in some way misbehaved against him. 
     
      
    5 Walsh carried out his business using persons with whom he came into contact. The major assistant in this enterprise was his wife, Melinda Love. She was involved in that part of the enterprise which required to receive from Walsh or his associates pure, or almost pure methylamphetamine and to mix it with dextrose in order to cut its purity and then package it for distribution. 
     
      
    6 Mr Walsh distributed the drug to members of the motor cycle club, as a general rule, and Melinda Love distributed it to other persons outside the club and the community. There is no doubt that a number of persons who were otherwise law-abiding citizens in the community became entangled in Mr Walsh’s enterprise and as a consequence of this committed criminal offences. I have sentenced one person so far because of his involvement with Mr Walsh who otherwise, I am satisfied, would never have criminal offences of any seriousness at all. I think that the present offender falls into the same category. 
     
      
    7 The offender knew Mr Walsh from school days. Eventually they came in contact again mainly because the offender had, and maintains, a reputation as a very fine spray painter indeed.  
     
      
    8 Part of Mr Walsh’s criminal activity, when he was not completely engaged in distributing methylamphetamine, was to steal motor vehicles - I do not mean motor cars - to have them taken apart, to use the parts in vehicles which he owned in the construction side of his affairs and also to rebirth vehicles which he used in the course of his trade. It was in the course of this criminal enterprise that he was engaged in that he came into contact with the offender. 
     
      
    9 The offender was asked by him to spray paint a vehicle and became involved in assisting Mr Walsh with both legitimate and illegitimate activity involving the use of construction vehicles. 
     
      
    10 Incidentally, so it seems to me, the offender also was ensnared into Mr Walsh’s serious criminal activity of supplying methylamphetamine in very large quantities indeed. 
     
      
    11 The two offences that are before me are offences of some degree of a highly technical nature. They would not have been committed without the involvement by the offender with Mr Walsh. One of them occurred when he was working for Mr Walsh. The other occurred shortly after he left Mr Walsh’s employment. 
     
      
    12 The offences cannot even be described as opportunistic because the opportunity that was taken to commit the offence did not come from the offender.  
     
      
    13 Both offences arise from the fact that Mr Walsh used to obtain his source of methylamphetamine from a man in northern New South Wales, another member of the Nomads motor cycle club who, if not the producer of the drug was very close to the person who was. Mr Walsh had to, from time to time, have somebody go to northern New South Wales to obtain the drug and bring it back to Sydney where Melinda Love would mix the drug with dextrose and ultimately put it on its way to distribution. 
     
      
    14 There have been a number of persons before me who have become ensnared, as it were, in these trips to northern New South Wales. So far there has not been a conviction in respect of their participation in Mr Walsh’s conduct, principally because the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were aware that Mr Walsh was obtaining drugs on those trips, rather than simply carrying out business associated with the Nomads motor cycle club. I think it is highly significant, particularly now having seen a number of persons being acquitted by a jury, that the activity in which the offender was engaged, that the offender has maintained his pleas of guilty. I take the pleas of guilty as a sign of contrition and acceptance of his criminal responsibility, such as it is, and give full weight to it. 
     
      
    15 There is an agreed statement of facts. It is unnecessary for me to read it onto the record. I will have it as an annexure to the sentencing remarks. It is enough to indicate that in respect of the first of the offences on the indictment the offender became involved in part of Mr Walsh’s drug enterprise when Mr Walsh took an opportunity, when he was in Queensland, to have his wife, Ms Love, obtain some drug and to mix it with dextrose and to bring it back to Newcastle. 
     
      
    16 In order to save Walsh and Love from coming back to Newcastle with the drug and it then being distributed, Walsh formed the view that it would be preferable for one of his associates to travel from Newcastle to northern New South Wales with Melinda Love’s equipment so that the drug could be obtained from its source and immediately the distribution process could take place. 
     
      
    17 The offender, I have no doubt, simply because of his employment with Mr Walsh, was brought into the activity which was being conducted by Mr Chapman, one of the persons who also was an associate and at one stage worked for Mr Walsh, and accompanied Chapman from Newcastle to the source of the drug, was present while Melinda Love cut the drug down with dextrose and accompanied Mr Chapman when he brought the cut down drug back to Newcastle for distribution. 
     
      
    18 There is no suggestion whatsoever, apart from the fact that the offender accompanied Mr Chapman and that at one stage on the way back drove the motor vehicle, that he was otherwise engaged in the supply of that amount of drug. That being the case, his criminality in respect of that matter is at the very lowest end of the scale. 
     
      
    19 The second matter is even more of a case of mischance so far as the offender is concerned. Mr Walsh, for some reason best known to him, would never make a trip to northern New South Wales to pick up the drug without being accompanied by some other person. That is so even though Mr Walsh may have driven all the way there and back again and that the person who accompanied him had little part to play, apart from keeping Mr Walsh company and doing his bidding, such as obtaining petrol, or a drink, or lighting a cigarette, or changing the radio station for him. 
     
      
    20 Mr Walsh on this occasion sought to find some person to accompany him and initially sought the assistance of Ms Chapman, a person who worked for Melinda Love in cleaning the house. She was also involved in the supply of methylamphetamine on a very minor basis in that she was used to test the purity of the drug once Melinda Love would cut it with dextrose. She was referred to as a rabbit. 
     
      
    21 Ms Chapman at that stage was working for the police. She was not only relaying information to the police as to what was happening but on occasions she participated in a controlled purchase of the drug and also wore a listening device. 
     
      
    22 Ms Chapman refused to accompany Mr Walsh to obtain the drug, notwithstanding that Walsh tried to badger her into accompanying him on this occasion. When she refused to go, Mr Walsh decided to contact the offender who, by that stage, was no longer working for him and on this particular occasion just happened to be working at Karuah, a town through which Mr Walsh would have to pass on his way north. 
     
      
    23 For some reason or other, probably because the offender hoped to obtain some amphetamine himself free of charge, he agreed to accompany Walsh and Walsh picked him up from Karuah and took him north. When they arrived at the source of the drug, the offender was present when Walsh obtained some one pound of drug and secreted it in the motor vehicle. Fortunately for the offender and Mr Walsh, and fortunately for the community, the police determined that that was the occasion to swoop and arrest Walsh. Unfortunately for the offender, he happened to be present on that particular occasion and was also arrested. 
     
      
    24 The Crown accepts that the only participation by this offender in this act of obtaining a large amount of methylamphetamine was to accompany Walsh knowing that if he did not, Walsh would not go to collect the drug unless he found some other person to do it. Again, in my view the criminality of the offender is right at the very lowest point on the offences of this kind. That is not to say that these offences are not serious. The offender knew that he, by these acts, was assisting Walsh in his business of distributing methylamphetamine in the community and that was, in itself, a significant act of criminality. 
     
      
    25 The offender was sentenced in the Local Court on 11 April 2003, having been convicted by that court of two counts of stealing a motor vehicle. As I understand it, these two offences arose from the fact that the offender assisted Walsh in some way in stealing those motor vehicles and, as I understand it, spray painting at least one of them in order to disguise its appearance. The magistrate sentenced the offender to a total sentence of two and a half years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen months but ordered that the sentence be carried out by way of periodic detention. That sentence, in total, expires on 23 October 2005 and the non-parole period expires on 23 April 2005. 
     
      
    26 There is a valid argument in my view for assessing the matters before the magistrate as indicating more criminality than the offences before me. That is because, as I understand it, the offender’s conduct was more seriously involved in that criminal activity than the one before me. On the other hand, as serious as that may be, to steal motor vehicles from the community, in particular motor vehicles of the nature which Mr Walsh was stealing, is a serious matter. It pales into insignificance in respect of the charges that are contained on the indictment before me, if one simply has regard to the maximum penalties of the offences. It is unfortunate to some degree that the offender has been sentenced by two different courts for activities which, although different, arise from the same set of circumstances, that is, the offender’s involvement with the man Walsh. 
     
      
    27 There is an overwhelming subjective case and for the present it is unnecessary to give the details of it, or to indicate why it is that the sentence I am about to impose is appropriate. 
     
      
    28 The offender had a very unfortunate upbringing indeed. There were a number of tragedies in the family which had sought to make a home in Australia as a result of problems in Serbia. There was a death of a brother, followed closely by the death of the mother, the family fell apart and the offender has had no contact with his father for some period of time. Luckily, the family was able to stay together to some degree and the offender has been supported throughout his present ordeals by members of his family, who have supported him to the extent of providing considerable bail for him. 
     
      
    29 The offender was married when he was aged twenty and has three children ranging in age from eleven, being the eldest, to three years. There has been a break-up in the marriage, at least of a temporary nature, which the offender sees as being the result of his involvement with amphetamines, increasingly so through his relationship with Walsh. However, the offender maintains a close contact with his wife and children, although they are not living together at the present time. Perhaps sensibly, they have decided to put on hold considerations of what they should do in relation to their marriage until the criminal proceedings against the offender have been finalised and he is aware of what will be required of him by way of punishment. It is hoped, at least by the offender, that when these matters are finally settled they will be able to resume eventually their marriage relationship and again become a family as they were before the troubles began. 
     
      
    30 There is no doubt that the offender is not only a hard working man in his work as a spray painter but a highly talented one and a very valued employee. There is a letter to that effect from his current employer. It also seems that as part of the service of his sentence of periodic detention he, having entered into Stage 2, has become involved in a community project and has a glowing reference from the person with whom he has been undertaking his community work as part of his sentence. 
     
      
    31 Such is the nature of the offender that the Probation and Parole Service believe that it is unlikely that he could benefit from supervision because there is simply no underlying issue that needs to be addressed in order to have the offender rehabilitated. It seems to me quite plainly that his rehabilitation was assured as from the date that Walsh was arrested and placed into custody and could no longer influence him or those in the community who came into contact with him. 
     
      
    32 The Crown has tendered material to me which, besides the summary of facts, contains some submissions on sentence. Those submissions point out the objective circumstances, the matters of aggravation and the matters of mitigation under s 21A but again it seems to me that these matters are so obvious that it is unnecessary to detail them. 
     
      
    33 On the one hand, Mr Walsh’s activity was highly criminal. The drug in respect of which he was arrested on the second count was of a high level of purity, a pound of methylamphetamine, worth a substantial sum of money in itself but worth a more considerable sum of money once Melinda Love had got to work on it and it was distributed in the community. 
     
      
    34 On the other hand, as I have attempted to indicate, if one stands back and looks at the actual criminal responsibility for the offence, it is very slight indeed. There is no suggestion at all that the offender was otherwise part of Mr Walsh’s drug enterprise. There is no suggestion that he was to receive any financial benefit at all and it is likely that he was motivated to act as he did on the spur of the moment simply because of his association with Walsh and because he hoped to get a small amount of methylamphetamine as a result. 
     
      
    35 As I have already indicated, his rehabilitation has already taken place. There is absolutely no likelihood of him re-offending, certainly in a serious way, and in my view the rehabilitation of the offender is not a matter for the court’s concern. 
     
      
    36 I have been somewhat troubled by what I should do about the matter, to some extent because of the way the offender has come to be sentenced. However, I have determined that a sentence of imprisonment is necessary, at least for the purposes of general deterrence which is very high indeed in a case such as this so that other persons in the community, for whatever reason, will not be minded to involve themselves in any way, even in the most menial way, in the enterprise of drug trafficking in this State. 
     
      
    37 However, it seems to me that I must take into account the sentences which have been imposed by the magistrate because, as I have endeavoured to indicate, although they are separate acts of criminality, they arise from the same circumstances that gave rise to the present offences. 
     
      
    38 Although a gaol sentence is necessary, it seems to me that again I could give him a sentence of very significant leniency and order that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. It should be obvious by now that the sentence that I am about to impose, and particularly the fact that I am ordering that it be served by way of periodic detention, is a very exceptional sentence in respect of a very exceptional case of offences of this kind. 
     
      
    39 I have indicated to the Crown and counsel appearing for the offender what I intended to do. That was not simply so that I could get acknowledgment by counsel that it was appropriate punishment and to enable them to have the opportunity, or at least for the Crown to have the opportunity to indicate his objection to the sentences as being appropriate punishment for the offences, but also to ensure that I have the power to do what I am about to do. 
     
      
    40 Because, in my view, the offender’s rehabilitation has occurred and there is no likelihood of re-offending and no work for the Probation and Parole Service to do, there is no point at all in a non-parole period being fixed. In my view the appropriate sentence now to be imposed is one which takes into account the totality of his criminality, as I have indicated, in particular, in the matters dealt with by the magistrate. 
     
      
    41 In respect of the first count on the indictment, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two years to be served by way of a fixed term dating from 21 May 2004 and expiring on 20 May 2006. That sentence is to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    42 In respect of the second count on the indictment that I consider to be the less serious one, the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of five months. That sentence is to commence on 21 May 2006 or a date close to that on which he is to attend for periodic detention and is to expire on 25 October 2006 or thereabouts. 
     
      
    43 It is my intention by making these orders that for the whole of the offender’s criminality derived from his association with Mr Walsh, he should serve a sentence of imprisonment of three years and six months. That sentence is to date from 11 April 2003, the date upon which he was sentenced by the magistrate; that there should be no non-parole period. 
     
      
    44 It should be borne in mind in this particular case that that sentence is a severe one in one way because the offender works five days a week. He is deprived by reason of his sentence of imprisonment from seeing his children on the weekends and participating in their daily lives. For example, he has no ability to see his son play soccer - something other fathers would in the community. One has to take into account that deprivation when considering the sentence that has been imposed upon him. It will, for a period of three and a half years, deny him the normal enjoyments of a member of the community on weekends in relation to his family. 
     
      
    45 The offender spent a period of about five months on remand before being granted bail in respect of this matter and presumably the other charges which were dealt with by the magistrate. For a person of really no prior convictions or no relevant prior convictions and with the nature of the person that is presented from the pre-sentence report and other material, that would have been a very significant sentence indeed. That is a matter clearly that I have taken into account as I am required to do by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    46 I also should indicate that I was conscious of the fact that if I sentenced the offender to a period of full time incarceration, the result would be that the sentence imposed by the magistrate would be converted into a full time custodial sentence, which would have been overly harsh having regard to the fact that it was being converted simply because I thought it was appropriate to sentence the offender to a relatively short period of imprisonment. That would have been a consequence which, in my view, would have made the sentence overly harsh having regard to his criminality in the particular matters before me. 
     
      
       
      He will no doubt continue at the periodic detention centre to which he is currently attending, or such other centre as the authorities might indicate to him and no doubt they will determine the appropriate date for the commencement of these sentences and their expiration in light of the requirements of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      .

      R v Robert ZDRAVKOVIC 
       
       
       SUMMARY OF FACTS 
       
       
      The Crown alleges that in about 1995 Richard Walsh joined the Newcastle Chapter of the Nomad Outlaw Motor Cycle Club. At this time Walsh and Melinda Love, his defacto wife, were living at Wallsend and Walsh worked in the concreting business. From about 1997 Walsh and Love were involved in acquiring and supplying methylamphetamine in the Newcastle area. Walsh obtained large quantities of “pure” amphetamine directly from his contacts in Queensland. 
       
       
      In March 1998 Walsh and Love purchased a house at 9 Tukkara Place, Maryland. Walsh distanced himself from the day-to-day sale of methylamphetamine requiring Love to carry out those activities. However, Walsh continued to arrange the bulk supplies. It was also at about this time that Walsh met Paul and Anne Chapman. Both were heavy users of methylamphetamine. Walsh used Paul Chapman both as a drug courier and also to steal vehicles and other items that he wanted. Anne Chapman was employed to clean Walsh and Love’s home, initially one day a week and later on a daily basis. Both were used to test the quality of methylamphetamine after it was received by Walsh and Love. This was to ensure that consistency of quality was maintained. 
       
       
      Walsh organised for the pure methylamphetamine to be either delivered by Club members or he (Walsh) sent Paul Chapman or others to collect it from Queensland. 
       
       
      In October 2000 Walsh and Love had planned to travel to the Gold Coast for the Indy car races. Walsh was going with other gang members as part of an official club run. Love was to travel separately in a rented car. Love arranged for a second car to be hired for Chapman and he was told he could take his wife and their children along as well. The Chapmans agreed. They travelled in a second vehicle and spent several days on the Gold Coast holidaying in accommodation booked for them by Love 
       
       
      When the races were over, the Chapman family set off to return to Newcastle. After they left, Walsh arrived at the Park Royal Hotel, the Nomad’s Club run having concluded. He met with Melinda Love and they discussed the shortage of methylamphetamine in Newcastle. Walsh then left the Hotel and drove to a location (Terranora) where he collected a package of pure methylamphetamine from Todd Little. He returned to the Hotel with this package and placed it in a safe in the room occupied by Love and himself. 
       
       
      At about this point in time, Paul Chapman, still en route to Newcastle, received a telephone call from Walsh. Walsh asked him, once he’d dropped his family off at home, to return to the Gold Coast. Chapman agreed. He was told that before leaving on the return trip, he was to go to the Walsh residence and collect all “the stuff Melinda uses” along with Robert Zdravkovic. (Zdravkovic had been house sitting for Walsh and Love in their absence). Chapman then went and collected all the mixing equipment and then, along with Zdravkovic, set off for the Gold Coast. 
       
       
      During the trip Chapman swapped the driving role with Zdravkovic, who attracted the attention of a passing police car, driven by Senior Constable McCormack. Zdravkovic was stopped and issued with a speeding ticket. The police noticed the laundry tub, scales, sieves and dextrose in the back seat area. Although suspicious, they accepted Chapman’s explanation that it was his wife’s cooking gear and allowed the pair to continue their journey. The Traffic Infringement notice was issued to Zdravkovic at Telegraph Point on 17 October 2000. 
       
       
      At the Gold Coast Chapman and Zdravkovic met Walsh at the Park Royal Hotel. They delivered the mixing equipment. Both were present when Love removed a bag of pure methylamphetamine from the safe. She then mixed a small sample and gave it to Chapman to test. He went into the bathroom and self administered it before reporting his opinion of the drug’s quality to Walsh. Walsh then told Love to prepare about two pounds of cut methylamphetamine. Love took about 20 minutes to mix and package this quantity, watched throughout by all present. Once the packages of methylamphetamine were ready, they were handed to Chapman and he and Zdravkovic immediately set off on the return journey to Newcastle. 
       
       
      Upon reaching Newcastle, Chapman dropped Zdravkovic off and then delivered three of the packages to persons in the Newcastle area. 
       
       
      From 13 June 2001, all trips to Queensland by Walsh were the subject of Police surveillance. 
       
       
      On Sunday 23 September 2001 at 7.08 am Walsh left his home in Mayfield, driving his black Toyota Hilux ute, registered number UZQ-406. Attached to the vehicle was a trailer containing a motor tricycle for delivery to Todd Little in Queensland. A second tricycle was secured in the rear tray of the utility and that also was to be unloaded at Little’s. Shortly afterwards Walsh picked up Zdravkovic. 
       
       
      At 9.12 pm that evening, Walsh and Zdravkovic arrived at Little’s house at 8 Rock Road, Terranora. Shortly after arrival, Walsh entered the house with Little, leaving Zdravkovic with the Hilux. Zdravkovic had begun to unload the bikes when he was rejoined by Little, Walsh and Cherie Hall. After unloading the tricycles, Walsh, Little and Hall re-entered the house leaving Zdravkovic outside. Three minutes later Walsh and Little reappeared and all three men approached the driver’s side of the Hilux. Whilst Zdravkovic and Little remained standing, Walsh opened the driver’s door and secreted a pound of methylamphetamine inside the door. There were some further comings and goings before at 10.14 am Walsh and Zdravkovic re-entered the Hilux and drove away. The visit to Little lasted 62 minutes. 
       
       
      Police stopped Walsh’s vehicle beside the Pacific Highway at Murwillumbah sixteen (16) minutes later at 10.30 pm. A search of the vehicle was conducted and a package of methylamphetamine stuffed into a motorcycle glove, was found in the cavity behind the driver’s door panel. It was weighed shortly afterwards at 510 grams gross. Upon analysis it proved to be methylamphetamine. A matching glove was found elsewhere in the vehicle. Zdravkovic was found in possession of a small amount of methylamphetamine. Both men were arrested. 
       
       
      As a result of evidence arising from Listening Devices and other sources, it was apparent to police that Walsh did not like making any journey to Queensland alone. In respect of the trip on 23 September 2001, it seems that Zdravkovic was taken along for “company”. It was suspected that Zdravkovic was addicted to speed at the time and would probably accede to any request if he thought free speed was involved. Apart from the possibility of obtaining speed for his own use, it does not appear he stood to gain in any other way from either trip (i.e. 17.10.00 or 23.9.01).

     ATTORNEY-GENERAL v Matthew CURRAN 
     
     
      
     
     
     
      
    On 8 November 2002, the respondent was convicted of an offence pursuant to s61M of the Crimes Act 1900, namely, assaulting an eleven year-old girl and at the time of the assault committing an act of indecency on her, namely licking her breasts. This assault occurred in circumstances of aggravation in that at the time of the offence the victim was under sixteen years old.The respondent appealed this conviction to the District Court and on 27 February 2003, the trial Judge, although finding the facts of the assault proved, allowed the appeal and dismissed the charge on the grounds that, by reason of his self-induced intoxication, her Honour was not satisfied that the respondent had formed an intention to commit the offence charged.On 15 April 2004, over thirteen months later, Judge Morgan stated a case pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, at the request of the Attorney-General, submitting for determination to this Court the question as to whether her Honour erred in taking into account, in considering mens rea for the offence, the self-induced intoxication of the respondent.  
     
      
    Section 5B(2) provides that a question of law, “must be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow.” The appellant therefore sought an indulgence on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant an extension of time and entertain the stated case. Counsel for the respondent opposed an extension of time for the submission of the question of law.Held: per Sheller JA, Sperling and Adams JJ agreeing: 
     
      
    1. The grant of an extension of time under s5B is not automatic and the discretion to do so is to ensure that fixed times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice. This involves a consideration, amongst other things, of the conduct of the parties, the consequences of the grant or refusal of an extension of time and the prospects of success of the proceedings. 
     
      
    2. On the material before the Court, the prospects of the question of law being answered in a way which would favour the prosecution are good, particularly in light of s428D of the Crimes Act, and there is a likelihood that the order of the trial Judge worked an injustice in that the appellant was wrongly acquitted. 
     
      
    3. The Counsel appearing for the DPP or informant before Justice Morgan made no reference to s428D of the Crimes Act.  Thus the informant or DPP, although no doubt unwittingly, played a significant part in the injustice occurring. There is no evidence, which indicated when it was first realised amongst those responsible for the prosecution that there had been this oversight.  
     
      
    4. The thirteen-month delay in requesting the stated case is largely unexplained. There is no sign of any attempt to expedite the various representations and advices until the matter came before the Crown Advocate. 
     
      
    5. The Court does not accept that the applicant was not prejudiced by the delay. The respondent, on 27 February 2003, would have rightly regarded himself as acquitted of the charge and nothing happened until January 2004 to suggest to the respondent that an extension of time was to be sought by the DPP.6. The responsibility was placed on the prosecutor to move with expedition to ensure that the legislative time limit was met. It would be a travesty of justice to grant an extension which would excuse the time that had elapsed in this case which, in part, was unexplained. 
     
      
    7. In any event, the Attorney-General had no standing for procedural reasons to request a stated case because there was no evidence of the Director of Public Prosecutions taking over the proceedings in the District Court from the informant.

     ATTORNEY-GENERAL v Matthew CURRAN 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: On 8 November 2002 Matthew Curran was convicted by the Local Court at Blacktown of an offence pursuant to s61M of the Crimes Act 1900, namely, that on 5 May 2002 at Blacktown he assaulted an 11 year old girl and at the time of the assault committed an act of indecency on her “to wit, licked breasts”. This offence was committed in circumstances of aggravation in that at the time of the offence she was under the age of 16 years.  
     
      
    2 Mr Curran forthwith lodged an appeal to the District Court. On 27 February 2003 her Honour Judge Morgan upheld his appeal. Her Honour found the facts of the indecent assault and the circumstances of aggravation proved but also found that the appellant was extremely intoxicated as a result of his having consumed intoxicating liquor and that his intoxication was self-induced. For reason that because of his self-induced intoxication her Honour was not satisfied that the appellant had formed an intention to commit the assault charged, she allowed the appeal, dismissed the charge and quashed the order of the Local Court. 
     
      
    3 During the appeal, s428D of the Crimes Act was not brought to the attention of the judge. That section provides, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “In determining whether a person has the mens rea for an offence other than an offence of specific intent, evidence that a person was intoxicated at the time of the relevant conduct: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) if the intoxication was self-induced – cannot be taken into account …” 
        
       
      
    4 Section 428B (1) defines “an offence of specific intent” as an offence of which an intention to cause a specific result is an element. Subsection (2) provides that without limiting the generality of subsection (1) the offences referred to in a table, which follows in the section, are examples of offences of specific intent. The offence with which the appellant was charged is not referred to in the table. For present purposes, I assume, without deciding it that the offence with which the appellant was charged was “other than an offence of specific intent”.  
     
      
    5 On 15 April 2004, that is to say, over thirteen months after Judge Morgan quashed the order of the Local Court, her Honour stated a case pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 at the request of the Attorney-General submitting for the determination of this Court the question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Did I err in taking into account the self-induced intoxication of Matthew Curran in considering whether or not he had the mens rea for the offence with which he was charged?” 
        
       
      
    6 Section 5B(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that a judge of the District Court may submit “any question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit.” Subsection (2) provides that at the request of a person “who was a party to appeal proceedings referred to in subsection (1),” a question of law may be submitted under that subsection to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination even though the appeal proceedings during which the question arose have been disposed of. “The question of law must be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings, or within such longer period as the Court of Criminal Appeal may allow.” 
     
      
    7 Jurisdiction for this Court to entertain the request depends upon the Court allowing the question of law to be submitted after the 28 day period. I turn to consider this question. 
     
      
    8 In claiming this indulgence, the Attorney-General relied upon two affidavits made by James Alexander Shevlin of 30 June and 5 July 2004 respectively. These were read without objection. In his first affidavit Mr Shevlin says that subject to the supervision of the Crown Solicitor, he is the solicitor who has carriage of the matter for the Attorney-General. I summarise the essence of what follows. After Judge Morgan made her order, apparently nothing of note took place until nearly two months later when on 24 April 2003 the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) received representations on behalf of the victim of the offence. A report was requested from the solicitor who prosecuted the matter. This report was provided on 23 May 2003. Consequently, on that date, staff more senior than the solicitor who appeared before Judge Morgan reviewed her Honour’s judgment. On 10 June 2003 the DPP considered whether or not to initiate proceedings under s5B and decided not to do so. 
     
      
    9 In about May 2003 for the first time the matter came to the attention of the Attorney-General and at some time unspecified representations were sent to the DPP which were answered. Further representations were received by the DPP on 28 August 2003 to which the DPP responded on 22 September 2003. Over two months passed and on 8 December 2003 the Attorney-General requested the advice of the Crown Advocate which was promptly provided on 9 December 2003. Further advice was furnished, again promptly, on 15 December 2003. On 13 January 2004 the DPP requested the Attorney-General, pursuant to s29 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986, to consider the exercise of the Attorney-General’s corresponding function in relation to the matter. On that same day the Attorney-General determined that he would request Judge Morgan to state a case pursuant to s5B of the Criminal Appeal Act. Also on 13 January 2004, the Attorney-General retained the Crown Solicitor to act for him in the matter and on 14 January 2004 the carriage of the matter was assigned to Mr Shevlin. 
     
      
    10 I note in passing that s29 enables the DPP, if the DPP considers it desirable in the interests of justice that the DPP should not exercise certain functions in relation to a particular case, to request the Attorney-General to exercise the Attorney-General’s corresponding functions.  
     
      
    11 From that time on, steps were taken expeditiously to obtain a stated case from Judge Morgan. On 26 February 2004 Mr Shevlin contacted Judge Morgan, who was then presiding at the Coffs Harbour District Court, and an appointment was made to attend in her Honour’s chambers at the Downing Centre on 1 March 2004. However, there were problems in making contact with Mr Curran, which resulted in the cancellation of that appointment. On 24 March 2004 Mr Shevlin wrote to the Registrar of the District Court advising of the Crown Solicitor’s instructions and sending a copy of a draft stated case. Some communication then took place between Mr Shevlin and Mr Curran’s solicitor. In early April Mr Shevlin attempted unsuccessfully on more than one occasion to contact Judge Morgan but was inhibited by damage that had been done to the telephone lines at the Coffs Harbour District Court. For various reasons, not the fault of the Crown Solicitor, there was some delay in the draft stated case being sent or received by Judge Morgan. On 13 April 2004 Mr Shevlin attended at the Downing Centre and obtained the draft stated case from the Associate to her Honour but there was further delay of an administrative kind before eventually, on 15 April 2004, the stated case was signed and filed in the Registry. Thereafter, it was listed for mention in this Court on 3 May 2004. 
     
      
    12 Counsel for Mr Curran opposed an extension of time for the submission of the question of law.  
     
      
    13 In Gallo v Dawson (1990) 64 ALJR 458 McHugh J considered an application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal against an order dismissing an action brought in the original jurisdiction of the Court. His Honour accepted that the appeal was one of right but that a notice of appeal had to be lodged within 21 days of the judgment appealed against. His Honour continued at 459: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, the present application was made over 16 months out of time. However, the applicant relied on the provisions of O 60, r 6 to support her application. That rule provides that the Court of a Justice may enlarge the time appointed by the Rules for doing an act upon such terms, if any, as the justice of the case may require and that the enlargement may be ordered although the application is not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or fixed for doing the act. The grant of an extension of time under this rule is not automatic. The object of the rule is to ensure that those Rules which fix times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice. The discretion to extend time is given for the sole purpose of enabling the Court or Justice to do justice between the parties: see  
        Hughes v National Trustees Executors & Agency Co of Australasia Ltd 
         [1978] VR 257 at 262. This means that the discretion can only be exercised in favour of an applicant upon proof that strict compliance with the rules will work an injustice upon the applicant. In order to determine whether the rules will work an injustice, it is necessary to have regard to the history of the proceedings, the conduct of the parties, the nature of the litigation, and the consequences for the parties of the grant or refusal of the application for extension of time: see  
        Avery v No 2 Public Service Appeal Board 
         [1973] 2 NZLR 86 at 92;  
        Jess v Scott 
         (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 194-195. When the application is for an extension of time in which to file an appeal, it is always necessary to consider the prospects of the applicant succeeding in the appeal: see  
        Burns v Grigg 
         [1967] VR 871 at 872;  
        Hughes, at 263-264; Mitchelson v Mitchelson  
        (1979) 24 ALR 522 at 524. It is also necessary to bear in mind in such an application that, upon the expiry of the time for appealing, the respondent has ‘a vested right to retain the judgment’ unless the application is granted:  
        Vilenius v Heinegar  
        (1962) 36 ALJR 200 at 201. It follows that, before the applicant can succeed in this application, there must be material upon which I can be satisfied that to refuse the application would constitute an injustice. As the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council pointed out in  
        Ratnam v Cumarasamy 
         [1965] 1 WLR 8 at 12; [1964] 3 All ER 933 at 935: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed, and in order to justify a court in extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be taken there must be some material upon which the court can exercise its discretion.’ “ 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 The grant of an extension under s5B is not automatic and the discretion to do so is to ensure that fixed times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice in this case. The question is whether the time limitation will work an injustice. This requires, amongst other things, considering the conduct of the parties and the consequences of the grant or refusal of the extension. Also relevant are the prospects of success of the proceedings if time is extended. 
     
      
    15 For present purposes, I am prepared to accept, on the material before us, that the prospects of the question being answered in a way which would favour the prosecution are good. This being so, it is no doubt true to say that the likelihood is that the order of Judge Morgan worked an injustice in that Mr Curran was wrongly acquitted. As against that, at the expiry of the 28 days, Mr Curran had a vested right to retain the judgment unless the application to extend is granted. 
     
      
    16 It is plain from the terms of the stated case that counsel appearing for the informant or DPP before Judge Morgan made no reference to s428D of the Crimes Act. Thus, no doubt unwittingly, and such mistakes can happen, the informant or DPP played a significant part in the injustice occurring. There is no evidence which indicates when first it was realised amongst those responsible for the prosecution that there had been this oversight. It is not known whether the section was brought to the attention of the Local Court. Nor are we informed for what reason the DPP decided not to request a case stated. However, I would assume that by this time the error had been recognised.  
     
      
    17 The case came to the attention of the Attorney-General in or about May 2003. By 10 June 2003 it must have been realised that the DPP had decided not to initiate proceedings under s5B and that, if initiated, an extension of time of at least three or four months would be required.  
     
      
    18 There followed a period of about six months taken up with representations and requests for advice. But, it must by the beginning of that period have been glaringly obvious what the alleged error was and that such delay could not be justified. There is no sign of any attempt to expedite the various representations and advices until the matter came to the attention of the Crown Advocate. The delay is largely unexplained. 
     
      
    19 The Attorney-General submitted that the appellant was not prejudiced by delay. I do not accept this. I surmise that on advice the appellant on 27 February 2003 would have rightly regarded himself as acquitted of the charge. He may have been advised that the DPP might request a case to be stated but that that would have to be filed within 28 days. It may be that it was pointed out to him that the DPP could seek an extension of time if justified. However, so far as Mr Curran was concerned, nothing happened to suggest that any such extension was, in fact, to be sought. Apparently the first attempt to communicate with Mr Curran was on 20 January 2004. In my opinion, it would only be in the most exceptional case that an extension of time of the sort currently requested, namely over a year, could be justified.20 The following matters need to be remembered. First, the informant or DPP was party to the mistake that Judge Morgan made. Second, the decision in this case, if favourable on the question of law submitted, would not settle any question of general public importance. It is directed solely against the acquittal of Mr Curran. Next, we are told that on conviction the Local Court imposed a penalty by way of a bond with conditions. We are also told that on conviction Mr Curran could be liable to non-association and place restriction orders or conditions; see generally the Justice Legislation Amendment (Non-association and Place Restriction) Act 2001.  
     
      
    21 The charge against Mr Curran was a very serious one and I can well understand the victim’s concern about the appeal being upheld. Anybody familiar with the terms of s428D may well immediately have recognised that an injustice had probably been done. But the responsibility is placed on the prosecutor taking account of these matters, to move with expedition to ensure that the legislative time limit of 28 days was met. While some indulgence can be given in particular circumstances which would allow extension for a short or reasonable period of time, particularly if sought before the expiry of the 28 days, in this case it would be a travesty of justice to grant an extension which would excuse the time that had elapsed in this case which in part was unexplained. 
     
      
    22 At the conclusion of the argument on behalf of the Crown, it became apparent that in any event the Attorney-General had no standing for procedural reasons to request a stated case. His standing depended upon the DPP having taken over the proceedings in the District Court from the informant. There was no evidence that the DPP did this and in particular the Attorney-General acknowledged that no notice in writing so informing the Court under s10 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act  had been given to the Court. 
     
      
    23 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Extension of the time for filing the stated case is refused; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Accordingly, the Court refuses to answer the question of law submitted because the question was submitted out of time.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
      (Note: The  
      Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
       s 11 prohibits the publication of the name of the prisoner and any other person mentioned in the proceedings who was under 18 at the time of the events referred to, including the deceased). 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 27 February last at Dubbo, the prisoner was found guilty by a jury of murdering his 15 year old girlfriend at Bourke on 26 December 2002. The prisoner was then aged 17 years and he and the deceased had been in a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship for approximately four years. 
     
      
    2 The relationship was marked by violence on the part of the prisoner towards the deceased, and there were a number of incidents in the days leading up to her death when she suffered injuries of varying severity at his hands. He has not been charged or convicted of these other assaults, and is not to be punished for them, so I refer to them only to explain the background against which the deceased met her death. The prisoner also appears to have been very possessive of the deceased and jealous of her associating with other persons, particularly members of the opposite sex. 
     
      
    3 About a week before Christmas, on 19 December, the prisoner hit the deceased across the top of her head with an iron bar necessitating her going to the hospital where her wounds were sutured. About this time the deceased claimed to some of her friends that she had caught the prisoner being intimate with another girl, C.E. 
     
      
    4 Late on the evening of 24 December or very early on the morning of 25 December, the deceased and the prisoner had a confrontation in relation to this matter and the prisoner accused the deceased of “talking to” another man (his words – T 902). The upshot of all this was that he hit her with his fists or a backhand resulting in an injury to her lip and re-opening of the sutured wound at the back of her head from the previous week. 
     
      
    5 She returned to her parents’ home at 9 Oxley Street crying where she begged her mother “not to let him hit her again”. Shortly afterwards, the prisoner appeared and abused the deceased calling her “a slut and a dog” and threatening to kill her. Following this, about 2:30am, the deceased and others including her mother went to Bourke Police Station to report the assault. The deceased was taken to Bourke Hospital for treatment of her injuries and after treatment, she was taken to a women’s refuge to sleep. 
     
      
    6 On the evening of 25 December, the deceased was at a party at 21 Anson Street, Bourke when the prisoner approached her, dragged her by her hair off the veranda where she was dancing, and punched and kicked her, tearing the singlet top she was wearing. At this stage, the deceased was upset and crying. Atholone Edwards, an aunt of the deceased, told her to go out and go with her bloke (the prisoner) but the deceased replied, “No Atholone, he’s going to kill me”, and made reference to the prisoner being with another woman. Atholone Edwards brushed it off. Other persons intervened and the prisoner was told to leave which he did, but whilst there, he said he was going to kill the deceased. Earlier that evening he had said to Melinda Edwards “She’s going to get it tonight” referring to the deceased. Whilst at 21 Anson Street, he was struck to the head by Brian Smith. 
     
      
    7 Later on Christmas night or in the early hours of Boxing Day, the deceased was at a bonfire in Adelaide Street in the company of Anthony Edwards (known as “Gundy”). The deceased and Edwards started to walk away from the bonfire together, and at this time the prisoner approached the deceased and assaulted her by attempting to drag her away by the hair and arm. Edwards intervened and punched the prisoner to the face. After leaving the area, the prisoner met up with Jamie Snelson, who noted that he had a cut under his left eye and was visibly upset. He said words to the effect of “Gundy can have her”. 8 After his altercation with the prisoner, Anthony Edwards and the deceased walked to the Alice Edwards Village, an Aboriginal reserve approximately 2kms from the main township and at about 3am, they attended a party at Lillian Booth’s flat in that village. The deceased told Lillian Booth that the prisoner had been with C.E. and she did not want him anymore. Whilst they were there, the prisoner appeared and approached the deceased, pulled her by the hair off the chair on which she was sitting, and whilst she was on the ground, kicked her to the head and body. The deceased broke free from the prisoner at some point and ran to Lillian Booth, to whom she clung and pleaded with her not to let the prisoner take her away. Anthony Edwards and Lillian Booth walked with the deceased and the prisoner away from the others at the party in an attempt to calm the situation. Lillian Booth asked the deceased what was going on and whom she wanted, to which she replied that she did not want the prisoner and was going with Gundy that night. After some time, Anthony Edwards returned to the party alone and was later followed by Lillian Booth, who left the deceased and the prisoner to talk. At one stage during the confrontation, Lillian Booth said to the prisoner, “You’ll end up killing her”. 
     
      
    9 About 4am that morning (i.e. 26 December), the deceased and the prisoner walked through the yard of cottage no. 8 at the village where they were seen by witnesses resident there. They appeared to be involved in a verbal argument, and the deceased was heard to say, “Are you going to bash me”. This was the last time the deceased was seen alive by witnesses. They were then heading towards the banks of the Darling River. 
     
      
    10 In fairness to the prisoner, I should add that both the prisoner and C.E. denied in their evidence that there had been any sexual activity between them. 
     
      
    11 The body of the deceased was found about 2pm on 26 December when its location was pointed out by the prisoner to Adam and Shaun Rice, who were in the area with their families for a day’s fishing. He had previously told them he was looking for his girlfriend and then he later came back and said he had found her and directed them to where the body was. In the meantime, commencing at about 8:50am, he had attended the home of the deceased’s parents on four separate occasions claiming to be looking for her, and at about 12:45pm had made a 000 call on a mobile phone for the Ambulance Service claiming that a young girl had drowned in the river and he gave directions. The ambulance personnel and police who attended the area described, did not find the deceased on that occasion and it was not until the prisoner indicated where he claimed he had “found her”, that anyone else was aware of her location.  
     
      
    12 The deceased’s body was lying on its right side close to and generally at right angles to the water with her legs bent at the knees. Her tracksuit pants were pulled down below her knees and her panties were just below her hip line whilst her top was pulled up to just below her breasts. She was not wearing the red bikini top bra which she had been wearing earlier in the evening and it was found three days later stuffed in a log some distance away on the riverbank. Her body was near a large fallen tree, the roots of which were located on the water’s edge with the trunk and branches extending out into to the water. Her shoes were found about 6 metres upstream of the body without their laces, with no mud on their soles, and there was no evidence of any dragging or sliding marks or shoe print impressions in the mud near the water’s edge. Around her neck was an extremely tight ligature which had caught some of her hair and it was so tight that some of the skin on the neck had folded back over it. 
     
      
    13 Later examination of the ligature established that the shoelaces from which the ligature had been made had come from the deceased’s shoes, and the following day, a piece of cord made of part of one of the same shoelaces was found wrapped around a branch of the tree which was lying horizontally into the water near where the deceased’s body had been found. The cause of death was ligature strangulation by the shoelaces.  
     
      
    14 At the time they left Lillian Booth’s premises at about 4am on Boxing Day, both the deceased and the prisoner were substantially affected by liquor. I am unable to say whether they had a further argument after that or whether, consumed with jealousy and fearful that she was going to terminate their relationship and go with Gundy, the prisoner resolved to kill her, or whether it was simply a combination of factors including his possessive attitude to the relationship and a desire to control her life, his increasing violence towards her, her accusation that he had been intimate with another girl and her decision to terminate their relationship, combined with the effects of alcohol and cannabis. 
     
      
    15 Apparently at some stage, he caught her unawares (possibly whilst she was sleeping near the riverbank) removed her shoelaces, made the ligature, and strangled her. To this extent the killing showed some deliberation and planning at least at its proximate stage and, having regard to the cause of death, I can only infer that at the time he intended to kill her. He apparently thought better of it shortly afterwards and this explains his attempts to raise the alarm during 26 December until the body was found, but in a way which would not direct suspicion at him. Notwithstanding the threats he made earlier in the night and the previous night that he was going to kill her, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time he meant them or genuinely intended to carry them out. 16 The prisoner was born on 11 April 1985, was nearly 18 at the time of the offence and now 19. He is Aboriginal and one of a large extended family but when giving birth to his younger brother, when he was about one year old, his mother suffered severe haemorrhaging and became very ill and unable to look after him. He was then placed in the care of an aunt at Engonnia where he remained until he was about 11 years of age. He has had virtually no contact with his natural father. When he was three years old, he accidentally ingested a number of “heart tablets” and became ill with childhood rheumatoid arthritis.  
     
      
    17 It appears that whilst living with his aunt, he witnessed severe physical abuse of her from her partner. He lived with his aunt until approximately 11 years of age at which stage he moved to his grandmother’s at Newcastle. Subsequently he seems to have moved around for some time but in the last 3 or 4 years he had lived mainly in Bourke but also at times in Dubbo.  
     
      
    18 According to the Juvenile Justice report, he described Bourke as “not a normal town…a lot of bad things happen there” and as examples, he explained daily life as full of violence, domestic violence, jealousy, theft, pain, hunger, drug and alcohol abuse. He was educated to Year 9 level but particularly in his latter years, he was in trouble at school mainly for smoking and truancy. Since his arrest, he has completed Year 10 in custody and is currently enrolled in Year 11. He claims to have suffered a number of head injuries caused by fighting and physical violence and he still suffers from the childhood rheumatoid arthritis, which causes severe joint pain.  
     
      
    19 He apparently began drinking alcohol at age 13 and prior to his arrest was binge drinking at least once a week and was also being a daily cannabis user, smoking up to six cones a day. He also started to use amphetamines at about age 13 on an average of once a week. He has an extensive criminal record dating back to 2000 including break enter and steal, goods in custody, assault police officer, malicious damage, steal motor vehicle, larceny, receiving, common assault, robbery in company, malicious wound and escape police custody. Of particular significance in the current context are the convictions for common assault and malicious wound. His life has been marked by personal tragedy including the death of his mother and since he went into custody for this matter the accidental drowning of his brother.  
     
      
    20 He has maintained his plea of not guilty, as he is entitled to, but since the jury’s verdict, he has expressed contrition. A letter tendered at the sentencing hearing addressed to the deceased’s family, although not sent to them included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “I also want you to know that I am sorry for the way I treated (her) – the abuse and violence. I understand that (she) would’ve been afraid of me and that I had upset her… 
        
       
       
        
        I don’t remember killing (her), but I take responsibility for her death and I blame myself for what happened. I’m very ashamed for what I’ve done.” 
        
       
      
    21 In addition to the aggravating and mitigating factors set out in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which I have taken into account, the sentencing of the prisoner poses particular problems because of his youth, his aboriginality, his lack of opportunity in life, the circumstances and atmosphere prevailing in Bourke at the time, particularly amongst parts of the aboriginal community, with its violence, drug and alcohol abuse and unemployment. On the other hand, a young woman’s life has been taken away and any undue leniency to the prisoner would tend to degrade the value of her life, which must be avoided. The life of a 15 year old aboriginal girl in Bourke is as much entitled to the protection of the law as is the life of any other citizen. 
     
      
    22 The youth and emotional immaturity of the prisoner are circumstances which generally lead to the elements of denunciation and general deterrence playing less part in the sentencing process and greater emphasis being given to considerations of rehabilitation than would otherwise be the case, although it has been said that this approach is of less relevance in cases of those who commit adult type crimes, such as murder, as explained in R v MA [2004] NSWCCA 92 at [26] to [30] and cases there cited. In the present circumstances, I consider the youth of the prisoner should result in some not excessive reduction in the head sentence, and constitutes “special circumstances” justifying a departure from the usual ratio between head sentence and non-parole period set out in s 44. He will also require a lengthy period under supervision when released on parole and such supervision should be continued throughout his parole period. 
     
      
    23 Considerations of particular relevance to the sentencing of aboriginal offenders are set out in cases such as R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 62-3. It is not necessary to repeat those principles here but I have taken them into account. As pointed out in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 the fact that a criminal offence was committed whilst affected by alcohol or drugs is not a mitigating factor, although it may tend to explain the offence.  
     
      
    24 Notwithstanding his previous offences, I believe the prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation particularly if he uses his time in prison to learn to control his anger and further his education to learn a trade, which may equip him for employment on his release. The evidence on sentence shows that he is not unintelligent and has relevant skills particularly in the fields of music and aboriginal art. In particular, I have noted the contents of Ex 6 showing his application to his studies and his second prize in the Youth Award (17-24 years) associated with Reconciliation Week 2003. He has expressed a desire to obtain employment in the area of mechanics. 
     
      
    25 Psychological testing disclosed a mild level of depression, stress and anxiety, trouble controlling anger, and a need to address drug and alcohol abuse. Mark Milic, clinical psychologist found on formal testing that he had the reading ability of year 4 primary school child (bottom 4% of the population). His score on verbal intelligence subtests was in the low average range (21st percentile) but on non-verbal scales he was in the 86th percentile. Mr Milic suggested the discrepancy could be due to learning disability, lack of educational opportunity or depressive illness. Dr Nielssen considered him quite intelligent and capable of learning, but with a need to avoid returning to the “chaotic lifestyle” he previously led. Apart from one instance of an assault on another inmate shortly after the death of his brother which caused him to be transferred to an adult gaol for three months where he met his natural father, another prisoner, for the first time, his conduct whilst in custody has been acceptable.  
     
      
    26 I am satisfied that in the light of his youth, background and disrupted education, he would benefit from remaining in the juvenile system where he will be able to access the appropriate treatment programs, psychiatric education and vocation services offered. 
     
      
    27 I have read the Victim Impact Statement from the deceased’s father and extend the Court’s sympathy to the family of the deceased. Their grief and sense of loss, although great, cannot affect the sentence of the prisoner: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. 
     
      
    28 As the offence was committed prior to 1 February 2003, s 44 applies as it stood before the 2002 amendments and the standard non-parole period provisions (ss 54A to 54D) do not apply. 
     
      
    29 M.S. for the murder of which you have been convicted, I sentence you to imprisonment for 17 years, such sentence to date from the day on which you were arrested namely 26 December 2002 and I fix a non-parole period of 11 years. The earliest date on which you will be eligible to be released on parole will be 25 December 2013. In accordance with s 19 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, I direct that until you turn 21 years, the sentence be served in a detention centre.

      70051/03 REGINA v MAO VANN 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 1 June 2004, the prisoner was arraigned and pleaded guilty to the murder of Userph Rima and the assault of Kamal Elmasri at Liverpool on 8 February 2002. He also asked that a charge of possess loaded firearm in a public place at the same date and place be taken into account pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1995. 
     
      
    2 The Crown thereupon tendered a bundle of documents described as an “Agreed Brief” including the prosecution statement of facts, a criminal history of the prisoner, a number of witness statements, the transcript of an interview with the prisoner (Ex A), 5 sets of photographs (Exs B to F) and a videotape of the crime scene with an interview at that scene with the prisoner on the day of his arrest (Ex G). All of these exhibits were admitted by consent and I was informed none of the witnesses whose statements had been tendered were required for cross-examination. The proceedings were then adjourned. 
     
      
    3 At the resumed hearing on 27 August 2004, counsel for the prisoner informed me (T 2) that “essentially” the facts were agreed but the inferences to be drawn from those facts were to an extent in dispute, and that the main issue was whether there was an intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm or merely a reckless indifference to human life. 
     
      
    4 The prisoner then gave evidence in which he attempted to minimize his culpability for the death of the deceased and to that end gave a version of the facts which was in various respects different to, and at times inconsistent with, the facts contained in the material admitted without objection in the Crown case. The Crown Prosecutor did not object to this evidence but vigorously challenged it in cross-examination and submitted that it should not be accepted.  
     
      
    5 The difficulties that can arise in sentencing proceedings following a plea of guilty when a statement of agreed facts and witness statements are tendered by consent and the defence subsequently adduces evidence inconsistent therewith have recently been discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases such as R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at [21], R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335, but it is not necessary to discuss these problems in detail as I am quite satisfied that, where inconsistent with the evidence led by the Crown, the prisoner’s evidence should not be accepted. 
     
      
    6 There are a number of reasons for this: firstly, the various exhibits in the Crown case, particularly Ex A with the Statement of Facts and the statements of witnesses were admitted without objection and the evidence of none of the witnesses was challenged by cross-examination; secondly, in various respects, the prisoner’s evidence was inconsistent with what he said in his recorded interview with police and in the video recorded “walk around”, and I consider his spontaneous responses on the day of his arrest are more likely to be reliable than responses given some 2 ½ years later, no doubt after a considerable amount of thought and re-construction; thirdly, in some respects his evidence is inconsistent with objective facts, for example, he says that after entering the theatre area the first time and returning to the car park, he was there only a very short time before he heard a commotion and returned to the theatre with the rifle, but the car park video shows a lapse of over 6 minutes; and fourthly, parts of his evidence lack credibility, such as that if he believed his friend Robert Ly was being attacked by others he would attempt to protect him by firing in the direction of his attackers, when such a course of action carried the very real risk that Ly himself could be killed or seriously injured.  
     
      
    7 In the Defence case, a report was tendered from Dr Rod Gardner, Senior Lecturer in Linguistics at the University of New South Wales. The report was objected to by the Crown but I admitted it subject to a proper curriculum vitae being provided. This has since been done.  
     
      
    8 His report was mainly directed to propounding that a number of the prisoner’s answers in his recorded interview could have meant something other than what they appeared to mean. He concluded that the prisoner speaks a non-standard variety of English which would show some differences from standard educated Australian English and may include some grammatical and lexical differences from the latter, but that he speaks English as, or very close to, a mother tongue variety. Later at p 14 of his report, he said the prisoner speaks English fluently, but does not speak a standard variety of Australian English. 
     
      
    9 Although of Cambodian background, the prisoner was born in Australia, educated here and has lived here or in New Zealand all his life. Although his family apparently spoke Khmer at home, I had the opportunity to observe his ability and proficiency in English in the witness box, and I am quite satisfied that his conversational English is in no way deficient. His answers were responsive, intelligent and showed a clear understanding of the questions. The interviews he had with police also demonstrated responsive, intelligent answers with an understanding of the questions, and I reject the submission that his answers in those interviews should be qualified or disregarded in any way. 
     
      
    10 The facts in the Crown Statement of Facts which I accept may be summarised as follows. On the evening of Friday, 8 February 2002, Userph Rima, aged 16 went to the Greater Union movie theatre at Westfield Shopping Centre at Liverpool accompanied by his girlfriend, Angelica Kourkos, his cousin, Mohammed Flaifel aged 17 and Mohammed’s girlfriend, Yolanda Moussa aged 17, where they purchased tickets and entered cinema 12 to watch the 9:15pm session of the movie, “Domestic Disturbance”. Also attending the movie that evening were Robert Ly and his female friend, Kinh Tu. Mr Ly and his friend sat in the row in front of Userph Rima and his party immediately prior to the movie commencing.  
     
      
    11 Shortly afterwards, Mr Ly’s friend dropped a mobile telephone behind her. Userph Rima saw the phone, picked it up and decided to keep it. His friend, Angelica Kourkos was aware of these matters but Mr Flaifel and Ms Moussa were not. Whilst the movie was still in progress, Mr Ly and his friend noticed that the phone was missing and a search was conducted for it, unsuccessfully. A short time later, Mr Ly left the cinema and made a phone call from his mobile phone and then returned to the cinema.  
     
      
    12 The movie finished shortly before 11pm and Mr Rima and his party left cinema 12 and went to the cinema foyer. When there, Mr Flaifel saw Robert Ly walk outside the complex and speak to a group of Asian males, Kinh Tu spoke to Userph, Angelica Kourkos and Yolanda Moussa demanding her phone back. Shortly afterwards a group of between 12 and 20 Asian males came up to Userph Rima and his friends, one of them argued with Yolanda Moussa about the phone and then punched her in the head with his fist.  
     
      
    13 Immediately after this, a number of the group of Asian males began assaulting Userph and his cousin Mohammed Flaifel, about 5 men attacking Mohammed and approximately 7 men attacking Userph. One of the Asian men hitting Userph was armed with a small baseball bat. Angelica Kourkos tried to assist and began hitting the men who were striking Userph, whereupon she was punched to the face and fell to the floor. At one point Mohammed Flaifel, in an effort to assist Userph, picked up a steel stand used to mark queues to the ticket office and threw it at some of the men attacking Userph, but the stand was heavy and it missed the persons it was aimed at.  
     
      
    14 Meanwhile a security guard, Mr Kamal Elmasri, saw the fight developing and, after calling for assistance on his radio, ran to where Userph Rima was being attacked and endeavoured to pull some of the Asian men away from him. He also tried to assist Mohammed Flaifel, who was also being assaulted and at one stage, ran across and grabbed the baseball bat which was being used to attack Userph.  
     
      
    15 At this stage the prisoner entered the shopping centre and fired a single shot from an SKS rifle which struck Userph on his front left upper chest just below the collarbone and ultimately penetrated the upper lobe of his right lung. One fragment of the bullet exited Userph’s body on the outer aspect on the right lower arm and struck the security guard, Mr Elmasri in the right shoulder causing a small injury. After being shot, Userph staggered down the stairs and collapsed on the floor of the Westfield Shopping Centre. Immediately after the shooting, the prisoner turned and ran from the complex through the northern exit towards the car park. 
     
      
    16 The prisoner was not in the group of Asian men who initially attacked Userph and his cousin. Prior to the shooting, he was at dinner with his girlfriend, Rebecca Ly (sister of Robert Ly) at a restaurant in Canley Heights. Whilst there, Rebecca Ly received a phone call from her brother and after the phone call, Ms Ly and the prisoner decided to go to the cinema, but on their way they went to the prisoner’s home at 26 Parker Street, Canley Vale and he placed a sawn-off SKS self-loading rifle into the car. They then drove to the Westfield Shopping Centre and parked in the car park adjacent thereto.  
     
      
    17 After parking the car, they walked towards the shopping centre and the prisoner entered the main entrance of the shopping centre, but at that stage the movie had not finished and the cinema foyer was empty, so the prisoner and Ms Ly returned to the car where they remained for about 6 minutes. At that stage, the altercation having broken out inside the foyer, an Asian man, Tuan Duc Tai waved in the direction of the prisoner, whereupon the latter left his vehicle and ran to the entry/exit doors of the shopping centre where he entered and fired the shot. His movements during this period and the times were recorded on closed circuit television (Ex D) and that video also records Tuan Duc Tai waving in the direction of the prisoner. 
     
      
    18 Immediately after the shooting, the prisoner turned and ran from the complex through to the exit door back into the car park, returned to his vehicle and a short time later was driven from the car park. The vehicle later stopped in Northumberland Avenue, Liverpool where the prisoner disposed of the rifle by placing it in a drain.  
     
      
    19 Ambulance officers attended the scene and provided treatment for Userph Rima but at the time, he had no pulse and an ambulance officer administered CPR. He was conveyed to Liverpool Hospital and pronounced dead shortly after his arrival. The cause of his death was found on post-mortem examination to be due to blood loss resulting from the damage caused to major blood vessels in the chest, right lung and also his right arm. Mr Elmasri’s injury was treated at Liverpool Hospital; it required only a dressing and he was discharged after treatment. 
     
      
    20 The rifle was recovered by police the following day Saturday, 9 February 2002 and on Sunday, 16 February they attended the prisoner’s home at 26 Parker Street, Canley Vale where he and Ms Ly were arrested. A search of the premises was conducted. The prisoner was taken back to Liverpool Police Station where he was interviewed and during that interview, he said in answer to question 51, “And I waited there near the car and that’s when one of the guys I don’t know who it was, I…..met him before, and he, he said that Robert was in trouble. And that’s when I ran in and did what I had to do”.  
     
      
    21 He also said, “What happened when I got to the door? I looked inside and nothing was wrong. So I just walked back to the car thinking there was nothing wrong. And then suddenly I turned around and saw this Asian guy signalling (A 156) and then I just went in and, you know, did what I did (A 157). I took the rifle and I shot Userph (A 158). When asked if he aimed the shot or whether he just pulled the trigger he said “No, I just pulled the trigger” (A 163), but later in answer to Q 169 he said he did aim the gun in the deceased’s direction (A 169). He said that he did not intend to kill the deceased (A 171) but when asked what he thought would occur by pointing the gun in that direction and pulling the trigger, he replied “He might die” (A 173).  
     
      
    22 Later that day, he agreed to accompany police on a “walk around” the area where the shooting occurred and he then showed police his movements on the night of Userph’s death, including where he stood and how he held the gun to his shoulder to fire the shot. He also said, “I went straight in and I stopped right here (indicating)…..and then, I don’t know, I saw a couple of guys attacking him…..they were there and then, but when I, when they saw me holding the rifle, they all started to run…..and that’s when I aimed my rifle at him and I shot”. 
     
      
    23 He also claimed in his oral evidence (T 9) that after Rebecca Ly had the telephone call from her brother, whilst she and the prisoner were at the restaurant, she told him that a group of people with machetes and baseball bats were after her brother. This could not have been correct as at that stage, the film was still in progress and the fight in the foyer had not started. There is no evidence that any one used a machete at any stage and the only baseball bat used was used by one of the Asian youths attacking the deceased. In cross-examination, he modified this to saying (T 34) that he was aware from what Rebecca told him that there was “going to be a fight”. Of course, the only persons with any reason to start a fight were Robert Ly (whose mobile phone had been taken) and his friends. 
     
      
    24 He said that after he went in to the cinema foyer and saw no one (the film being still in progress), he came back to the car and told Rebecca there was nothing going on and they should go home. However, they did not go home but waited around for approximately 6 minutes (as recorded on the CCTV) before re-entering the cinema foyer following a signal from an Asian youth waving. 
     
      
    25 He was reluctant to admit that the signal for him going back into the cinema was another Asian youth waving at him (T 39-T 44), which was contrary to his answers in his recorded interview (AA 70-75, 156). 
     
      
    26 He also denied the rifle was his and said it belonged to “a group of us in the house”, although in his recorded interview, he told police it was his, and the only other persons living at his house appear to have been Rebecca Ly and the person referred to by Det Sgt Bingham in his statement as Sophear Em (sic). 
     
      
    27 What is abundantly clear from the documents tendered on behalf of the Crown, including the witness statements, is that Robert Ly was angry and upset at having his mobile telephone stolen, that he believed (correctly) that the deceased had taken it, and that he thereupon summoned a group of his Asian friends to the theatre to assault the deceased and his companions in retaliation for the taking of the phone. This they did quite viciously in the foyer of the cinema after the film ended and they were continuing to do so when the prisoner entered the foyer for the second time armed with the rifle following a signal from one of the other men in the Asian group. At this stage, those attacking the deceased moved away (a fact confirmed by a number of eyewitnesses’ statements and by the prisoner – (see first answer on top of p 5 of walk around transcript) leaving the deceased exposed alone and the prisoner raised the rifle, aimed it in the direction of Userph Rima, although without lining up the sights, and shot him in cold blood. If, as he now claims, he thought the person being attacked was Robert Ly, and he saw those attacking him run away, there was no reason to shoot at all. 
     
      
    28 To suggest that the prisoner was there solely to protect Robert Ly and that his presence at the same time as Ly’s associates were attacking the deceased and his companions over the loss of the mobile phone was merely coincidental is to invite one to realms of fantasy. I believe that his first visit to the foyer was to see if the fight had started, and when he found it had not, he decided it to wait around to help when called upon.  
     
      
    29 The major issue on the sentence proceedings has been whether he fired the rifle with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, or only with a reckless indifference to human life (the last mentioned is conceded). I have already set out his answers to QQ 163, 169 and 171 in his recorded interview, and in his evidence he said he pulled the trigger to frighten them. 
     
      
    30 In Dr Gardner’s report at p 14, he said he asked the prisoner what he had meant in his answers to Q 169 (did you aim the gun in his direction?) to which he replied “Yes, I did”, and he said he meant that he aimed the gun in the “general” direction of the group of people, “a bit above, or beside”. He suggested in evidence that he fired it up in the air, but clearly he did not, and in the walk around he demonstrated the manner in which he raised the rifle to his shoulder. Mr Santisi suggested that this was impossible because he was wearing handcuffs at the time of the walk around, but I have watched the video twice and, notwithstanding the hand cuffs, it clearly shows him lifting both hands to shoulder level and he demonstrated an angle of the gun just slightly above the horizontal which would allow for the 7 steps from the floor to cinema foyer level. 
     
      
    31 He certainly did not aim the gun in the direction of the ceiling or to an area of the foyer where there were no people, but at least in the general direction of the victim or the victim and his attackers who apparently decamped when he appeared. 
     
      
    32 In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that he fired with an intent to kill, and not only with a reckless indifference to human life; but even if I am wrong in this finding, I consider that firing into a cinema foyer with a number of persons present with reckless indifference would be no less culpable than firing with an intent to kill, and I proceed on that basis.33 The prisoner was born in Australia of Cambodian parents on 7 April 1981 and accordingly was 20 years and 9 months old at time of the offence. Although his parents spoke Khmer at home, he was educated entirely in this country to year 11 (although he did not complete that year). His father died from cancer when he was less than 3 years old, but he continued to reside at home with his mother and siblings until about 1997 when he left home, apparently due to friction with his mother's new partner and commenced to reside with undesirable friends who apparently supported him and he commenced using illegal drugs. On 2 occasions, he moved to New Zealand where he worked in a bakery in Wellington operated by an aunt and uncle. In late 2001, he formed a relationship with Rebecca Ly and she was pregnant to him at the time of the offence. It appears that he has never been employed in this country. 
     
      
    34 His only previously recorded conviction is for possessing a knife in a public place, but following the search of his residence for this investigation on 16 February 2002 and the discovery of a quantity of heroin, he has pleaded guilty at committal to a charge of supply prohibited drug and been committed to the District Court for sentence. 
     
      
    35 He has expressed his remorse and regret for the death of the deceased, but in view of his attempts on the sentencing proceedings to minimize his culpability and to resile from what he had told the police in his recorded interview, I have very serious doubts about the genuineness of his remorse, except remorse for his own predicament.  
     
      
    36 I am also satisfied that his plea of guilty to the charge of murder was motivated solely by the overwhelming weight of the Crown case, after all attempts to find some way out by seeking expert evidence which may prove helpful had failed. It was submitted that the issue of murder or manslaughter needed to be investigated in depth; but the known circumstances of this shooting, particularly in the light of the prisoner’s admissions to police, could only amount to murder and manslaughter was never a realistic possibility. Accordingly, I do not regard the plea of guilty as evidence of contrition. 
     
      
    37 He is however, entitled to a discount on account of the utilitarian value of the plea; but as it only came after three adjournment applications all of which, except that for the change of solicitor, I found to be without merit, and then only on the day after the date finally fixed for the trial, I regard it as a late plea and accordingly, I only allow a discount of approximately 13 per cent. 
     
      
    38 I have had regard to the matters specified in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 particularly as aggravating factors that the offence involved the use of a weapon, that he had a previous conviction, that the offence was committed without regard for public safety; and as mitigating factors that by reason of his age, he has good prospects of rehabilitation, his pleas of guilty and his assistance and co-operation with police in his recorded interview and walk through.  
     
      
    39 In addition, I have taken into account the offence of possess loaded firearm in a public place in the manner approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Re Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, no 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. 
     
      
    40 In this case, it is appropriate to have particular regard to the need for general deterrence. There is no place in our community for people to be carrying loaded firearms in public places, or to resolve property disputes, or any other disputes for that matter, by the use of such firearms; and it is necessary that this be clearly understood by all members of the public.  
     
      
    41 I have read the Victim Impact Statement by Ali Rima on behalf of the deceased’s family. The deceased was clearly a loving member of a large close-knit family and I extend the Court’s sympathy to his parents, brothers and sisters. It is a tragedy that he died as he did on the threshold of his adult life and because of a mobile phone; but in accordance with authority, whilst acknowledging the family’s loss and distress I have not taken such loss and distress into account in assessing the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    42 I therefore start with a sentence of 22 years reduced by 3 years for the plea of guilty. I have considered the issue of “special circumstances”, but I am not satisfied that there are any such circumstances which in this case justify a reduction in the statutory relationship of non-parole period to head sentence indicated by s 44. 
     
      
    43 The prisoner has been in custody since the date of his arrest, 16 February 2002 and the sentence will run from that date. In the circumstances, the sentence for the assault of Kamal Elmasri will be wholly concurrent with the sentence for the murder. 
     
      
       
       
      
    44 Mao Vann, for the murder of Userph Rima, and taking into account the additional charge of possessing a loaded firearm in a public place, I sentence you to imprisonment for 19 years. The sentence will be taken to have commenced on 16 February 2002 and expire on 15 February 2021 and I fix a non-parole period of 14 years and 3 months. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 15 May 2016. 
     
      
    45 On the charge of assaulting Kamal Elmasri, I sentence you to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months to be served concurrently and to be taken to have commenced on 16 February 2002.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Ipp JA, which sets out the primary facts. 
     
      
    2 I am not persuaded that Phegan DCJ erred in concluding that there was a causative breach of duty. 
     
      
    3 The first claimant (TAB) owed a duty of reasonable care to patrons who came to its premises to place bets. The content of that duty extended to the taking of reasonable measures to control rowdy and dangerous patrons whose activities had the potential to threaten the safety of other patrons. 
     
      
    4 The issue on breach is whether the inaction of the manager, Mr Youngman (the second claimant) fell on the wrong side of a line that is difficult to draw. I am unpersuaded that the learned primary judge erred. He had the advantage of seeing all of the witnesses and assessing the evidence in its totality. It was in my view open to him to conclude, as he did, that breach of duty occurred in the failure to take steps towards removing the young men from the premises before matters got out of hand. 
     
      
    5 The men were visibly affected by alcohol, rowdy and offensive. They had been twice warned to behave by Mr Benson; by Therese, the TAB employee; and by Mr Youngman, the manager. On each occasion they complied for a time, before reverting to noisy and offensive behaviour that was obviously concerning to other patrons in the fairly crowded environment of the shop. 
     
      
    6 Mr Youngman realised that their activities constituted a risk of injury to the other patrons. He was admittedly worried “that someone else in the public space would do something irrational”. He gave the two men a warning, telling the smaller (and less aggressive) man that if they did not quieten down they would have to leave. Things “settled down” for a time, but Mr Youngman kept the men in view for two or three minutes, obviously because he was unsure of the longer term effect of his warning. Within minutes, the men recommenced their noisy and aggressive behaviour and continually shouted out obscenities. The elderly patron, Mr Benson had to admonish them again. Another minute or two passed. However, the two men started to shout and swear again. It was at that stage that Mr Benson spoke to them firmly. Unfortunately this provoked the fight in which the respondent suffered injury as a result of his intervention. 
     
      
    7 This was the very thing that Mr Youngman was concerned might happen (Tr pp171, 173, 178). 
     
      
    8 Ipp JA has concluded that there was at most an error of judgment on Mr Youngman’s part. I do not agree. Or, to put it more accurately, I am not persuaded that Phegan DCJ erred when he concluded otherwise. 
     
      
    9 I move to causation. Mr Youngman had the capacity to require the men to leave and to back up his request by summoning the police, using a call button on his phone if urgency was required. More probably than not, in my opinion, this would have (a) induced patrons not to continue taking matters into their own hands and (b) induced the rowdy young men to desist from violence, probably also leaving the premises. I base these conclusions upon my assessment of the level of rowdiness and capacity for self-control of the two men, having regard to the evidence as a whole. I also take account of what happened after the fight itself erupted.  
     
      
    10 I do not share Ipp JA’s concerns based upon this precise scenario not having been put to Mr Youngman in cross-examination. Causation was clearly in issue. The court’s task was and is to determine the probabilities in an admittedly hypothetical situation. Mr Youngman’s views on the topic might have been helpful, but their absence is not determinative. Judge Phegan found causation in the plaintiff’s favour, stating that “the only effective measure facing the [claimants] was removal of the young men”. This, in my view, was intended to encompass the various measures to which I have adverted. In any event, the facts support the reasoning on causation I have discussed. 
     
      
    11 I would refuse leave to appeal and dismiss the summons with costs. 
     
      
    12 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Ipp JA. 
     
      
    13 IPP JA: This is an application for leave to appeal against a decision of Phegan DCJ whereby his Honour entered a verdict and judgment for the opponent in the sum of $91,189.55. The judgment was in respect of a claim by the opponent for damages for personal injuries. The injuries were said to have been caused by the claimants’ negligence. 
     
      
    14 Leave to appeal was sought in respect of his Honour’s findings as to both liability and damages. It was common ground that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal upheld in respect of the quantum of damages. The parties were agreed that the amount awarded in respect of damages should be reduced by $20,000. I shall, however, first deal with the issue of liability. 
     
      
    15 For some 19 years prior to 17 April 1999, the first claimant (“TAB Limited”), through its agent, the second claimant (“Mr Youngman”) had operated the TAB at Kings Langley, a western suburb of Sydney. The premises in which the TAB agency was located were relatively small in area. The agency had what was described as a “family type atmosphere” and was a relatively sedate establishment. 
     
      
    16 At about 2.00 pm on 17 April 1999, the opponent – who was then almost 55 years old – entered the Kings Langley agency. About 30 customers were there. They included a wide assortment of people, from young mothers with babies to elderly men and women in their seventies.  
     
      
    17 After the opponent had been in the premises for a period of 10 to 15 minutes, one of two young men (who had been sitting together) went to the betting counter and bought a bet or some bets. He returned to his seat and the two men watched the horse races being shown on the television set in front of them. Soon, the men (particularly the larger of the two) began to swear loudly and conduct themselves generally in a rowdy, unpleasant and offensive manner. Both men were under the influence of alcohol. Apparently, the horse they had backed had lost and they were agitated about this.  
     
      
    18 Phegan DCJ described the scene as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “As many as 30 people were congregated in a relatively confined space, certainly in circumstances where the rowdy behaviour of the two young men was sufficient to both disturb and offend a number of the other patrons in close quarters with them. It was in that sense difficult to get away from the two young men who were making so much noise and drawing attention to themselves”. 
         
        
       
      
    19 The conduct of the two men resulted in an elderly patron of the establishment, Mr William Benson, walking across to speak to them. He admonished them for their rowdy behaviour. They then quietened down. 
     
      
    20 Within minutes the noise increased again. An employee of the TAB named Therese went over to the young men in order to calm them down. The two young men went quiet but again, within a minute or two, became noisy and offensive. They were still watching the races (which were being shown about every three minutes).  
     
      
    21 Mr Youngman, who had been in the office part of the premises, came into the public area and told the smaller man that if they did not quieten down they would have to leave. Mr Youngman thought that the smaller man would be more receptive to reason and would have influence over his companion. The two men did in fact quieten down and Mr Youngman moved back to the doorway of his office.  
     
      
    22 Mr Youngman stood at the door of his office for about two to three minutes observing the men. He said that by then “things were settled” and there was no interaction between the patrons and the two men. He thought that things were under control.  
     
      
    23 Mr Youngman then went through the door to his office. Within minutes, the men recommenced with their noisy and aggressive behaviour and continually shouted out obscenities.  
     
      
    24 Mr Benson again went up to the two men and admonished the smaller man. The larger man said to his friend “keep it cool” or words to that effect.  
     
      
    25 After a minute or two had passed, however, the two men started to shout and swear again and the larger man continually threw up his arms apparently in response to something he had seen on one of the races on the television screen. 
     
      
    26 Mr Benson, for the third time, approached them. According to Mr Youngman, Mr Benson “actually put his face to the other man’s face”, they were “fairly close; a matter of inches”. Mr Benson said, “You were told to be quiet” or “I told you to be quiet”. He told them to leave.  
     
      
    27 Mr Benson then moved to the counter and while he was bending over, the larger man stood up and threw a bottle he had been holding at Mr Benson. The bottle struck Mr Benson on his face. The larger man then moved over to Mr Benson and grabbed him around the neck in a stranglehold. 
     
      
    28 The opponent, courageously, came to Mr Benson’s aid by moving forward and trying to pull the larger man away. The opponent was struck on the head and attempted to swing the larger man around to avoid the blows. Eventually, a young woman walked into the premises and asked the opponent to let the larger man go. The larger man said, “If you let me, I will walk out. Let me go and I will walk out.” The opponent let him go and the two men and the young woman walked out. The opponent injured his shoulder in wrestling with the larger man.  
     
      
    29 Phegan DCJ found that it was “foreseeable in [the] circumstances that if the situation were allowed to continue the point would be reached where a complaint made to [the two men] would meet with a more violent response than had been the case up to that point of time.” His Honour concluded that the opponent’s intervention and his resultant injuries were reasonably foreseeable. 
     
      
    30 Dealing with the question whether there was a duty of care upon the claimants, Phegan DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am satisfied that there was a duty on the [claimants] arising out of the physical circumstances of the premises, that is, the relatively confined space, large number of people in a somewhat crowded situation, the volatility of two young men who had been identified as affected by alcohol, combined to impose a responsibility on the [claimants] to ensure that proper care was taken to avert any unnecessary injury to patrons on the premises. That duty extended, if necessary, to intervention involving the removal of the young men from the premises.” 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the only effective measure facing the [claimants] was removal of the young men, at a point when it became apparent that efforts to simply quieten them down by way of requests was not going to work. At that point, more drastic action was called for. At the crucial time, that is, at the time he intervened, [Mr Youngman] was on notice of the danger and should have anticipated the risk of something happening along the lines that eventually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    32 The claimants contend that Phegan DCJ erred in finding that they owed the opponent a duty of care. In the alternative they contend that his Honour erred in finding that they breached any duty of care they may have owed to the opponent. Thirdly, they contend that the evidence did not establish that any breach of a duty of care they may have owed to the opponent caused the damage to the opponent. 
     
      
    33 As regards the duty of care question, the claimants relied on Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Limited v Anzil (2000) 205 CLR 254. They submitted that the circumstances did not impose on the claimants a duty of care to take reasonable steps to prevent patrons of the TAB from suffering harm by reason of the criminal behaviour of third parties. 
     
      
    34 In Oxlade v Gosbridge Pty Limited (unreported, NSWCA, 18 December 1998) Mason P said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is exceptional for the law to impose a duty to exercise care in controlling a third party to prevent the third party doing damage to another (see generally  
        Smith v Leurs 
         (1945) 70 CLR 256). But a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect patrons has been imposed upon the manager of a hotel as regards intoxicated or dangerous customers. Whatever the outer limits of such duty, it encompasses the protection of a patron while he or she is on or departing from the licensed premises”. 
        
       
       
      See also

       (2001) 3 VR 447 and  
      Gordon v Tamworth Jockey Club 
       [2003] Aust Torts Reports 81-698. 
       
      
    35 Such a duty is capable of being extended in scope. In my reasons in South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club Limited v Cole (2002) 55 NSWLR 113 (with which Heydon JA and Santow JA agreed) I said (at 137, [152]): 
     
      
       
        
        “[The general duty on the part of the occupier to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury to the entrant] ordinarily concerns risk of injury from the condition of the premises, but this is not an inevitable limitation on the scope of the duty. If, to the knowledge of the occupier, activities conducted on the premises bring about a risk of injury to the entrant, the circumstances may give rise to a duty of care wide enough to encompass a duty to take reasonable care to avoid a foreseeable risk of injury arising from those activities:  
        Canterbury Municipal Council v Taylor 
         [2002] NSWCA 24. Typically, the foreseeable risk of injury in such a case is the risk of physical injury directly caused by the known activities on the premises.”  
        
       
       
      Nothing in the reasons of the High Court in this case ( 
      Cole v South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club Limited 
       (2004) 78 ALJR 933) is inconsistent with these remarks.  
       
      
    36 The opponent complains that the claimants negligently failed to control the continued presence of the two young men on the premises. The facts in the present case, therefore, differ fundamentally from Modbury. In fact they fall squarely within the possible exception to the rule in Modbury explained by Hayne J (at 293-294 [117]).  
     
      
    37 In Modbury Hayne J (at 292 [112]) observed that “[t]he occupier of land has power to control who enters and remains on the land and has power to control the state or condition of the land”. Hayne J remarked that that power of control established a relationship between occupier and entrant that could suffice to create a duty of care.  
     
      
    38 Accordingly, while it is true that no liquor was sold at the TAB, that is by no means conclusive of the question.  
     
      
    39 Foreseeability of harm is an important factor in this context. It is very much to the point that, by the time Mr Youngman spoke to the two men, he realised that their activities on the claimants’ premises constituted a risk of injury to the other patrons.  
     
      
    40 In my view, the circumstances were such as to give rise to the imposition of a duty on the claimants to take reasonable steps to prevent injury to the TAB patrons from the activities of the two men. This conclusion is simply the product of the concept of reasonableness: see Tame v State of New South Wales (2002) 211 CLR 317 per Gleeson CJ at 330, [8]. 
     
      
    41 I turn now to the question of breach of that duty.  
     
      
    42 Phegan DCJ observed that Mr Youngman conceded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the very thing that happened was something that he had anticipated might happen when he spoke to the smaller of the two young men. He was concerned about the way the larger, taller man was behaving and one reason why he had spoken to the smaller man was that he feared at that stage that the taller man might have been very easily provoked into some sort of aggressive behaviour, and that by resorting to the method of communicating through the less affected and less aggressive of the two, he might have been able to bring the situation under control.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour observed: 
       
       
        
        “He did have reason in those circumstances on his own evidence to anticipate the kind of thing that eventually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    43 Mr Youngman described the men’s behaviour as “very uncomforting [sic]”. He spoke to the smaller man as he thought that that was “prudent”. The prudence lay in his fear that the larger man might possibly “erupt” and become violent if he spoke to him.  
     
      
    44 Mr Youngman said that when he walked away from the men after admonishing the smaller man, he stood at his office door and watched them because, he said, “I was concerned about their behaviour”. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “My worry was that someone else in the public space would do something irrational. That was my feeling”. 
        
       
       
      He was concerned that one of the other customers would go to the men and “start having a go or having a talk to them”. In the back of his mind, when he stopped at the door to keep an eye on them, was the thought that the men might react and there would be a fight.  
       
      
    45 Thus, there was ample evidence to support the judge’s findings as to the foreseeability of harm. These findings are relevant to breach as the reasonableness of the steps Mr Youngman took to avoid the risk that he had foreseen of injury to patrons must be judged against the likelihood and degree of harm foreseen. 
     
      
    46 Phegan DCJ held, as I have said, that “the only effective measure facing the [claimants] was removal of the young men”. His Honour said that that should have occurred “at a point when it became apparent that efforts to simply quieten them down by way of requests was not going to work”. The judge did not identify the particular point of time when he considered that this should have taken place. 
     
      
    47 Who is it that should have removed the men from the premises?  
     
      
    48 The TAB did not employ security guards at the premises and there was no suggestion that it should have done so. In any event, there was nothing in its history of some 19 years that indicated that security guards were necessary.  
     
      
    49 I am unable to accept that it was reasonably practicable for Mr Youngman, then a 54 year old man, to have personally physically removed these two aggressive, fit young men (who appeared to be less than half his age). The prospect of Mr Youngman being able physically to manhandle the men and thereby eject them from the premises is fanciful and could well itself have amounted to an assault.  
     
      
    50 The only way, realistically, that the men could have been removed is by the police. But only about 10 to 15 minutes elapsed from the time that the men purchased bets to the occurrence of the melee. There was no suggestion that the police would have come in time to prevent the fight that occurred. 
     
      
    51 Accordingly, the finding that the “removal of the young men” would have been an “effective measure” cannot be sustained. 
     
      
    52 In the course of argument on appeal, Mr Gibb SC, who together with Mr Regattieri appeared for the opponent, submitted that the breach occurred by the claimants failing to muster staff to deal with the situation, and then to caution the men and direct them “to desist from their behaviour”.  
     
      
    53 This argument was not advanced at trial and so not put to Mr Youngman. There was no evidence as to whether there was staff on the premises who were equipped, physically, to deal with the situation. In any event, Mr Youngman (true, it is, alone) requested the two men to desist but this request, although successful at first, proved to be of no avail. It is not possible to find on the evidence that the presence of, say, Therese (the young assistant working at the TAB) and Mrs Youngman or any other identified staff member would have added material force to Mr Youngman’s request to desist. I would not uphold this submission. 
     
      
    54 Mr Gibb then submitted that Mr Youngman should have asked the men to leave and should have warned them that, if they did not, the police would be summoned. He said that there was “no evidence that they would have refused to comply without police intervention.” 
     
      
    55 This submission (like the previous one) faces the difficulty that the primary judge made no express finding that Mr Youngman should have taken these steps.  
     
      
    56 It is perhaps arguable that steps of this kind fall within the meaning of the judge’s words “the only effective measure facing the [claimants] was removal of the young men”. That is, in the sense that the expression the “removal of the young men” includes telling them to go and warning them that if they did not the police would be called.  
     
      
    57 The problem with this proposition, however, is that the judge made no finding as to causation and, indeed, did not discuss causation at all. The strong inference is that he assumed that, had the men been removed before the fight, the opponent would not have been injured. This militates against construing his Honour’s reference to removal in any way other than an immediate physical removal. On the finding that the claimants should have removed the men before the fight occurred, there was no need to make a finding as to causation. The causative effect of taking such a step is self-evident. On the other hand, the causative effect of asking the men to leave and warning them that if they did not the police would be summoned is a different proposition. In my view, if this is what his Honour had in mind by “removal” he would have gone on to make findings as to causation – which he did not. 
     
      
    58 The absence of evidence that the men would have refused to leave without police intervention does not assist the opponent. The onus is on the opponent to prove that the men would have left had they been told to go.  
     
      
    59 I am inclined to think, gauged by reference to their later behaviour, that the men would have left the premises immediately had Mr Youngman, when he first spoke to them, told them to leave and that he was calling the police there and then. The knowledge that the police were actually being called would have worried the men, who did not seem to be intrinsically violent characters (as evidenced by their willingness to leave at the later time).  
     
      
    60 Nevertheless, in my view, this Court should not uphold the judge’s decision in favour of the opponent on this ground. In explaining why I have come to this conclusion I shall put aside the fact that his Honour made no finding as to causation and I shall assume that an inference should be drawn to the effect that, had Mr Youngman told the men to go and that he was immediately calling the police, they would have left before the fight started.  
     
      
    61 Mr Youngman thought that his first approach should be “to give them a warning”. He made a considered assessment, when speaking to the men, that they would not continue to act offensively. He did not agree that the best course was to ask them to leave.  
     
      
    62 It is true that he foresaw a real possibility of a fight occurring, and patrons being injured, and he was fearful of that. But that does not necessarily mean that he was negligent in failing to order the men to leave and that he was calling the police. Reasonableness remains the criterion. 
     
      
    63 The men had only been behaving badly for a matter of minutes. Their bad behaviour seemed to be caused principally by their excitement at betting and their disappointment when losing. It was not aimed at any individual patron. Although under the influence of alcohol, they did not seem to be uncontrollable. They had shown no signs of violence to other patrons (albeit that Mr Youngman recognised the possibility of violence) and, as indicated, they quietened down at first. While Mr Youngman feared that violence could occur, particularly if a patron accosted the men while they were behaving so aggressively and obscenely, as he stood at his office door he adjudged the situation to be reasonably safe. 
     
      
    64 Mr Youngman had to make a judgment on the spot, and in awkward circumstances. The answer to the predicament resulting from the behaviour of the men was not obvious. On the one hand, the men seemed to have accepted his requests and calmed down, although he knew that the possibility of a violent eruption was not far from the surface. On the other hand, I infer, confronting the men might itself result in a physical reaction with danger to many. The situation did not admit of an obvious answer.  
     
      
    65 Mr Youngman may have made an error of judgment in not telling the men to go and that he would call the police immediately. But I do not think that that amounted to negligence. In my view, a finding to that effect would be an impermissible finding of negligence by hindsight. 
     
      
    66 The judgment amount is close to $100,000. In my view, the trial judge was in error in finding for the opponent. The issues involved are not novel but in my view deserve the attention of this Court.  
     
      
    67 I would grant leave to appeal, uphold the appeal with costs, set aside the judgment and verdict granted by Phegan DCJ, grant judgment in favour of the claimants, order the opponent to pay the costs of the trial, and grant a certificate to the opponent under the Suitors Fund Act 1951 (NSW) if otherwise entitled. 
     
      
    68 I do not think it necessary to say anything further about the application for leave to appeal against the award in respect of the quantum of damages.

      JUSTICE DAVID KIRBY 
       
       
       
      Thursday 11 November 2004 
       
       
       
      70076/03 REGINA v ABDUL RAZZAK HAMOUI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 1] - Admissibility of relationship evidence. 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On Monday 25 June 2001, Ms Julie Haklane was reported missing. She was a diabetic. She required injections of insulin at least twice a day. She had been expected home at 5.30 pm. When she did not arrive, her parents became concerned. They contacted the police. 
     
      
    2 The following Thursday (28 June 2001) the body of Ms Haklane (the deceased) was found in her motor vehicle. The vehicle was parked in Eton Street, Fairfield. She had been strangled. It appeared that she had died on the day that she disappeared (Monday 28 June 2001).  
     
      
    3 Mr Abdul Razzak Hamoui has been charged with the murder of Julie Haklane. He has pleaded not guilty. On 18 October 2004, a week before the jury was empanelled, the matter was listed to deal with a number of preliminary issues. Some issues had been resolved by agreement. However, agreement could not be reached in respect of four issues: 
     
      
    · First, a general objection was taken to the admissibility of evidence concerning the relationship between the accused and Julie Haklane which the Crown proposed to lead. 
     
      
    · Secondly, a specific objection was taken to evidence concerning an episode on 23 January 2001. It was said that, as a matter of discretion, the evidence should be excluded (ss135,137 Evidence Act 1995). 
     
      
    · Thirdly, the body having been discovered, the accused was taken to Fairfield Police Station. An application was made to a Magistrate for a Detention Warrant under Pt10A of the Crimes Act 1900. The warrant was issued. The accused was thereafter interviewed and a buccal swab taken to enable DNA testing. It is said on behalf of the accused that there was impropriety or illegality on the part of the police in obtaining the warrant. The evidence should be excluded under s138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, the Crown identified one aspect of the deceased's account of the episode of 23 January 2001 (the subject of the second objection) which was said to correspond to the circumstances in which her body was found on 28 June 2001, such that the Crown could rely upon the coincidence rule (s98 Evidence Act). The accused denied the applicability of that rule. 
     
      
    4 On the morning of 25 October 2004, shortly before the jury was empanelled, I gave rulings in respect of each of these issues, namely: 
     
      
    · First, that as a generality, the relationship evidence was relevant and admissible as an aspect of the Crown's circumstantial case. It should not be excluded under s135 or s137, subject to counsel for the accused having the right to object to particular phrases or passages in the statements which had been served. Having foreshadowed that ruling, counsel agreed upon the exclusion of particular matters (under s137). Other aspects may arise and can be dealt with before a witness gives evidence. 
     
      
    · Secondly, the incident of 23 January 2001 should not, as a matter of discretion, be excluded under s137 (or s135). The statement made by the deceased on 24 January 2001 and the amendments made by her to that statement three days later should be admitted. 
     
      
    · Thirdly, there was neither impropriety nor illegality in the obtaining of the Detention Warrant. There is no occasion, therefore, for the exclusion of this evidence under s138 of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    · Fourthly, the Crown should not be entitled to rely upon the coincidence rule. The fact that the seat was back both at the time of the alleged abduction (on 23 January 2001) and at the time of the murder is nonetheless relevant and admissible. 
     
      
    5 I now provide, in this judgment, my reasons for the rulings in respect of the first and second issues, the relationship evidence. I will, in separate judgments, deal with the remaining issues. 
     
      
       
      The relationship evidence. 
       
      
    6 Mr Hamoui was born on 20 April 1974. In June 2001 he was therefore 27 years old. Ms Julie Haklane was 24 years old (born 8 August 1976). Mr Hamoui Is a Muslim. Ms Haklane was a Christian. Ms Haklane described the accused as her ""first love"". They began their relationship approximately five years before her death.  
     
      
    7 The relationship began well enough. However, after several years they began to argue and fight. Threats were made by Mr Hamoui against Ms Haklane, including threats to kill. They repeatedly broke up, and then started seeing each other again. The deceased's sister, Ms Naha Erdem witnessed episodes of physical and verbal abuse. She saw bruising to the arms and legs of Julie Haklane which her sister attributed to the accused. He grabbed her arms, punched her and kicked her. He continually telephoned her, sometimes late at night, often at hours inconvenient to family members. He was very possessive. In front of members of the family he said this: 
     
      
       
       ""If I can't have you, no-one else can fucking have you."" 
       
      
    8 On other occasions Mr Hamoui was heard to say: 
     
      
       
       ""If you get another boyfriend, I'm fucking going to kill you."" 
       
      
    9 The deceased's mother and sister will also give evidence of the turmoil in Julie Haklane's relationship with the accused in the days immediately before her death. On Saturday 23 June 2001, Julie Haklane saw her sister Naha Erdem at the home of a friend. Julie was crying. She had a red mark on the base of her neck where she said Abdul Hamoui had grabbed her. She said that Mr Hamoui had followed her. To escape she had driven in search of her sister.  
     
      
    10 Having heard this complaint, Ms Erdem resolved to find Mr Hamoui. She went searching for him in her vehicle. She found him sitting in his car. She told him to stop stalking Julie. He responded by saying that they were sleeping together. Ms Erdem insisted that Julie had a new boyfriend, Ray (Bayeh). She was sleeping with him. Once she returned to the house, she recounted the conversation to Julie. Julie confirmed that she was ""with Ray now and didn't want anything else to do with Abdul"". 
     
      
    11 Apart from such evidence, the Crown seeks to prove four particular episodes of violence which Julie Haklane reported to the police. 
     
      
       
      The assault of July 1999. 
       
      
    12 On 3 July 1999 Julie Haklane attended the Merrylands Police Station. She spoke to Constable Cochran. Constable Cochran took a statement which she recorded in her police notebook. The statement was signed by Julie Haklane. Ms Haklane said that the first three years of her relationship with Mr Hamoui had been happy. He had treated her ""like a princess"". There had been no violence. On 28 June 1999, however, he ""went missing"". When Ms Haklane located him, he was behaving strangely. She tried to speak to him. He did not want her in his house. She reminded him of certain money he owed her. He thereupon grabbed her by the jumper and dragged her out of the house. She responded by kicking the side of his car. He retaliated by kicking her, using both feet. He is a competitive kick boxer. Ultimately his brother, Omar, asked him to stop, which he did. Ms Haklane then went to the Merrylands Medical Centre where she saw Dr Laughlin. She thereafter attended the Merrylands Police Station. She had severe bruising to her right thigh. Her statement to Constable Cochran concluded with these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""At this stage, I would just like Abdul spoken to by the police. I don't want any charges laid."" 
        
       
      
    13 Constable Cochran spoke to Mr Hamoui. He said that he had kicked Julie Haklane once because she had damaged ""a lens"" on his vehicle. 
     
      
       
      Assault 6 January 2001 
       
      
    14 At 3.20 am on Saturday 6 January 2001, Constables Hansford and Sweeney attended Ms Haklane's home. Ms Haklane recounted an incident which Constable Hansford recorded in her notebook, which Ms Haklane signed. She said that ""four weeks ago Abdul and I split up"". On the evening of 4 January 2001 she drove to his home to return his belongings. He wanted to speak to her. She, however, did not wish to speak to him. He reached into the cabin of the vehicle and took her car keys. The statement described what happened thereafter in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He said, 'Julie, are you seeing anyone?' I said, 'It's none of your business.' He said, 'Can I go through your phone to see if you've rang any guys?' I said, 'No, it's none of your business, please give me my keys back.' My mobile phone rang and it was my mum and I told her what was happening."" 
        
       
      
    15 Ms Haklane said that her father was ""on his way"". Mr Hamoui returned her keys. Later, according to Mr Hamoui, Mr Haklane came to his home. Mr Haklane produced a handgun. He threatened to shoot Mr Hamoui if he did not leave Julie alone. 
     
      
    16 On 6 January 2001, half an hour after midnight, Mr Hamoui rang Julie. He said he was sorry for what had happened. She told him she did not wish to speak, and hung up. He rang back a number of times. Ultimately he spoke to her. He said he simply wanted to know who had shot his car. He drove past her home to show her the damage. Ms Haklane recorded in her statement to the police that she saw a bullet hole through the windscreen. According to Ms Haklane, Mr Hamoui said this: (para 7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Your family wants to get dirty and use guns. I'm going to go and get a gun now and I'm going to make sure there is blood shed tonight."" 
        
       
      
    17 Ms Haklane then resolved to ring the police. Whilst the police were taking a statement from Ms Haklane on 6 January, Mr Hamoui telephoned her a number of times. The police spoke to him. He described to the police the threat by Julie's father to shoot him, the production of the handgun, and the bullet hole. However, he declined to attend the police station. 
     
      
       
      The abduction on 23 January 2001 
       
      
    18 On 23 January 2001, Julie Haklane made a further statement to the police. She signed each page. She said that she had formed a new relationship and, as a consequence, ""Abdul was very upset"". She nonetheless wished to remain friends with Abdul. She still ""cared for him"". From time to time he made excuses to see her. 
     
      
    19 On Tuesday 23 January 2001, Mr Hamoui asked Mr Haklane to drive him to Merrylands Police Station. He wished to report an assault. They then went to Parramatta. When her phone rang he snatched it from her saying: ""I'll bet that's him."" He ran off. Ms Haklane said that she then found a public phone. She repeatedly rang Mr Hamoui's mobile phone. When she was unable to speak to him, she returned home. It was about 7.30 pm. 
     
      
    20 Mr Hamoui ultimately returned her calls at 9.00 pm. At first he refused to return the mobile phone. He then agreed to do so, suggesting that she pick it up outside his home. 
     
      
    21 Ms Haklane then drove to Mr Hamoui's home. He got in her car. According to the account she gave the police, he was very aggressive. He directed her to drive to Cabramatta to pick up the phone from a friend's place. During the course of the journey, he asked her to park the car. When she did so, he produced a gun, which he pointed at her. He said that if she tried to run or scream he would shoot her. They remained parked for the next hour. He would not let her go. Indeed he got more and more angry. He kept the gun against her face and head, threatening her. 
     
      
    22 Ms Haklane complained of feeling faint. She needed insulin. She asked to go home. On her account Mr Hamoui refused to allow her to go home. Instead, he said that he would drive. He directed her to put the passenger's seat back as far as possible. He told her that if she lifted her head he would shoot her. He drove with the gun on his lap. 
     
      
    23 Eventually Mr Hamoui stopped the vehicle. Ms Haklane was crying. He then said this: (para 17) 
     
      
       
        
        ""This is all because I love you, I can't live without you. I'd rather kill you and me before I let another man have you."" 
        
       
      
    24 Mr Hamoui demonstrated the gun was loaded. He then pointed the gun under his chin and said: (para 18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I'm sorry to put you through this. I'm sorry, I'm going to kill myself."" 
        
       
      
    25 Ms Haklane then grabbed the barrel of the gun. There was a struggle. The gun hit the passenger side windscreen, causing it to crack. Ultimately Ms Haklane said she started to scream. She said to Mr Hamoui these words: (para 19) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I can't take this more, either kill me or kill yourself because I can't take this any more."" 
        
       
      
    26 She claimed to be nearly unconscious. Mr Hamoui told her to calm down. He said he would let her go. He asked that she forgive him. He added that he was going to kill himself. He then got out of the vehicle. Ms Haklane then drove straight home. It was about 3.30 am. Her 16 year old brother Anthony was waiting for her return. She told him what had happened. Anthony remembered her words as follows: 
     
      
       
       ""Abdul put the gun to my head and hit me."" 
       
      
    27 She then drove with Anthony to the Merrylands Police Station. She saw Constable Hume at about 3.40 am. She briefly described what had happened in words consistent with the account she later gave. She repeated that account to Senior Constable Azzopardi. She said, however, that she needed to return home, to take insulin, and to return her young brother. The police drove her home and waited for her. She then returned to the Merrylands Police Station about 15 minutes later. She was accompanied by two male friends, one of whom was Mr Allen Yousif, her then boyfriend. According to Mr Yousif, she said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Abdul kidnapped me with a gun, I've had enough. I am gonna report it, he will kill me otherwise."" 
        
       
      
    28 Detective Senior Constable Danyluk saw Ms Haklane at about 4.30 am. She pointed to a graze to the side of her neck and swelling to her forehead. Her injuries were photographed. Detective Danyluk also saw the crack in the window caused by the rifle barrel. He took a detailed statement which Ms Haklane then signed. 
     
      
    29 At 2.25 pm the same day (24.01.01) Mr Hamoui was arrested. His room was searched. A shortened .22 calibre rifle with a silencer was found. It was loaded with a bullet in the chamber and 12 live rounds in the magazine. Mr Hamoui was charged, relevantly, with the following offences: 
     
      
    · Detain for advantage and cause injury to victim.· Maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do so.· Possess unauthorised firearm and prohibited firearm. 
     
      
    30 On 26 January 2001, Julie Haklane telephoned Detective Danyluk. She said that she had seen a counsellor. She had discussed her problems with Mr Hamoui. She also said that she had spoken to Mr Hamoui. She wished to amend her statement in a number of respects. 
     
      
    31 On Saturday 27 January 2001, Ms Haklane again attended the Merrylands Police Station. She was given a copy of her statement. She made handwritten amendments to a number of paragraphs. In substance, she withdrew the allegation that Mr Hamoui had threatened her. Rather, he had threatened to end his own life by shooting himself. Her purpose in going to the police was to help him. 
     
      
    32 On 14 February 2001, Ms Haklane again went to the Merrylands Police Station. She was told that her amended statement had been sent to the solicitor for the DPP. The advice of the DPP was awaited. Mr Hamoui then entered the foyer of the police station. He spoke to Detective Danyluk. Detective Danyluk repeated what he had just said to Ms Haklane. Detective Danyluk described Mr Hamoui's reaction in these words: (S'ment R Danyluk 20.11.01, para 21) 
     
      
       
        
        ""21. Hamoui did not appear satisfied with this response and stated in the presence of Haklane that Haklane had been coerced into making her statement to police on the 24 January 2001. This was immediately denied by Haklane. They then both left the Police Station."" 
        
       
      
    33 On 3 April 2001, Ms Swain, the solicitor for the DPP, saw Julie Haklane. She made a contemporaneous note of her conference (Exhibit 4 on the Voir Dire). The notes included criticisms by Ms Haklane of Detective Senior Constable Danyluk. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I want charges which relate to me to be withdrawn. Bob [Detective Danyluk] told me he needed info to get help for Abdul. I kept telling him I didn't want to make a statement. I was out of it and half asleep. He should make people read the statement before people sign it."" 
         
        (parenthesis added) 
        
       
      
    34 Ms Haklane also said that she did not feel well. She repeated that she had not been threatened by Mr Hamoui. Rather, he had threatened to end his own life. The notes of Ms Swain included these words, recording the words of Ms Haklane: 
     
      
       
        
        ""We had broken up. I was seeing another guy Alan. Alan put the gun in his mouth (he was crazy). 
        
       
       On and off with Abdul."" 
       
        
       
      
    35 Ms Haklane described to Ms Swain her feelings towards Mr Hamoui (as at 3 April 2001) in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Things have settled down a lot. Now Abdul is dealing with the gun issue - when he was threatened. Now his pride and manhood are returning. He felt stripped of that when he saw Allan take his fiancee (me) away from him. 
         
        Got engaged on 14/2/01 - got me a new ring. 
         
        Plan to marry after court is all over."" 
        
       
      
    36 On 10 May 2001, the DPP withdrew the charges of detain for advantage and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. It persisted with the firearms charges. 
     
      
       
      The assault on 16 June 2001. 
       
      
    37 The final incident relied upon by the Crown occurred on or about 16 June 2001. Ms Haklane's best friend, Ms Diana Lichaa, was at Ms Haklane's home. Mr Ray Bayeh was also there. He had become Ms Haklane's boyfriend in about May 2001. Ms Haklane and Ray sat opposite the window ""kissing and cuddling on the lounge"". As they were doing so, Julie Haklane's mobile phone rang. She left the room momentarily to answer it. When she returned she appeared worried. She said: ""Abdul's outside stalking the house."" She asked her friend to drive her to the rear of a church, where Ray would pick her up. Julie Haklane and Ms Lichaa walked to Ms Lichaa's vehicle. As Ms Lichaa was reversing the vehicle, Julie asked her to stop, so that she could telephone Abdul. Whilst the car was stationary, Abdul opened the back door and got into the back seat. He sat immediately behind Julie Haklane. Ms Lichaa's account of what then happened was in these terms: (para 18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... he said, 'Give me a lift home.' Julie just looked at me and said, 'Okay Diana, we'll give him a lift home.' He said, 'Where are you going?' Julie said, 'I'm going to go pick my sister up from the Albion.' Abdul then started saying 'Who was that guy that you were kissing in your house.' Julie said, 'There was no guy.' Then Abdul described what Ray was wearing and where we were all sitting in the lounge room ... Julie tried to tell him he was just a family friend. Abdul started calling her names like, 'Slut, you're going slutting around again, you whore.' As I was driving Abdul reached around across the centre console and hit Julie on the face. I think he used his right hand and it was closed, like a fist. Julie was trying to push him away and he scratched her on the right cheek. ... I was very scared and pulled the car over and grabbed Abdul's right arm ... "" 
        
       
      
    38 In the course of the struggle, the plastic centre console broke into a number of pieces. Abdul then got out of the vehicle. He took with him Julie Haklane's mobile phone. Ms Haklane removed a ring from one of her fingers, which she then threw from the car window. 
     
      
    39 The next day, Sunday 17 June 2001, Ms Haklane and Ms Lichaa went to the Merrylands Police Station. Ms Haklane described what had happened. The police officer made a note in his notebook. Ms Haklane said, however, that she did not want the complaint ""put on the computer"". 
     
      
       
      Text messages before disappearance. 
       
      
    40 According to the Crown, Julie Haklane was due home on Monday 25 June 2001 at about 5.30 pm, when she would take her insulin. Mr Hamoui was required to report to the Merrylands Police Station on the firearms charges. He did so at 5.10 pm. The Crown asserts that mobile phone records and other material suggest that Julie Haklane met the accused either shortly before, or shortly after, he reported for bail. She was later murdered. 
     
      
    41 Communications between the deceased and the accused in the days before her disappearance, and especially on the day of her disappearance, are obviously important. A number of text messages were sent by Julie Haklane to the mobile phone of the accused in the 24 hours before she was reported missing on Monday evening, 25 June 2001. The police interviewed Mr Hamoui in the early hours of Tuesday 26 June 2001. The interview was recorded on video. In the course of the interview the police asked Mr Hamoui to call up text messages that had been preserved on his mobile phone, received from Ms Haklane. Mr Hamoui did so. The messages in some cases were affectionate. They included the following message from Ms Haklane to the accused sent on 24 June 2001 at 2.13.46 am: (ERISP 26.06.01 Q86) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There are three things I need in this world, the sun, the moon and you, the sun for the light, the moon for the night and you forever to hold me tight. XXX""  
        
       
      
    42 A further message on her work mobile sent at 10.23.15 pm on Sunday 24 June 2001 (less than 24 hours before her disappearance) was as follows: (ERISP Q90/91) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Hey, Abs, I asked M angel to watch over you, but he came back sooner than expected, I asked why he smiled and said, 'an angel doesn't need to watch over another angel'."" 
        
       
      
    43 When interviewed by the police, Mr Hamoui described Ms Haklane as his girlfriend. He denied knowledge of Julie Haklane's other relationships, including with Mr Ray Bayeh. He believed Mr Bayeh was simply a friend. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on admissibility. 
       
      
    44 Mr Ierace SC, on behalf of the accused, objects to all of the proposed relationship evidence, and alternatively to evidence concerning the abduction on 23 January 2001. In support of the general objection, counsel drew attention to the statement of principle of Howie J in R v Toki (2000) 116 A Crim R 536 where his Honour said this: (at 540) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The evidence is admitted not simply because it describes the relationship of the parties, but because statements or acts of the parties occurring within the relationship are relevant to the issues before the jury."" 
        
       
      
    45 Evidence of the relationship must be relevant to the facts in issue. According to the accused, the Crown had not identified any specific question which the relationship evidence might reasonably and logically elucidate. Yet it was highly prejudicial. The jury may regard it as demonstrating a propensity on the part of the accused to resort to violence. 
     
      
    46 Alternatively, in the context of significant evidence concerning the relationship between Ms Haklane and the accused, as proposed by the Crown, the incident on 23 January should be excluded under s137 of the Evidence Act. It was, according to the appellant, unfairly prejudicial for a number of reasons.  
     
      
    47 First, the incident involved the same car as the car in which the body of the deceased was found five months later. The jury would find it difficult to put that aspect to one side. Yet, there would be no evidence that the deceased met her death in the car. The evidence to be presented by the Crown would be consistent with her having been murdered elsewhere and then placed in the car. There would be no direct evidence as to who was responsible for her murder, or even that it was the work of one perpetrator. 
     
      
    48 Secondly, one could not ignore what happened after Ms Haklane's initial complaint. She had then altered her statement within three days. She withdrew the allegations against Mr Hamoui. Instead, she made allegations of impropriety against the police in the taking of the statement. She cannot now be cross examined. It would be impossible for the jury to satisfactorily resolve these issues. If the issue were opened up, a number of witnesses would need to be called. Inevitably it would give rise to a ""trial within a trial"". It would be a distraction from the real issues. 
     
      
    49 The Crown responded that under the ordinary rules the evidence was admissible. It was highly probative. It could not be regarded as unfairly prejudicial. The Crown drew attention to R v Clark (2001) 123 A Crim R 506 where Heydon JA, after an extensive review of the authorities, identified the differing ways in which relationship evidence may be relevant. First, such evidence provided a realistic context within which the Crown case against the accused could be considered. Heydon JA said this: (at 575) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... to exclude all evidence of tension and violence but leave in only evidence of cordiality would be misleading. The evidence was relevant because it prevented the issues from being considered in a 'vacuum' ( 
        Wilson  
        (1970) 123 CLR 334 at 344, per Menzies J). It avoided the jury having 'quite an artificial picture':  
        Peake 
         (1996) 67 SASR 297 at 300, per Millhouse J (Williams J concurring). It enabled presentation of the case 'in an intelligible and real fashion':  
        Garner 
         (1963) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 120 at 123, per Sugerman J. The evidence was 'the key to an assessment of the relationship between the [accused] and the [victim] and, as such, constituted part of the essential background against which the ... [accused's] evidence ... necessarily fell to be evaluated':  
        B 
         at 60."" 
        
       
      
    50 Secondly, relationship evidence is ordinarily relevant to a determination of whether the accused had killed the deceased and done so with the appropriate intent. Heydon JA said this: (at 575) 
     
      
       
        
        ""... It was material to consider whether the past dealing and mutual attitudes of the parties were such as to create a reasonable doubt in the appellant's favour or whether they were such as to increase the probability that a killing resulted. 
        
       
       
        
        The relationship was capable of casting light on whether the appellant killed the deceased, and, if he killed the deceased, what his mental state was:  
        Hissey 
         (1973) 6 SASR 280 at 289. The existence of a bad relationship increased the chance of a relaxation of normal inhibitions against killing. It thereby offered a potential explanation for any criminal conduct by the appellant. It established 'an atmosphere which would render it less unlikely that the offence charged would have been committed in the circumstances which arose on the occasion of [the accused's drive with the victim], having regard to the past relationship of the principals':  
        Garner 
         at 129 per Maguire J."" 
        
       
      
    51 His Honour added: (at 575/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Even though the relationship evidence was not tendered as going directly to motive, an evaluation of the motive issue and an evaluation of the probabilities in relation to whether the appellant killed the deceased, after a sudden quarrel or otherwise, would be carried out less realistically if there were an exclusion of all evidence of the bad terms existing between the appellant and the deceased. Evidence of a hostile relationship would enable the jury to draw adverse inferences from the circumstantial evidence pointing to the appellant's guilt; evidence of a good relationship, foreshadowed by the appellant in his records of interview and actually given in the witness box, would cause them to hesitate in doing so."" 
        
       
      
    52 Thirdly, the evidence was also relevant because it could be predicted that the accused would rely upon evidence that his relationship with the deceased had been good (Garner (1963) 81 WN (Pt1) (NSW) 120, per Sugerman J at 123; Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 251). His Honour added: (at 576) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The evidence against the appellant was, apart from his confession to Mr Brown, entirely circumstantial: he made no direct admissions to the police and there was no direct witness of the crime 
        . Where a case is entirely circumstantial, it is common for relationship to be considered as one of the circumstances 
        ."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    53 According to the Crown, each of the purposes identified by Heydon JA had application to this case. There was some material which, arguably, should be excluded under s137. That material had been discussed by counsel. Excisions had been made. What remained, according to the Crown, could not be regarded as unfairly prejudicial. It should be admitted. 
     
      
       
      Evidence relevant and probative. 
       
      
    54 I accept the Crown's submissions. The evidence concerning the relationship between the accused and the deceased (including evidence relating to the incident on 23 January 2001) is relevant in each of the three ways identified by Heydon JA in Clark.  
     
      
    55 First, the evidence provides a realistic context within which the Jury may examine the material said to implicate the accused. In Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334, Menzies J said this: (at 344) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Any jury called upon to decide whether they were convinced beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant killed his wife would require to know what was the relationship between the deceased and the accused. Were they an ordinary married couple with a good relationship despite differences and disagreements, or was their relationship one of enmity and distrust? It seems to me that nothing spoke more eloquently of the bitter relationship between them than that the wife, in the course of a quarrel, should charge her husband with the desire to kill her."" 
        
       
      
    56 In The Queen v Hissey (1973) 6 SASR 280, the Court (Bray CJ, Hogarth and Mitchell JJ) said this: (at 288/289) 
     
      
       
        
        ""We think that it was relevant and indeed important for the jury to know the general terms upon which the parties were living. If evidence of this nature were to be excluded as being technically inadmissible, then equally it would be technically inadmissible for evidence to be tendered to the jury which might be favourable to an accused person, for example of a man having lived with his wife on terms of affection and harmony over a long period of years; and we think that such evidence would clearly be relevant and indeed important. When evidence of this kind is admissible it is admissible not only to prove the intent of the accused, but also the fact of the crime:  
        R v Ball  
        [1911] AC 47, per Lord Atkinson at p68;  
        Wilson v The Queen 
         (1970) 123 CLR 334, per Barwick CJ at p339."" 
        
       
      
    57 Secondly, the concluding words in Hissey, in the passage above, emphasise the relevance of such evidence (especially in the context of a circumstantial case) to the issue of whether the accused committed the crime and did so with the appropriate intent. It is material from which inferences may logically and reasonably be drawn concerning those issues (Wilson v The Queen (supra) per Barwick CJ at 339; R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 102, per Dunford J, paras 21 and 22). It is evidence, to use McHugh J's words in Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590 at 630, which ""tends to prove how or why the conduct, the subject of the charge, arose, or because it makes it more probable than not the conduct occurred at the time or place or in the way alleged."" 
     
      
    58 Thirdly, the evidence in the Crown case will include assertions by the accused, when interviewed, that he had a good relationship with the deceased. They were girlfriend and boyfriend and loved each other. It will include a series of text messages from the deceased to the mobile phone of the accused shortly before she died (supra paras 41, 42). The messages are affectionate. That material is part of the picture, and an important part. But the Crown is entitled, in my view, to complete the picture. The complete picture, on the Crown case, was of an obsessive relationship (on the part of both the accused and the deceased) in which, in various situations, the accused repeatedly displayed intense emotion concerning the deceased. 
     
      
       
      Discretion. 
       
      
    59 In the course of argument, matters were identified relevant to the discretion under s137 (and s135). Episodes in a relationship which are remote in time may have less weight (R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510, per Hunt CJ at CL at 521-522). There also needs to be some balance, so that the relationship evidence does not swamp the Crown case (R v Bradley (1989) 41 A Crim R 297 at 302). It is unnecessary that every argument between the deceased and the accused should be the subject of evidence. Statements by the accused may well be relevant to his state of mind and whether he intended to kill the deceased. Statements by the deceased, on the other hand, will only be relevant where her state of mind is a relevant issue (The Queen v Frawley (1993) 69 A Crim R 208, per Gleeson CJ). 
     
      
    60 Mindful of these limitations, the Crown said that it would limit the relationship evidence in the manner set out above. Evidence concerning prohibited weapons found by the police at Mr Hamoui's home on 24 January 2001 were not relevant to the episode the day before. There would be no reference to them. The rifle which was found (which was consistent with the description given by Ms Haklane) would be referred to as a ""rifle"", rather than as a ""sawn off rifle"". There will be no reference to the silencer which was fitted to that rifle. 
     
      
    61 In my view, as a generality, the relationship evidence has significant probative value. The statements by the deceased are, of course, hearsay, admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Ms Haklane is not available for cross examination. Nonetheless, again as a generality, such dangers as there may be of unfair prejudice (through resort to tendency reasoning) will be dealt with by an appropriate direction. In that context the probative value substantially outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. 
     
      
       
      The episode of 23 January 2001. 
       
      
    62 The probative value of Ms Haklane's account of the supposed abduction on 23 January 2001 must be assessed in the light of her retraction of a number of the more significant allegations. The resolution of that issue is ultimately not dependant only upon Ms Haklane. She told her younger brother Anthony, shortly before she attended the police station, that ""Abdul put a gun to her head and hit her"". Once she arrived at the station, she gave an abbreviated account to Constable Hume, and then to Senior Constable Azzopardi. What she said, in substance, was the same as the more elaborate account in the statement taken by Detective Danyluk, which she signed. She repeated the same allegation that night to her boyfriend Allen Yousif. 
     
      
    63 It will be a matter for the jury to reach a view as to where the truth lies and why she provided differing accounts. She cannot, of course, be cross examined by the accused. The jury, nonetheless, will have her explanation (which is favourable to the accused) provided to the solicitor for the DPP, Ms Vivien Swain. 
     
      
    64 I regard the evidence as having significant probative value, whatever version represents the truth. The amended statement reveals the state of mind of the accused and the depth of his feelings for the deceased. On her amended version, he was about to take his own life because of his love for her and the presence in her life of someone else. Subject to s137, both statements should be admitted. It was said that Ms Haklane was sleep deprived and unwell. However, she had been given insulin not long before she saw Detective Danyluk. The statement is a coherent and logical account of the events which she claimed to be describing. Detective Danyluk said that she was given coffee. He said she was emotional but anxious to press ahead with the statement. She appeared able to do so. As a matter of probability (s142), I accept that account. 
     
      
    65 Should the evidence be excluded because the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice (s137), or for any of the reasons set out in s135? If admitted, the jury would be told that Mr Hamoui had a gun. They would also be told that he was charged with a number of offences as a result of Ms Haklane's complaint. They would learn that once Ms Haklane had provided her amended statement, certain charges were withdrawn, although the firearms charges remained. It is relevant to unfair prejudice that the deceased did not meet her death by a firearm. She was strangled. 
     
      
    66 The fact that the episode will reveal criminal conduct does not automatically lead to its exclusion, as shown by Harriman v The Queen (supra), per McHugh J at 630. Here the jury will be warned against propensity reasoning. The fact that the deceased's car was involved in both the episode of 23 January 2001 and the circumstances of her death (on 25 June 2001), does not, in my view, create unfair prejudice. It is an aspect of each episode, just as a bedroom or a particular part of a house may be an aspect in another case. Both episodes were very different, one involving a rifle, and the other culminating in strangulation. The fact that the car was involved in both will not give the episode more weight than it deserves, nor is it likely to inflame the jury, nor divert them from their task (see McHugh J in Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 at para 51). 
     
      
    67 The admission of evidence concerning the incident on 23 January 2001 will, no doubt, create the need for a number of witnesses who either saw Ms Haklane immediately after, or who dealt with her once she changed her mind. However, that is not unusual. It will simply become one of the issues in the trial. 
     
      
    68 In my view the probative value of the proposed evidence significantly outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. The evidence should be admitted.

    IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESEQUITY DIVISIONGZELL JMONDAY 15 NOVEMBER 20044638/03 MICHAEL RYAN & ANOR v CRAIG WRIGHT & ANOR (NO 2) 
     
      
    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    1 Craig Wright and his wife Lynn Wright were charged with contempt of court. They did not call evidence at the hearing. I found Mr Wright guilty of contempt and the charges against Mrs Wright not proved. At the hearing as to penalty, Mr Wright chose to swear an affidavit. Over objection that its contents were basically a challenge to my findings, I allowed the affidavit on the restricted basis that it went to Mr Wright’s state of mind. 
     
      
    2 The applicants, Michael Ryan and DeMorgan Information Security Systems Pty Ltd, sought to cross examine Mr Wright. I was loath to allow cross examination. However, Mr Wright consented to being cross examined. I limited the cross examination to matters going to the deponent’s state of mind.  
     
      
    3 On 4 September 2003, Mr and Mrs Wright gave an undertaking to the court to refrain from directly or indirectly carrying on a business in competition with DeMorgan either through themselves or any associates as that term was defined in a shareholders’ agreement and to refrain from directly or indirectly approaching either through themselves or through any associates any company, business, entity or person who was or had been as at 8 August 2003 a customer of DeMorgan.  
     
      
    4 In Ryan v Wright [2004] NSWSC 749, I found that Mr Wright had between 4 September 2003 and 23 October 2003, when the undertakings were in force, directly or indirectly approached the Australian Stock Exchange, Rail Infrastructure Corporation and News Limited all of whom were DeMorgan customers as at 8 August 2003 and that he directly or indirectly carried on business in competition with DeMorgan by undertaking work for ASX, RIC and News being work that DeMorgan had or could have undertaken for those customers. 
     
      
    5 During that period from 4 September 2003 to 23 October 2003, I found that Mr Wright made or received telephone calls from ASX on 14 occasions and on six occasions visited the offices of ASX signing himself in as a representative of Ridges Estate Pty Ltd of which Mr and Mrs Wright were the sole shareholders, directors and secretaries and which conducted a business similar to that of DeMorgan. With respect to RIC, I found that Mr Wright had made or received telephone calls on 43 occasions and communicated by way of email on 11 occasions during that period. With respect to News, I found that he had made or received 11 telephone calls communicated by email on five occasions and Ridges quoted $10,000 for work done up until 23 October 2003.  
     
      
    6 That pattern of behaviour constituted deliberate defiance of the undertakings, in my view.  
     
      
    7 In his affidavit, Mr Wright swore that he believed he would regain control of DeMorgan and thus its business would continue to be the primary source of wealth generation for him and his wife. He said he had no interest in harming DeMorgan’s business by competing with it and, while he was subject to the undertakings, he never contemplated approaching a customer of DeMorgan for the purpose of competing for its business. Nonetheless, he did approach DeMorgan’s customers and Ridges was carrying on business in competition with it.  
     
      
    8 In his affidavit and in cross examination Mr Wright swore that he prepared a document for ASX in the name of Ridges because his solicitor advised him not to use the name DeMorgan. No evidence was tendered from the solicitor. I find that explanation implausible and I reject the testimony.  
     
      
    9 Both in his affidavit and in cross examination, Mr Wright spoke of contact with employees of customers of DeMorgan. He said he did not understand the undertakings as restraining him from communicating with employees who were not officers of customers of DeMorgan. There was no basis for Mr Wright to limit his undertakings in that fashion. 
     
      
    10 There was nothing in Mr Wright’s affidavit or his cross examination that suggested that the breaches of undertaking were casual, accidental or unintentional. That being so, Mr Wright’s wilful disobedience of his undertakings constituted criminal contempt (Australian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 108, 113). 
     
      
    11 In his favour, Mr Wright who is 33 years of age, has never before been charged with a criminal offence. Since he was 15 he has been regularly involved in work for charitable organisations and references from charitable organisations associated with the Uniting Church and with St Vincent’s Community Services were before me. 
     
      
    12 I also take into account the limited period in which the undertakings were breached. On 23 October 2003, a notice of motion was filed upon which, on 30 October 2003, orders were made by the court in terms of the undertakings given on 4 September 2003 and a further undertaking given on 17 October 2003. No evidence was led to suggest that there had been any breach of the orders made on 30 October 2003. 
     
      
    13 On the other hand, there was no suggestion of contrition on the part of Mr Wright. Having stated that he disagreed with my findings and had instructed his solicitors to lodge an appeal and he understood a holding appeal had been lodged, he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “In spite of that appeal, if the Court ultimately maintains that I have breached my undertakings and/or the orders of the Court then I apologise to the Court. It was never my intention to breach the undertakings that I gave or the orders of the Court.” 
        
       
      
    14 In the course of his solicitor’s final submissions, I asked whether Mr Wright freely and willingly apologised to the court. His solicitor took instructions from his client and said he did. I do not accept that belated indication of an apology as a purging of Mr Wright’s contempt. The whole tenor of his affidavit and his manner in the witness box under cross examination was one of belligerent adherence to his views.  
     
      
    15 The Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 55 r 13(1) provided that where a contemnor was not a corporation, the Court might punish contempt by committal to a correctional centre or fine or both.  
     
      
    16 In Mudginberri at 107 a majority of the High Court explained the purpose of punishment for contempt. Having referred to the distinction between criminal and civil contempt, the majority went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the light of these complexities it is not surprising that the distinction between the two classes of contempt has been subjected to increasing scrutiny. The theoretical distinction between the two classes overlooks the underlying rationale of every exercise of the contempt power, namely that it is necessary to uphold and protect the effective administration of justice. Although the primary purpose in committing a defendant who disobeys an injunction is to enforce the injunction for the benefit of the plaintiff, another purpose is to protect the effective administration of justice by demonstrating that the court’s orders will be enforced. As the authors of  
        Borrie and Lowe’s Law of Contempt 
        , 2nd ed (1983) say, at p 3:  
         
          
          “If a court lacked the means to enforce its orders, if its orders could be disobeyed with impunity, not only would individual litigants suffer, the whole administration of justice would be brought into disrepute”.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 In Director-General of Department of Fair Trading v Yang (2002) 132 A Crim R 438, it was common ground that the sentencing principles in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 applied if a contemnor was to be sentenced to imprisonment in criminal contempt proceedings.  
     
      
    18 It A-G for NSW v Whiley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314 at 321 it was held that the provisions of the former Sentencing Act 1989 applied where a person was imprisoned for contempt. At 320 the court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A conviction for contempt of court is a conviction for an offence which is criminal in nature. Punishment of the convicted contemnor must therefore take into account considerations normally applicable to the punishment of crime in general and this crime in particular. It was said by Kirby P in  
        Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Maniam 
          
        (No 2) 
         (1992) 26 NSWLR 309 at 314: 
         
          
          “…it is appropriate to bear in mind the purposes of punishing the contemnor; deterring the contemnor and others in the future from committing like contempts; and denouncing the conduct concerned in an approximately emphatic way.” 
          
         
        Being a common law offence there is no statutory maximum penalty. Punishment for contempt is referred to in  
        Supreme Court Rules 
         1970, Pt 55, r 13(1) but, as was said in  
        Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Maniam (No 2), 
         this rule confirms the court’s power of punishment but does not exhaust it.” 
        
       
      
    19 In Maniam (No 2) at 314 the court had said that the Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 55, r 13(1) was declaratory of the court’s power to punish for contempt of court but did not exhaust it. That proposition was not doubted in Whiley.  
     
      
    20 Whiley was criticised on the basis that it ought not apply to civil contempt by Handley JA in Young v Registrar, Court of Appeal (1993) 32 NSWLR 262 at 288 (See also, Powell JA at 292). It was also criticised by Hunt CJ at CL in Wood v Galea (1996) 84 A Crim R 274 at 276-277. His Honour felt himself bound to conclude that once punishment for a certain term was to be imposed in criminal contempt proceedings, it had to be imposed in accordance with the Sentencing Act 1989. 
     
      
    21 In my view, the authorities establish that the court is not confined to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for its power to punish for contempt of court. The court may rely on its inherent power or its declaration in the Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 55, r 13(1). But once it is determined that a prison sentence is appropriate, the sentencing principles in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 must be applied. In my view, the concession was made correctly in Yang. 
     
      
    22 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 21A(1) provided that in determining an appropriate sentence, the court was to take into account specified aggravating factors, specified mitigating factors and any other objective or subjective factor that affected the relative seriousness of the offence. Section 21A(2) prescribed the aggravating factors. They included that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity (par (n)). The mitigating factors were prescribed in s 21A(3). They included that the offender did not have any record of previous convictions (par (e)), the offender was a person of good character (par (f)), the offender was unlikely to re-offend (par (g)), the offender had good prospects of rehabilitation (par (h)). I have taken these matters into account in addition to the matters set forth above.  
     
      
    23 In my view Mr Wright’s deliberate flouting of his undertaking makes this a serious offence. His lack of contrition exacerbates its seriousness. There is a need to bring home to a contemnor the seriousness of his contempt. For the purposes of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 5(2) these are my reasons for my determining that a sentence of imprisonment is required in this case. I propose to sentence Craig Wright to a term of imprisonment of 28 days. Under s 46 I am not required to set a non-parole period.  
     
      
    24 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 8(1) provided that instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, a court might make a community service order directing the offender to perform community service work for a specified number of hours. The procedures with respect to such orders are set out in Pt 7 of the Act. That provision did not empower the making of a custodial sentence and an order for community service.  
     
      
    25 In Maniam (No 2) at 319, however, the Court of Appeal concluded that while the power to order community service under the then Community Service Orders Act 1979, s 4 did not extend to contempt proceedings, the court was entitled to act under its inherent power. It was not contested that the court might, in effect, impose an obligation of community service as a condition for suspending the operation of a fine that would otherwise have been imposed. 
     
      
    26 The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 12(1) provided for the suspension of a custodial sentence of not more than two years upon entry into a good behaviour bond. It did not provide for suspension upon undertaking community service. 
     
      
    27 The Supreme Court Rules 1970, Pt 55, r 13(3), however, provided that the court might make an order for punishment on terms, including a suspension of punishment. I propose to act under that rule.  
     
      
    28 In Maniam (No 2), the Court of Appeal suspended the fine upon the contemnor undertaking to the court that he would perform voluntary service as a medical practitioner at Liverpool Hospital upon duties reasonably directed by the director of medical services or his delegate, that he would cause to be provided to the Registrar of the Court of Appeal by a specified date a certificate of the director of medical services certifying to his satisfactory performance of the voluntary service and, as required by the court, he would appear before it to be further dealt with if called upon having regard to his compliance with the undertaking. 
     
      
    29 I propose to take a similar course. Mr Wright has worked with Uniting Care Burnside Hastings Family Support Centre in the past. I propose to suspend the prison term if Mr Wright undertakes to provide voluntary service to that organisation. That organisation has indicated that it is prepared to accept Mr Wright for that purpose. 
     
      
    30 An appeal has been lodged from my judgment and I propose to grant a short stay of execution of my orders to enable an application for a further stay to be made to the Court of Appeal. 
     
      
    31 So far as the costs of the proceedings are concerned, in Degman Pty Ltd (in liq) v Wright (No 2) (1983) 2 NSWLR 354 at 358 Holland J said that in his experience it was quite common to find, in cases where an application was made to the court for committal for contempt, an order for costs designed to give a party a complete indemnity by ordering the contemnor to pay the other party’s costs on a solicitor and client or solicitor and own client basis. 
     
      
    32 The matter is complicated because the case for contempt against Mrs Wright failed and ought not to have been brought, in my view, on the negligible evidence that was led against her. If the case against her had been heard separately, I would have been minded to order indemnity costs in her favour.  
     
      
    33 The amount of time devoted to the case against Mrs Wright was slight. Balancing the positions of the parties as best I can, it seems to me that there should be no order for costs in favour of Mrs Wright and an order for costs on the ordinary basis against Mr Wright. 
     
      
    34 The orders I make are the following: 
     
      
      (1) I dismiss the charges against Lynn Wright. 
       
      (2) I declare that Criag Wright is guilty of contempt of court in that between 4 September 2003 and 23 October 2003 he, without justification, breached an undertaking given by him and Lynn Wright on 4 September 2003 to the court to refrain from: 
       
        
        (a) directly or indirectly carrying on a business in competition with DeMorgan Information Security Systems Pty Ltd either through him and Lyn Wright and/or any “associates” (as that term is defined in clause 1.1 of the shareholders’ agreement dated 30 June 2003); 
         
        (b) directly or indirectly approaching either through him and Lynn Wright and/or through any “associates” (as that term is defined in clause 1.1 of the shareholders’ agreement dated 30 June 2003) any company, business, entity or person who is or was, as at 8 August 2003, a customer of DeMorgan Information Security Systems Pty Ltd. 
        
       
      (3) I sentence Craig Wright to a term of imprisonment of 28 days to commence 28 days after this order takes effect.  
       
      (4) I order that the punishment in order (3) be suspended upon condition that Craig Wright undertake in writing to the Registrar in Equity within 14 days of this order taking effect that: 
       
        
        (a) He will perform 250 hours of voluntary service with Uniting Care Burnside Hastings Family Support Centre at Port Macquarie at times and upon duties reasonably directed by the coordinator of the centre or her delegate; 
         
        (b) He will cause to be provided to the Registrar in Equity within 21 days of this order taking effect, a certificate of the coordinator of Uniting Care Burnside Hastings Family Support Centre that she or her delegate is prepared to supervise 250 hours of voluntary service to be performed for the centre by Craig Wright;  
         
        (c) Within six months of this order taking effect, he will cause to be provided to the Registrar in Equity a certificate of the coordinator of Uniting Care Burnside Hastings Family Support Centre certifying to his satisfactory performance of the 250 hours of the voluntary service; and 
         
        (d) As required by the court, he will appear before it to be further dealt with if called upon to do so having regard to his compliance or non-compliance with the undertaking.  
         
         
        
       
      (5) I order Craig Wright to pay the costs of the proceedings. 
       
      (6) I direct the Registrar in Equity to hold the passport of Craig Wright delivered up in accordance with my previous order to be returned to him upon receipt of the certificate referred in order 4(c) or upon further order of the court. 
       
      (7) Orders (3) and (4) will take effect upon the termination of any stay of execution of those orders. 
       
      (8) I stay the execution of orders (3) and (4) for 14 days.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCOLL JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon the applicant in the District Court following his plea of guilty on arraignment to an offence of using an offensive weapon to avoid lawful apprehension contrary to section 33B of the Crimes Act. That is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment. In addition, the applicant asked Judge McGuire to take into account, when sentencing him for that offence, two matters on a Form 1 under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act. As a consequence his Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 8 years and specified a non-parole period of 6 years. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 18 January 2008. 
     
      
    3 There were three grounds of appeal originally filed. They complained in effect that, firstly his Honour failed to properly discount the applicant’s sentence as a result of his plea of guilty; secondly, his Honour failed to properly consider whether there were special circumstances in determining the length of the non-parole period; and, thirdly, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. On the day before the hearing of the application a further ground was filed asserting that there was a miscarriage of justice occasioned by the absence of evidence of the applicant’s intellectual disability at the sentencing hearing. Leave was sought to add the further ground of appeal, notwithstanding that the original grounds were filed on 22 July this year and that a psychological report, upon which the new ground was based, is dated 27 September 2004. 
     
      
    4 The facts upon which the applicant was to be sentenced were contained in a statement of facts tendered before the District Court and set out in the sentencing remarks. They were not in dispute. The applicant, who is a car thief, was driving a stolen vehicle on the morning of 19 January 2002 when he picked up three youths with whom he was acquainted. They drove to the car park of a club in Tumbi Umbi where the applicant and his companions intended to steal another motor vehicle. The applicant entered a vehicle by the use of a screwdriver he carried for that purpose and attempted to start it by tampering with the ignition. Having failed in this attempt the applicant, with the assistance of the youths pushing the vehicle, attempted to jump-start it. 
     
      
    5 Security officers observed this activity on closed-circuit television. They attended the scene and apprehended the youths. The applicant, however, entered the stolen vehicle he had previously been driving. He drove out of the car park then over a grassed medium strip towards the group almost colliding with the security guards and the young persons they were detaining. The applicant then alighted from the vehicle brandishing a sharp object that he maintained was a screwdriver. He threatened the security guards, swinging the object in their direction and causing them to release the young persons. After two of the young persons entered the vehicle, the appellant drove off. He later dropped off his passengers and, coming upon a patrolling security van, drove into the rear of it. He then abandoned the stolen vehicle. Police arrested him later that morning. 
     
      
    6 As a result of this course of conduct the applicant faced sentence for the offence under s 33B(1)(b) of the Crimes Act in relation to his threats to the security guards using the screwdriver. In addition he asked his Honour to take into account on a Form 1 two offences of driving a conveyance without consent and an offence of driving in a manner dangerous. This last matter arose from the conduct of the applicant driving in the direction of the security guards. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was aged 33 years at the time of sentence. He has what his Honour described as an “appalling criminal history”, much of it for stealing motor vehicles and other offences of dishonesty but including driving offences and violence against the person. He had received gaol sentences for such offences on numerous occasions. Most recently he was imprisoned for offences including using an offensive weapon and assaulting police officers. He was a disqualified driver at the time of the offence, and perhaps more importantly was on parole. Clearly this was a case where on its face a very significant gaol sentence was required, if for no other reason than personal deterrence notwithstanding that the applicant had spent most of his adolescence and early adulthood incarcerated. 
     
      
    8 However, there was a significant amount of material before his Honour as to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. There was in evidence a psychiatric report from Dr Tran of the Corrections Health Service. He recorded that the applicant had been diagnosed with Attentional Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder about two years earlier and had been prescribed medication to treat the disorder. The applicant reported to the doctor that he had been drinking alcohol from the age of 10 years and using amphetamine from the age of 14 until his last confinement to prison in 1999. The applicant had been admitted to the psychiatric ward of the prison on past occasions due to his self-harming behaviour resulting from his repeatedly cutting the main arteries in his arms. 
     
      
    9 Dr Tran gave the following opinion as to the applicant’s mental state: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Although [the applicant] does not suffer from a mental illness as defined by the Mental Health Act 1990 or a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital, he appears to be suffering from multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions, aetiologically related to a number of factors including biological vulnerability, early childhood adversity as well as substance-related significant developmental disruptions and long term psychosocial sequelae. 
        
       
       
      He recommended that, if the applicant were to receive a term of imprisonment for the present offences, he would benefit from “on-going drug and alcohol counselling, regular psychiatric reviews, and specific psychological programs aimed at anger management and self-enhancement social skills”. Dr Tran thought that the applicant remained “an on-going risk of serious harm in response to situational stressors requiring both crisis interventions and appropriate custodial management”. 
       
      
    10 There was also a pre-sentence report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service. In relation to the applicant’s drug and alcohol history the report states that the applicant “has on more than one occasion since [diagnosis of ADHD] combined his prescribed medication with illicit drugs in addition to abusing alcohol”. The officer concluded that the applicant would be in need of psychiatric assistance and drug and alcohol intervention on a long-term basis and added “it would appear that the offender has needs for intervention beyond the normal resources of this service”. 
     
      
    11 The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge. He confirmed that he had been released to parole for offences of car-stealing and assault on 17 December 2001. His only dispute with the facts was that he maintained that he held the screwdriver with the point down when threatening the security officers. He explained that he had harmed himself previously in custody “to relieve the stress”, but that he had not cut himself in the four months since his return to prison. He conceded that he had been using both drugs and alcohol on his release to parole and on the night of the offences had been drinking heavily after having an argument with his girlfriend. 
     
      
    12 The fresh evidence is in the form of a report from a psychologist asked to examine the applicant since sentence was imposed and at the behest of the solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Commission to prepare the appeal. The basis upon which the Court is asked to receive the evidence is that the solicitor, who appeared for the applicant on sentence, although apparently competent, lacked the experience possessed by the later solicitor to identify that the applicant’s behaviour and background required examination from a psychologist. This is of course notwithstanding that there was a psychiatric report in evidence before Judge McGuire. It is submitted that the fresh evidence is significant as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and without the evidence the sentencing proceedings miscarried. 
     
      
    13 It is unnecessary because of the view I take as to the other grounds of appeal to determine whether the evidence ought to be received as fresh evidence. But it should not be thought that simply because a solicitor preparing a matter for appeal to this Court, whether from the Commission or otherwise, thinks that it would have been better had a psychological or other examination been undertaken of the applicant before sentence, that this Court will readily admit the evidence. I indicated my views of such evidence in Fordham (1997) 98 A Crim R 359 and I can see little difference between the situation that pertained in that case and that which exists in the present. It appears to me to be a case of the later solicitor simply second-guessing the course taken by the earlier solicitor.  
     
      
    14 However, that may be I have formed the view that the sentence is manifestly excessive as a reflection of the objective seriousness of the offences committed by the applicant, as serious as those offences were and as bad as the applicant’s criminal record was for similar offences. Notwithstanding the subjective circumstances of the applicant, both general and personal deterrence required a salutary sentence to be imposed upon him. This would be so even had the psychological report, now in evidence before this Court, been placed before the sentencing judge. But the sentence imposed, being a term of 8 years as against a statutory maximum of 12 years and following a plea of guilty, albeit not an early one, is simply too high in my opinion, even having regard to the matters taken into account on the Form 1. The statistical information provided to the Court confirms what was my immediate reaction to the sentence. 
     
      
    15 It should be borne in mind, as Judge McGuire did, that the s 33B offence related to the threat with the screwdriver. A reader of the facts tendered by the Crown could be excused for thinking that the most serious threat to the safety and welfare of the security guards, and the young persons in their custody for that matter, was posed by the applicant’s use, or rather misuse, of the stolen motor vehicle. The facts tendered by the Crown appear to have been the same as those used to support the offences with which the applicant had originally been charged. Those charges included two s 33B(1) offences: one with respect to the use of the motor vehicle and the other the screwdriver. The Crown apparently believed that it was in the community’s interest in securing a plea of guilty in the face of an overwhelming Crown case, to relegate what I consider to be the most serious aspect of the applicant’s conduct to a driving offence and that to be taken into account on a Form 1. 
     
      
    16 Although, as I have indicated, Judge McGuire was with respect experienced and astute enough not to fall into the trap opened by the Crown’s tender of the statement of facts used to support more serious allegations, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that his Honour was unduly influenced by the applicant’s conduct in driving the vehicle at least in reckless disregard of the safety of the security guards. This is notwithstanding that, after commenting on that fact and the risk of death or serious injury resulting, his Honour made the point that the applicant was not to be sentenced for that conduct. 
     
      
    17 Had the Crown pursued the initial charges laid against the applicant, it might be the case that a sentence somewhere approaching that imposed by his Honour would have been appropriate. But the Crown had eschewed the use of the vehicle as a weapon and relegated that conduct to a very minor role in the sentencing proceedings having regard to the nature of the offence to be taken into account on the Form 1. 
     
      
    18 The bargain struck by the Crown resulted in a substantial reduction of the charges faced by the applicant and a consequential reduction in a sentence that would otherwise have been appropriate for the protection for the public in general and persons such as security guards and police officers in particular. The sentence imposed by his Honour might provide the protection from the applicant the public deserves but it is not, in my respectful view, proportional to the criminality reflected in the single charge for which the applicant was to be sentenced and on a basis that the only threat was from a screwdriver, however seriously that threat was taken by the victims. 
     
      
    19 However, having regard to the applicant’s record a very significant sentence is to be imposed, notwithstanding the subjective material. I believe that there is little in the psychological report that would justify mitigating the applicant’s punishment to any significant degree. The applicant has been assessed as of “borderline intellectual capacity”. The report concludes: 
     
      
       
        
         
        When he is released, [the applicant] needs to address drug and alcohol counselling and support, as well as vocational programs and general counselling that would be suitable for a person with a mild intellectual disability and serious impairment in communications skills. 
        
       
       
      The Court has no evidence as to whether such programs and counselling are available within the Parole Service or whether, if they were, they would make the slightest difference to the applicant given his age and continued re-offending. The simple fact is that, while on release to parole, the applicant was refusing to take his medication to control his erratic behaviour, and instead was abusing alcohol and drugs. 
       
      
    20 The fact that the applicant has now been found to have an intellectual disability does not indicate to me that he has any better prospect of rehabilitation than was apparent before that discovery. It may explain why the officer in the pre-sentence report concluded that he needed “some form of intervention beyond the scope of the service”. Nor in the circumstances of this particular case does the finding of an intellectual disability mean that the court should temper to any significant degree the deterrent aspect of the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    21 As is so often the case, there have been a large number of affidavits filed in the Court for the purpose of re-sentencing the applicant. Much of it relates to the applicant’s current custodial status. There is nothing in that material that indicates to me that the sentence should be reduced substantially because of more onerous gaol conditions suffered by the applicant or for any other reason. The applicant must understand by now that, if when released he re-offends, the only response of the courts will be to return him to custody, in whatever conditions that sentence might have to be served. 
     
      
    22 I indicate that I would give the applicant a reduction of the sentence by approximately 15 per cent by reason of the plea of guilty. This results in a head sentence of 6 years. 
     
      
    23 Judge McGuire found that there were no special circumstances justifying an alteration in the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. That finding is unimpeachable on a sentence of eight years, as that would provide the applicant with a parole period of two years. I am prepared to find special circumstances only on the basis that the applicant will be required to serve a substantial period in custody before being eligible for release and it may be the case that at the end of that period some form of parole supervision will be available to the parole board to justify a finding that he can be assisted by release to parole at the earliest opportunity. However, there can only be a very slight reduction in the non-parole period because the minimum period of imprisonment I propose is the very least that can adequately reflect the criminality of the offence and the importance of both specific and general deterrence. 
     
      
    24 I propose that the application for leave be granted and the appeal be allowed. The sentence imposed by Judge McGuire is quashed and in lieu the applicant is to be sentenced to 6 years from 19 January 2002. There is to be a non-parole period of 4 years which is to expire on 18 January 2006 the date upon which the applicant is eligible to be released to parole. 
     
      
    25 BUDDIN J: I agree with Howie J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I will ask James J to give the first judgment.  
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Shannon Leslie Purdie applied for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 19 March 2004 by his Honour Judge Urquhart Q.C on a charge that between 1 and 13 October 2001 he knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug, being not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine, to which the applicant had pleaded guilty.  
     
      
    3 Judge Urquhart imposed a sentence of imprisonment of five years nine months, commencing on 24 October 2003 with a non-parole period of four years. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for twenty years and/or a fine of $385,000. Having regard to the date of the commission of the offence, the standard non-parole period for an offence of that kind was not applicable.  
     
      
    4 The applicant was one of three co-offenders, all of whom were sentenced by Judge Urquhart. The other two offenders, Matthew Glen Keller and Anthony Denholm had not pleaded guilty and had been found guilty by a jury after a trial conducted before Judge Urquhart. 
     
      
    5 For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine, of which he had been found guilty, Keller was sentenced by Judge Urquhart to imprisonment for eight and a half years, commencing on 22 October 2003, with a non parole period of five years four months. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine, of which Denholm had been found guilty by the jury, Denholm was sentenced by Judge Urquhart to imprisonment for six years, commencing on 22 October 2003, with a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
    6 Having regard to the grounds of the application by the applicant for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him, it is convenient to summarise the history of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and, to some extent, his co-offenders.  
     
      
    7 The applicant was arrested on 20 June 2002 and was refused bail. He remained in custody until 20 December 2002, when he was discharged at committal proceedings and released from custody.  
     
      
    8 The applicant was informed that an ex officio indictment would be presented against him and on 11 April 2003 he was arraigned on an ex officio indictment on a charge of supplying a prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine. When arraigned, the applicant pleaded not guilty. He remained at liberty.  
     
      
    9 A joint trial of the applicant, Keller and Denholm was fixed for 23 September 2003. However, the applicant failed to appear at the trial and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest. It appears from Judge Urquhart’s Remarks on Sentence in sentencing the applicant that the applicant had suffered an injury while he was overseas, which had precluded him from returning to Australia in time for the trial. It was not suggested in the proceedings on sentence that the applicant had deliberately failed to return in time for the trial. 
     
      
    10 The joint trial of the co-offenders Keller and Denholm proceeded before Judge Urquhart and a jury. At the conclusion of the trial Keller and Denholm were found guilty of the offences charged.  
     
      
    11 The applicant returned to Australia on 24 October 2003, shortly after the jury had returned their verdicts of guilty against Keller and Denholm but before they had been sentenced.  
     
      
    12 The applicant was arrested immediately after he returned to Australia and remained in custody until he was sentenced by Judge Urquhart. On 2 February 2004 he pleaded guilty, when arraigned on the charge on which he was ultimately sentenced, namely, of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug being not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine. 
     
      
    13 In his Remarks on Sentence Judge Urquhart summarised the agreed facts of the offence, as set out in a document prepared by an Australian Federal Police officer. His Honour’s summary of the facts was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 20 September 2001 the Australian federal police arranged for warrants to be issued under the relevant legislation in respect to telephone services used by Keller; a number of conversations between Keller, Purdie and other persons were subsequently intercepted and recorded. On the morning of 9 October 2001, Keller telephoned Purdie and they had a coded conversation. During that conversation Purdie told Keller that it had taken Purdie days and days to hunt up ‘that bit of a thing’. Purdie told Keller that it is absolute rocket fuel ‘and they made an arrangement to meet on 11 October 2001. Keller in the meantime arranged for a friend of his, Denholm, to travel to Sydney from Melbourne with $40,000 in cash. That cash had been withdrawn by Keller from one of his accounts on 11 October 2001. 
        
       
       
        
        On 11 October 2001, Denholm arrived in Sydney from Melbourne and booked into a room at a hotel in Sussex Street, Sydney. On the afternoon of that day Purdie telephoned Keller and Keller told Purdie, that Denholm was in Sydney. Shortly thereafter, Purdie again rang Keller because the earlier conversation had terminated when the telephone line dropped out. During this second call, Keller provided Purdie with an alternate telephone number and in doing s9, used a prearranged code. During that afternoon of 11 October 2001, Denholm met Purdie and another person and at that meeting handed over the money which he had brought from Melbourne. He was told to visit a nearby bar. That evening Denholm rang Keller and told Keller he was at a bar; that he had seen Purdie earlier that day and that he expected to ‘get the result’ the following morning at about 9 o’clock. In the early hours of the following morning: That is at about 12.35 am on 12 October 2001 Denholm telephoned Keller and informed him that he was staying at a hotel and confirmed that he had provided ‘them’ with the money. It was during that conversation that Keller told Denholm not to return to Melbourne by aeroplane but rather to use the train. 
        
       
       
        
        From about 9 o’clock in the morning of 12 October 2001, surveillance was commenced in the vicinity of the hotel where Denholm had been staying overnight. That surveillance was conducted by members of the Australian Federal Police. Shortly after 10 that morning Denholm was observed checking out of the hotel and shortly thereafter departed the hotel and was observed not to be carrying a bag. Shortly thereafter he was observed in the vicinity of the Sydney aquarium. Shortly after that, Keller telephoned Denholm and was told that Denholm was ‘supposed to be seeing him at 11 but, oh, they have changed the time three times today already’. That clearly was a reference to a time which had been previously arranged for Denholm to obtain the cocaine. As I have already indicated the money had been handed over the day before. Later that morning, there were other observations made of Denholm and at about 10 to midday, Denholm was observed meeting with an unknown male. Both Denholm and that unknown male walked away from those making the observations and subsequently out of their sight with Denholm shortly thereafter to reappear carrying a blue and black backpack. 
        
       
       
        
        About an hour later Denholm was arrested at Central railway station and was found to be in possession of that same blue and black backpack which was found to contain a compressed block of white cocaine powder which block contained cocaine weighing 505.5 grams of a purity of 67.4 percent. It is estimated that the street value of the cocaine seized was approximately $194.689. During this day, Purdie telephoned Keller and said to Keller that he, Purdie, had ‘done the best I could’. And he added ‘so, he’s got half the job done’. He also told Keller in that conversation that he, Purdie, had to use some of his own money to ‘seal the deal’ and noted further to Keller that ‘he’s got to come back and pay the rest of the money and get the rest’. During that conversation, it was clear that the final price for the one kilogram of cocaine was $140 thousand; that Purdie had contributed $20,000; that Keller had already paid $40,000 and that Denholm would have to return with $80,000 in order to obtain the remaining half a kilogram of cocaine”. 
        
       
      
    14 In his Remarks on Sentence Judge Urquhart, after stating the objective facts of the offence and summarising the history of the criminal proceedings, dealt with a number of matters. His Honour noted that the applicant was born on 24 March 1973 and was thirty years old, almost thirty-one, at the time he was sentenced. The applicant was educated to Higher School Certificate standard and had had a number of jobs during his working life. He had a criminal history but the offences had been dealt with by the imposition of fines and recognisances and there were no drug offences in his criminal history. 
     
      
    15 His Honour found that the applicant had a long history of abusing alcohol and drugs and that at the time of committing the offence the applicant had been using a very substantial quantity of cocaine, alcohol and sleeping tablets.  
     
      
    16 His Honour referred to an opinion by a psychiatrist, Dr Roberts, that the applicant’s capacity to assess his actions and the consequences of his actions “would have undoubtedly been affected by his state of mind at the time of committing the offence.” However, his Honour added that this opinion expressed by Dr Roberts in his report was based on what the applicant had told Dr Roberts and that the applicant had not given any evidence before Judge Urquhart. 
     
      
    17 His Honour found that the applicant had not abused alcohol or any prohibited drug while he had been in custody between June and December 2002 and that he had had the intention of continuing to abstain from substance abuse. However, the applicant had relapsed into substance abuse, when informed that an ex officio indictment would be presented against him. During his further period in custody the applicant had not used alcohol or any prohibited drug. His Honour found the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and that it was unlikely that the applicant would re-offend. 
     
      
    18 His Honour noted in his Remarks on Sentence that the Crown did not contend that it could show that the applicant had entered into the criminal enterprise out of a motive of profiting from it. 
     
      
    19 A matter that Judge Urquhart particularly considered in his Remarks on Sentence was the role the applicant had played in the criminal enterprise. At the time of sentencing the applicant, Judge Urquhart had already sentenced Keller, who he had found to have been a principal in the enterprise, and Denholm, who he had found to have been a courier or not much more than a courier. His Honour considered that it was of little assistance to seek to attach some label to the applicant’s role, such as that of “facilitator”. 
     
      
    20 His Honour found that there was a clear distinction between the criminality of Keller and the criminality of the applicant. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view this offender Purdie’s role was to find a vendor of cocaine, to negotiate the financial aspect of the sale, to receive the purchase monies from Denholm and pass that money on to the vendor, who was to hand over the drugs to Denholm who was then to deliver the drugs to Keller for on-supply by him”. 
        
       
      
    21 Judge Urquhart rejected a submission made on behalf of the applicant that the criminality of the applicant and the criminality of Denholm were at about the same level. In rejecting this submission his Honour relied particularly on a finding that the applicant was so intent upon the cocaine being delivered ultimately to Keller, that he, the applicant, had provided $20,000 of his own money to enable that to happen. His Honour found that the criminality of the applicant was between that of Keller and that of Denholm.  
     
      
    22 His Honour found that there were special circumstances within s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in the applicant’s age, the absence of any previous convictions that had resulted in custodial sentences and the applicant’s participation in various programs while he had been in custody.  
     
      
    23 Towards the end of his Remarks on Sentence Judge Urquhart explained how he had arrived at the sentence he had ultimately imposed. Apart from the plea of guilty and the discrete period of pre-sentence custody, his Honour would have imposed a sentence of seven years three months. By reason of the plea of guilty he reduced that putative sentence to six years three months. He then reduced that putative sentence to five years nine months, to take into account the discrete period of six months of pre-sentence custody in 2002. 
     
      
    24 Two grounds of appeal against sentence were relied upon by counsel for the applicant. These grounds of appeal were:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The applicant has a legitimate sense of grievance arising from the disparity of sentence imposed on his co-offenders. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentencing judge erred in the way he took into account pre-sentence custody”. 
        
       
      
    25 I will deal with those two grounds of appeal in turn. 
     
      
    26 As for the first ground of appeal, it was contended by counsel for the applicant that there was a lack of proper proportionality between the sentence passed on the applicant and the sentences passed on the co-offenders and, particularly, the sentence passed on the co-offender Keller.  
     
      
    27 A number of submissions were made in support of this principal contention. It was submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in finding that, objectively, the criminality of the applicant lay between that of Keller and that of Denholm and that the criminality of the applicant should have been found to have been about the same as that of Denholm.  
     
      
    28 One matter relied upon in support of this submission was that Judge Urquhart had made a finding that the offence had not been committed by the applicant with a motive of profiting from the offence. However, it would not appear to me that Judge Urquhart actually made an affirmative finding that the applicant did not have a motive of making a profit from his participation in the venture. His Honour merely recorded that the Crown did not contend that it could prove that the applicant had a motive of profit. His Honour went on to observe that (because of the lack of evidence) this was an area which was not capable of being satisfactorily entered. As was held by the High Court in Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629, it may not be possible, because of lack of evidence, to resolve some issue relevant to sentencing, either for or against the offender.  
     
      
    29 His Honour made a finding that the co-offender Keller had entered into the enterprise with a motive of profit making. As regards Denholm, in his Remarks on Sentence in sentencing Denholm Judge Urquhart said there was no evidence before him as to what Denholm had received or was to receive from his participation in the enterprise. In those Remarks on Sentence his Honour expressed the view that there was to be some benefit to Denholm from the venture but his Honour decided that he should not say anything more than that any such profit should be regarded as “quite small”.  
     
      
    30 It was submitted that the applicant deserved to be sentenced more leniently, because he, unlike the others, was a user of drugs and at the time of committing the offence his capacity to assess his actions and the consequences of his actions had been affected by the use of drugs. In this regard, counsel for the applicant referred to the part of the report of Dr Roberts to which I have already referred. However, I am not satisfied that the sentencing judge did actually accept this part of Dr Roberts’ report. In his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour immediately went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “I mention that aspect of the matter simply and solely to provide some background to this offender at that time. I hasten to add that there is no firm evidence that I have received from the offender and those matters to which I have referred have been presented to Dr Roberts or the author of the presentence report by the offender”. 
        
       
      
    31 It was further submitted on behalf of the applicant that his Honour had made a finding that the applicant had demonstrated contrition, whereas neither of the other two offenders had shown any contrition. 
     
      
    32 The conclusion I have reached, after considering counsel’s submissions, is that this Court should not find that his Honour made any error in assessing the criminality of the applicant as lying about midway between the criminality of Keller and the criminality of Denholm. 
     
      
    33 I am further of the opinion that the degree of proportionality between the head sentence on Keller and the putative head sentence which his Honour considered should be imposed on the applicant was within the boundaries of his Honour’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    34 A number of submissions were made by counsel for the applicant about his Honour’s finding of special circumstances and about his Honour’s division of the head sentence into a non-parole period and a parole period. 
     
      
    35 As I have already noted, his Honour made a finding of special circumstances in favour of the applicant. In sentencing the other two offenders, his Honour also made findings of special circumstances in favour of them. However, it was submitted by counsel for the applicant that his Honour, although making a finding of special circumstances in favour of the applicant, had still set a non-parole period which was approximately seventy per cent of the head sentence, whereas the non-parole period of the sentence imposed on Keller was 62.75 per cent of the head sentence and the non-parole period of the sentence imposed on Denholm was 662/3 per cent of the head sentence. It was submitted that there was no good reason why the non-parole period of the sentence imposed on the applicant should have been proportionally higher than the non-parole period of the sentences imposed on the co-offenders.  
     
      
    36 Furthermore, if the period of six months pre-sentence custody that the applicant had served was added to the non-parole period of four years, then the period of imprisonment the applicant would necessarily serve was increased to four years six months. His Honour said in his Remarks on Sentence that he had allowed a discount of one year for the applicant’s plea of guilty. If the applicant had not pleaded guilty and a proportional part of that year had been allocated to the non-parole period of the sentence passed on the applicant, then the total period the applicant would necessarily have had to serve in custody would have been approximately five years three months, that is four years, plus six months, plus approximately nine months, and would have been almost as much as the non-parole period imposed on the offender Keller, who his Honour had found to have been a principal in the criminal enterprise.  
     
      
    37 In my opinion, it should be accepted that there is some lack of proper proportionality between the sentence passed on the applicant and at least the sentence passed on Keller. It should also be accepted that his Honour only gave the most limited effect to his finding that there were special circumstances, with the consequence that the non-parole period should be less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence.  
     
      
    38 As to the second ground of appeal, it was submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account the discrete period of six months of pre-sentence custody by subtracting the period of six months from the head sentence, before determining the non-parole period. In R v Patterson [2001] NSWCCA 316 Hodgson JA with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, said at para 72:  
     
      
       
        
        “…it seems to me that, in calculating a non parole period, when credit is given for time previously served in prison, the correct approach would normally be to take the head sentence arrived at before giving credit for that time, work out an appropriate proportion for the non parole period, and then give the benefit of the previous period of incarceration to both periods. That results in a somewhat larger parole period than if one calculates the proportion after one has given credit for the previous period of incarceration”. 
        
       
      
    39 It is unclear whether his Honour followed this approach but it would appear that his Honour did not. The conclusion I have already reached that there was a lack of proper proportionality between the non-parole period of the sentence passed on Keller and the non-parole period of the sentence passed on the applicant is thereby reinforced. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion, leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Judge Urquhart should be granted and the appeal against sentence should, to a limited extent, be allowed.  
     
      
    41 I would confirm the head sentence of five years nine months imposed by Judge Urquhart. However, in my opinion, the head sentence should be divided between a non-parole period and a parole period in the ratio of 60:40. 
     
      
    42 If the sentencing judge’s starting point of seven years three months for the total sentence is retained and if, as the sentencing judge did, a deduction of one year is made for the plea of guilty, one arrives at a figure for the putative head sentence of six years three months.  
     
      
    43 If the putative head sentence of six years three months is then divided into a non-parole and a parole period in the ratio of 60:40, one arrives at a non-parole period of three years nine months. 
     
      
    44 The discrete period of pre-sentence custody of six months should be deducted from the putative head sentence, thus arriving at a head sentence of five years nine months, which was the head sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. The full period of six months of pre-sentence custody should be deducted from the putative non-parole period of three years nine months, thus arriving at a non-parole period of three years three months. 
     
      
    45 Accordingly, in lieu of the non-parole period of four years set by his Honour Judge Urquhart, a non-parole period of three years three months to date from 24 October 2003 should be set.  
     
      
    46 The first day on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 23 January 2007. 
     
      
    47 GROVE J: I agree with James J. The orders of the Court, therefore, will be as proposed.

     Judgment 
      
    1 GROVE J: Mr Justice James will deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Khanh Ly and Chin Thi Nguyen, his former wife, applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on them in the District Court by her Honour Judge Morgan on 7 May 2004. The two applications for leave to appeal were, by consent, heard together. 
     
      
    3 In a trial before Judge Morgan and a jury each of the applicants had been found guilty on a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, heroin, on 3 May 2002. Each of the applicants was sentenced by Judge Morgan to a term of imprisonment of five years, with a non-parole period of three years six months commencing on 5 March 2004, the date on which the jury had returned its verdicts of guilty against the applicants. The maximum penalty for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug is imprisonment for 15 years and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. 
     
      
    4 In addition to sentencing the applicant Nguyen for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, Judge Morgan also sentenced Nguyen for two other offences to which she had pleaded guilty, a charge of receiving a camera and a charge of goods in custody, the goods being four cameras. For the offence of goods in custody Judge Morgan sentenced Nguyen to a term of imprisonment of three months to date from 5 March 2004; for the offence of receiving Judge Morgan sentenced Nguyen to a term of imprisonment of nine months also to date from 5 March 2004.  
     
      
    5 The two applicants had been co-offenders in the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on 3 May 2002. Another co-offender in that offence was a man named Con Van Huynh, who had pleaded guilty to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug on 3 May 2002 and who had been sentenced on 12 December 2002 by another District Court Judge, Judge Urquhart. 
     
      
    6 In sentencing the two applicants Judge Morgan delivered a single set of remarks on sentence. In her remarks on sentence her Honour stated the facts of the offences by summarising some of the evidence given at the trial, which her Honour clearly accepted for the purpose of sentencing the applicants. On these applications no complaint has been made by either applicant about this part of her Honour's remarks on sentence. Her Honour said: 
     
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence before the jury was that as a result of information received police obtained approval to conduct a controlled operation, that is to use an informant or undercover police officer to buy prohibited drugs. A registered informant (Steve) gave evidence that on or about 2 May 2002 he telephoned the offender Ly, a person he called ‘father’, and made inquiries about the purchase of an ounce of heroin and the cost of it. He was told it would cost $9000. In evidence Steve said that as at 2 May 2002 he was a heroin addict and had been for some time. 
         
         
        On 3 May 2002, together with an undercover police officer ‘Tony’, Steve went to the offender’s premises at Sydenham Road, Marrickville. The car was driven into the back lane behind the house and Steve went to the back door and rang the bell. There was no answer. He returned to the car and used Tony’s mobile phone to ring Ly. When Ly answered he said ‘It’s Steve here, open up’. The undercover officer had been fitted with a listening device and what was said by Steve was recorded on tape and was played to the jury. After this conversation Steve returned to the back door where he was met by Ly. Steve said he had a friend outside with money to purchase an ounce and asked did he have it, to which Ly replied yes. 
         
         
        The offender Nguyen, whom Steve called ‘mother’, was inside the house and told him to come back in half an hour. Steve left the premises and returned in half an hour, went to the back door, knocked, and ‘father’ opened the door. He told Steve to leave his friend outside and that only he, Steve, should come inside. Steve told Ly that his friend would not give him the money and suggested Ly should check him out. Ly then walked to the rear gate, had a look at Tony and then said it was okay for him to come in. The undercover officer went to the boot of the car and removed a plastic bag containing the money. He was introduced to Ly and as they all walked to the house the offender Nguyen beckoned them inside. As they did the telephone rang and Nguyen had a conversation in Vietnamese. A translation of that conversation revealed Nguyen requesting the person to whom she was speaking to come quickly to the house. 
         
         
        They went into the dinning room and sat at the table where the undercover officer unwrapped the plastic bag he had taken from the boot and removed the money which he commenced to count. Nguyen then made gestures to the undercover officer indicating that he should lift his sleeves and also to lift his shirt up. The undercover officer gave evidence that he said to the female offender words to the effect ‘I am not a user, it is just business. Mrs Nguyen continued to gesture to Tony to lift his sleeves, apparently to ascertain whether he had any track marks on his arms. She then accused him of being a cop. Tony became concerned for his own safety. He placed the money in the bag and left the house. 
         
         
        The tape of the proceedings in the house was played to the jury. A translation was also part of the evidence in this matter. 
         
         
        Steve asked the offenders what was happening to which Mrs Nguyen said ‘It is coming’. Steve then joined Tony outside at the car. Shortly afterwards Steve returned to the back door where Ly was standing with another Asian man whom Steve knew as Andy and whom he understood was the offender’s son-in-law. There was a discussion as to the way in which the drug exchange was to take place and eventually Andy went to the car, spoke to Tony and was handed the money which he counted at the car. Andy then went back to the house and returned with a plastic bag containing a white rock substance which was later analysed and found to be 28.21 grams of heroin. He handed this to Tony in exchange for $9000, following which discussions took place between them concerning future supplies”. 
        
       
      
    7 The person referred to in her Honour's remarks as ""Andy"" was the co-offender Con Van Huynh. 
     
      
    8 In her remarks on sentence her Honour made some findings about the objective seriousness of the offence. She found that the supply on 3 May 2002 was not an isolated sale, that the applicants had been engaged in commercial dealings in heroin, that on 3 May 2002 the undercover officer had made it clear that he was buying the heroin, not for his own use, but for on-selling, that neither of the applicants was addicted to, or even used, heroin, and that there were discussions on 3 May 2002 about future purchases of heroin from the applicants.  
     
      
    9 In her remarks on sentence Judge Morgan referred to some of the subjective features of the applicant Ly, who had given evidence in the proceedings on sentence. He was born in Vietnam in October 1954. He had left school at the age of 10 and worked as a farmer, except when doing military service. At the age of 27 he had married the applicant Nguyen. Four children of the marriage were born in Vietnam. In 1988 the family left Vietnam in a fishing boat and travelled to Hong Kong, where they stayed in a refugee camp. In 1991 the family came to Australia. Another child was born in Australia. In Australia he attended English language courses but he had learnt to speak only a little English. For most of the time he had been in Australia he had been unemployed. In 2001 he and Nguyen had separated. Ly had never used prohibited drugs. He had no previous criminal convictions. He expressed no remorse for the offence he had committed. 
     
      
    10 The applicant Nguyen did not give evidence in the proceedings on sentence and Judge Morgan relied on a pre-sentence report and a report by a psychologist in making findings about the subjective features of Nguyen. Nguyen was born in Vietnam and at the time of sentencing was 45 years old. In Vietnam she had left school at the age of 12 and had then assisted in raising her numerous brothers and sisters and in working on the family farm. Particulars of her marriage, her married life and the movements of the family have already been given by me in dealing with the subjective features of the applicant Ly. After the divorce in 2001 the applicant Nguyen received social security benefits but then obtained a job as a process worker. Since Nguyen went into custody on 5 March 2004, the older children have been caring for the youngest child of the marriage who was born in Australia. Nguyen maintained to her probation and parole officer who prepared the pre-sentence report that she had never used alcohol or any illicit substance. She denied that she had committed the offence of which she had been found guilty and accepted no responsibility for the offence. Nguyen had no previous criminal convictions.  
     
      
    11 In her remarks on sentence her Honour said that she accepted submissions by counsel for Nguyen in relation to the two other offences for which Nguyen was to be sentenced, that if Nguyen had been sentenced for those offences in the Local Court, as she could have been, custodial sentences might not have been imposed, particularly as Nguyen had no previous criminal convictions; and that any sentences imposed for those two offences should be fully concurrent with part of the sentence for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    12 Judge Urquhart's remarks on sentence in sentencing the co-offender Huynh were before Judge Morgan in the proceedings for the sentencing of the applicants. In sentencing Huynh for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on 3 May 2002 Judge Urquhart took into account two further offences, an offence of goods in custody being possession of just over $2,000 in cash and an offence of receiving stolen property. In addition to sentencing Huynh for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, Judge Urquhart also sentenced Huynh for separate offences, to which Huynh had pleaded guilty, of receiving stolen property and of supplying a prohibited drug, both offences having been committed on 30 May 2002. 
     
      
    13 In his remarks on sentence Judge Urquhart made a finding that Huynh's role in the supply of heroin on 3 May 2002 had been inferior to that of the two applicants. In his remarks on sentence Judge Urquhart said that Huynh had a criminal record which included a conviction for armed robbery, for which he had served a prison sentence, and which also included convictions for possession of a prohibited drug (cannabis). In his remarks on sentence Judge Urquhart referred to evidence given by Huynh in the proceedings on sentence which his Honour apparently accepted, that Huynh had been seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident, that he had been treated with morphine to relieve pain from injuries suffered by him in the motor vehicle accident and that he had become addicted to morphine, and then heroin, and that it was in order to cater to his addiction to heroin that he had become involved in the supply of heroin. 
     
      
    14 In his remarks on sentence in sentencing Huynh Judge Urquhart said that because of Huynh's pleas of guilty he was allowing a discount of 25 percent on all the sentences he would impose. For the offence of receiving on 30 May 2002 Huynh was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eighteen months with a non-parole period of twelve months commencing on 30 May 2002, the date on which he had been arrested. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on 30 May 2002 Huynh was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years eight months with a non-parole period of two years commencing on 30 May 2002. For the offence of supplying heroin on 3 May 2002, and taking the two additional offences into account, Huynh was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three years nine months with a non-parole period of two years six months commencing on 30 May 2003. It can be seen that Judge Urquhart made this sentence partly cumulative on the two previous sentences, to the extent of twelve months. 
     
      
    15 In her remarks on sentence in sentencing the applicants Judge Morgan concluded on the basis of the evidence which had been given in the trial of the applicants, that there was little difference in the roles the three offenders had played in the commission of the offence. Her Honour decided that a sentence of five years, which was the sentence Judge Urquhart would have imposed on Huynh for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on 3 May 2002, but for allowing the discount of 25 percent for Huynh's plea of guilty, would be an appropriate sentence to impose on each of the applicants.  
     
      
    16 Her Honour made a finding of special circumstances in favour of both applicants, in that the sentence of imprisonment she was about to impose would be the first time in custody for each of the applicants and that, because of their English language difficulties, their conditions of custody would be more than usually onerous and, in the case of Nguyen, that she was the mother of a nine year old child.  
     
      
    17 The only ground of appeal stated in counsel for the applicant Ly's written submissions was that the sentencing Judge failed properly to apply principles of parity between co-offenders, such that the sentence imposed on Ly was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances. The grounds of appeal stated in the written submissions for the applicant Nguyen were (1) that the sentencing Judge erred by finding that the notional sentence to be imposed on the co-offender, before a discount was allowed on account of a plea of guilty, was the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon the applicant (2) that the sentence was manifestly excessive. In the case of each applicant the ground of appeal which was pressed on the hearing of the applications was that there had been an infringement of the sentencing principles of parity or appropriate disparity in the sentencing of Huynh on the one hand and the sentencing of the two applicants on the other hand.  
     
      
    18 It is convenient to consider both applications together. 
     
      
    19 That Huynh was also sentenced for unrelated offences for which neither applicant was sentenced, the sentences imposed on Huynh for those unrelated offences and whether they were made concurrent with or cumulative upon the sentence passed on Huynh for the common offence, seem to me to be irrelevant to a consideration whether there was a contravention of the sentencing principles of parity or appropriate disparity in the sentencing of the applicants. 
     
      
    20 The factors which could properly be relied upon by the applicants as supporting the parity or appropriate disparity submission were the following. In sentencing the co-offender Huynh for the common offence Judge Urquhart took into account two other offences, namely, the offence of goods in custody and the offence of receiving, whereas no additional offences were taken into account in the sentencing of either of the applicants. The co-offender Huynh had a criminal history, including offences for the possession of drugs and an offence of armed robbery for which he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, whereas neither of the applicants had any criminal antecedents. 
     
      
    21 On the other hand the co-offender Huynh was sentenced on the basis of findings made by Judge Urquhart that his role in the commission of the offence was less than that of the applicants, that he was addicted to heroin, that he had become addicted to heroin through misfortune rather than choice following his motor vehicle accident, and that he was dealing in heroin for the purpose of financing his own addiction. Judge Morgan found that neither of the applicants was addicted to heroin or even a user of heroin and that each of them was dealing in heroin for his or her own commercial gain. 
     
      
    22 It is true that the extent to which the circumstance that an offender committed an offence because of addiction to drugs can be taken into account as a circumstance of mitigation in sentencing the offender is very limited. See The Queen v Henry (1992) 46 NSWLR 346. However, the fact that an offender who is being sentenced for an offence of dealing in drugs committed the offence, not for the purpose of feeding an addiction, but purely for the purpose of making a commercial profit, is an important circumstance of aggravation.  
     
      
    23 Having endeavoured to weigh the factors which would tend to suggest that, leaving aside Huynh’s plea of guilty, there should have been some disparity in favour of the applicants between the sentences passed on the applicants and the sentence passed on Huynh and the factors which would tend to suggest that it would be more appropriate to pass a heavier sentence on the applicants than on the offender Huynh, I have ultimately reached the conclusion that this Court should not intervene in the sentences passed by her Honour on the grounds of lack of parity or appropriate disparity.  
     
      
    24 I would also reject the submission which was made in the written submissions, but not really pressed in oral argument, that the sentences were manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    25 In my opinion, while leave to appeal should be granted to each applicant to appeal against the sentence, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    26 GROVE J: I agree. 
     
      
    27 BARR J: I also agree. 
     
      
    28 GROVE J: The orders of the court therefore will be in each appeal that leave to appeal against sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BRYSON JA: The applicant Ms Drew seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on her by his Honour Judge Christie QC in the District Court at Port Macquarie on 4 December 2003. The principal offence for which she was then sentenced was car-jacking in aggravated circumstances contrary to s.154C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the statutory maximum penalty is fourteen years imprisonment. The applicant was sentenced for that offence to imprisonment for five years commencing on 4 September 2003 with a non-parole period of three years also commencing on 4 September 2003.  
     
      
    2 At the same time the applicant was convicted of and sentenced for four other offences under the procedure in s.166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. These offences and the sentences imposed are as follows:  
     
      
       
       Drive speed dangerous 
       s.42(2) of Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 
       Fixed term of 9 months imprisonment from 4/9/03 to 3/6/04Disqualified from driving for 3 years from 4/9/03

       Fined $50 
       
      
     
     
      
       
      Imprisonment under these sentences was concurrent with the principal sentence, and the terms have expired. Submissions in support of the appeal were directed to the principal sentence. 
       
      
    3 The Statement of Facts in evidence before the District Court was as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        DREW has approached the victim’s vehicle and began her fist into the drives window. The victim saw DREW had a pair of white handled scissors in her hand. DREW said, ""Give me the fucking keys you slut"". The victim refused to give DREW the keys. 
         
         
        DREW reached through the partially open window and punched the victim in the face. DREW grabbed the keys from the ignition. The victim attempted to get the keys back off DREW however DREW punched her in the face again. DREW began walking back away from the vehicle. DREW picked up a rock and threw it towards the vehicle, causing the rear drivers side window to shatter. 
         
         
        As a result of DREW punching the victim, she suffered bruising, swelling and soreness to her face. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The victim and Witnesses, STONE and DUNCOMBE feared for their safety and ran inside to number 17 Granite Street, Port Macquarie. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A short time later as they were waiting for Police, witness MARKOVICZ has walked to his front porch and saw DREW driving away in the victim's vehicle. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        DREW drove down Hill street, onto Lake Rd and past the Private Hospital and lost control of the vehicle, crossing to the incorrect side of the road, mounted the footpath, causing the vehicle to roll, coming to rest colliding with a parked vehicle outside a block of units at 105 Lake road. 
        
       
       
        
         
        DREW got out of the vehicle and left the vehicle when several occupants of 105 Lake road attended the scene of the accident. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        On the 1st of September 2003 Port Macquarie Crash Investigations attended the scene of the accident. The physical evidence supports a speed of the vehicle at the time of DREW losing control as being above 110km/h in a 60km/h area. Had the vehicle driven by DREW not impacted with the parked vehicle, DREW's vehicle would have continued to travel into the bedroom of a villa which is occupied by an elderly female. 
         
         
        On Thursday the 4th of September 2003 DREW was arrested by Police. DREW agreed to participate in [an] Electronically recorded interview where she made full admissions to the incident. DREW further stated she began drinking around 10am on Sunday morning (31/8/2003). DREW stated she consumed at least four bourbon and coles, a carton of beer and a Goonie (wine). 
        
       
      
    4 The applicant co-operated fully with the police from a time soon after her arrest on 4 September 2003, and admitted the relevant facts in an electronically recorded interview on that day. She made no steps towards defending the charges, and pleaded guilty at the first and each available opportunity.5 The applicant was born on 9 November 1981. She had many previous convictions. Most of her earlier offences were dealt with in Children’s Courts and included assaults, stealing, robbery in company, malicious damage in various forms of these and lesser offences. The most severe sentences were several imposing control orders which led to her detention in a Juvenile Institution and one imposing one hundred hours of community service. Her previous convictions as an adult were as follows:

    6 The bond entered into on the suspended sentence on 28 October 2002 was still current when the offence now relevant was committed on 31 August 2003. The applicant served short terms of imprisonment during the term of the bond. It was not made clear to his Honour, and it appears that his Honour was not aware, that the bond entered into on 28 October 2002 was still current at the time of the offence now relevant.7 In his Remarks on Sentence the learned Sentencing Judge referred to the applicant’s prior record. The motivation for the applicant’s taking the vehicle as explained in her evidence and it would seem accepted by his Honour was that she did so in the hope of attracting the attention of Mr Leon Markievicz. His Honour made observations and findings on events in the applicant’s life which have been markedly unfortunate. Passages in the Remarks on Sentence include the following:  
     
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The young lady has not been the subject of any pre-sentence report but I have a fairly good picture of her background. She is not in touch with her father whom I gather from remarks from the Bar Table resides in the Wagga Wagga district. Her mother apparently has a new partner in life and resides somewhere in the Coffs Harbour area so that obviously this young lady has been obliged to fend for herself for some significant period of time. I am entitled to assume, probably for a good deal of her semi-adult life and she has accumulated an unenviable number of convictions some of them for not inconsequential matters by any stretch of the imagination. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The attraction -it would seem - for a young man named Leon Markowitz led her into some previous difficulties and I am told by her from the witness box in response to questions from her own representative that those malicious damage matters that saw her in prison for five months are in some way related to her attempts to make contact or attract the attention of this particular young fellow. 
         
        
        
        So that the events of this particular night, 31 August [2003] also seemed to have their aetiology in much the same circumstance. The young lady goes - obviously heavily inebriated one would assume and all the facts seem to indicate it - heavily under the influence of liquor she goes and sits outside in the gutter somewhere nearby the premises at which she is expecting to see or possibly speak with or attract the attention of this young man, Leon Markowitz. He is dropped home in a car round about a quarter to 10 on a Sunday night and he gets out of the car and goes into the house. 
        
       
      
    8 In relation to the scissors, the weapon which constituted circumstances of aggravation under s.154C(2), his Honour found:  
     
      
       
        
        Obviously at that time possessed of a pair of scissors. The scissors were white handled scissors and were seen not only by the person, the driver whom she subsequently punched but by other occupants of the car. I am inclined to accept and indeed I do accept that the prisoner is of the belief that she was not possessed of these scissors and did not have them and that the scissors found in the car later on must have belonged to the previous occupants of the car, that is the persons who were in the car when Leon got out of it. 
         
         
        Her representative, Mr [Magney], appears to be in possession of some information that the scissors came from the premises at which this young lady was boarding and indeed I think by and large the offender accepts that she had possession of the scissors but does not accept that in any way she attacked the driver of the car with the 
         scissors.  
        
       
      
    9 With respect to the assault his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        She appears to have struck the driver at least twice with a closed fist, that is the right fist and at that time the left hand was seen to be possessed of the scissors. She struck the lady a couple of times causing injury...That assault of course constituted by the striking of a number of blows to this 18 year old girl's face. 
        
       
       
      (I interpose that a back-up charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm was withdrawn and dismissed). 
       
      
    10 After dealing with the facts and events constituting the offence his Honour remarked on the good fortune that the applicant injured no other person. His Honour also made findings establishing that the applicant had been drinking most of the day, was a heavy imbiber of alcohol, and that her intoxication explained why she did not remember a great deal about the events. Dealing with elements subjective to the applicant his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        This lady has a deprived background. I do not think she would mind my saying that. She left school before the end of Year 9 aged about fifteen, she tells me. I have no reason to disbelieve that. She has never been fortunate enough to have employment but hopefully that situation can be remedied upon her return to the community and consequently she - by reason of the absence of her parents - has obviously been left without any real support or sense of direction so that she has been adrift emotionally and sociologically for some years at the very least and possibly I strongly suspect for somewhat longer than that. 
         
         
        So that if ever there was a case with strong subjective circumstances this is probably it because there will be a profit in the community and certainly a profit for the prisoner in her eventual rehabilitation. She will need to mend her ways in connection with alcohol consumption obviously, at least to the extent that it appears to have dominated her life leading up to this event. She has not been long out of gaol. She has been in custody now since 4 September and she only got out of custody on the previous occasion - a date in early April to which I earlier referred - 23 April, so she has been out of gaol for about sixteen or seventeen weeks and finds herself back there. She has been in there now for three months not knowing of course the length and breadth of her sentence and informed thinking with which I happen to agree is that persons who are within the custodial system not knowing how long they will be there find that time 
          
        passes significantly more slowly than otherwise would be the case. For all I know she may have been held in the remand section which of course is not as satisfactory as persons who are serving a sentence and consequently have their time filled in somewhat better. 
        
       
      
    11 In the opening words of the Remarks on Sentence his Honour said “She has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity …” and later said:  
     
      
       
        
        She pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Mind you I think I would be forgiven for saying that the Crown case is strong to the degree of irresistible if ever there was an irresistible case. Most of the people who were in this car knew this girl. Knew her by sight. Knew who she was. So there was never much chance of her not being convicted of this offence and the associated offences ...  
        
       
      
    12 Ground 1 for which the applicant’s Senior Counsel contended was “The sentencing Judge erred in the manner in which he took into account the applicant’s plea of guilty.” 
     
      
    13 Although his Honour referred, twice, to the applicant’s having pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, he did not indicate, either in detail or in any way, however general, that that consideration had had any influence in his determination of the sentence to be imposed. A plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity raises for consideration whether the sentence to be imposed should be discounted so as to have regard to the utilitarian value in the public interest of an early plea of guilty. It is usual to articulate clearly whether or not an allowance of some kind is made for this consideration, and it is also usual, on the basis of observations in Regina v. Thomson; Regina v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 to express the allowance made by adopting some percentage in the range from 10 to 25 percent. It is not erroneous to give a less than complete exposition of the reasoning process, and it is not erroneous to explain the reasoning process in some other way than by reference to a percentage of the sentence first adopted, but if these almost conventional means of expression are adopted there are advantages in the comprehensibility and openness of the reasoning process.  
     
      
    14 Not only is there no express indication elsewhere in the Remarks on Sentence that an allowance or discount for the utilitarian value of the early plea was made, it is a plain error to bring the strength of the Crown case to bear on consideration of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty and what influence it should have on sentence actually to be imposed; his Honour’s reference to the early plea is followed immediately by observations about the strength of the Crown case and the difficulties of any defence, had there been a defence. It has been established by decisions of this Court and in the clearest way that the strength of the Crown case is not a relevant consideration in relation to whether an allowance should be made for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty and what that allowance should be. A full and clear exposition of the law appears in Regina v. Thomson; Regina v Houlton in the judgment of Spigelman CJ, and many decisions which give emphasis to the law are collected in the judgment of Howie J in Regina v. Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [11-13].  
     
      
    15 I must respectfully say that from the manner and context in which the learned Judge referred to the significance of the early plea, and from the absence of any other observation explaining its significance, it appears quite clearly that his Honour did not make a correct application of the law on this very important aspect of determination of the sentence. Flawed reasoning on this important part of the discretionary process has the consequence that his Honour’s exercise of discretion must be set aside, and the process of sentencing should be undertaken again by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 16 There are other respects in which the learned Judge’s determination appears to be open to review. When determining the non-parole period his Honour was referred specifically to s.54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and its provision (at Item 15 of the Table) of a minimum non-parole period of 5 years in relation to an offence under s.154C(2). His Honour referred to a number of circumstances, including several mitigating considerations and general circumstances, which led him to adopt a non-parole period of less than five years in dealing with the applicant; however his Honour did not expressly refer to the law as explained in Regina v. Way [2004] NSWCCA 131 at [71] under which a standard non-parole period is not applied on conviction upon a plea of guilty. In addition to the lack of express advertence to the standard non-parole period’s not being applicable, his Honour also did not give express advertence to the circumstance adverse to the applicant that the offence occurred while the bond under s.12 was still current.  
     
      
    17 His Honour referred extensively and in my view correctly to adverse subjective circumstances of the applicant, whose life and emergence into adulthood have been disrupted by unusually adverse influences, which seem to have made her unable to bring her life into order and control in her own interests. These subjective circumstances included the lack of parental guidance during the applicant’s highly troubled adolescence, the lack of employment and of a cultural base for employment, irresponsible abuse of alcohol, and severe signs of poor social integration and control, evidenced by repeated offences arising out of social conflict, aggression towards other people and irresponsibility towards other people’s property. As the learned Judge said: “she… has obviously been left without any real support or sense of direction so that she has been adrift emotionally and sociologically for some years at the very least … There will be profit for the community and certainly a profit for the prisoner in her eventual rehabilitation.”  
     
      
    18 The offence was a serious one and involved aggression in conduct and speech, repeated personal violence against the driver, continued and aggressive pursuit of the project of seizing the keys and taking control of the vehicle, and when taking and driving the vehicle, doing so in a markedly irresponsible way causing it to overturn and collide with another vehicle, in circumstances of public danger, fortunately unrealised. However this is not a grave instance in the range of conduct which could constitute aggravated car-jacking and fall within s.154C(2).. Some aspects of the offence were punished in concurrent sentences which have expired. The applicant’s prior record and breach of bond are adverse to her. . In my view consideration should begin with a sentence of five years imprisonment, and after a discount for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty the sentence should be four years. The applicant’s subjective circumstances and relative youth mean that an unusually lengthy proportion of the term should be available for parole. There is a public interest, as well as an interest personal to the applicant, in there being a full opportunity for rehabilitation. In the applicant’s circumstances the sentence should be significantly weighted towards an opportunity for parole. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion the Court of Criminal Appeal should make the following orders: 
     
      
    (1) The applicant is granted leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    (2) The sentence imposed upon the applicant by the District Court at Port Macquarie on 4 December 2003 on conviction of aggravated assault with intent to take a motor vehicle while armed with an offensive weapon under s.154C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is set aside. 
     
      
    (3) In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for four years to commence from 4 September 2003 and to expire on 3 September 2007, with a non-parole period of two years to commence on 4 September 2003 and expire on 3 September 2005. The applicant will become eligible for release to parole on 3 September 2005.

      Facts: 
       The Appellant stood trial and was convicted on a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of narcotic goods, namely “ecstasy” tablets to the value of between $7.2M and $12M. He was sentenced on 19 December 2003 to imprisonment for fourteen years with a non-parole period of nine years. The tablets had been concealed in 48 columns in a shipping container which was transported by ship from Belgium. They were intercepted in Brisbane by Customs and Police, who initiated a controlled delivery.  
      
     
     
      
      The Crown case was that the Appellant’s knowing concern was demonstrated by his participation in the unloading of the columns after they were delivered to premises in Sydney owned by him, in the examination of the columns and sorting of tablets removed in a search for genuine ecstasy among the inert tablets, and in making extensive inquiries as to the whereabouts of the balance of the consignment which he, and his brothers suspected had been stolen either by those involved in the European end of the shipment, or by associates who had been responsible for the clearance and initial delivery of the container into a warehouse in Brisbane. The Appellant’s case was that he was innocently unaware of, and had no knowledge of the importation until December 1 when his brothers came to him for advice, by which time, it was contended, the importation process had ended. 
      
     
     
      
      Ground 1 
       - His Honour erred in admitting into evidence the words spoken by his brother who clearly was a Principal, “Steven ate two,” on the occasion of the unloading and examination of the columns in Sydney on 24 November 2001 during an intercepted telephone call. 
       
      Held 
      : The words were properly to be regarded as being spoken in the furtherance of the common purpose, there being sufficient prima facie circumstantial evidence to satisfy the  
      Tripodi 
       test of preconcert from at least the morning of 24 November:  
      R v Tripodi v The Queen 
       (1961) 104 CLR 1. 
      
     
     
      
      Ground 2 
       - His Honour erred in admitting into evidence references to possible past and future importations of drugs found in intercepted telephone calls and recorded conversations to which the Appellant was a party. 
       
      Held 
      : The evidence was relevant and probative as to the Appellant’s participation in the importation by showing his knowledge of what was involved:  
      Harriman v The Queen 
       (1989) 167 CLR 590 applied.  
      
     
     
      
      Ground 3 
       - His Honour erred in not discharging the jury when the jury sent a note expressing concern over the inappropriate behaviour of a person in the public gallery.  
       
      Held 
      : The trial judge gave appropriate directions to the jury and there was no risk of a miscarriage of justice or need for a discharge of the jury.  
      
     
     
      
      Ground 4 
       - His Honour erred in his directions concerning being “knowingly concerned in the importation.”  
       
      Held 
      : The directions were adequate and sufficiently explained what was involved in the concept of being knowingly concerned in an importation in accordance with the principles established, for example in  
      R v Courtney-Smith 
       (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49. 
      
     
     
      
      Ground 5 
       - His Honour erred in playing to the jury a recording of the whole of his summing up during the jury deliberations. 
       
      Held 
      : The discretion (see  
      R v Taousanis 
       [1999] NSWSC 107) was appropriately exercised by the trial judge in the context of a lengthy trial, following a request by the jury for a transcript of the summing up.  
      
     
     
      
      Additional ground of appeal 
       -The summing up of the learned trial judge was not balanced and leant too far towards the Crown. 
       
      Held 
      : The summing up was comprehensive, correct and properly balanced.  
      
     
     
      
      Ground 6 
       - The verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.  
       
      Held 
      : The process of importation is an extended and flexible concept (see  
      R v Lam  
      (1990) 46 A Crim R 402;  
      R v Courtney-Smith 
        
      (No. 2) 
       (1990) 48 A Crim R 49; and  
      R v Leff 
       (1996) 86 A Crim R 212 and may include recovery, unpacking, storage and anything done in direct proximity, incidental to, or proximate to the bringing of goods into the country. In this context, the conduct of the Appellant (after 24 November) amounted to a knowing concern on his part, the importation process still being on foot during the period when the Appellant rendered assistance to the Principal in seeking to recover the drugs. There was a proper evidentiary basis for the jury to reach their verdict and they ought not have had a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.  
      
     
     
      
      Crown appeal against leniency of sentence and Applicant’s appeal against sentence 
       
      Held 
      : No appealable error was shown. The sentence was warranted in law. Conviction and appeals against sentence dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 WOOD CJ at CL: The Appellant stood trial, together with his brother Paul Tony Sukkar, on a charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of narcotic goods, consisting of not less than a commercial quantity of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (“Ecstasy”) tablets. To that charge he entered a plea of not guilty. After a trial lasting two months he was found to be guilty of that offence. He was sentenced on 19 December 2003 to imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 9 years, each to date from the time of his arrest, namely 5 December 2001. 
     
      
    2 The Appellant now appeals against the conviction, and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. The Crown appeals against the leniency of the sentence.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 On 17 November 2001, the ecstasy tablets the subject of the charge arrived in Brisbane on board the P&O Nedlloyd vessel Tuaranga. They had been transported from Belgium, via Singapore, concealed in 48 columns, which purported to be parts of a portable coolroom. They were packed into a 40 foot shipping container consigned to CJ Trade Consultants Pty Limited, a company which had been registered in April 1999 as part of business venture between Huynh Joon (John) Choi and the Appellant and of which the Appellant, Choi and Louis Sukkar were originally listed as directors.  
     
      
    4 After the cargo was landed it was intercepted by Customs and Police who removed the 480,000 tablets concerned from the columns which were repacked with tablets of an inert substance together with a smaller amount of the original tablets (13,000) for the purpose of allowing a controlled delivery pursuant to a certificate granted to the National Crime Authority. The total consignment of drugs had a bulk weight of 123.75 kgs, or 34.401 kgs of pure ecstasy, with a wholesale value of between $7.2M and $12M.  
     
      
    5 Listening devices were placed in the container and in a warehouse in Brisbane, which had been leased by Maurice Shepherd and to which the container was transported. Telephonic interception began in relation to the services of a number of suspects and video cameras were installed in the warehouse.  
     
      
    6 The container was unpacked in the warehouse by Shepherd and Glen Bourke, and the 48 columns together with some other parts of the cool room were loaded onto a truck which had been leased by Louis Sukkar. It was then driven by Bourke to Kempsey. Louis Sukkar, Choi and another person followed it in a motor vehicle, which Choi had rented. At Kempsey Louis Sukkar took over the driving of the truck, which arrived at 84 Consett Street, Concord West on the morning of 24 November. Bourke was a general handyman who had been used by the Appellant and Choi when they had conducted a restaurant business. He had also been used by other members of the Sukkar family, and on this occasion he had been given advance knowledge of the components within the container that contained the narcotics.  
     
      
    7 The premises at Consett Street had recently been purchased by the Appellant. They were occupied by Louis Sukkar, Michelle Royal and an Asian student who was boarding there. Surveillance was maintained, and from 27 November listening devices were installed.  
     
      
    8 Shortly after midday, the Appellant arrived at the premises, where he remained until about 4 PM.  
     
      
    9 During part of the afternoon, the truck was unloaded, and the columns were initially placed in a garage and later moved to a garden shed. During the period that the Appellant was at the premises Joseph Sukkar and John Choi were also present. He was observed to be assisting in carrying columns from the truck. 
     
      
    10 During that afternoon it appeared that the columns were examined and the contents removed from at least some of them. In the course of that activity it is evident from the telephone calls which Louis Sukkar made that he became aware of the substitution of the tablets. These calls were made to Joseph Sukkar. 
     
      
    11 During one call to Joseph Sukkar, Louis Sukkar said, when reporting that there was “nothing to check” that the Appellant had eaten two of the tablets during the unpacking, and that he as well as his girlfriend had similarly eaten some tablets.  
     
      
    12 Objection was taken to the admission into evidence of this observation, and it gives rise to one of the grounds of appeal to which I will return.  
     
      
    13 After 4.00 PM the Appellant left the premises with Choi and together they went to a restaurant or cafe in Strathfield. He returned after 6.00 PM but remained there for only about six minutes.  
     
      
    14 Over the following week the Appellant attended the premises on Sunday 25th, Monday 26th, Tuesday 27th, Friday 30th, and Saturday 1st December 2001. During that week there were many telephone calls made, involving Louis Sukkar, Joseph Sukkar, and Choi that were intercepted, and which were admitted into evidence, along with the product of the conversations that were intercepted by the listening devices which had been installed in the premises. Video recordings of the activities that occurred were also tendered. In the main the conversations during this period were concerned with attempts to bring together the documentation that had been used in connection with the importation in case it shone a light on when and where the substitution had been effected.  
     
      
    15 Late in the afternoon of 1 December whilst Louis Sukkar, Joseph Sukkar and the Appellant were at 84 Consett Street, arrangements were made for a barbeque at Joseph Sukkar’s home, which all three then attended.  
     
      
    16 During that evening the Appellant was a party to a number of telephone calls, that were obviously directed towards discovering how, when and where the substitution had been made, and whether one of the various parties involved in the importation other than a member of the Sukkar family had obtained the drugs.  
     
      
    17 On 2 December 2001 the Appellant, Joseph Sukkar, Paul Sukkar and Louis Sukkar gathered at 84 Consett St. A number of columns were examined and opened and a sorting process was undertaken in which the genuine ecstasy tablets were separated from the substituted tablets. The empty columns were loaded on to a truck which had been leased, and were then taken by Paul Sukkar to a storeroom in Granville. The substitute and genuine tablets remained at Consett Street. After the empty columns had been removed and most, if not all, of the sorting had been finished, the Appellant left the premises.  
     
      
    18 The movements of those who were suspected of being involved in the importation were kept under surveillance during 3, 4, and 5 December. Recordings of telephone calls and of conversations intercepted by listening devices between 1 and 5 December were tendered, along with video recordings of the activities and Consett Street.  
     
      
    19 On 5 December 2003, the Appellant was arrested and charged. It is obvious from the conversations to which I will return, in a little more detail, that Joseph and Louis Sukkar, who were clearly involved as principals, initially suspected that the substitution had occurred at the European end. Later, largely as a result of the Appellant’s inquiries, the blame shifted to John Choi. Somewhat inadvisedly, although perhaps out of misplaced confidence, they did not give serious consideration to a lawful interception by the authorities. 
     
      
    20 Although it was the Crown case that the Appellant had been knowingly concerned in the importation before 24 November, it accepted that there was no direct evidence of that being the case. Rather, its case in that regard was circumstantial, being pursued upon the basis that his attendances on 24 November and 2 December had not been a mere coincidence, and upon the further basis that a fair understanding of the many telephone calls, which he made, showed his knowing involvement in the venture before 24 November.  
     
      
    21 The Crown also contended that his actions in seeking to locate and remove any more genuine ecstasy tablets, which were still in the columns, on 2 December 2001, and to find who had taken the balance of the tablets were themselves actions which constitute his knowing concern in the importation, it being contended that the importation process was still on foot while attempts were being made to find and to recover the genuine tablets.  
     
      
    22 It was the case of the Appellant, who was the youngest member of the Sukkar family, and a practising solicitor, that he had known nothing of the importation until the evening of 1 December.  
     
      
    23 In his evidence he said that he had attended the Consett Street premises for the first time in his life on 24 November. Its purchase had been arranged by Louis Sukkar out of the profits from the sale of another house which he had owned and which had been renovated by Louis Sukkar. The arrangements which were made were similar to those pertaining to the previous house, in that Louis Sukkar was to live there and to renovate it.  
     
      
    24 He accepted that he had helped unload the truck on 24 November, but did so innocently unaware of the assumed presence of drugs in the columns. He denied tasting any of the tablets. He accepted that he had gone to Strathfield with Choi, but denied that this had any relationship to the importation of narcotics. Choi’s presence at the house, he said, had been unexpected, and there was nothing unusual, that he could see, in Joseph or Louis calling in that day, which was a Saturday. 
     
      
    25 Choi, he said, had been a client of his legal practice, whom he had introduced to his brothers because he believed him to be a person with business expertise, who could assist them in their legitimate business activities.  
     
      
    26 He acknowledged having visited Consett Street on a number of occasions during the following week, but said that he did not at any time discuss with his brothers the importation or substitution. His first knowledge of it, he said, was on the night of 1 December when he was asked by his brothers to assist them to ascertain how, when, where and why the substitution had taken place, because of their concern that those at the European end were accusing Joseph Sukkar, and his accomplices, of being guilty of a “rip off”.  
     
      
    27 Thereafter, he said, he made the various telephone calls, to which I will return in more detail when I come to the principal ground of appeal, because of his concern for the safety of his brothers in the event of there being a reprisal from the Europeans. It eventually became his belief, which was communicated to the Europeans, that Choi had been responsible for the substitution, and that it had occurred in Brisbane. 
     
      
    28 It was as a result of this advice to the brothers that a proposal from the European end to send out various persons to investigate the problem, resulted in only one man, Antoun El Hani arriving in this country and being arrested.  
     
      
    29 It is evident, from the various intercepted conversations, that it was Joseph Sukkar who had direct connections with those involved at the European end, including El Hani whom he had known while living in Lebanon. It was the case that Joseph Sukkar had travelled to Europe in October 2001 immediately prior to the despatch of the container.  
     
      
    30 It was also the Appellant’s case that on learning of the importation, he wanted everything connected with it, to be removed from his house. It was to that end, he said, that he went to the premises on 2 December where he assisted in checking the columns and sorting tablets, because he thought that this would facilitate their removal. He explained that while the columns were removed, the tablets had remained because Louis Sukkar had failed to deliver on his promise to remove them.  
     
      
    31 A number of persons have been dealt with by the Courts in relation to this importation. They include Shepherd who pleaded guilty and gave assistance to the authorities. For his role in providing assistance in relation to the clearance of the container, and its reception into the warehouse, in return for a payment of $25,000, he was sentenced, on appeal (R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 287) to imprisonment for 11 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years and 4 months. 
     
      
    32 Another offender who was also convicted of knowingly being concerned in the importation was Simon Sunil Prasad, who had an import/export business, and who was recruited by Choi to take on the role of ensuring the Customs clearance, and to act as a cut-out between Shepherd and Choi and such of the Sukkar brothers as were involved, for a net reward (after payment to Shepherd) of $25,000, plus forgiveness of a debt of about $100,000 owed to Choi. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 8 months.  
     
      
    33 Although this Court held on appeal: (Regina v Prasad [2004] NSWCCA 293) that a proper sentence would have been one of imprisonment for 17 years with a non-parole period of 11 years and 2 months, it dismissed the Crown appeal against leniency, on discretionary grounds. 
     
      
    34 El Hani, who also pleaded guilty and provided some assistance to the authorities, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 years. He was found to be a senior person in the importation who had been sent to Australia to discover what had gone wrong with the importation and to put the matter to rights. 
     
      
    35 The jury were unable to agree on a verdict in relation to Paul Sukkar who had however offered a plea of guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the importation. By the time that the Appellant came to be sentenced, proceedings in respect of Joseph and Louis Sukkar, and Choi, were incomplete.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – His Honour erred in admitting into evidence the words “Steven ate two” included in the intercepted telephone call between Louis and Joseph Sukkar at 19.38.05 hours on 24 November 2001.  
       
      
    36 This call took place after the Appellant had left the premises with Choi at about 4 PM and before his return at about 6 PM. It followed a number of calls that were made by Louis Sukkar to various people, including Choi, in which Louis made mention of being “set up”, and having “some stuff planted.” 
     
      
    37 In the conversation at 19.38.05, the following is recorded (M1: Louis Sukkar; M2: Joseph Sukkar): 
     
      
       
        
        “M1: It’s nothing … I ate about three of them 
         
        … 
         
        M1: There’s nothing and ah MICHELLE ate one STEVEN ate two there’s nothing at all. 
         
        … 
         
        M1: You know when you when you um speak to them over there 
         
        M2: Yeah 
         
        M1: I … think I think you should make it very clear 
         
        M2: Yeah 
         
        M1: That there was an attempted set up 
         
        M2: That’s what I said I just spoke with them just about ten minutes ago”. 
        
       
      
    38 It is evident from the conversations which followed this call that Joseph and Louis were working on the hypothesis that there had been two consignments of drugs on the vessel, that the “other side” had worked a substitution in respect of their consignment, and had given Customs a tip off, yet Customs had mistakenly intercepted the other consignment, an event of which mention had been made in the news on the preceding Wednesday.  
     
      
    39 In allowing the disputed comment into evidence as relevant to a fact in issue, namely the Appellant's “knowledge of the importation”, his Honour had regard to the decisions in Tripodi v The Queen (1961) 104 CLR 1 and R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371. Those decisions establish that where the prosecution case is one involving a number of persons acting in preconcert in the commission of a crime, then once reasonable evidence of the preconcert has been adduced, evidence of directions, instructions, arrangements or utterances accompanying acts given or made by any one of those persons, although in the absence of the others, in furtherance of their common purpose, which constitutes or forms an element of the crime, becomes admissible against the other or others.  
     
      
    40 It was here submitted by the Appellant that: 
     
      
       
      (a) The importation was over by the time of this conversation, and the comment by Louis Sukkar to Joseph Sukkar was not made in furtherance of any common purpose to import the drugs, albeit it was one to which undeniably they had each attached themselves; 
       
       
      (b) There was no evidence that fell into the category of reasonable evidence of preconcert involving the Appellant prior to the evening of 1 December 2001. 
       
      
    41 The reasonable evidence of preconcert does not involve proof beyond reasonable doubt, nor is it confined to direct evidence.  
     
      
    42 In my view, there was prima facie circumstantial evidence of a preconcert in relation to the Appellant arising from the following circumstances:  
     
      
       
      (a) His earlier associations with Bourke and Choi; 
       
       
      (b) The inherent improbability of his brothers delivering a potentially enormous quantity of drugs to his premises, without his knowing consent, combined with evidence pointing to his knowledge of their earlier and ongoing involvement in drug importations;  
       
       
      (c) His involvement in the unpacking activities on the afternoon of 24 November; 
       
       
      (d) His regular attendances at the premises during the following week and the evidence pointing to his knowledge before 1 December of the fact that the tablets had been badly packed; 
       
       
      (e) His involvement in the checking and sorting activities on 2 December; 
       
       
      (f) The tenor of the conversations in which he became involved from 1 December onwards, both with his brothers and with Choi, and in particular his use of the plural when discussing the problem in a way which suggested that he had been a participant in the enterprise. 
       
      
    43 Although not necessarily determinative beyond reasonable doubt of his involvement in the enterprise before 24 November, I am satisfied that these matters constitute sufficient evidence to satisfy the Tripodi test of preconcert from at least that morning. I am also satisfied, for the reasons later set out, that the importation could not be regarded as having been completed by the time of the relevant conversation, and that the words uttered were properly to be regarded as having been spoken by Louis in furtherance of the common purpose.  
     
      
    44 In that regard they clearly related to what was being done in the course of recovering the drugs from the columns or from the possession of whoever then held them. Louis Sukkar was confirming to his brother that there had been a substitution, and was encouraging him to make it clear to the consignor/exporter that there had been an attempted set up. As the immediately following conversation shows it was also known by Louis that there were some genuine ecstasy tablets “sprinkled” among the substituted tablets. The evidence had a potential relevance in so far as it threw light on the assistance provided on 24 November by the Appellant, in so far as it tended to explain his apparent familiarity with the venture when he spoke to Choi on 1 December, and in so far as it tended to show his knowledge of what had been imported in the columns.  
     
      
    45 I am not persuaded that his Honour was in error, either in finding it relevant to a fact in issue, or in declining to exclude it on discretionary grounds.  
     
      
    46 This ground is not made good.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – his Honour erred in admitting into evidence the references to possible past and future importations of drugs which were included in a number of recordings of intercepted telephone calls and in conversations recorded by listening devices.  
       
      
    47 The conversations in question occurred on 1, 2, 3 and 4 December 2001, and in each case the Appellant was a speaker or was present when it took place. The first of those conversations (on 1 December) was between Louis Sukkar and the Appellant. In the course of it the Appellant reported his concerns that Max Messina of Intergroup Shipping, to whom he had spoken in relation to the movements of the container using a false name, was “sussing” him out, and had known what was arriving.  
     
      
    48 The conversation continued (M1: Appellant; M2: Louis Sukkar):  
     
      
       
        
        “M1: He knew it was cool rooms 
         
        M2: Yes but JOHN knew it was cool rooms too 
         
        …  
         
        M2: He knew from  
        last time 
         
        M1: Alright so he knew from last time.” 
        
       
      
    49 The second of these conversations occurred on 2 December, and it was one in which the Appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “SS: …alright you know now we’ll fix it up mate get another one and we’ll do it ourselves  
        next time 
         it’s alright.” 
        
       
      
    50 The third conversation occurred during the tablet sorting, the speakers initially being Louis Sukkar and Paul Sukkar in the course of which there was discussion about Choi having “overstepped the mark this time” and about temptation getting too much for people, although as the Appellant observed “how come it’s never been too much for us”. This was followed by further conversations about there being “over two hundred thousand dollars in there he’s [Choi] not seeing any of that”. A little later that day (at 12:13) the Appellant and Joseph Sukkar discussed future “work”: 
     
      
       
        
        “SS: (wds) wanna do a (wds) for the  
        next one 
         [Pause] aren’t you going to work with him 
         
        JS: (wds) if there’s work why not (wds) Ough if we can do work with the Chinese (wds)” 
        
       
      
    51 At 12:47 on the same day the Appellant and Joseph continued their discussion:  
     
      
       
        
        “SS: Do you think they will  
        still work with you 
         on this shit 
         
        JS: They should still (wds) 
         
        … 
         
        JS: (Wds) better things We’re talking about tens (wds) what would I say we’re talking about a tonne cocaine from Brazil this on its own (wds) me and TONY he said about this cunt (wds)” 
         
        
       
      
    52 At 12:57, after some discussions about sending Tony some money so that he could come (to Australia), the intercepted conversation involving the Appellant, Joseph Sukkar, Louis Sukkar included the following passages: 
     
      
       
        
        “SS keep him happy as much as you can they’ll appreciate what you are doing and then just get started on the  
        next one 
         
        … 
         
        LS Well shall I give him [Choi] a ring right 
         
        … 
         
        PS Just tell him say look the guys are due here in the next couple of days get your arse back here we gotta clear this up 
         
        … 
         
        SS Just say look we need to cover that gap once we cover that gap that’s it we say it’s not our end then we just get onto the  
        next one 
         but tell him see he he’s insisting on that money to make sure that once we pay that fifty then he’s clear he goes oh they really don’t suspect us so we gotta say look JOHN we don’t have anything we can’t pay it please just come and help us organise the  
        next one 
         we’ll use the…” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    53 In a further conversation on the same day (commencing at 13:33) Joseph and Louis discussed five hundred kilos in Brazil and doing “another one”. 
     
      
    54 In a conversation (commencing at 14:20) in which each of the Appellant Joseph Sukkar, Louis Sukkar, Paul Sukkar and an unknown male participated, there was the following exchange:  
     
      
       
        
        “JS JOHN wants one hundred fifty thousand dollars the son of a bitch … 
         
        … 
         
        PS (wd) the way we did the  
        last one 
         (wd) even bigger one” 
        
       
       
      
    55 The final conversation on 2 December 2001 of relevance in relation to this ground (at 17:05) involved the following exchange between the Appellant and Joseph Sukkar: 
     
      
       
        
        “JS We should now do something nice we should (wds) the man’s goods JOHN whatever you can get off JOHN and we’ll  
        do one more 
         (wds) 
         
        SS What’s it worthwhile (wds) 
         
        JS Believe me  
        you’ll 
         do very nice money in the next two months 
         
        SS Alright” 
        
       
       
      
    56 Then on 3 December there was a discussion between the Appellant (SS), Michelle Royal (MR) and Louis Sukkar (LS) (at 19:11:37) in relation to the Appellant’s apparent discovery that the pipes in the columns were Australian made. That conversation included the following exchange:  
     
      
       
        
        “SS The pipes inside were fucking Australian made 
         
        MR How do you know 
         
        SS I saw it it just fucking jerried with me about an hour ago 
         
        LS They’re exactly the same pipes as last time 
         
        MR Really it says made in Australia 
         
        SS No they’re Australian fucking made 
         
        LS They came in the same pipes as  
        last time 
         
        SS No they’re not no they’re not Paul’s looking at them up there he’s got the ones last time  
         
        LS Has he 
         
        SS Yeah he’s still got the fridge from  
        the last one 
         
        LS And he compared exactly the pipes 
         
        SS He did I told him to he did they’re different 
         
        LS They wouldn’t have needed to change the pipes 
         
        SS LOUI you can’t open those pipes without breaking them” 
        
       
       
      
    57 There was further discussion at 18:04:50 about the tubing in Paul Sukkar’s possession, in which Paul Sukkar confirmed that he had checked them and had found that they were solid foam, and in which the Appellant asked him to check if the other tubes were Australian made.  
     
      
    58 This evidence was not led as tendency or coincidence evidence. Rather the Crown relied upon it as establishing the nature of the Appellant’s relationship with those who were obviously principals in the importation and as being contradictory of the defence case that he had been a late and reluctant conscript after the importation had ceased. Objection was taken to its tender as being prejudicial and as not being probative in relation to the fact in issue, namely whether the Appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation.  
     
      
    59 The admissibility of this evidence was in my view properly established, in accordance with the line of authority that was settled in Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590, esp at 594 per Brennan J and applied in Regina v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 519 and R v Chan (2002) 131 A Crim R 66. Each provides an example of a case where conversations, or conduct, relating to other offences involving the importation or supply of drugs, were received into evidence in order to establish the true nature either of the charged transaction, or of the relationship between those involved.  
     
      
    60 The evidence was, in my view, admissible upon the same basis, not as tendency or coincidence evidence, but as being relevant, and probative, in relation to the defence case. That case was to the effect that the Appellant had no knowledge of the importation, or of his brother’s activities, prior to the evening of 1 December, and thereafter only behaved, in the way that he did, out of an urgent desire to have the incriminatory material removed from his property, and also to assist his brothers in establishing, to the satisfaction of the European end, that they had not “ripped off” the drugs.  
     
      
    61 The portions of those conversations to which objection was taken, were admitted by his Honour as being relevant to the Appellant’s knowledge of the nature of the importations and of his knowing involvement in the present one. His Honour also made it clear that he would give a direction that the evidence was received on this basis, and was not to be used by way of tendency reasoning. I am not persuaded that he was in error in finding that the evidence was relevant to a fact in issue, or in declining to reject the evidence on discretionary grounds.  
     
      
    62 The asserted concern that the Appellant had to remove the incriminatory material is somewhat hollow, having regard to the obvious belief of the brothers, and of the Appellant, that someone other than law enforcement authorities had intercepted the consignment, and that they had in fact targeted a quite separate consignment, and also having regard to the fact that the tablets remained on the premises up to 5 December.  
     
      
    63 Together the conversations show that the Appellant was well aware of the nature of the unlawful operations in which his brothers had engaged and which they had planned. The terms in which he spoke showed his acquiescence in and support for those activities and were clearly relevant to show the nature of his participation in the events which commenced, so far as he was concerned, from 24 November 2001. The obvious familiarity which he had with their activities, and the confidence which they had in speaking to him, clearly emerges from the references to past and future dealings, and in particular to the tubing or pipes which had been involved in this and in an earlier importation.  
     
      
    64 The use by the Appellant of the plural in relation to “our end” and to what they (“we” or “us”) had done or proposed for the “next one”, was relevant to the issue of his involvement in the transaction, and to the time that his participation began.  
     
      
    65 While it would not be enough for the Crown to show that the Appellant was concerned, in the sense of worried, that his brothers had imported narcotics, or that he simply knew that they had done so, the conversations, in which he became engaged, and the terms in which he spoke, particularly when read in the context of the somewhat violent response which he had in mind in relation to Choi, pointed in the direction of his knowing involvement in the transaction, and were admissible as relevant in relation to that issue. 
     
      
    66 It was evidence that was contradictory of the proposition that the Appellant had only been brought into the inner sanctum, innocently, and after the importation had been completed, to assist his brothers out of concern for their welfare at the hands of the aggrieved suppliers from the European end. As the Crown put it on appeal “the comfortable and knowledgeable manner in which the Appellant spoke of past and future importations” was clearly relevant to a consideration of his relationship with his brothers, and of the reason for, and nature of, his conduct from 24 November 2001.  
     
      
    67 This ground is not made good.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – his Honour erred in not discharging the jury when the jury sent a note expressing concern about a person behaving inappropriately in the public gallery. 
       
      
    68 This ground arose by reason of a note, which was sent by the jury on the 30th day of the trial, expressing concern that a young man in the public gallery appeared to have had in his possession a mobile phone, possibly a video phone, that had been pointed in their direction. The Appellant, who had been giving evidence at the time, indicated that he had seen a young lady, whom he knew, although not favourably, come into the Court during the afternoon, and that he had also seen a young man, whom he did not know, come into the Court. The young man remained unidentified, despite the inquiries that were made when an application for discharge of the jury was made. Later it emerged that the lady was observed making signs in the direction of the Appellant, while he was giving evidence. No application was made in this regard, although the lady was removed from the Court.  
     
      
    69 The Appellant submitted that the jury may have been concerned about their own security, in relation to these events, and that there was a risk that they would have connected them with the Appellant, resulting in a risk of prejudice to his case.  
     
      
    70 His Honour dealt with each of these matters by way of an appropriate direction to the jury.  
     
      
    71 In relation to the note, he said:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “I have your note which reads as follows “your Honour several members of the jury noted that yesterday after lunch a young man in the public gallery was behaving inappropriately. Although we have been reassured that video phones were not permitted in the building several of us thought he had a mobile phone possibly a video phone and was pointing it in our direction. 
        
       
       
        
        As a result of that note, I have taken steps to try and determine what did transpire yesterday and as to whether there were any photographs or films taken. I have taken further steps to ensure that it hasn’t and cannot happen. Please be assured that everything is being done to that end. Such an events (sic) if it did happen can have no bearing on this trial and you can and should not speculate on its meaning and nothing could be attributed in any way to the accused in relation to this event. 
        
       
       
        
        I propose to give you further directions at the end of the trial when I sum up in relation to that.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    72 In relation to the signs, he said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, I understand before we adjourned there was someone sitting at the back of the Court supposedly making signs to the witness, and I must say I didn’t see this, but some of you may have seen this. I just wish to say to you that person has been removed. But it has nothing to do with the accused and there is nothing that has come about because of him, and if things were seen, that should simply be ignored.” 
        
       
      
    73 He returned to the matter in the summing up, in so far as he observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “You may recall that I directed you at the time that this conduct had no connection with the accused. I repeat that direction, that this activity was not related in any way to either of the accused and that incident forms no part of the evidence and can from no part of the trial and cannot be used in any way adverse to the accused, and it should not be speculated upon.” 
        
       
      
    74 The directions given by the learned trial judge were appropriate to the circumstances which had arisen. There was no risk of a miscarriage of justice, or occasion for the jury to be discharged as a result of what occurred.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – his Honour erred in his directions concerning “being knowingly concerned in the importation”. 
       
      
    75 During the course of the trial, counsel were provided by his Honour with a draft of the relevant direction, and were invited to indicate any amendment which they sought. In the course of the submissions which followed, reference was made to the decisions in R v Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R 402 and R v Doney (1988) 37 A Crim R 288. 
     
      
    76 In Lam the Court of Criminal Appeal quoted with approval portions of the directions which had been given by the trial judge, including the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “The part played by the person accused of being knowingly concerned must be played before or during the importation, including before or during all that is involved in such importation. He must be implicated or involved in the sense of having something to do with the importation and the importation includes all that is incidental or proximate to the act of importation,  
        but it does not include the use, transportation or disposal of the goods after everything proximate and incidental to the importation has been completed. 
        ” 
         
        
       
      
    77 His Honour included this direction, save for the part in italics. However he provided examples of conduct that could involve being knowingly concerned in the importation both before and after the arrival of the goods. It was the inclusion of that portion of the summing up, particularly that relating to post arrival events which, it is now submitted, gave rise to error.  
     
      
    78 The direction which was given needs to be considered in full. It was as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “Knowingly concerned in, this is the element of the offence which is at the heart of the dispute in this trial. Firstly, what does it mean to be concerned in an importation? The concern to which the section speaks is not concern personal to the accused in the sense of being in his mind, but it is a concern which can be demonstrated objectively by reference to his association with the importation. It must be shown that he is concerned in, not just concerned about, the importation. A person would not be guilty of the offence of being knowingly concerned in an importation merely from his knowledge of the importation and his state of mind. Before he could be convicted, he would have to do something to connect himself with or involve himself in the importation. 
        
       
       
        
        To be concerned in an offence means to do something which involves a practical connection with the offence and all that is involved in the offence. Merely to stand by with knowledge of an importation and to do nothing is not to be concerned with it. However, if a person waits with knowledge with a view to doing something to facilitate the importation, or do something concerned with the importation that would amount to being knowingly concerned in the importation. These things must be done before or during the importation, that is, before or during all the things that are involved in importation.  
        
       
       
        
        The importation is the whole process of making available in Australia goods from overseas. It includes all that is incidental or proximate to the act of importation. That is, the importation does not finish the moment the goods are landed or even the moment they are cleared through customs, but extends to all matters and events which are directly related or proximate or incidental to the importation. That is, to the whole process of making the goods available in Australia. Importation is the continuing process or venture and extends to both sides of the actual act of importing to all matters which are directly related or proximate or incidental to the act of importation. 
        
       
       
        
        The venture or process of the importation can begin before the narcotic goods are placed aboard the craft or vessel by which they are brought into Australia and can continue after the act of importation. For example, prior to the actual act of importing narcotic goods into Australia from overseas, the process or venture of the importation can include such things as the payment for the narcotic goods, their packaging and concealment and their delivery to a courier or a freight forwarding agent or craft or vessel and their transport into Australia. Similarly, after the actual act of importing narcotic goods into Australia, the process or venture of the importation can include such things as picking up the narcotic goods following their arrival in Australia, delivering items to another person or elsewhere and packing the narcotic goods, and whatever is necessary to enable the recovery of the narcotic goods after their actual importation into Australia in order to make them available in Australia, for example for distribution to the markets for which they are intended.  
        
       
       
        
        Concern in an importation can commence at a time when it is apparently broken down and where efforts are being made to bring it to fruition. The part played by the accused of being knowingly concerned must be played before or during all that is involved in such importation. He must be implicated or involved in the sense of having something to do with the importation, and the importation includes all that is incidental or proximate to the act of importation. Once the importation has been completed, he cannot therefore be knowingly concerned in that importation. 
        
       
       
        
        How far the process or venture of the importation extends will depend upon the particular circumstances. However, it will extend to all that is directly related or proximate or incidental to the act of importation. It will not extend to conduct or acts that are not directly related or proximate or incidental to the act of importation. 
        
       
       
        
        To be concerned in the importation means to be involved in or take part in the importation in the sense of doing something to further or facilitate in some way the venture or process of the importation. Such involvement or participation must occur during the venture or or process of the importation and is not confined to doing something physically or acting to further the actual importation but also encompasses other conduct that contributes to the furtherance of the venture or process of the importation. A person who merely stands by with knowledge of an importation and does nothing is not concerned in the importation, but if the person has been standing by with such knowledge for the purposes of doing something to further or facilitate the importation process or venture, that person would be concerned in the importation.”  
        
       
      
    79 His Honour continued:  
     
      
       
        
        “There is an issue in the case as to the scope and duration of the importation with knowing concern must be shown, that is, as to when the importation may have ceased or terminated. The time will be reached when involvement with the drugs and their passage through the Australian community cannot properly be categorised as knowing concern in the importation…The question of when an importation may or may not have ceased or terminated in all of the circumstances is a question of fact for your decision within the meaning of what is an importation in the light of these directions.” 
        
       
       
      
    80 In my view these directions were unexceptional. They sufficiently explained what was involved in the offence, and clearly identified the critical issue in so far as the Appellant was concerned.  
     
      
    81 This ground is not made good. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5 – his Honour erred in playing to the jury a recording of the whole of his summing up during the deliberations of the jury. 
       
      
    82 The recording was supplied following a request by the jury for a copy of the transcript of the summing up and following a further request for them to listen again to the summary of the Crown and Defence cases. As the summing up had been sound recorded but not taken out, his Honour had the tape of the whole summing up played.  
     
      
    83 In R v Taousanis [1999] NSWSC 107, Sperling J held that a Judge had a discretionary power to make available to a jury a copy of the transcript of any part of the record of the proceedings conducted in their presence, including a transcript of the Crown and Defence opening addresses. In R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329, this Court held that there had been a miscarriage of justice resulting from the refusal of the trial judge to comply with the jury’s request for a copy of the transcript of the closing address of two of the defence counsel.  
     
      
    84 Faced with these decisions Counsel for the Appellant accepted that, in an appropriate case, where requested, the trial judge could properly provide the jury with a copy of a transcript of the summing up or arrange for it to be replayed to them. The error which here occurred, it was submitted, was in doing so in a case where the summing up was, so it was argued, unbalanced and unduly favourable to the Prosecution. 
     
      
    85 For the reasons advanced in relation to the additional ground of appeal concerning the balance of the summing up for which leave was sought during the hearing of the appeal, and to which I will next turn, I am unpersuaded that the foundation for this submission has been made good. 
     
      
    86 The discretion which his Honour exercised was appropriate for a case which was lengthy, and involved two Appellants, and it served to reinforce for the jury the issues involved for each accused and the legal principles by which they were to be resolved. Moreover it followed several requests by the jury for assistance.  
     
      
    87 This ground is not made good.  
     
      
       
      Additional ground of appeal – the summing up of the learned trial Judge was not balanced and leant too far towards the Crown 
       
      
    88 This ground depends upon the proposition that twice as much attention was paid by his Honour, in the summing up, to the Crown case as to the defence case. In support of that proposition the Appellant relied upon an argument that a lack of balance was demonstrated by the fact that his Honour devoted 21 pages of the summing up to an outline of the prosecution case and only 10 pages to the defence case. Reference was also made to the fact that his Honour, when dealing with the Crown case, made several references to the observations in the course of the conversation between Louis and Joseph Sukkar concerning the Appellant eating some of the tablets on 24 November, and then made only brief mention of it when outlining the defence case.  
     
      
    89 The replaying of the summing up, it was contended, doubled the imbalance, although it is to be noted, no objection was taken to the summing up when first given.  
     
      
    90 In order to determine whether a summing up is unfairly balanced, it is necessary for it to be considered in its entirety, and in the context of the issues and the evidence led in the trial. Any attempt to measure the balance by reference to a mere numerical comparison of the pages devoted to the Crown and to the defence respectively, is valueless and has been held to be such. In R v Courtney-Smith (No. 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49 the Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Lusher J) said at 56: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not the length of the time devoted to the cases of the Crown or the accused which is in issue. It is the fairness, balance and impartiality of the summing up which the Appellate court must review or safeguard.” 
        
       
      
    91 As was observed in R v Williams (1990) 50 A Crim R 213 at 214, a summing up:  
     
      
       
        
        “should involve no more and no less than a clear and manageable explanation of the issues which are left to the jurors in the particular case before them. There is no need to venture beyond a clear statement of the relevant legal principles as they affect the particular case and against which they are to apply their decisions on the factual issues which arise”.

      R v Meher 
       [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [76] to [77].  
       
      
    92 As Hunt J (as he then was) said in R v Tillott (1991) 53 A Crim R 46 at 51: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is important is that the jury must understand which ingredients of the charge are in issue, what are the facts relevant to each ingredient which are themselves in dispute, what evidence has been given in relation to those facts and what arguments have been put in relation to that evidence. It is only in that way that the trial judge will explain how the relevant law may be applied to the facts of the particular case:  
        Alford v Magee 
         (1952) 85 CLR 437 at 466.” 
        
       
      
    93 This does not necessarily require an exhaustive reiteration or analysis of the entirety of the evidence which has been led, or even an analysis of all of the conflicts in the evidence (R v Meher, Supra at [77]), so long as the critical evidence is identified, and the cases of the Crown and the defence in relation to the issues are identified and summarised in a fair and meaningful way. As Brennan J observed in B v The Queen (1992) 63 A Crim R 225 at 229, citing Stokes v The Queen (1960) 105 CLR 279 at 284, a summing up must exhibit a judicial balance so that the jury is not deprived “of an adequate opportunity of understanding and giving effect to the defence and the matters relied upon in support of the defence”. See also Green v The Queen (1971) 126 CLR 28 at 34; Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107 at 117-118 per Barwick CJ; R v Schmahl [1965] VR 745 at 748 cited with approval in Regina v Tomazos NSWCCA 6 August 1971 and Regina v Malone NSWCCA 20 April 1994, where Blanch J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is of paramount significance in assessing a summing up is to determine whether the defence has been fairly put thus allowing a jury properly to consider the issues raised on the accused’s side. If a jury is not given the opportunity fairly to consider the defence case, then there has been a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    94 If a judge does refer to the evidence in relation to a crucial issue, then there will be an imbalance in the summing up unless there is reference to the competing versions, and the competing considerations, including inferences arising therefrom: Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 at 560-561, R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105 and R v Hannes (2000) 158 FLR 359 at 377. 
     
      
    95 As the decisions in R v Courtney-Smith (Supra at 55), R v Broadhurst [1964] AC 441 at 462 and R v Meher (Supra at [93]) show, where there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of a lack of balance, that deprived the Defendant of a fair trial, then the Appellate Court must intervene and order a new trial.  
     
      
    96 Upon my reading of the summing up, I am unpersuaded that his Honour failed to comply with these requirements. Sensibly, having regard to the length of the trial, his Honour elected not to read slabs of evidence from the witnesses, or to read from the very many recordings that were in evidence. Rather he identified, in a summary way, the aspects of the evidence upon which the Crown and the Defence respectively relied, in the light of the way that their cases were presented.  
     
      
    97 The summing up was relatively short, but it was precisely focussed, and so far as I can see it did not omit or understate any aspect of the defence case. His Honour was careful throughout not to comment on the evidence in a way that might have been seen to advance or undercut the case of either party. He provided all of the customary directions, including conventional directions in relation to circumstantial proof, good character, avoidance of propensity reasoning and the potential unreliability of the evidence of the accomplice Shepherd, and lies. He correctly explained the law in relation to the offence charged, and he identified the one issue that was alive, namely whether the Appellant became knowingly concerned in the importation of ecstasy which was undeniably established, while it was still in progress.  
     
      
    98 The preponderance of the time taken during the hearing was occupied by the Crown case, and the Prosecution address involved an analysis of the events in which the Appellant had been actively engaged and of the conversations attributed to him. The defence depended significantly upon identifying conversations or events in which his participation was not established, and in providing explanations of why he had made the telephone calls from 1 December onwards and of what he had been doing on 2 December. The inevitable difference in detail attaching to those circumstances, and the fact that it was the Crown which had to make the running, if it was to satisfy the onus of proof, necessarily meant that more time needed to be given by his Honour to the Crown case than to the defence case.  
     
      
    99 In my view, the summing up was comprehensive, and correct, and reflected a proper balance, a circumstance which is only confirmed by the fact that experienced trial counsel did not make any complaint about it or seek any redirection.  
     
      
    100 This ground is not made good.  
     
      
       
      Ground 6 – The verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence 
       
      
    101 It was the Crown case, based upon inference from circumstantial evidence that the Appellant had been knowingly involved in the importation prior to 24 November. Alternatively its case was that the importation was still in progress up to 5 December and that the Appellant was knowingly concerned in it from 24 November.  
     
      
    102 This ground requires the Court to make its own examination of the available evidence, in order to determine whether, making due allowance for the advantage which the jury had in hearing and seeing the relevant witnesses, it considers that, on the whole of the evidence, the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the Appellant: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 and Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439. This is a question of fact: M v The Queen at 492. In the present case it very much turns upon an analysis of the listening device and telephone interception material, and of the surveillance evidence, along with a consideration of the Appellant’s evidence in respect of the assessment of which the jury had a distinct advantage over us.  
     
      
    103 Although the intercepted conversations occupy 519 pages of transcript, there is little alternative other than to extract some of the salient passages, and to consider them in the context of the events which occurred, in particular between 24 November and 4 December.  
     
      
    104 The available evidence relates to the following matters: 
     
      
       
      24 November 
       
       
      (a) The arrival of the container at Consett Street on the morning of 24 November; 
      
      
      (b) The attendance of the Appellant at Consett Street commencing at 12:22, when he was joined by Joseph Sukkar and later by John Choi, and where he remained for four hours, a period that would hardly be consistent with his presence having been confined to seeing the house, which he had just purchased, for the first time; 
      
     
     
      
      (c) The unloading of the columns from the container in which the Appellant participated during that afternoon, when they were moved into a garage, and later to a garden shed as captured by video surveillance. 
      
     
     
      
      (d) The departure at 4:23 PM from the premises of the Appellant and Choi who then drove separately to Strathfield where they were observed meeting initially at a cafe, and later at a restaurant. 
      
     
     
      
      (e) The return of the Appellant to Consett Street for a short time between 6:23 PM and 6:29 PM that day; 
      
     
     
      
      (f) The telephone conversation, at 18:37:48 in which Choi advised Louis Sukkar, after referring to the possibility of Customs being tipped off, and of someone running off with the goods, that he should “get rid of that shit…in your house”, being consistent with Choi having been advised by someone that afternoon of the substitution; 
      
     
     
      
      (g) The evidence of Louis Sukkar reporting to Joseph Sukkar, in a conversation beginning at 19:38:05, that the Appellant and he had each eaten some of the tablets and found that “they are nothing”, something which Louis would have been unlikely to have reported unless it had, in fact, occurred, and something which Louis or Joseph would not have expected the Appellant to do, unless he knew what was expected, and was himself involved in the enterprise; 
      
     
     
      
      (h) The realisation on 24 November, as appears from the calls between Louis Sukkar and “Shane” at 19:14:22 and 21:00:58 that there had been a substitution of “coloured tablets”, or “sweets” and that there were also “some real ones in there…sprinkled among them”; 
      
      
      25 November 
      
     
     
      
      (i) The understanding on 25 November, as evidenced by the telephone calls between Louis Sukkar and Joseph Sukkar at 11:26:21 that the overseas connections were intending to travel to Australia, and would wish to examine the columns; the arrival (at 1700) of both Louis Sukkar and the Appellant at Consett Street where they remained for 49 minutes; the conversation commencing at 18:37 between Joseph and Louis Sukkar in which the former arranged to come past to collect some of the tablets to show to someone who had indicated that maybe they could do something if they were the right price; his arrival at 18:56 at the premises; the observation at 19:35 of Joseph, Louis and the Appellant entering the rear garden shed where the columns were located; and the call commencing at 20:32:44 which Joseph Sukkar made to Jeff (in Europe) in which there was a discussion as to whose side was responsible for the missing tablets; 
      
      
      26 November 
      
      
      (j) The attempt commencing this day, to bring together the paperwork in relation to the importation, involving telephone conversations between Louis Sukkar, Choi and Prasad, following a conversation between Louis and Fred Nassif concerning the loss of $7 million worth of stock, and the availability of a small amount of stuff that they could talk about later; 
      
      
      (k) The presence on the same day of the Appellant at Consett Street between 14:49 and 15:54, his return at 17:13, and the arrangements made by phone at 17:19:06 for Joseph to come by the premises, where he was later observed, seated in the backyard, talking with Louis Sukkar and the Appellant; 
      
     
     
      
      27 November to 30 November 
       
       
      (l) The somewhat guarded, although admittedly equivocal conversation with Louis Sukkar, in which the Appellant made a reference to “these things here” during the evening of 27 November 2001, by which time it is clear from the conversations between Louis Sukkar and Choi that some suspicion was falling on Choi,; 
      
      
      (m) The discussions between 27 November and 30 November, variously involving Louis Sukkar, Joseph Sukkar, Choi and Prasad (in Australia), and El Hani and Erik and Jeff (in Europe), concerning the recovery of the documentation, in the course of which suspicions were raised as to who had taken the tablets, questions were asked as to why the importation had gone through Brisbane when the “last one” went through Sydney, the movements of the container were discussed, and reference was made to Choi’s departure for Korea and to El Hani’s intention of travelling to Sydney to “see the boxes”.  
       
      
     (n) The conversations on the morning of Friday 30 November between Joseph Sukkar, El Hani and Jeff, commencing at 00:20:16 and 00:50:11 which show that not all of the columns had yet been opened, during which El Hani observed that “you’ve already opened thirty two columns”, asked “are they long or short?”, and added that Erik had said that there are “thirty two long ones and sixteen short ones”; and during which Joseph was heard to ask El Hani “shall I open the rest…you tell me what should I do?”. 
      
       
      (o) The discussions during these conversations about contacting the company to which the container was delivered in Brisbane, about going to Brisbane to examine the remaining boxes, checking the screws in the boxes, and examining the paperwork, in an attempt to find who had the original tablets, in the course of which various possibilities were explored including the European end, Choi, and the government.  
       
       
      (p) The inquiries made by Louis Sukkar of P&O Nedlloyd as to the vessel’s arrival, and the tasking of Choi in collecting and providing the relevant documents; 
      
      
      1 December 
       
       
      (q) The presence on 1 December of the Appellant at Consett Street on several occasions, while Louis and Joseph were there, and his concurrence, in a conversation, commencing 17:01 PM, with Joseph’s complaints about what had happened to him, observing “It is a very stressful time for everyone”, an observation which is consistent with him being aware of the problems with the importation before any discussion at the barbeque. 
      
      
      (r) The conversation commencing at 20:49:11 that night, initially between Choi and Louis Sukkar in which they discussed the absence of any document showing delivery of the containers to the warehouse, which was then taken over by the Appellant, and during which he said, immediately after indicating that he was the speaker:  
       
       
        
        “Listen now the document that you’ve given us ‘cause  
        we 
         don’t want to cause hassle when they get here and this might blow up”,  
        
       
       
      after which he said,  
       
       
        
        “now the P&O port that means someone signed to pick it up from the port”. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        These passages are consistent with the Appellant already knowing that the drugs had been imported via a P&O vessel, that he had sighted at least one document that Choi had provided, and that people from the European end were expected to arrive in Sydney.  
        
       
      
     
     
     (s) The conversations which followed which were of critical importance, in so far as the prosecution relied upon them to show the extent of the Appellant’s knowledge of the venture, particularly having regard to the familiarity with which he discussed the matter with Choi, which it contended would not have been expected had he not already been known by Choi to be involved, his use of the plural pronoun, and his references in calls commencing at 22:11:35 of the goods having been “very badly packed”, something which he could not have known had he not seen the tablets and the pipes in the columns while they were being unpacked prior to 1 December. They were also of relevance to the defence in so far as, conversely, they might have suggested that the Appellant had only that evening learned of the problem, having regard to some of the questions which he asked.  
      
       
      The following passages of relevance are extracted (M1: Choi; M3: Appellant):  
       
       
        
        “M3 Who are the Customs Brokers 
         
        M1 It’s on the piece of paper … 
         
        M3 These people SHEPHERD MAURICE CHARLES

        M3 For  
        us 
         and you 
         
        …

        M1 Yeah Intergroup Customs that’s it 
         
        M3 Intergroup Customs you’re telling me took it from the port and delivered it to the port to the warehouse 
         
        M1 Yeah yeah 
         
        M3 Okay now –Pause- where are they in BRISBANE 
         
        M1 In BRISBANE 
         
        M3 All right well  
        we’ll  
        just have to contact them and make sure where where they delivered it to 
         
        … 
         
        M3 But believe me these people are super suspicious and if everything isn’t covered because they’re they’re ..convinced that there is nothing wrong from their end 
         
        M1 STEVEN I can a hundred percent tell you even if we have that piece of paper right 
         
        M3 Hm 
         
        M1 They are gonna suspect  
        us 
         
        M3 No I know I know but at least  
        we 
         know that there is no no no little no little loop left untied there’s no hole no hole that we can fall into and right now that little time period I know it’s impossible but it is a hole and they will suspect it because they don’t know what  
        we’re 
         capable of so they they’re even contemplating because the ship landed in SYDNEY someone took ‘em off in SYDNEY and put them back on that’s just how far their thinking goes 
         
        M1 Hm 
         
        M3 And you don’t want to get on the wrong side of these people because they are very connected very heavy and they do things drastically 
         
        M1 Yeah 
         
        M3 And believe me  
        we’re 
         all in the firing line here 
         
        … 
         
        M3 So if  
        we 
         can cover this little this little two two hour gap 
         
        … 
         
        M1 Now if I ask him again for another piece of information which it seems totally unnecessary since we already received the goods ... (wds) something funny going on you know 
         
        M3 Well JOHN  
        we we’ll 
         just try and find out  
        we’ll 
         call this (wds) 
         
        M3 And try and find out  
        ourselves 
         but if  
        we 
         can’t find out for  
        ourselves 
         you’re gonna have to ask him  
        we’ll 
         have to lose  
        that connection 
         just to save our own skins 
         
        M1 Oh okay 
         
        M3 But to be honest with you to keep  
        ourselves 
          
        in the clear is much more valuable than keeping  
        this connection 
         ‘cause you can always get  
        another connection 
         
        … 
         
        M3 I’m thinking of  
        our 
         own skin here 
         
        … 
         
        M1 I think you’re thinking that they guy who bloody coming over to see JOE is the guy who organised the bloody thing (wds) 
         
        … 
         
        M3 Well any way leave it for now but don’t do anything for now  
        we’ll 
         just try to do  
        our 
         own inquiries … and see how  
        we 
         go 
         
        M1 Yeah it’s best to do it that way because I mean you don’t blow your um bridges all over the place” 
        
       
      
     (t)The absence of any call having been placed to Choi, who was still overseas before this last mentioned conversation to show that he had been advised that the Appellant had just now been informed of the importation, and brought in to assist, as might have been expected had Choi not already known of his involvement. Although it is true that the Appellant was asking questions about the mechanics of the clearance and delivery, Louis Sukkar, had similarly been inquiring as to who had delivered the goods from the port to the warehouses, a circumstance that was consistent with the details of the importations having been left to Choi to arrange; 
     
     
     (u) The call made at 21:02:36 by the Appellant, while still at Joseph Sukkar’s home, to Directory assistance, in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the telephone number for Intergroup Customs; after which, at 21:04:41, he phoned Choi in China advising that there was no listing for this firm. Choi replied that there should be a number shown on the letterhead which he had seen on the documents which he had given to Louis Sukkar. While the Appellant audibly leafed through some documents which were clearly in his possession there was the following exchange between Choi (M1) and the Appellant (M2): 
      
       
        
        “M2 JOHN I just want to make sure that no-one points the finger at  
        us 
         mate that’s all 
         
        M1 I I I STEVEN I’m hundred percent think it’s going to eventually going to happen anyway” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (v) The continuation of this conversation:  
       
       
        
        “M2 So I’m just saying did someone go there and say they were someone from Intergroup Customs 
         
        … 
         
        M2 When they really weren’t” 
         
        … 
         
        M2 But but but we’ve got to make sure that  
        we 
         distance ourselves from whoever delivered it to the brokers 
         
        … 
         
        M2 But we should know this  
        we 
         should be able to find out who the courier company was  
         
        M1 Yes 
         
        M2 Who delivered from the ship to  
        us 
         
        … 
         
        M1 Yeah I can get that that’s not a problem 
         
        M2 If you can just find out who that is without burning any bridges 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Well alright just give me a call tomorrow don’t don’t burn any bridges just if you can do it nice and easy 
         
        … 
         
        M2 … otherwise … I’ll call the Australian Quarantine Service tomorrow and I’ll ask them who fixed it up because I found these these goods missing from the from the container we just want to know who picked them up 
         
        … 
         
        M2 And I’ll ask is there an Intergroup Customs if that’s well who’s SHEPHERD MAURICE CHARLES 
         
        M1 Well he’s he’s my friend that guy he’s he’s I don’t want to I can’t tell him because  
         
        … 
         
        M2 He’s the one that just imported it” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
     (w) The advice given by the Appellant to Choi, after more paper shuffling that he had now found the name Intergroup Shipping from a tax invoice, and indicated that he would give them a call. The conversation continued:  
      
       
        
        “M1 It’s it’s It’s not going to work 
         
        M2 Well it will work ‘cause if ‘cause we’ve we’ve called up all these people well to confirm all this documentation and everything’s been confirmed so they can’t point the finger and this is the only little time delay time gap that we haven't covered and I just want to cover it that’s all and I’ll I can do it anyway don’t don’t call no-one I’ve got their number and I’ll take care of it I’ll see what I can find out 
         
        M1 But what if we how do they know how do we know they picked it up at this (wd) 
         
        M2 Well JOHNNY if if if we do everything we can and we’ve got everything in paper and they still don’t believe  
        us 
         well there’s nothing we can do they can get stuffed then 
         
        M1 Yeah 
         
        M2 But until that time I I  
        we 
         can’t tell ‘em to get stuffed  
        we  
        have to answer every question I mean there’s a lot 
         
        M2 At stake here 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Um until we can get until we we have to answer their questions and  
        we’d 
         just like to be in a position to answer every question 
         
        … 
         
        M1 I thought they were um already arrived there on Friday 
        
       
       
        
        M2 No they’re arriving next week Monday Monday evening they’re here” 
        
       
       
        
       
      (x) The further inquiry made by the Appellant at 21:14:17, of Directory Assistance which produced a number for Intergroup Shipping in Brisbane, which number he then rang at 21:16:13 even though it was a Saturday night, and even though, as the Appellant’s opening words made clear, he had not expected anyone to answer at that time. 
      
     
     
      
      (y) The incorrect identification of the Appellant as “Steve Royal” in this call, which was taken by Max Messina (M1) to whose mobile phone it had been diverted. The Appellant (M2) said, after indicating that he was calling on behalf of CJ Trade:  
       
       
        
        “M2 Okay um I just want to ask a query you guys did a shipment for  
        us 
         from Brisbane port 
         
        M1 Right 
         
        M2 And apparently when  
        we’ve 
         opened up the crates some of the goods weren’t there and  
        we 
         were wondering if you could give  
        us 
         some documentation to tell  
        us 
         the time for the .. container 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Okay um MAX would you be able to explain with any documentation to say who picked up the goods from the er who received the goods from your driver 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Okay um well I know he delivered it to unit 1 flat 6 Pendrey Court Woodridge 
        
       
       
        
        M1 Yeah 
        
       
       
        
        M2 Now I just I know it was delivered at about shortly before 9am on the 23rd but I don’t know who accepted delivery of the goods 
        
       
       
        
        M1 Um well we we gave him the we faxed through the handover sheet um I faxed it through on (wds) I faxed the handover to STEVE SHEPHERD” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The conversation continued: 
       
       
        
        “M2 There’s two (wd) missing 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Now the people that that sent them from overseas say no we have them and they want a receipt 
         
        … 
         
        M2 And we say no we haven’t got them” 
        
       
       
       
        
        Thereafter Messina advised the Appellant that he would obtain a report from the transport company and would fax through a copy of the handover agreement showing Shepherd signing for the goods;  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (z) The call made immediately thereafter, at 21:25:11, by the Appellant (M2) to Choi (M1), reporting his call to Messina:  
       
       
        
        “M2 Now I did I asked him for the form he sounded a bit funny like – Stutters – he couldn’t talk properly you don’t know this bloke do ya 
         
        M1 No I know ah there’s another guy I know him there who did it but um 
         
        M2 Okay do they know anything about the goods itself 
         
        M1 No nothing he don’t know nothing he said I’d appreciate it if 
         
        M2 Alright ‘cause I told them look there is a cool room there’s too doors missing and the people overseas that delivered the goods to me are saying they wanna be to paid and I don’t wanna pay them because there’s two doors missing and until I find out where the hell they are I’m not gonna pay anything and right now you guys picked it up from the port delivered it to WOODRIDGE somewhere along the line something’s happened he said he’ll fax me everything on Monday I gave him I gave him your fax number is that okay 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Who’s STEVE SHEPHERD 
         
        M1 He’s the guy who owns the company MAURICE SHEPHARD 
         
        M2 Owns that company where the where the warehouses are 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Alright see they told me yeah he would definitely get someone to sign it’s standard procedure so what you told me earlier was wrong JOHN 
         
        M1 No 
         
        M2 So I can’t be saying things like that to these people  
        we 
         need to be absolutely precise” 
        
       
      
      
       
      (aa) The call at 21:51:20 which was placed by Louis Sukkar (M1) initially involving Joseph Sukkar (M2) but which the Appellant (M3) joined: 
       
       
        
        “M3 Do you know who MAX MESSINA is 
         
        M1 No 
         
        M3 That’s the bloke apparently from intergroup shipping 
         
        M1 Yeah 
         
        M3 He sounded funny on the phone LOUIS 
         
        … 
         
        M1 I don’t know any of those people JOHN used STEVEN 
         
        M3 And you confirmed with P and O the port that it left the port on the twenty third 
         
        M1 Yeah definitely 
         
        … 
         
        M3 Well that guy said he got a STEVE um SHEPHERD 
         
        M1 Yeah that’s the guy that’s the guy that works in the warehouse that’s the guy that owns the warehouse 
         
        … 
         
        M3 Well he signed for the goods 
         
        … 
         
        M1 I never met him but he was an Aussie guy and his name was STEVE 
         
        M3 Yeah he signed for it 
         
        M1 I presume that’s him yeah 
         
        M3 And they’re going to fax me the stuff on Monday 
         
        … 
         
        M3 Is there any possibility that these people can get into P and O in and out before in between the sixteenth and the twenty third somehow 
         
        M1 -Sighs- You know I I don’t know those sort of things STEVEN I really don’t I’ve had nothing to do with this sort of stuff before I wouldn’t think so you know ‘cause I no shit it had to go into quarantine it went to quarantine on the twenty first and it had 
         
        M3 Did you confirm that with quarantine 
         
        M1 It’s on it’s on the paperwork there 
         
        M3 I know forget the paperwork but did you confirm it 
         
        M1 No no no 
         
        M3 Well we need to confirm with quarantine that they actually accepted the goods and fumigated them on that date” 
         
         
        
       
      (ab) The call made at 22:04:45 by the Appellant (M1) to Louis Sukkar (M2):  
       
       
        
        “M1 See this is what I was thinking LOUIS after fumigation right 
         
        M2 Mm 
         
        M1 After fumigation I don’t know this MAX bloke he seems suss 
         
        M2 Right 
         
        M1 He seemed like he was sussing me out 
         
        … 
         
        M1 Hang on it left me with the impression that he knew what was going on 
         
        … 
         
        M1 But what I’m concerned about is that between the twenty-first and the twenty-third 
         
        … 
         
        M1 There’s forty hours there so I don’t know what type of connections he’s got in the port so I’m considering possibly he knew what was going on he come in there unloaded changed them and put it back alright 
         
        … 
         
        M1 What type of information have you told JOHN 
         
        M2 Nothing information (wd) 
         
        M1 Do you know what he knew obviously what was coming 
         
        M2 He knew what was coming yeah 
         
        M1 He knew in what it was coming 
         
        M2 Yeah he wouldn’t know which box or anything like that 
         
        … 
         
        M1 He knew it was cool rooms 
         
        …  
         
        M1 So I’m thinking did he fucking tell these people in BRISBANE they then told this MAX bloke he’s then got them in that day the forty hour period and fixed it because they’re bodgy 
         
        … 
         
        M1 It’s here mate it’s here I think the problem is here 
         
        … 
         
        M1 Right now LOUI it seems that the problem is here there’s forty hours unaccounted for mate 
         
        … 
         
        M2 (Wds) do us a favour do us a favour ring JOHN 
         
        M1 Yeah 
         
        M2 Ask JOHN if he knows this guy say ask JOHN if he knows the guy straight away right 
         
        … 
         
        M2 And then then take it from there ask him what the JOHN should know the procedures here he does this all the time 
         
        M1 No JOHN knows shit mate because he’s telling me they never signed for it and I just called this MAX and he got STEVE SHEPHERD to sign for it (wds) that’s normal 
         
        M2 JOHN is a fucking bullshit artist STEVE you got to put him on – stutters – I told you a hundred times you actually got to get him on the spot put him on the spot and catch him on the spot to get the truth out of him he’s always like that 
         
        … 
         
        M1 (Wd) –stutters- I don’t know if he’s done this but I’m thinking maybe some information has leaked along the line and it’s given someone the opportunity to do it 
         
        M2 Well the best thing to do is question JOHN about it 
         
        M1 (Wds) I’ll call him now” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
      (ac) The call made at 22:11:35 by the Appellant (M2) to Choi (M1) which contains the following exchanges:  
       
       
        
        “M2 Who’s MAX MESSINA 
         
        …  
         
        M1 I don’t know no 
         
        M2 Okay well MAX MESSINA is the bloke from Intergroup Shipping 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Right now according to these documents the good were discharged on the twenty-first from quarantine

        M2 No no it says here on the document it was released by two thirty-seven pm on the twenty-first 
         
        … 
         
        M2 That’s on the twenty-first now your mate in BRISSIE knows this MAX

        … 
         
        M2 MAX is the person I spoke to from Intergroup Shipping and he had intimate knowledge about it 
         
        M1 Yeah 
         
        M2 Okay now there’s forty hours where I believe MAX has got access to these things while they’re on the ports he can go in and out because they’ve come out 
         
        M1 MAX doesn’t MAX doesn’t know anything Intergroup Shipping doesn’t know nothing 
         
        M2 Well you don’t know that because you don’t know ‘cause your friend knows and you don’t know what your friend has told MAX

        M1 Yeah (wd) 
         
        M2 And they haven’t been dispatched until the twenty-third

        M2 P and O P and O confirms that it left their docks on the twenty-third

        M2 Of the tone MAX adopted okay I spoke to him

        M1 Yeah 
         
        M2 He was sussing me out 
         
        M1 Okay 
         
        M2 He knew what was in them and he wanted to find out whether I knew 
         
        … 
         
        M2 I know I know someone’s tone when I speak to em he was sussing me out JOHN it was very clear please get a hold of your friend over there and fix the situation what I’m telling you 
         
        M1 (Wds)

        M2 Yes

        … 
         
        M1 Yeah so if we okay if so you’re saying that they took it out they changed the goods and they brought it back in is that right 
         
        M2 Something like that because  
        they’re very badly packed 
         
        M1 Okay so you 
         
        M2

         you can see it 
         
        … 
         
        M1 I think first ring up and confirm everything on Monday right 
         
        M2 Alright JOHN I’ll do everything on Monday but listen if if things don’t quite add up you should come back a little earlier 
         
        M1 Okay I’ll have to come back earlier but 
         
        … 
         
        M2 No no no I don’t even want you to call them right now I’m just telling you if things don’t quite add up I don’t want you to talk to ‘em nothing just come back early don’t talk to ‘em just come back and I’ll tell you what’s gonna happen 
         
        M1 Alright then 
         
        M2 Don’t don’t talk to them don’t raise any suspicions right now keep everything nice and dandy” 
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The Crown placed considerable weight on the incorporation by the Appellant of himself into the plural pronoun, in this exchange, and to his assumption of authority over Choi to whom he could be heard giving directions. Also of importance is the Appellant’s knowledge of the tablets having been badly packed, an observation that is consistent with him having already seen the interior of the columns and pipes.  
        
       
      
     
     
     (ad) The conversation between Louis Sukkar (M2) and the Appellant at 22:23:38, during which the Appellant (M1) reported the results of his inquiries and his suspicions concerning the interception and removal of the tablets at the hands of Choi and his friends working in conjunction with Messina:  
      
       
        
        “M1 This bloke MAX MESSINA 
         
        M2 Mm 
         
        M1 goes in and out the ports every fucking day and who knows what contacts he’s got in the ports he’s got forty hours to fucking play with it and  
        you saw how fucking bodgy the packing was 
         
        …  
         
        M1 LOUIS I think  
        we 
         found  
        our 
         answer mate 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Do you think do you know if that’s the case then STEVEN I I reckon JOHN is involved  
         
        M1 I think he is 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Because JOHN kept giving me different dates STEVEN  
        remember 
         
        … 
         
        M1 Mm alright well well listen let’s just fucking look at it this way let’s wait for these people to get here I think something’s gone on I’m not sure we can’t confirm it we gotta work out quarantine and all that type of stuff when it all happens and how it happens and then we gotta fucking see JOHN mate and I mean we gotta see JOHN we just gotta fucking ground the cunt 
         
        M2 I told I told JOHN the other day that he has to come back early 
         
        M1 Yeah I told him that just now I go JOHN if things don’t add up you gotta come back alright anyway we’ll see how we go 
         
        M2 Maybe he is yeah 
         
        M1 I think it is him mate the  
        way it was packed 
         I think it’s him they said they said when they fill it up with foam it takes it expands over twenty four hours and then he sands it back and then puts that little cover thing  
        you know that cover thing over the foam 
         
        M2 Mm 
         
        M1 Well  
        some of the packaging here was bulging out 
         
        M2 Yeah I know it was 
         
        M1 That that means if his theory is correct that he sands it back because it keeps expanding it’s spent at least twenty hours expanding after they’ve repackaged it 
         
        M2 Mm 
         
        M1 They’ve done it 
         
        M2 If that’s the case yeah I’m gonna if  
        I’ve found out that 
         it’s  
        JOHN I’m gonna fucking kill him 
         I’m gonna 
         
        M1 No no shut up don’t fucking say like that on the phone” 
        
       
       
        
       
      (ae) the advice given by the Appellant (M1) to Louis Sukkar (M2), when Louis rang him at 22:32:25, not to call from Michelle Royal’s phone and the Appellant’s acceptance of the observations of Louis:  
       
       
        
        “M2 And  
        you know 
         the other day when I when I rang him back right 
         
        M1 Mm 
         
        M2 And you know and … I said I need that other bit of paperwork right” 
        
       
       
        
        as being indicative of the Appellant’s knowledge of the importation and substitution by 27 November at the latest, since it was on 26 and 27 November that Louis had made such request of Choi.  
        
       
       
      (af) The voice message left at 23:00, on Joseph Sukkar’s phone asking him to call back that night, referring to an “emergency”, which the Crown submitted was a reference to the conclusion, which had been reached, that Choi and his Brisbane associates had effected the substitution; 
       
       
      (ag) The coded call made at 23:09:09 by the Appellant (M2) to Paul Sukkar (M1):  
       
       
        
        “M2 Alright um you know  
        our 
         little dilemma 
         
        … 
         
        M2 I think we’ve found we think we found a solution for it 
         
        M1 Oh well that’s alright 
         
        M2 Yeah it’s alright but the thing is I need to get oh they need to be transported 
         
        … 
         
        M2 Yeah cause I think its KOREAN KOREAN style mate 
         
        M1 Well anyway doesn’t matter I’ll see you tomorrow anyway but look if you have to get in there 
         
        M2 Mate I’m concerned about KOREAN style calling the coppers because he might be concerned  
        we’re 
         onto it and he’s overseas” 
         
        
       
       
      2 December  
       
       
      (ah) The conversation, commencing at 00:03:51 on 2 December, following the various telephone conversations during the preceding 6 hours, in which Joseph Sukkar (M2) spoke to El Hani (M1) in Holland and had a conversation with him, and with Jeff (M3) which included the following exchange:  
       
       
        
        “M2 ANTOUN it seems there is something here 
         
        …

        M2 Really there is no need for anyone to come I know what happened whoever wants to come can come 
         
        … 
         
        M1 So there is no money

        M2 Yeah he found that there was there was a period of forty hours he found there was a period of forty hours thus the existing company of that man became able to access them to take them out and bring them in

        M1 So we can expect some result 
         
        M2 We can expect some result of course

        M2 He left the country his family is still here” 
        
       
       
       
        
        The reference to Antoun “not needing to come” related, on the Crown submission, to the man who had placed the tablets in Europe into the columns. Otherwise the passage was relied upon as support for the proposition that the tablets had not been sold and could still be recovered once Choi returned, so as to perfect the importation. 
        
       
       
      (ai) The renting, on Sunday 2 December by Louis Sukkar, of a truck, which was initially driven to Joseph Sukkar’s home in Croydon, at about 10:25, followed by a call at 10:28:15 from Joseph Sukkar to the Appellant asking him to “come to help [them] at Louis’” after which, at 10:38, the Appellant was seen to drive to Consett Street. 
       
       
      (aj) The conversation commencing at 10:42:40, between Joseph Sukkar (JS) and the Appellant (SS) in relation to what was in store for Choi, of whose complicity in a rip-off they were by then obviously convinced, in which Louis Sukkar (LS) also participated: 
       
       
        
        “JS Are  
        we 
         going to do something with him STEVEN 
         
        SS Oh yeah.

        SS We’ll get it back 
         
        … 
         
        SS JOE JOSEPH trust me (overtalk) trust em when I get him I’m gonna get him you watch I’m not going to leave him if he doesn’t come (wds) he won’t be able to get out of it. 
         
        JS It’s not fair it’s not fair my goodness what he did [whistles].

        SS LOUIS when are you gonna call him 
         
        LS I’ll ring him in a few hours (wds) 
         
        JS We need to work 
         
        SS When you call him just say look there’s this little we haven’t found we’re gonna call on Monday see if we can find out there’s a little discrepancy if we can’t find out Monday you’re just gonna have to come back and explain that gap ‘cause they here tell him tell him they’re coming from overseas.” 
        
       
       
      After which, Louis Sukkar is heard to say:  
       
       
        
        “LS …let’s um open the rest of these things. 
        
       
       
        
        JS Open ‘em here” 
         
        
       
       
      (ak) The Crown surveillance evidence which appears to show the Appellant, together with Joseph, and Louis Sukkar proceeding to open the other ends of some of the columns, looking for more drugs and sorting the tablets that had been removed, that is, after the Appellant had, at 10:49, given Paul Sukkar directions of the location of the Consett Street premises; 
       
       
      (al) The conversations from 10:50 onwards, picked up by the listening device, in the back yard of Consett Street, involving Louis (LS), Joseph (JS), Paul Sukkar (PS) and the Appellant (SS) and the video surveillance which showed that columns were being opened and that tablets were being sorted: 
       
       
        
        “JS Move a bit then. Let us uncover them He’ll bring them one pillar at a time we’ll put them here open them We’ll open them here and we’ll empty them into the bags close it close that up the roller door close up 
         
        … 
         
        SS Thought we could just drive it all up to PAUL'S place and just open it all get all the pills out

        … 
         
        SS I know but we’ll get them out of here 
         
        … 
         
        LS There’s some here” 
        
       
       
      and later: 
       
       
        
        “SS How are we going to remove them 
         
        … 
         
        JS Ough may God give you health Are you going to open those ones or do you want to leave them

      and later (from 11:49): 
       
       
        
        “SS LOUIS you wanna grab a box and we’ll (wd)

      (ax) the fact that, after several phone and direct conversations between Louis and Joseph Sukkar, Choi and the Appellant, and the Appellant and Louis Sukkar, concerning the need to get Choi back, there was a further conversation between the Appellant and Louis Sukkar, as well as a phone call between the Appellant and Joseph Sukkar during the evening, in which the Appellant spoke of having discussed the Choi problem with someone else, who had offered to get “five mill” from him, for 10%, if the Sukkars can’t work it out with him. The source for these exchanges is contained both in listening device and telephone intercepts. For example the intercept for the telephone call at 19:09:05 between the Appellant (M3) and Joseph Sukkar (M1) and Louis Sukkar (M2), records the following:

        SS Oh God theses guys are going to fucking tear him apart mate” 
         
        
       
       
        
        This was followed by a further conversation commencing at 18:55:48: 
        
       
       
        
        “SS So when’s Johnny coming back 
         
        LS Sunday I think 
         
        SS Still Sunday so so you told him no you’re you’re we’re not paying you just have to organize it when he gets back 
         
        LS Pretty much 
         
        SS I’d like to grab him mate” 
         
        
       
      
    105 It may be accepted that evidence, arising from these various events and exchanges, of mere knowledge by the Appellant of the importation and of his brothers’ involvement in it, or of any concern or anxiety that he had in relation to their financial loss, or in relation to any risk of them being harmed by anyone else involved in it, or even in relation to their arrest, in connection with it, would not suffice to make good the offence charged.  
     
      
    106 In that respect, proof of his assistance after the importation had been completed, whether in order to assist in recovering any money that had been lost, or to ensure the removal of the drugs that had been recovered or the remains of the freezer from his home, or to conceal any evidence that might be inculpatory of his brothers would also not make good the Prosecution case. Any such assistance after the importation was complete, as a matter of law, would constitute an offence committed by him as an accessory after the fact, but that was not the offence upon which the Appellant was placed on trial.  
     
      
    107 Similarly, evidence of him being complicit in the possession of goods that had been imported, or in the subsequent supply of any portion of the consignment which had been recovered, whether by way of an actual supply or deemed supply, would constitute separate offences, and would not make good the offence charged.  
     
      
    108 A critical question that needs to be determined in relation to this ground, accordingly, concerns the time when, as a matter of law, the process of importation came to an end and, perhaps more importantly, what is involved in the expression “knowingly concerned” in an importation. 
     
      
    109 As I have previously observed, an importation and concern in it do not begin or end at the moment the narcotic goods arrive at the port of disembarkation, or cross the customs barrier. The offence charged embraces activities both preceding and following the arrival of the goods, which are directly related, or proximate or incidental to, bringing the goods into the country.  
     
      
    110 In R v Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R 402, this Court confirmed that acts constituting the offence included those occurring after the time of the arrival of the two couriers, who had brought the drugs into the country in capsules which they had swallowed, and which were still located in their intestines. The act of the Appellant who brought enemas to their hotel, in order to assist in the retrieval of the capsules and drugs, was held to be an act of being knowingly concerned in the importation.  
     
      
    111 Gleeson CJ there said (at 404-405): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The fact that the term ""importation"" is one that must involve at least some measure of flexibility is demonstrated by the judgments of Barwick CJ and Windeyer J in Forbes v Traders Finance Ltd 126 CLR 429. At p 432 Barwick CJ said: “I would merely add for myself that `importation' extends on both sides of the actual act of importing into the country. The importation does not cease at the  
         
        moment of an import. But the relevant use of a vehicle must be proximate to the act of importing. Whether it is so or not is a question of degree for decision in the particular case.” It may also be noted that Menzies J, who was in the minority in that case accepted at least some degree of flexibility when at p 435 his Honour said: “It may be that there are circumstances in which it would be difficult to say whether or not a carriage had been used in the importation of goods, eg, where goods are taken by trolley from an aeroplane to the terminal.” 
        
       
       
        
        More to the point, however, in the present case is the observation made by Windeyer J in relation to a similar statutory provision there under consideration. In my view the important question is not so much the precise meaning and application of the word ""importation"" as the meaning and application of the expression ""knowingly concerned in the importation"". 
        
       
       
        
         
        The expression ""concerned in"" is one of general import and it is impossible to state with precision what is comprehends. It is necessary to consider the facts and circumstances of the particular case (see Corr v -William and Son Limited v Harrison (1906) AC 274 per Lord Halsbury, Lord Chancellor, 275-276; Batts Coombe Quarry Pty Limited v Ford (1943) Chancery 51 per Lord Greene MR53). The Shorter Oxford Dictionary and the Macquarie Dictionary both give as a synonym for ""concerned"" the word ""involved"".  
        
       
       
        
        In Regina v Kelly (1975) 12 SASR 389 at 400 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia said, in relation to the word ""concerned"": ""The word is no doubt deliberately chosen to cover a wide range of activities since it would be well-nigh impossible to define more closely the various acts which could go towards the fulfilment of a plan for the importation of prohibited articles.""  
        
       
       
        
        The latter case is also authority for the proposition that if pursuant to a pre-conceived plan the Appellant had made himself available to be the instrument by which the chosen method of importation could achieve the ultimate purpose of making the heroin independently present in Australia as goods liberated from the bodies of [the couriers], then he was concerned in the act of importation which they performed.” 
        
       
      
    112 In R v Courtney-Smith (No. 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49 the Court was concerned with drugs which arrived in a container that was landed at Port Botany, and which five days later was taken to a freight forwarding company. Following customs clearance and fumigation, that container was transported to a factory in Manly Vale. It was there placed under surveillance until it was opened by co-accused of the Appellant twelve days after its arrival in Sydney. Preceding the arrival of the vessel carrying the container, and subsequent to its arrival, the Appellant had dealings with the forwarding company to arrange for its clearance and delivery, and he made payments to that agent.  
     
      
    113 It was there submitted that there should have been a directed acquittal on the basis that the Appellant’s involvement with the container had only started after it was landed in Port Botany. The Court (Kirby P, and Sharpe and Lusher JJ) rejected this proposition, observing (at 63-64): 
     
      
       
        
        “The legal answer [to this submission] is that it simply is not sustained either by the language and purpose of the Act or by authority which has collected around its meaning. The relevant provisions of the Customs Act were enacted to give effect to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. Its clear purpose is to strike at the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and their penetration of the Australian society. Because Australia is an island, that penetration will normally occur through importation of such drugs. Therefore, a section addressed simply to the act of landing would not only fail to exhaust in a proper and understandable way the relevant Federal head of power. It would also fail to achieve the plain objective of preventing importation by attacking those within Australia who become concerned in the arranging the act of importation and in moving the goods, once imported, into the community where they do their mischief. 
         
         
        Legal authority, both of the High Court of Australia and of this Court supports that construction of the word “importation”. In Forbes v Traders Finance Limited (1970) 126 CLR 429 at 432, Barwick CJ said: “'[I]mportation’ extends on both sides of the actual act of importing into the country. The importation does not cease at the moment of an import. But the relevant use of a vehicle must be proximate to the act of importing. Whether it is so or not is a question of degree for decision in the particular case.” That question of degree has been clarified by a succession of cases in which meaning has been given to the term… 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Neither Commonwealth power nor the language of the Customs Act will follow the goods once they are imported, without limitation as to time and place. A time will be reached when involvement with them in their passage through the Australian community cannot properly be categorized as knowing concern in their “importation”. Likewise, innocent transport of goods after their arrival, although amounting to concern in their importation in one sense, will not have the character of criminality to which the section is addressed. None of this is relevant to the facts of the present case. Nor is the narrow and technical construction of “importation” urged by the Appellant compatible with a series of holdings of this and other courts about the scope and duration of the “importation” with which knowing concern must be shown. For example in R v Shin Nan Yong (1975) 7 ALR 271, this Court made it plain that it was not necessary, to secure a conviction under s233B(1)(d) that the “concern” should be made manifest in a physical sense whilst the importation was actually in progress. It was sufficient if the “concern” is manifested in the venture which centred upon the importation. To similar effect was the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia in R v Kelly (1975) 12 SASR 389. See also Ashbury v Reid [1961] WAR 49.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    114 The Court also regarded the decision in R v Lam to be particularly instructive on this question, in so far as Gleeson CJ had there stated that “the term ‘importation’ was one which must involve at least some measure of flexibility’”. The Court held that: 
     
      
       
        
        “at least to the point where the imported product was still in a container held in a hired factory…before distribution to the markets for which it was intended, the process of ‘importation’…(had) not relevantly ceased for this offence. Concern in that importation whilst the goods remained as they were qualifies for the application of the section”. 
        
       
      
    115 The decisions in Lam and Courtney-Smith were also followed in R v Leff (1996) 86 A Crim R 212. That was a case in which the Appellant had a number of telephone conversations with the courier, at a time which followed his arrest and the seizure of the drugs which he had been carrying, that being a time while he was co-operating with the authorities. In so far as the Crown case was based solely upon an alternative that was confined to the post arrival/arrest conversations (there being another alternative dependant upon disputed evidence as to some earlier involvement on the Appellant’s part in the planning for the importation) it was held that the venture was, as a matter of law, still in progress at the time of these conversations, and that there was sufficient evidence to show that the Appellant was knowingly concerned in it. Gleeson CJ there said (at 214): 
     
      
       
        
        “The concepts of importation, and of being concerned in an importation, are both sufficiently flexible to cover a case such as the present. As the authorities referred to by James J show, importation is a process, or a venture, not a physical act which occurs or ceases at the moment of import. Furthermore, concern in an importation can commence at a time when it has apparently broken down, and where efforts are being made to bring it to fruition.” 
        
       
      
    116 James J, with whom Gleeson CJ and Allen J agreed, said (at 223): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that in the present case Raz was arrested at the airport and the cocaine being carried by him was seized by the Federal Police. However, I do not consider that the intervention by the authorities prevented the process or venture of importation from continuing so that a person might subsequently become concerned in the importation.” 
        
       
      
    117 These decisions were also followed in R v Kwong Yue Cheung SCWA CCA 28 October 1997, and it is by reference to the principles which they establish that this ground falls to be decided. 
     
      
    118 Of some importance in relation to the asserted absence of any evidence of the Appellant’s knowing involvement in the importation, was the defence submission that the columns had been unloaded, and all of the tablets removed before the Appellant arrived at the premises on the morning of 2 December. That was associated with his submission that the time of removal of the tablets, either on 24 November or on 2 December, marked the end of the process of importation. 
     
      
    119 Absent any evidence showing positively that the Appellant had a financial interest in the importation, and absent any direct evidence of activity connected with the venture on his part before 24 November, I would accept the Appellant’s submission that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt of his knowing concern in the importation prior to that date. While the evidence would give rise to a strong suspicion of his earlier involvement, that would not suffice to support a conviction on that basis.  
     
      
    120 The prosecution case however does not depend upon the Appellant having been knowingly concerned in the importation before 24 November, or of having a financial interest in it. Its case was that the process of importation continued thereafter and that the conduct, on that day and subsequently, of the Appellant amounted to a knowing concern on his part.  
     
      
    121 On my assessment that submission is correct having regard to the extended concept involved in the process of importation which includes recovery of the goods after landing and anything which is done having a direct proximity to the bringing of the goods into the country, and making them available including their clearance and transfer into storage, unpacking, and arranging for payment of those involved in the process, that is the suppliers, shippers, customs agents, freight forwarders, and so on. 
     
      
    122 In support of its submission that the Appellant was not involved in the importation between 24 November and 1 December the defence pointed to the absence of any evidence, during that period, of him discussing the importation, or the problem, with his brothers, or with Choi, as might have been expected had he been knowingly concerned in it. To the contrary, the defence argued, he seems to have gone about his regular business and engaged in inconsequential social chatter with them.  
     
      
    123 That clearly was a factor requiring careful evaluation by the jury as was the evidence of his prior good character. Each must now be given appropriate weight in relation to a consideration of this ground of appeal. Similarly the jury were entitled to take into account the somewhat banal and brief nature of the Appellant’s conversation on his return to the premises on the evening of 24 November, and the fact that Louis Sukkar seems not to have spoken to anyone by phone in relation to the substitution, until after the Appellant had left the premises with Choi.  
     
      
    124 Equally the jury needed to take into account that while there were intercepted conversations between Joseph and Louis between 24 November and 1 December, relating to the importation, none seems to have occurred at a time when the Appellant was present, as might have been expected had there been the “Councils of war” which the Crown contended had taken place that week, involving the Appellant, at the time of his visits to the premises. Nor was anything said by Louis or Joseph or Choi in their discussions over this week suggestive of the Appellant having been involved in the venture, any discussion involving or concerning him having been related to entirely different topics. 
     
      
    125 The Crown submission, that it was not credible that the accused was informed of the importation only on the night of 1 December, however, has considerable force, having regard to the terms of his telephone conversation with Choi that night, the absence of any indication to Choi that he had just been brought in to assist, the absence of any apparent indication of shock or surprise on his own part, and his obvious awareness of the prior importations.  
     
      
    126 There is also the fact that the arrival and storage from 24 November of portion only of a cool room, at a private dwelling would, as a matter of common sense, inevitably have attracted strong suspicion and concern on the part of the owner of those premises unless he had some knowledge of what was involved. It would also be somewhat surprising for a valuable consignment of drugs to be taken to those premises unless it was certain that this could be safely done, or for there to be no discussion as to why the freezer had been brought to Consett Street, and as to what was intended for it, if it was involved in some legitimate commercial activity.  
     
      
    127 The Appellant’s adoption of an alias when speaking to Max Messina on 1 December, his presence on 24 November when the columns were unloaded, in the course of which steps to remove the tablets were commenced, being the occasion when he was reported as having tasted some of the tablets, and his presence at the premises over the succeeding days, together provide strong support, in my view, for the Crown case, as do the facts that Choi and the Appellant had discussions away from the premises on the afternoon of 24 November, and that when Choi phoned Louis Sukkar at 18:37:48 he had obviously been informed of the fact of the substitution, a circumstance which, while not conclusive, was at least consistent with him having had an opportunity of discussing it with the Appellant. It must, however, be recognised that there was a competing inference open, namely that Louis had earlier driven from Consett Street to meet Choi, to warn him of the discovery, and that this had deliberately occurred in the absence of the Appellant, so as to keep him in the dark. 
     
      
    128 The Crown submitted however, that it was noticeable from the surveillance video of 24 November, that the body language of the Appellant, along with that of his brothers was consistent with each being disappointed at the discovery of the loss. While a viewing of the video, does tend to support that submission, there being obvious indications of despair on the part of all present, I accept that some caution needs to be exercised in drawing a conclusion too quickly from body language. At best it can be taken into account as a factor in a circumstantial case, not being an essential intermediate fact requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt. Much the same observation can be made in relation to the 2 December surveillance video, where a somewhat sombre mood is obvious, on the part of those present, particularly during the segment where they took a mid morning break sitting around a table, before the columns and other bits of the freezer, were loaded onto a truck. 
     
      
    129 While it was the defence case that the only purpose or involvement of the Appellant from 1 December onwards was to have the tablets, columns, and the remains of the freezer cabinet removed from his premises as quickly as possible, that contention cannot stand, on my assessment, with the evidence of his conversations, or of his actions from the night of 1 December onwards.  
     
      
    130 I would accept that if the evidence as to his involvement, after being informed of the importation, revealed nothing more than a commitment to secure the removal from his premises of any evidence concerning it, then the offence charged, as distinct from one of being an accessory after the fact, would not have been made good.  
     
      
    131 However, on my assessment, the extracts from the intercepts earlier noted convincingly show that the objective and involvement of the Appellant went well beyond that.  
     
      
    132 The continued presence of the recovered tablets on the Consett Street property up to and including 5 December, the Appellant’s instruction on 2 December that the tablets be put in the shed, and the tenor of his conversations concerning his plans for Choi, clearly belie the suggestion that all he wanted to do was to have everything removed from his property, and the suggestion that he lent his physical assistance for that purpose alone.  
     
      
    133 His coded conversation with Paul Sukkar on the night of 1 December, in which he refers to “our little dilemma” and to his concern about “Korean style calling the coppers” similarly suggests far greater involvement than that for which the defence contended, even taking into account his observation “I’m not prepared to leave it overnight”. Had he truly been unassociated with or not concerned in the venture, it would seem more probable that he would have had nothing whatsoever to do with the matter other than to forcefully insist on his brothers getting rid of every trace of the importation from his property. 
     
      
    134 Of substantial significance in relation to the Appellant’s evidence that his concern on 2 December was only to get the drugs off the Consett Street property, as quickly as possible, is the surveillance and listening device evidence of what actually happened that day. Far from an early morning urgent move of everything from the property, the evidence shows that there was hammering and emptying of columns, a careful sorting of tablets, which the Appellant acknowledged knowing to be ecstasy, so as to make them available for sale, and discussions about the recovery rate and likely proceeds, which went on for a lengthy period. Moreover while the rental truck took the remnants of the freezer cabinet away for storage elsewhere, the tablets remained at Consett Street.  
     
      
    135 The observations made during the earlier intercepted conversations concerning the number of the columns that had been emptied and of those that had yet to be checked, the discussions about examining the remainder, the surveillance evidence of 24 November and 2 December, and the conversations in relation to what was occurring on 2 December clearly show that the unloading and attempted recovery of genuine tablets, including the opening of some of the columns at the other end to search for more tablets, and the sorting and bagging of the “genuine” tablets, all of which formed part of their recovery, was continuing up to and including 2 December.  
     
      
    136 The evidence of the Appellant’s conduct from 1 December in attempting to find where the drugs were, and the supply of information to his brothers concerning his inquiries, which was then used by them in their dealings with Choi and with the European end, also provided in my opinion, cogent evidence in support of the jury verdict.  
     
      
       
      
    137 In particular the terms of the Appellant’s conversation with Choi on the night of 1 December, including his familiarity with some of the details, and the open way in which Choi spoke to him, display far greater knowledge of what was involved, than that which might have been expected of someone who had previously known nothing of the importation, and whose premises had been unwittingly used for the delivery and recovery of a large consignment of drugs. 
     
      
    138 While that by itself may not have sufficed to show a knowing concern before 24 November, it is what occurred thereafter that in my view was persuasive. The fact of this conversation and the absence of any obvious remonstration with Choi, or with his brothers, in having been used by them in a venture which risked destroying his career and jeopardising his liberty, was properly available to the jury in their interpretation of his subsequent conduct.  
     
      
    139 The additional explanation which the Appellant put forward for his actions, based upon his concerns in relation to his brothers being at risk of harm from the Europeans, also does not ring true, in the light of the terms of the conversations extracted. 
     
      
    140 The threats which the Appellant mentioned to his brothers concerning Choi, when read in conjunction with his attempts to encourage him to return to Australia by misrepresentations, point strongly in favour of him being actively involved in having pressure placed upon Choi to deliver up the drugs which were believed to have been removed by him, or by his associates. That conduct was properly capable of being understood as showing a knowing concern on his part in the importation. In this context it is of some significance that the appellant said in one conversation to Michael that he was “playing stupid at the moment” with Choi, and that “I’ll get them back”.  
     
      
    141 It is also not unimportant that the Appellant clearly took the lead from the night of 1 December onwards in the inquiries as to the whereabouts of the missing drugs, and spoke in a way that was consistent with him giving Choi directions. It is similarly revealing that, on occasions, he used what was apparently regarded as a “safe phone”, being a mobile phone registered in a false name.  
     
      
    142 His obvious knowledge of prior importations, and his interest in the source of manufacture of the pipes found on this occasion, compared with a prior importation, were also revealing.  
     
      
    143 Similarly, the Appellant’s comments in relation to “what we should be getting” and to looking at “what we’re getting without looking at what we should have got” were particularly telling in relation to his involvement, when considered in the light of the remaining evidence and his repeated use of the plural pronoun in most of the conversations in which he was involved.  
     
      
    144 In summary, having regard to the continuing efforts between 24 November and 4 December, on the part of all concerned, including the Appellant, to recover, sort and bag such of the genuine ecstasy tablets as had made their way to Consett Street, and to locate and to recover the balance of the intercepted drugs, in whosever possession they were, I am satisfied that it was proper for the jury to determine the Appellant’s guilt by reference to his conduct, and that of Joseph and Louis Sukkar, and of Choi, during the period up to and including 4 December. What the appellant did during the period between 24 November and 4 December in my assessment clearly established his knowing involvement in the importation in so far as he made strenuous efforts to rectify the problem and to recover the drugs. 
     
      
    145 In the light of the detailed summary of the evidence, and the extracted conversations earlier set out, and in the light of these further observations, I am accordingly satisfied that not only was there a proper evidentiary basis for the jury verdict, but that the case was one where the jury ought not to have had a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. 
     
      
    146 This ground is not made good.  
     
      
       
      APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE 
       
      
    147 The Crown submitted in support of its appeal against leniency, accepting the views of this Court in Regina v Prasad [2004] NSWCCA 293 concerning the consequences of the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914, that the starting point of the sentencing judge was too low, having regard to the role of the Respondent, the absence of a plea of guilty and of any evidence of contrition, the sheer size of the importation (68 times the applicable commercial quantity) and the close connection between the Appellant and the principals. 
     
      
    148 The Appellant submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive, upon the basis that his Honour overstated his objective criminality. Assuming that the conviction should stand, the submission involved, in substance, the proposition that he had played no part in the original importation, that he had no financial interest in it and that his assistance from 1 December onwards only occurred because of his brothers’ discovery of the substitution. As a consequence, it was contended, his culpability was significantly less than that of the remainder of those who were involved in the venture.  
     
      
    149 The Appellant submitted in support of his application for leave to appeal against sentence, that there was no proper evidentiary basis for his Honour’s findings that: 
     
      
       
      (a) the Appellant sorted through “hundreds of thousands of pills”; 
       
       
      (b) he must have known on 24 November that the columns contained MDMA in substantial excess of the commercial quantity; 
       
       
      (c) he assisted Louis and Joseph Sukkar before 24 November and 5 December in “their efforts to ascertain how the narcotics had been lost in their efforts to recover the drugs and/or obtain monetary compensation for their loss”; and  
       
       
      (d) between 24 November and 5 December he advised Louis and Joseph “on how the narcotics might best be recovered from Choi”. 
       
      
    150 These findings were broadly open upon the evidence, save for the number of tablets through which the Appellant personally sorted, and the likely quantity of MDMA of which the Appellant became aware on 24 November. I am not persuaded that any overstatement in the respects mentioned was such as to occasion the Court’s intervention. 
     
      
    151 Upon my assessment, absent any evidence of the Appellant having been knowingly concerned in the venture before 24 November, or of him standing to gain any financial benefit from it, his objective criminality needed to be assessed upon the basis of the active assistance which he provided to his brothers, in permitting the cool room and tablets to remain on his premises, in assisting physically in the attempts to recover drugs from them, and in pursuing various inquiries aimed at discovering where the missing drugs were so as to retrieve them for his brothers. 
     
      
    152 His role was that of a knowing assistant to his brothers, rather than as a principal, or accomplice who expected a monetary reward. This is not to say that it was an insignificant role. By the time that he became deeply involved from 1 December, he clearly knew that the venture was one of considerable substance, which potentially involved very large sums of money. Despite his prior good character, he became enthusiastically involved, and his objective criminality was high, although not as high as that of those who stood to gain financially from it.  
     
      
    153 Taking that conclusion into account along with the subjective circumstances that were appropriately identified by his Honour, I am not persuaded that appellable error has been shown or that any sentence other than that which was imposed, was warranted in law. 
     
      
    154 I would accordingly propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal dismissed; 
       
       
      2. Crown appeal against sentence dismissed; 
       
       
      3. Leave granted to the Appellant to appeal against sentence; 
       
       
      4. Appellant’s appeal against sentence dismissed.  
       
      
    155 HIDDEN J: I agree with Wood CJ at CL.  
     
      
    156 SMART AJ:  The facts and circumstances have been stated in the comprehensive judgment of Wood CJ at CL. 
     
      
    157 I agree with the Chief Judge that the evidence was not sufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that prior to 24 November 2001 the appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation of narcotic goods consisting of not less than a commercial quantity of ecstasy tablets. The critical question is whether it was reasonably open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was knowingly concerned in an importation from 24 November 2001 to 5 December 2001 or part of that period. These principles emerge from the authorities. 
     
      
       
        
       
       
        
        (a) ""Importation"" extends on both sides of the actual act of importing into the country The term ""importation"" involves some measure of flexibility. See per Barwick CJ in  
        Forbes v Traders Finance Ltd,  
        126 CLR 429 at 432 and Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Lam  
         (1990) 46 A Crim R 402. 
         
        (b) The important question is not so much the precise meaning and application of the word ""importation"" as the meaning and application of the phrase ""knowingly concerned in the importation"". See per Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Lam 
        .  
         
        (c) The word ""concerned"" is one of general import and it is impossible to state with precision what it comprehends. Regard must be had to the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The concept of being concerned in the importation is one of some flexibility. The word ""involved"" is often given as a synonym for ""concerned"". See per Gleeson CJ in  
        Lam. 
         
        (d) Importation means more than ""landing"". The prohibition against being knowingly concerned (or involved) in the importation of narcotic goods covers those within Australia who become concerned in arranging the importation and in moving the goods, once imported, into the community. See  
        R v Courtney-Smith 
          
        (No 2)  
        (1990) 48 A Crim R 49.  
        
       
       
        
        (e) A time will be reached when involvement with narcotic goods in their passage through the Australian community cannot properly be categorised as knowing concern in their ""importation"". See  
        R v Courtney-Smith (No 2). 
        
       
       
        
        (f) Innocent collection, transport or handling of goods after their arrival or providing a place for their permanent or temporary storage, although amounting to concern in their importation in one sense, will not be criminal. See  
        R v Courtney-Smith 
        
       
       
        
        (g) The concern does not have to be made manifest in a physical sense while the importation is taking place. It is sufficient if the ""concern"" is manifested in the venture which centred upon the importation. 
        
       
       
        
        (h) If imported narcotic goods are still in a container and held in a hired factory or storage facility before distribution to the intended markets they are still in the state of importation. See  
        R v Lam. 
        
       
       
        
        (i) Importation is a venture or process not a physical act which occurs or ceases at the moment of import. Intervention by the authorities, for example, seizing the goods, does not prevent that process or venture from continuing and a person might subsequently become concerned in the importation. See  
        R v Leff 
         (1996) 86 A Crim R 212 per James J and per Gleeson CJ. 
        
       
       
        
        (j) Concern in an importation can commence at a time when it has apparently broken down and where efforts are being made to bring it to fruition. See per Gleeson CJ in  
        Leff 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        (k) Where narcotic goods are imported into Australia in the voids of pieces of machinery or equipment the act of importation embraces the removal of those narcotic goods from such pieces of machinery and equipment and attempts to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        (l) As importation is a process or venture, even where the authorities have intervened and removed most of the narcotic goods from the pieces of machinery and equipment, but left some of the narcotic goods and added inert substances or tablets, removal of such goods by a person and attempts to remove them amounts to being concerned in the importation. Usually, the machinery or equipment has been delivered to the consignee or his, her or its nominee after the narcotic goods, or most of them, have been removed. Part of the importation is the machinery and equipment in which the narcotic goods have been secreted. 
        
       
      
    158 The facts in the present case extend the concept of being concerned in an importation close to its limits, putting aside temporarily the concept of ""knowingly"". 
     
      
    159 The importation was intercepted by the Australian Government Authorities in Brisbane and most of the narcotic goods (ecstasy tablets) were removed from the 48 columns of the portable coolroom, and inert tablets (described as lollies) were substituted. The equipment was transferred to a Brisbane warehouse. Part of the coolroom, including the columns, were transported by road to the appellant's newly acquired house at 84 Consett Street, Concord under the supervision of Louis Sukkar and John Choi, arriving there during the morning of Saturday, 24 November 2001. 
     
      
    160 The appellant arrived at the house shortly after noon on 24 November. This was his first inspection of the house he had bought and in which his brother, Louis, his brother's girl friend, Michelle Royal, and a young Asian student, a boarder, lived. During the afternoon the hired truck was unloaded by Louis Sukkar, assisted by the appellant and the student. The coolroom columns which contained the tablets were placed in the garage. 
     
      
    161 During the afternoon Louis Sukkar became aware that the tablets in the columns were not ecstasy tablets and telephoned his brother, Joseph Sukkar with that news. Later in the afternoon Joseph Sukkar arrived and after he arrived the columns were shifted from the garage to a garden shed and the coolroom doors were unloaded from the truck and put in the garage. 
     
      
    162 At 3.12pm Louis Sukkar left 84 Consett Street, drove around the corner and met John Choi. The appellant contended that that was so Louis Sukkar could tell Choi that the appellant was there and alert Choi not to say anything about the importation. Meanwhile, in response to a message left by John Choi on the appellant's mobile telephone, he telephoned Choi and they had a brief discussion about something having nothing to do with the importation. No reference was made to the importation or to the cargo having arrived or being unloaded. The appellant asked Choi if he was coming their way and Choi told the appellant that he was in Croydon. Choi visited 84 Consett Street, but did not inspect the cargo in the garden shed. Shortly after 4.00pm the appellant and Choi went to Strathfield, in separate vehicles. They conferred there. They also spoke to people in and about coffee shops and restaurants who appeared to have nothing to do with the importation. Choi was a long time client of the appellant. After 6.00pm the appellant arrived back at 84 Consett Street, stayed for six minutes and left. It cannot be safely inferred that the appellant and Choi went to Strathfield to talk about the importation. If they had wished to do that 84 Consett Street was a preferable venue. 
     
      
    163 As soon as the appellant left 84 Consett Street, Louis Sukkar telephoned Choi. Later, about 1938 hours, Louis telephoned Joseph and remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It's nothing … I ate about three of them. There's nothing and ah Michelle ate one. Stephen also ate two there's nothing at all."" 
        
       
      
    164 With some doubt but taking the evidence the Crown relied upon at its highest I agree that this conversation was admissible, but when regard is had to the whole of the evidence it provides a tenuous and insubstantial base from which to conclude that the appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation. It is appreciated that this was one of a series of matters relied upon by the Crown. 
     
      
    165 During the period from 25 November 2001 until the evening of 1 December 2001 there were many conversations between Louis Sukkar, Joseph Sukkar and the appellant. In every conversation between Louis Sukkar and Joseph Sukkar they spoke about the importation but when speaking to and with the appellant the importation was never mentioned. There were many conversations between Louis Sukkar and others and Joseph Sukkar and others when the subject of the conversation was the importation. 
     
      
    166 During the period mentioned, Louis Sukkar endeavoured to obtain all the ""paperwork"" as to the importation. Joseph Sukkar also tried to work out what had happened. He kept in touch with the European suppliers and contacts and tried to mollify them. Initially, he suspected that the substitution had occurred in Europe. 
     
      
    167 On 27 November 2001 Choi was at 84 Consett Street from 3.53pm to 4.11pm and gave documents to Louis Sukkar. After Choi left there were conversations between others about documents. At 4.35pm there was a somewhat heated conversation between Louis Sukkar and Choi about the money that had been lost. At 5.11pm Choi telephoned the appellant and spoke to him about a wholly different matter. Nothing was said in this conversation about the importation, the documents or the loss of any money. In a further telephone conversation at 6.46pm between the appellant and Choi nothing was said about those matters. The appellant was at 84 Consett Street on Tuesday 27 November 2001 between 8.11pm and 9.57pm and talked with Michelle Royal, a young lady called Lisa, and his brother Louis about a number of matters but not the importation. He telephoned Peter and arranged to go riding on the following Sunday. Despite the variety of subjects covered nothing was said about the importation, the documents or the lost moneys. 
     
      
    168 At 10.24pm and 10.25pm, well after the appellant had left, there were two telephone calls between Louis Sukkar and Choi concerning documents. 
     
      
    169 The appellant had visited 84 Consett Street on Sunday, 25 November and Monday 26 November but did not visit on 28 and 29 November. He visited on Friday 30 November. Early that day Joseph Sukkar had spoken with the European suppliers. Later in the morning Joseph and Louis discussed the European telephone call. Joseph spoke to the appellant at 2.23pm and 5.11pm. There was no mention of the importation or anything connected with it. 
     
      
    170 Given the closeness of the Sukkar brothers it is very surprising neither Louis nor Joseph said anything to the appellant about the importation or anything connected with it. 
     
      
    171 On Saturday, 1 December 2001 the appellant arrived at 84 Consett Street with Louis and Joseph at 1.11pm. Later on Malek Jarjo arrived and there was a conversation about diamonds.. After that conversation Joseph and Jarjo left. Later on the appellant washed his car. He spoke to Louis but did not speak about the importation. At 5.01pm a conversation took place between Louis, Joseph and the appellant. There was considerable talk of family problems; a family barbecue was arranged that night at Joseph's place. 
     
      
    172 The importation was the constant subject of discussion between all those who were knowingly concerned and there were many such conversations. There was never any reference to the importation in any conversation with the appellant. It was submitted by the appellant that up to this point he knew nothing of the importation. 
     
      
    173 In his reasons the Chief Judge has summarised the available evidence in support of the Crown case against the appellant. Some of the material relied upon by the Crown is based on the activities and remarks of other members of the common enterprise. While Joseph, Louis and Choi were aware of the importation of narcotic goods the evidence from the many intercepts and the listening devices shows that the importation and matters connected with it were not mentioned in conversations with the appellant. Joseph, Louis and Choi must have abstained deliberately. 
     
      
    174 The appellant's attendances at 84 Consett Street from 24 November to early evening on 1 December 2001 are not surprising considering that he had recently purchased that property, that the brother who was closest to him lived there, that he had recently broken up with his girl friend and was at a loose end and the agreement that Louis would live there rent free and renovate the property. I have not overlooked that the truck containing the columns was driven to 84 Consett Street, that the appellant assisted in unloading and placing the columns in the garage and later assisted in shifting them to the garden shed. 
     
      
    175 I do not think that any inference adverse to the appellant can be drawn from his visit to a coffee shop (or shops) and restaurant at Strathfield with Choi and speaking to Choi and other people there. What was said is not known and in subsequent conversations between them prior to the evening of 1 December 2001 neither the importation nor anything connected with it was discussed. 
     
      
    176 The Crown also relied on what the appellant is recorded as saying during the evening of 1 December 2001 and subsequently and what he did as showing the extent of his knowledge and previous engagement in the enterprise. 
     
      
    177 The Crown placed reliance upon a series of conversations which it claimed indicated that the appellant was well aware of the drug operations of the Sukkar family, for example, the appellant's remark to Louis about coolrooms ""All right so he (Choi) knew from last time"" it was coolrooms. There were the further comments by the appellant, ""… we'll do it ourselves next time its all right"" and about Choi having ""overstepped the mark this time"". These remarks, along with others, provided some basis from which the Crown could argue that the appellant had been involved, as had Choi, in past importations of tablets using coolrooms and intended to involve himself in further importations. This was coupled with the use of words such as ""we"" and ""us"". All these statements were said to make it difficult to accept lack of knowledge on the appellant's part while the importation was in progress. Again, the admission of this evidence does not effectively prove the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown is trying to read too much into some relatively small segments of the evidence and not taking the evidence as a whole. 
     
      
    178 By the evening of 1 December 2001 despite extensive inquiries Joseph and Louis had not succeeded in ascertaining what had happened, that is how, when, and by whom the bulk of the ecstasy tablets had been removed. It was the defence case that at the barbecue the appellant was told of the importation, the removal of the tablets and what had happened so far as Joseph and Louis were aware. The appellant was told of the steps taken to date and asked to assist. The Crown relied upon the terms of the conversations held by the appellant that evening with Choi, who was in China, from about 2049 hours onwards as showing the extent of the appellant's knowledge of the venture, particularly having regard to the familiarity with which he discussed the matter with Choi. The appellant held conversations with others during the evening. 
     
      
    179 The Crown relied on the use by the appellant in his conversations of the words ""we"", ""ourselves"" and ""us"", but this should not be regarded as significant. Solicitors and others often use the plural to cover the interests or people they represent. 
     
      
    180 Choi was a client and business associate who also knew the appellant's brothers. In such a context a loose general word would naturally be used and it would be odd for the appellant to differentiate between his brothers and himself. Precision of expression is not to be expected in such circumstances. From the conversation at 2049 hours it appears that the appellant was worried about the attitude and actions the Europeans might take and questioned Choi extensively about the movement of the goods in Brisbane and the documents and whether there was any gap when the goods could have been substituted. 
     
      
    181 After a further conversation with Choi, contacting the Customs broker (during which the appellant misled the broker as to his name), another conversation with Choi and speaking with his brothers in a telephone call at 2159 hours, the appellant made a further call to Louis at 2204 hours. By this time the appellant had deduced that there was a forty hour period in which the goods could have been substituted. After his discussion with Louis the appellant telephoned Choi at 2211 hours and explained, amongst other things, that there was a period of forty hours after quarantine when the goods were sitting in the ports before ""we"" got them. The appellant expressed the view, ""something smells"". Choi commented that the appellant was saying that ""they"" (possibly people associated with the Customs broker or Intergroup Shipping), had changed the goods. The appellant replied, ""Something like that because they're very badly packed"" and ""You can see it's been done it's been very rushed …"". The Crown relied on the appellant giving Choi instructions. 
     
      
    182 In a conversation with Louis at 2223 hours the appellant expressed his suspicion that Choi and his friends working in conjunction with the Customs broker intercepted and removed the tablets. The appellant explained that when a person fills up a column with foam it expands over 24 hours. It is sanded back and a little cover is put over the foam. The appellant added, ""some of the packaging here was bulging out."" If the packaging was bulging out that could have been readily seen as the columns were being transported. That does not involve looking inside the columns. 
     
      
    183 A detailed examination of the evidence persuades me that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that between 24 November and the evening of 1 December 2001 the appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation of narcotic goods, I regard much of the material on which the Crown relied as equivocal and readily explicable. 
     
      
    184 However, the evidence of what occurred from the evening of 1 December 2001 to 5 December 2001 is in a different category. In approaching that evidence I bear in mind that importation is a process or venture and that a person can become involved in it even where it has apparently broken down and he makes efforts to pursue and try to enliven it. 
     
      
    185 During the evening of 1 December 2001 the appellant made determined efforts to trace the course of events after the landing of the goods and to ascertain who was responsible for the substitution and to recover the goods or otherwise make good the loss which had been incurred. As a result of his activities his suspicions fell on Choi and his Brisbane associates. 
     
      
    186 It was the appellant's case that on learning of the importation he wanted everything connected with it removed from his house and pressed that desire on his brothers. 
     
      
    187 On Sunday, 2 December Louis rented a truck which was initially driven to Joseph Sukkar's home in Croydon, arriving about 10.25am. About 10.28 Joseph called the appellant and asked him to come and help them at Louis"". 
     
      
    188 About 10.38am the appellant drove to 84 Consett Street. About 10.42am the three brothers participated in a conversation. They contemplated what might be in store for Choi. During that conversation the appellant said  
     
      
       
        
         
        ""We'll get it back."" 
        
       
      and  
       
        
        ""we'll do it ourselves next time."" 
        
       
      
    189 The reference to ""We'll get it back"" meant getting Choi's share back. 
     
      
    190 At the end of the conversation this was said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Louis: …let's um open the rest of these things. 
         
        Joseph: Open em here."" 
        
       
      
    191 The appellant, Joseph and Louis proceeded to open the other end of some of the columns looking for more drugs and sorting the tablets into ecstasy tablets and inert tablets. About 1049 hours the appellant gave Paul Sukkar directions for getting to 84 Consett Street.  
     
      
    192 From about 10.50am onwards the four brothers opened columns and sorted tablets. Joseph proposed that they open one column at a time and empty the contents into bags. The appellant replied,  
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Thought we could drive it all up to Paul's place and just open it all get all the pills out. 
        
       
       
        
        There's some in doubles we got to check 'em again which ones did we miss."" 
        
       
      
    193 There was further discussion between the four brothers as they worked away at checking the columns and ensuring that they were empty. An unknown male joined them. 
     
      
    194 About 12.02 hours Louis remarked ""There's over two hundred thousand dollars in there he's not seeing any of that."" The appellant said ""It's fifty thousand E's that's pretty good."" He later referred to five thousand. 
     
      
    195 In a conversation about 12.52 hours that day as to Choi the appellant remarked, ""I'm the one who that put them on to him"", and confirmed the remark of Paul Sukkar, ""don't you know what we have been doing through the last five to six years you f--- animal."" The appellant remarked that Joseph could have made ""a million and you guys would have made three or four hundred thousand selling them."" The appellant said, ""We don't want the goods and you give us the the money go sell 'em."" 
     
      
    196 The Crown also relied on comments made by the appellant at 1425 and 1532 hours as to Choi's insistence that the goods go to Brisbane where it's easier because there is less checking and as to his suspicions about the shipping company. 
     
      
    197 About 1632 hours there was conversation between the four brothers and the unknown male about the experiment of dissolving some tablets in water. About 1737 hours there was a discussion involving Joseph, Louis, the appellant and an unidentified male in which there was some unintelligible conversation seemingly as to the value of the tablets. 
     
      
    198 The empty columns were taken by truck by Paul Sukkar to a storeroom in Granville. The substitute and genuine tablets had been separated. Louis Sukkar was to remove these from 84 Consett Street but failed to do so. 
     
      
    199 About 1558 hours on 3 December 2001 in a telephone conversation between the appellant and a man called Michael there was reference to the big swap which had recently taken place. The appellant said, ""… as soon as he gets back I'll get them."" The appellant commented that ""they"" had access to them [the goods] for two days before they gave it [the goods] to us. The ""they"" appears to be a reference to Choi and his Brisbane associates. 
     
      
    200 About 1837 hours on 3 December 2001 Choi telephoned the appellant and discussed the importation and the documents. Choi stated, ""nobody can access that yard besides P and O people."" The appellant said that he did not want Choi to call anyone or anything and continued, ""just try get back ASAP 'cause those people are here get those documents for us I don't want to call anyone I want to back away from it mate too hot for me and too dirty for me go away I don't want to do it anymore."" 201 None of the Sukkar brothers and Choi realised that their telephone calls were being intercepted and recorded. There was no attempt to speak in code. There are relatively small snatches of conversations which are capable of being regarded as suggesting the involvement of the appellant in the importation prior to 2050 hours on 1 December 2001 and there are two videos of 24 November 2001 and 2 December 2001 on which the Crown relied. The video of 24 November 2001 shows the unloading of the van and the stacking of columns and doors in the garage. It also shows Choi arriving and Choi and the appellant leaving to go to Strathfield and at Strathfield, and the appellant returning to 84 Consett Street. The video of 2 December 2001 shows the Sukkar brothers attending to the columns and loading them and the doors onto a van. The video did not throw any further light on when the appellant first became knowingly involved in the importation.  
     
      
    202 By way of a strong counterbalance the Court has the unusual benefit of the terms of the conversations between Louis, Joseph, Choi and the appellant. In this, the Court is not dependent on the credibility of those speakers. The recordings reveal that prior to 2050 hours on 1 December 2001 while the importation was freely and frequently discussed between Joseph and Louis and Choi and Louis it was never mentioned in this period when they were speaking with the appellant. This reveals an incredible state of affairs if the appellant was knowingly involved prior to 2050 hours on 1 December 2001. Further, Louis went to speak to Choi away from 84 Consett Street prior to him arriving at the site. The inference is that Louis did not want Choi to reveal the correct position as to what was happening to the appellant. It is possible theoretically that the appellant was knowingly involved from 24 November 2001 or prior to that date. However, if that were so, some mention of this in some form would have been made in the many telephone conversations with him. Taking all the Crown evidence together it was not along with the remainder of the evidence open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's knowing involvement prior to 2050 hours on 1 December 2001. 
     
      
    203 It seems that when Louis and Joseph were unable to resolve what had happened that the appellant was called upon to assist. That was in the evening of 1 December 2001 and when he first became knowingly involved in the importation. Initially it was not a physical involvement but it became physical as well as managerial on 2 December 2001. 
     
      
    204 Whatever may have been the true position prior to the evening of Saturday, 1 December 2001 the evidence establishes that as from at least 2050 hours on 1 December 2001 the appellant became knowingly concerned in the importation of the narcotic goods. Indeed, he became intimately involved as he sought to establish what had happened to the goods and to either recover them or procure compensation for their loss. Late in the evening of 1 December 2001 the appellant procured the assistance of Paul Sukkar, his brother, to remove the columns from 84 Consett Street. On the Sunday the appellant became involved in opening the columns and the pipes encased in the columns to check whether all tablets had been removed, removing any remaining tablets, sorting the tablets, overseeing the removal of the columns and arranging for Louis to remove the tablets from 84 Consett Street. The appellant appreciated the danger of any of these items or goods remaining at the house he owned. The conversations on 3 December were revealing both as to the appellant's involvement, his attitude to Choi and his efforts to extricate himself and his family from the positions in which they found themselves. 
     
      
    205 On the basis of the evidence as to what occurred from 2050 hours on 1 December 2001 onwards there was sufficient evidence entitling the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant of the charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation of narcotic goods. 
     
      
    206 I have earlier expressed my agreement with the conclusion reached by the Chief Judge on Ground 1. I also agree with the conclusion reached by the Chief Judge on Ground 2. The Crown is entitled to rely on the conversations in questions which occurred on 1, 2, 3 and 4 December 2001 and to put its case at the highest. The conversations are capable of providing some support for the Crown case and in rebuttal of the defence case, This does not mean that the conversations are determinative. 
     
      
    207 I agree with what the Chief Judge has written on Grounds 3, 4 and 5 and the additional ground of appeal and his rejection of those Grounds. As to Ground 6, while I agree with the Chief Judge's conclusion I have done so on a narrower basis. The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    208 The judge sentenced the appellant on the basis that the depth of his knowing concern was greater than that which I think the evidence reasonably supports. My view as to the proven extent of the appellant's knowing involvement (or concern) in the importation disposes of the Crown appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    209 If the wider basis upon which the Chief Judge would uphold the conviction is correct, and there are substantial grounds in support of that approach, the appellant's appeal against his sentence should be rejected. 
     
      
    210 On the narrower view of the appellant's offence is the sentence imposed within the permissible range? On my approach the appellant's involvement did not commence until well after the narcotic goods had been landed. The appellant's knowing involvement (as distinct from his involvement) commenced on the evening of 1 December 2001 when he undertook the task of ascertaining what had happened to the goods after they arrived in Australia and whether there were any ""gaps "" when the substitution could have taken place. This led to him studying the documents and speaking with his brothers, Choi and the Customs broker. Having formed the conviction that Choi and his associates were responsible for the substitution he gave consideration to the recovery of the tablets and the obtaining of compensation for the losses suffered and generally managing Choi and the situation which he believed had developed as to him. The opinion which the appellant had formed as to Choi's role in the substitution was erroneous. 
     
      
    211 While the role of the appellant proven beyond reasonable doubt was limited, his offence was serious. Part of his role involved eliciting sufficient facts so his brother Joseph could satisfy the European principals that he and Louis had not participated in any substitution or been guilty of any careless or underhand conduct. The appellant, once he became aware of the position, desired to have the columns and tablets removed from his property at 84 Consett Street as soon as possible, and took steps to that end. He became involved in opening and checking the columns and sorting the tablets into substituted ones (""lollies"") and ecstasy tablets. He was generally active in endeavouring to recover the situation for his brothers. It was apparent that the remaining ecstasy tablets would be sold. The fact that the appellant was mistaken in his analysis of the situation and unsuccessful does not lessen his criminality. 
     
      
    212 Louis had been in Brisbane collecting the portable coolroom. It was Louis who lived at 84 Consett Street, drove the truck from Kempsey to that address and initiated and supervised the unloading of the columns. Louis and Joseph were the organisers and moving spirits behind the Australian end of the importation but, as previously mentioned, the evidence points to neither of them speaking to the appellant about it between 24 November and the evening of 1 December. On the evidence the appellant was not involved in the importation until well after the goods were landed. While it was ultimately left to him to find out what had happened and who had effected the substitution, the evidence does not establish that he was involved in bringing the narcotic goods into Australia or in the proposed arrangements to distribute such goods in Australia. On the other hand, when made aware of importation and substitution on the evening of 1 December, he joined his brothers in trying to salvage the operation and in handling the fall-out. 
     
      
    213 In my opinion, a sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 9 years is manifestly excessive for the limited role played by the appellant. 
     
      
    214 In determining the correct sentence I have had regard to the appellant's favourable subjective features as outlined by the judge. These were highly favourable. He was the youngest member of the family and the one who had made good. His career as a solicitor has been destroyed. This is a severe punishment. I have applied the terms of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. The element of deterrence is important. The appellant has allowed family loyalties to override his duties as a solicitor in upholding and obeying the law. 
     
      
    215 After taking a starting point of 16 years and allowing a discount of about one-third, I would impose a sentence of 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. 
     
      
    216 I would make the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
          1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
          
         
        
       
      
     2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          3. Appeal against sentence allowed; sentence quashed. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          4. In lieu of the sentence imposed, the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 11 years commencing on 5 December 2001 with a non-parole period of 7 years commencing that day and expiring on 4 December 2008 when the appellant becomes eligible for release on parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
     
       
      
    1 WOOD CJ AT CL: I will ask Grove J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence imposed by Andrew ADCJ in the District Court.  
     
      
    3 The respondent had pleaded guilty to a single charge of discharging a firearm in a public place contrary to s 93G(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 which offence carries a prescribed maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. His Honour ordered the respondent to enter into a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act) for a period of six months, commencing on the date of imposition of sentence (28 January 2005). It would therefore expire on 27 July 2005. The usual conditions as to good behaviour, notification of change of address and appearance if called upon during the currency of the bond were imposed. 
     
      
    4 It might be noted at the outset that at the first instance hearing the Crown Prosecutor conceded that this particular offence might appropriately be met by a sentence of imprisonment ""after the release date in May"" suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Act abovementioned. The Crown now recognises a defect in that concession and I will return to it, but a principal focus of its submission in the appeal is that, in the circumstances, what was imposed amounted to very little effectual punishment at all. This can be perceived by reference to the circumstances of the offence and the respondent's history. 
     
      
    5 On the afternoon of Friday 13 October 2000 the respondent was at his home at Dulwich Hill. At the time there was in existence a family dispute and a relative (by marriage) of the respondent arrived at his premises which was a unit in a complex of residences. This person commenced to make loud threats in the direction of the unit occupied by the respondent. These threats were confirmed by neighbours who heard expressions such as ""You fucking pricks, you cunts, let me in"" and ""You're dead"". The relative then commenced banging on the front security door as a result of which a neighbour called from a balcony for him to leave. In response he produced a rifle from a duffle bag. Partial protrusion of that weapon from the bag had been earlier observed by others. 
     
      
    6 The would-be intruder continued his attempts to enter the premises and he had reached the stage of breaking glass panels on the front door. The respondent armed himself with a pistol, which, in accordance with agreed facts, he had obtained ""because of previous threats made towards (him) and members of his family by (this person)"".  
     
      
    7 When the respondent emerged from the premises the intruder had moved to the rear of his motor car. It is further agreed that at that stage the respondent believed that he was retrieving the firearm. Thereupon the respondent fired four shots into the air with the intention of frightening the other into leaving. This was achieved and the intruder drove off at high speed.  
     
      
    8 It is the discharge of those four shots into the air in those circumstances which is the basis of charge. 
     
      
    9 Although police were called, the respondent was neither arrested nor charged. It appears that the intruder was interviewed at some point but denied having been present on 13 October.  
     
      
    10 On 21 December 2001 the respondent was arrested and charged with offences of supplying prohibited drugs. He was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 24 May 2002. His first date of eligibility for parole is 23 May 2005. An appeal against sentence was later dismissed.  
     
      
    11 It should be observed that a cousin of the respondent was killed whilst in gaol and the respondent gave evidence against offenders who were convicted of murder and an attempt to murder the respondent. The sentence which the respondent had received in respect of the drug matter took into account assistance to authorities and that, by reason thereof, his sentence is being served in strict protection. 
     
      
    12 As can be deduced from the foregoing, the bond imposed by Andrew ADCJ will be concurrent with full-time custody of the respondent except to the extent that he may be released to parole between 23 May 2005 and 27 July 2005. The court is unaware as to whether a determination of actual date for release to parole has been made. 
     
      
    13 Submissions and counter submissions have been received from counsel for the Crown and for the respondent, and attention has been drawn to the general objective seriousness of the discharge of a firearm, in particular a pistol, in a public place. It must add to the seriousness of any such offence that the public place was in a residential area. On the other hand, there is substance in the submission on behalf of the respondent that, given the threat posed by the intruder who was himself armed, the discharge of shots into the air, which fortunately had the desired effect, was a selection of a relatively safe, although unlawful, option.  
     
      
    14 The learned sentencing judge found that the case was at ""the very end of the low end of the scale"" and it has not been shown that that finding was not open to him. It was also appropriate for his Honour to take into account (as was further conceded) that the plea of guilty was made at the earliest opportunity, the matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court and that the offence was stale in that it had not been prosecuted for over three years. The charge was not preferred against the respondent until 13 February 2003. 
     
      
    15 I am, however, of the view that the Crown contention that the penalty imposed by his Honour represented virtually no punishment at all is made good, and that, despite the favourable findings open to his Honour, a sentence which imposed virtually no punishment at all should be held to be manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    16 The current sentence of the respondent will not expire until 23 May 2006 and any liberty enjoyed by him up to that time can be anticipated to be subject to conditions of parole. It would be an additional imposition on the respondent if, during the anticipated period, he was subject to the risks inherent in a suspended sentence. 
     
      
    17 In a written submission to this Court the Crown observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The concession by the Crown that there would be no error if a suspended sentence were imposed properly had regard to the delayed interruption to his life by reason of being sentenced long after the offence"".  
        
       
      
    18 In a submission in response this was taken to contend that the Crown was seeking only that the matter be dealt with by way of suspended sentence. This form of sentence is no longer pressed.  
     
      
    19 As I have indicated, I would regard a suspended sentence as a proportionate penalty in the circumstances. However, the imposition of suspended sentence is governed by s 12 of the Act subsection (2) of which provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “(2) An order under this section may not be made, in relation to a sentence of imprisonment if the offender is subject to some other sentence of imprisonment that is not the subject of such an order"". 
        
       
        
       
      It would not be competent to order a sentence to be suspended pursuant to s 12. 
      
    20 The provision precludes suspension of a sentence during such time as any other custodial sentence is in force during both its parole and non parole periods: R v Edigarov 2001 125 A Crim R 551. 
     
      
    21 It would be repugnant to any sense of fairness that an offence committed in 2000 and charged in 2003 should be met with a sentence, even if suspended, commencing after the expiry of sentence in 2006. More significantly, specification of the date of commencement of sentence is governed by s 47 which is in Part 4 of the Act. Part 4 is excluded in relation to sentences ordered to be suspended by s 12 (3). 
     
      
    22 I am unpersuaded that the justice of the situation would make it appropriate to extend the period of the respondent's present custody by an imposition which would postpone his present date of eligibility for release to parole. Such an order is not pressed by the Crown.  
     
      
    23 Nor, however, do I consider that the circumstances should be met by a good behaviour bond pursuant to s 9 to operate for a greater length of time than that ordered in the District Court. As I have observed the respondent, if released, will be subject to parole conditions until the expiry of his current sentence. It is now contended this Court should impose a bond of greater length than the potential parole period. As I have said, for this stale offence, such a course would be, in my view, inappropriate. 
     
      
    24 Although for the reasons given I consider that the imposition in the District Court was manifestly inadequate, in the very unusual circumstances of this case I would exercise the residual discretion of this Court to dismiss a Crown appeal and I would so order.  
     
      
    25 WOOD CJ AT CL: I agree. 
     
      
    26 HOEBEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    27 WOOD CJ AT CL: The orders of the Court will therefore be as proposed by Grove J.

      L026/96 REGINA v BRONSON MATTHEW BLESSINGTON 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 28 November 1996, the applicant, Bronson Mathew Blessington made an application for re-determination of his life sentence pursuant to s 13A Sentencing Act 1989 as it then stood, and by Notice of Motion filed 19 August 2004 he seeks the separate determination of the questions identified in the annexure to such Notice of Motion.  
     
      
    2 Mr Basten QC and Ms Burgess appeared for the Applicant and the Crown Advocate (Mr R D Cogswell SC) and Ms Mitchelmore appeared for the Crown. The applicant contends inter alia that some of the statutory provisions relied on by the Crown are inconsistent with Chapter III of the Commonwealth Constitution and accordingly notice of the proceedings was given to the Attorney General of each of the States and Territories pursuant to s 78B Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and the Crown Advocate and Ms Mitchelmore also appear to intervene on behalf of the Attorney General of New South Wales, but only on the constitutional issues. The other State and Territory Attorneys General indicated that they did not wish to be heard.  
     
      
    3 On 8 September 1988, a group of five “street kids” who had no fixed place of abode including the Applicant, then aged 14, abducted Janine Balding from the car park at Sutherland Railway Station in her own car, sexually assaulted her and then drowned her in a dam near Minchinbury. Some of her jewellery and personal possessions were taken.  
     
      
    4 The Applicant was tried along with Mathew James Elliott and Steven Wayne Jamieson and, following trial by jury, he was convicted of murder, abduction, sexual intercourse without consent, robbery and other charges. Not only was he aged only 14 at the time of the offences but he and his co-offenders were “street kids” accustomed to sleeping on park benches and in empty railway carriages, and psychiatric evidence adduced on the sentencing proceedings indicated that his mental age at the time was even lower, and he was illiterate. The psychiatrist who examined him for the purpose of the sentencing proceedings considered that he had an abnormality of mind from an inherent cause present at the time of the offence, which fitted the criteria for a defence of diminished responsibility, although no such defence had been raised during the course of the trial. Reports from the Department of Youth and Community Services indicated that the applicant had made excellent progress during his period of detention whilst awaiting trial.  
     
      
    5 After sentencing each of the prisoners for the various other offences, Newman J dealt with the murder, and after dealing with Jamieson went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of the two youths, Elliott and Blessington, I find this to be a difficult task, difficult because of their extreme youth, difficult in terms of the principles of law to which I have to apply. To sentence prisoners so young to a long term of imprisonment is, of course, a heavy task. However, the facts surrounding the commission of these crimes are so barbaric that I believe I have no alternative other than to impose upon both young prisoners, even despite their age, a life sentence. So grave is the nature of this case that  
        I recommend that none of the prisoners in the matter should ever be released 
        .”  
        (my underlining) 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant abandoned his appeal against his conviction and along with Elliott sought leave to appeal against his sentence: R v Jamieson, Elliott and Blessington (1992) 60 A Crim R 68. In dismissing the appeal, Gleeson CJ, with whom Hope AJA and Lee AJ agreed, said that notwithstanding the youth of the appellants, the imposition of a life sentence was well within the range of the trial judge’s sentencing discretion, that there was no error of fact or principle in the Remarks on Sentence and the sentences could not be characterised as manifestly excessive. He went on: 
     
      
       
        
        “Under the relevant legislation, the appellants will have the right, after the lapse of a certain period of time, to apply to a Judge of this Court to change the indeterminate sentences to determinate sentences. A decision in that regard can then be made in the light of all the relevant factors, including the custodial history of the appellants up until the date of the application.  
        
       
       
        
        With respect to the learned sentencing judge however, I have a problem concerning his recommendation that the appellant should never be released. Counsel agreed that this would have no legal effect if and when an application to fix a determinate sentence is made. There does not appear to have been any statutory basis for the making of the “recommendation”, nor, for that matter does there seem to be any statutory basis for appealing against it. Even so, I think it appropriate to express the view that, especially where the offender is a young person, and there are so many different possibilities as to what might happen in the future, it is normally not appropriate for a sentencing judge to seek to anticipate decisions that might fall to be made by other persons, and in other proceedings, or under other legislation, over the ensuing decades. For that reason, I should indicate that I do no support the recommendation made by Newman J.” 
        
       
      
    7 The “relevant legislation” to which his Honour was referring was s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989 (the 1989 Act) which was introduced by the Sentencing (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1989 which commenced from 12 January 1990 and permitted persons such as the applicant, after serving 8 years of his or her sentence, to apply to the Supreme Court for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term of the sentence.  
     
      
    8 At the time the applicant committed the offence, a person subject to life imprisonment in New South Wales had an opportunity for release on licence pursuant to s 463 of the Crimes Act 1900 as then in force. Release on Licence, under the old scheme was a prospect which almost universally became fact, although such release was not inevitable.  
     
      
    9 In November 1993, the 1989 Act was amended by the Sentencing (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1993 which inserted subs (8)-(8B) into s 13A. The effect of this amendment was that in cases where the Court refused to specify a term, it might direct that the offender never re-apply to the Court for such determination or that he not re-apply for a specified period. As noted above, on 28 November 1996, the applicant applied for a re-determination of his life sentence.  
     
      
    10 The Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 No 6 (the 1997 Act) was assented to on 9 May 1996. That Act which commenced on the date of assent amended s 13A by inserting a definition of “non-release recommendation” as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Non-release recommendation, in relation to person serving an existing life sentence, means a recommendation or observation, or an expression of opinion, by the original sentencing court that (or to the effect that) the person should never be released from imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    11 It also amended s 13A (3) and (3A) to read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (3) A person is not eligible to make such an application unless the person has served: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) at least 8 years of the sentence concerned, except where the paragraph (b) applies, or 
           
          (b) at least 20 years of the sentence concerned, if the person was the subject of a non-release recommendation. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3A) A person who is the subject of a non-release recommendation is not eligible for the determination of a minimum term and an additional term under this section, unless the Supreme Court, when considering the persons’ application under this section, is satisfied that special reasons exist that justify making the determination. 
        
       
      
    12 Part 3 of Schedule 2A contained transitional provisions consequent upon the amendments effected by the Act. Clause 8 (1) read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The amendments made by the amending Act to section 13A do not apply to an application made by any person under that section that was pending immediately before the day on which the Bill for the amending Act was introduced into Parliament. However, they apply to any application made by such a person under section 13A on or after that day. 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant was therefore not affected by the amendments which would have required him to wait 20 years before making an application because his application was pending immediately before the day on which the Bill for the amending Act was introduced into Parliament. However, on the next sitting day of Parliament, the Sentencing Amendment (Transitional) Act 1997 No 8 (the Transitional Act) was introduced and this Act was assented to on 20 May 1997. It amended clause 8(1) of Schedule 2A of the earlier Act by providing that the amendments made by the Amending Act to s 13A applied in relation to an application made by any person under that section before the date on which the Bill of the Amending Act was introduced into Parliament, as well as in relation to applications made after that date, unless the application had been fully dealt with prior to the date on which the Transitional Act was introduced into Parliament. 
     
      
    14 It is agreed that the present applicant is the only person affected by the Transitional Act in that he is the only person who, having been sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-release recommendation had an application on foot prior to the introduction of the 1997 Act (No 6). 
     
      
    15 The Sentencing Act 1989 was repealed by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 No 94 and replaced by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 92 (the 1999 Act). Section 44 (5) of that Act, now subs (4), provides that Schedule 1 have effect in relation to existing life sentences and Schedule 1 substantially reproduces the provisions of s 13A of the 1989 Act.  
     
      
    16 The transitional provisions of the 1999 Act are contained in Schedule 2 of that Act, and clause 21 of that Schedule provides that any application under s 13A of the 1989 Act that had been made but not determined before the commencement of the appointed day is to be determined in accordance with Schedule 1 to that Act, but this provision does not apply to an application referred to in clause 8 (1) of Schedule 2A to the 1989 Act as in force immediately before the appointed day which was 3 April 2000. 
     
      
    17 Schedule 1 of the 1989 Act was further amended by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Existing Life Sentences) Act 2001 No 29 (the 2001 Act) which commenced on 20 July 2001. It inserted in clause 1 of Schedule 1 a definition of “sentencing court” as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “sentencing court, in relation to an offender who has been resentenced as a result of a re-trial or other appeal proceedings, includes both the court by which a penalty was originally imposed for the offence and the court (whether the same court or a different court) by which a penalty was finally imposed for the offence.” 
        
       
      
    18 It also increased from 20 years to 30 years the period of time that must elapse before a non-release recommendation prisoner is eligible to make an application for re-determination, and inserted a new sub clause (3) in clause 4 providing that even if the Court set a non-parole period in respect of non-release recommendation prisoners, it did not have jurisdiction to set a specified term for the sentence; so that in effect they would remain on parole for life.  
     
      
    19 That Act also added clause 39(a) to Schedule 2 of the 1999 Act which provided that the amendments made by the 2001 Act do not affect any proceedings before the Supreme Court on an application under clause 2 of Schedule 1 to the 1999 Act which had been made, but not disposed of, before the commencement of those amendments. 20 The 2001 Act also inserted s 154A into the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        154A Serious offenders the subject of non-release recommendations 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Section 143 does not require the Parole Board to give preliminary consideration as to whether or not a serious offender the subject of a non-release recommendation should be released on parole unless an application for that purpose is made to the Parole Board by or on behalf of the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) An application under this section must be lodged with the Secretary of the Parole Board. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) After considering the application, the Parole Board may make an order directing the release of the offender on parole if, and only if, the Parole Board: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) is satisfied (on the basis of a report prepared by the Chief Executive Officer of the Corrections Health Service) that the offender: 
           
            
            (i) is in imminent danger of dying, or is incapacitated to the extent that he or she no longer has the physical ability to do harm to any person, and 
             
            (ii) has demonstrated that he or she does not pose a risk to the community, and 
            
           
          (b) is further satisfied that, because of those circumstances, the making of such an order is justified. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) In this section serious offender the subject of a non-release recommendation means a serious offender: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) who is serving a sentence for which a determination has been made under clause 4 of Schedule 1 to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and 
           
          (b) who is the subject of a non-release recommendation within the meaning of that Schedule. 
          
         
        
       
       
      Question 1 – On the assumption that the relevant provisions are valid laws and otherwise have application to the Applicant, has the applicant been, on and from the commencement of the Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 (NSW) on 9 May 1997, a person “the subject of a non-release recommendation” within the meaning of- 
       
       
        
        (a) section 13A(3)(b) of the Sentencing Act 1989, and 
         
        (b) clause 2(2)(b) of Schedule 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) ? 
        
       
      
    21 On their face the words of Newman J clearly constitute a non-release recommendation which by definition both in the Sentencing Act 1989 s 13A(1) and the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1989, Schedule 1 cl 1 means a “recommendation or observation or any expression of opinion by the sentencing court that (or to the effect that) the person should never be released from imprisonment”. 
     
      
    22 Formerly, the 1989 Act referred to a recommendation by the “original sentencing court” and that phrase clearly encompassed Newman J. The 1999 Act refers to the “sentencing court” which term is itself defined but only to widen the definition to include courts other than the original sentencing court, such as courts on appeal and re-trial. 
     
      
    23 It is true that in relation to this offender, Gleeson CJ speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal expressed the view (to put it at its highest) that such recommendation should not have been made, but he also pointed out that there was apparently no statutory basis for the making of the recommendation, nor any statutory basis for appealing against it. Consequently, the Court of Criminal Appeal made no order in respect of the recommendation and it remained in force, although it had no binding effect. 
     
      
    24 Questions 1 (a) and (b) should be answered “yes”. 
     
      
       
      Question 2 – If the answer to question 1(a) is yes, and on the assumption the provision had a valid operation in relation to the Applicant, did the replacement of sub-s13A(3) by Schedule 1, item [2] of the Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 apply to the application made by the applicant on 4 December 1996? 
       
      
    25 The Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 No 6 (the 1967 Act) introduced the special category of “non-release recommendation” prisoners and made 3 significant alterations to the legislation in respect of them. Firstly, it provided they were not eligible to make an application unless they had served 20 years of the sentence; secondly, they were not eligible for a determination unless the Court was satisfied “special reasons” existed that justified the making of the application; and thirdly (and this applied to all applicants), the Court in considering the application was to have regard to and give substantial weight to any relevant recommendations etc of the original sentencing court. Other amendments increased from 2 to 3 years the time after which a subsequent application could be made. 
     
      
    26 The transitional provisions inserted in Schedule 2A clause 8(1) provided that the amendments did not apply to an application made under that section which was pending immediately before the day the Bill was introduced into Parliament – that is 8 May 1997. At that time, the applicant had made an application (on 28 November 1996), which was valid when it was made, or “duly made”, and so the amendments effected by the 1967 Act did not apply to him. 
     
      
    27 Question 2 should be answered “no”. In particular, he did not have to wait 30 years before making his application (he had already made it) and he did not have to satisfy the Court that “special reasons” existed which justified the making of the application. 
     
      
       
      Question 3 – If the answer to question 1(a) is yes, and the answer to question 2 is no, did the replacement of sub-s 13A(3) by Schedule 1, item [2] of the Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 apply to the application made by the applicant on 4 December 1996, by reason of the new clause 8(1) inserted into Schedule 2A of the Sentencing Act by the Sentencing Amendment (Transitional) Act 1997, Schedule 1, item [1]? 
       
      
    28 So far as is relevant to this case, the only effect of the Sentencing Amendment (Transitional) Act 1997 No 8 (the Transitional Act) was to amend the transitional provisions in the earlier 1997 Act so as to provide that the amendments to s 13A made by that Act applied in relation to an application made by a person under that section before the date on which the Bill for the earlier Act was introduced into Parliament (8 May 1997) unless the application had been fully dealt with before that date. 
     
      
    29 Quite clearly that meant that, in considering an application by a non-release recommendation prisoner, such person was not eligible for a re-determination unless the Court was satisfied that “special reasons” existed that justified the making of the determination: subs (3A); and the Court was required to have regard to and give substantial weight to any relevant recommendation, etc: subs (10A); It said nothing specifically about the making of an application, but by referring to applications made before the introduction of the earlier Bill, accepted that such applications (or it would seem this application – it was the only one in question) had in fact been made.  
     
      
    30 It follows that as a matter of construction, the clause could not apply to the making of an application, and in particular to when an application could be made. The Transitional Act governed how such pre-1997 applications should be dealt with, but pre-supposed that such applications had been “duly made.” The Act could have provided that such applications should be deemed not to have been made, or that they be rendered null and void, or that any non-release recommendation prisoner irrespective of when his application was made should have to serve 20 years before having his application considered, but it did none of these 
     
      
    31 Whereas under the earlier 1997 Act, the requirement for “special reasons” did not apply to this application lodged prior to the 1997 Act, as a result of the Transitional Act, such “special reasons” needed to be shown when the application was heard, but there is nothing which purports to undo what had already been done and completed, namely the making of the application. 
     
      
    32 Section 13(4) both before and after the 1997 amendments conferred jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to determine a minimum and additional term “on application duly made”. It is conceded, and in my view correctly conceded, on behalf of the Crown that in the case of this Applicant there was an application “duly made” on 28 November 1996, but it is submitted that such application cased to be “duly made” on the enactment of the Transitional Act, because, so the submission goes, Parliament subsequently removed the right to make the application at the time it had been made. I do not doubt that Parliament could take such a course, but as it would relate to pending litigation, I consider it would require clear and express words to do so, and there are no clear and express words to that effect. The term “duly made” referring to the past tense in its natural sense relates to regularity at the time it was made. The application having been “duly made” s 13(4) conferred on the Court jurisdiction to deal with it, albeit subject to the amendments made by the 1997 Act to subs (3A) and (10A). 
     
      
    33 Question 3 should be answered “no” as to the making of the application, but ""yes"" as regards the determination of the application. 
     
      
       
      Question 4 – Prior to the repeal of the Sentencing Act 1989 on 3 April 2000, and assuming the relevant amendments to the Sentencing Act were valid, was the Supreme Court precluded from making a determination pursuant to s 13A(4) in relation to the applicant until he had served 20 years of his life sentence? 
       
      
    34 For the reasons set out in dealing with question 3, this question should be answered “no”. 
     
      
       
      Question 5 – If the answer to question 4 is yes, was the Supreme Court precluded, after 3 April 2000, from making a determination pursuant to clause 4 of Schedule 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in relation to the applicant until he had served 20 years of his life sentence? 
       
      
    35 In view of the answer to question 4, this question strictly does not arise, but it is desirable to say something on it, in case I am in error in my answer to question 4. 
     
      
    36 The Sentencing Act 1989 was repealed by the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Sentencing) Act 1999 No 94 and replaced by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 92 as from 3 April 2000 (the 1999 Act). The former s 13A is now reproduced in Schedule 1 of the later Act. The relevant transitional provisions are contained in Schedule 2 of that Act clause 21(1) and (2). Sub-clause (1) provides that an application under s 13A of the former Act that had been made but not determined before the commencement of the new Act (3 April 2000) is to be determined in accordance with Schedule 1 of the new Act; but sub-clause (2) provides that subcl (1) does not apply to an application referred to in cl 8(1) of Schedule 2A to the 1989 Act i.e. applications made but not fully dealt with before the date on which the Bill for the 1997 Act was introduced into Parliament (8 May 1997).  
     
      
    37 This application duly made in 1996 comes within subcl (b) and is therefore excluded from subcl (a). Accordingly, it is not to be determined in accordance with Schedule 1 of the 1999 Act, but in accordance with s 13A of the 1989 Act, as the repeal of a statute does not affect existing proceedings unless expressly provided: Interpretation Act s 30(1)(e). A similar conclusion was reached by Sully J in R v Veen [2000] NSWSC 656. 
     
      
    38 For the reasons given in relation to question 3, the Court would not be precluded from making a determination under s 13A(4) of the 1989 Act but in making such determination would be required to give effect to the provisions of subss (3A) and (10A) of the section.  
     
      
       
      Question 6 – If the answer to question 5 is yes, and assuming the validity of the relevant amendments, did the replacement of the period of 20 years in clause 2(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 with a period of 30 years, by item [2] of Schedule 1 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Existing Life Sentences) Act 2001 have operation in relation to the applicant? 
       
      
    39 This question also strictly does not arise. If the application is to be determined in accordance with the Sentencing Act 1989, the answer is “no” because there has been no amendment to s 13A(3) increasing from 20 to 30 years the time which a non-release recommendation prisoner must serve before the prisoner can make an application.  
     
      
    40 On the other hand, if the application is to proceed under the 1999 Act, the increase in the period that a non-release recommendation prisoner must serve before making an application would not apply to the applicant for 2 reasons: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the application has already been duly made, see the discussion relating to question 3 above, or 
         
         
        (b) Clause 39(a) of Schedule 2 of the 1999 Act provides that the amendments made by the  
        Crimes Legislation Amendment (Existing Life Sentences) Act  
        do not apply to proceedings where an application has been made but not disposed of before the commencement of that Act.  
        
       
      
    41 On the other hand, if I am in error in my answer to question 3 and the application duly made in 1996 is no longer “duly made” or is a nullity and a fresh application needs to be made under the 1999 Act, the 30 year period would apply.  
     
      
       
      Question 7 – If any or all of the following amendments had operation in relation to the applicant, was that amendment (or each of them) invalid by reason of inconsistency with Chapter III of the Constitution, because - 
       
       
        
        (a) for the purposes of an exercise of judicial power of the Commonwealth under Ch III of the Constitution, both the determination of guilt of a criminal offence and the imposition of a sentence on a particular offender are exclusively exercises of judicial power; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the assertion and exercise by a State Legislature of a power retrospectively to vary the exercise of the sentencing power by a State Supreme Court and by a State Court of Criminal Appeal will tend to impair public confident in that part of the judiciary which is also required to exercise federal judicial power, so as to render such an exercise of State legislative power inconsistent with Ch III of the Constitution; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) that tendency is exacerbated where the interference by the Legislature operates by giving legal effect to an expression of opinion which, at the time of the expression, had no legal consequence or effect; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) a consideration relevant to the evaluative judgment required in determining when a State Legislature has acted so as to impair the authority of a Supreme Court in a manner inconsistent with the status of a Supreme Court for the purposes of Ch III of the Constitution, is the fact that the legislative scheme purports to operate uniformly to the disadvantage of both adult offenders and children, and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) in relation to Schedule 1, item [1] of the Sentencing Amendment (Transitional) Act 1997 the purpose was directed and effect related solely to the punishment of the applicant by variation of the punitive consequences of the sentence imposed by the Supreme Court; 
        
       
       
      the amendments in question being those effected by: 
       
       
        
        (i) items [1] and [2] of Schedule 1 of the Sentencing Legislation Further Amendment Act 1997 as it applied in relation to the applicant; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) item [1] of Schedule 1 of the Sentencing Amendment (Transitional) Act 1997 as it applied in relation to the applicant; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) clause 2(2)(b) of Schedule 1 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as it appears in relation to the applicant; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) item [2] of Schedule 2 of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Existing Life Sentences) Act 2001, as it applies in relation to the applicant, and 
        
       
       
        
        (v) the cumulative effect of any one or more of the foregoing provisions, as they apply or applied in relation to the applicant. 
        
       
      
    42 The submission that the effect of the various amendments is to so impair the functioning of the Supreme Court as a judicial body so as to be inconsistent with its status and functions pursuant to Chapter III of the Commonwealth Constitution is based on the reasoning of the High Court in Kable v The Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1996) 189 CLR 51.  
     
      
    43 A similar challenge was made to the 1997 Act: Baker v The Queen (2004) 210 ALR 1 but that challenge was based on the proposition that the requirement in s 13A for a non-release recommendation applicant to show “special reasons” to justify a determination was devoid of content and therefore illusory. The High Court (Kirby J dissenting) held that the term “special reasons” was not devoid of content and that cases could arise where “special reasons” could be shown. Gleeson CJ at [17] gave as an example of special reasons the case of a juvenile when the non-release recommendation was made, referring specifically, although not by name, to the present applicant. 
     
      
    44 The invalidity of the 1997 Act was also challenged on the basis that it took as the criterion for particular treatment the non-release recommendation made at a time when such recommendations had no binding effect and at the time when only some, but not all, judges were prepared to make them; and it was submitted that such provision was random and arbitrary, but the Court held (at [8], [44], [49]) that Parliament was entitled to choose such criterion as it saw fit, and the selection of such a past criterion did not render the legislation invalid. 
     
      
    45 The applicant in Baker was not concerned with the application of the Transitional Act because he had already served 20 years of his sentence and did not make his application until 1 August 1997, after the passing of both the 1997 Act and the Transitional Act. 
     
      
    46 A point was made that the Transitional Act was passed for the sole purpose of “catching” this applicant who was the only non-release recommendation prisoner who had lodged an application which had not been dealt with prior to the 1997 Act, and it was faintly submitted that this characteristic of the of legislation being directed at a particular person, as was the legislation in Kable, rendered it invalid. But the grounds for the decision in Kable were much more extensive than the fact that it was directed at one person; and in any event, the effect of the Transitional Act if it has the effect contended for by the Crown was not to particularly target the applicant and single him out for special treatment, but to bring him within the general class of all non-release recommendation prisoners so that he was dealt with in the same way as the others.  
     
      
    47 Ultimately, the submissions on this question focussed on the effect of s 154A of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 inserted by the 2001 Act Schedule 2 cl 2 set out earlier in this judgment, which in effect provides that even if a non-release recommendation prisoner successfully “jumps through all the hoops” of s 13A (3)(b), (4) (4A) and (10A) and succeeds in having a non-parole set, he cannot be released on parole until he is in imminent danger of death, irrespective of his conduct and progress at rehabilitation in the meantime. This provision does not apply to other serious offenders including persons sentenced to life under s 19 Crimes Act 1900, since repealed, who have had their sentences re-determined but were not the subject of a non-release recommendation or offenders subsequently sentenced to lengthy determinate terms, whose offences in both cases may be more heinous than those of persons subject to non-release recommendations. This problem is compounded by the fact that the making of non-release recommendations was arbitrary and of no legal effect when made, a course adopted by some judges, but not by others, and in the former case, often made without hearing evidence on sentence or submissions. 
     
      
    48 It was submitted that the enactment of s 154A rendered re-determination of life sentences for non-release recommendation prisoners a farce and that either the whole concept of non-release recommendation prisoners and special considerations for them in s 13A of the 1989 Act and Sch 1 of the 1999 Act were invalid, or alternatively, s 154A is invalid. In the light of Baker, I fail to see how I can find the provisions in the 1997 Act relating to non-release recommendation prisoners invalid, and the validity of s 154A should not be determined until there is someone who is presently, or soon to be, affected by it. That does not include the applicant at this stage. 
     
      
    49 Question 7 should be answered “No”. 
     
      
    50 I have already referred to the fact that when the applicant appealed against his life sentence the Court of Criminal Appeal expressed some misgiving about the making of a never to be released recommendation particularly in the case of a young person such as the present applicant, but noted that there was no statutory basis for making the “recommendation” nor any statutory basis for appealing against it, it being agreed by Counsel that the “recommendation” would have no legal effect if and when an application was made to fix a determinate sentence. 
     
      
    51 At the time, the “recommendation” was not an “order” and consequently not a “sentence” within the meaning of that word as it then stood or now stands in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s 2. It may be arguable that as a result of the amendments effected by the 1997 Act which gave legal effect and authority to such a recommendation, such recommendation became retrospectively an “order” and therefore a “sentence”. If this is so, it may be that, subject to obtaining leave to appeal out of time, an appeal could now be brought against the “recommendation” pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of that Act. 
     
      
    52 This point was not taken at the hearing, I have heard no submissions on it and I express no concluded view in relation to it. 
     
      
    53 The questions in the annexure to the Notice of Motion should be answered as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) (a) and (b) yes 
       
      (2) No 
       
      (3) No as to the making of the application but ""yes"" as regards the determination of the application

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SHELLER JA: The appeal is dismissed with costs. The Court is of the unanimous opinion that the appeal does not raise any question of general principle, pursuant to s.45 subs.4 of the Supreme Court Act 1970. I will ask Justice Hodgson to give the Court’s reasons in short form. 
     
      
    2 HODGSON JA: The primary judge correctly identified the relevant risk of injury as that of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff, and correctly identified the relevant class of persons as those trying to scramble or swing around the end of the fence in the vicinity of the relevant pole: see Phillis v Daly (1998) 15 NSWLR 65 at 67.  
     
      
    3 He correctly regarded that risk as not at all probable. He correctly noted that the pole had stood for eight months. In those circumstances, it was well open to him not to be satisfied that the pole should have been better secured than it was with a wire rope and shackle.  
     
      
    4 In so far as his judgment can be criticised for the assertions that Mr Towson’s opinion as to the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s fall and the movement of the pole was not relevant, that there was no evidence that the pole was loose and that the duty owed by the respondent did not extend to a person such as the plaintiff, these assertions do not vitiate the judgment.  
     
      
    5 As to the first, the primary judge took into account Mr Towson’s evidence as to the mechanics that could possibly explain the movement of the pole, and it is clear that Mr Towson was not in any event able to express any opinion as to what actually caused the pole to fall. 
     
      
    6 As to the second, the only evidence that the pole was in any sense loose was the fact of it falling, and the evidence did not justify a finding that this was due to inadequate securing rather than some other cause such as interference with the wire rope and shackle by some person other than the respondent. 
     
      
    7 As to the third, in its context it should be understood not as altogether denying the existence of any duty whatsoever, but as asserting that the respondent’s duty did not extend beyond what the respondent had actually done.  
     
      
    8 SHELLER JA: Accordingly, as I have said the appeal is dismissed with costs.

      70776/03 REGINA v ABDUL RAZZAK HAMOUI 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT [No 4] - REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On the afternoon of Monday 25 June 2001 Julie Haklane spoke to her mother by telephone, telling her that she would see her after work. At 4.10 pm she telephoned her boyfriend, Raymond Bayeh. She told him that she had just finished work. She rang again at 5.03 pm. She told Mr Bayeh that she was on the Windsor Road, ten minutes from her home in Merrylands. She invited him to telephone her at home in 15 minutes time, so that they could make arrangements for the evening. 
     
      
    2 That was the last known communication with Julie Haklane. She failed to arrive home at 5.30 pm. She did not thereafter answer her phone. By 5.40 pm her phone messages went through to voicemail. 
     
      
    3 The parents of Ms Haklane were naturally concerned. They were the more concerned because their daughter was a diabetic. She required insulin. She would ordinarily have an insulin injection each afternoon. The parents therefore went to the police. They related to the police their phone conversations with their daughter that afternoon. They also told the police of a tempestuous and long-standing relationship between their daughter and Abdul Razzak Hamoui. 
     
      
    4 That evening the parents and friends of Julie Haklane went to the home of Mr Hamoui in Guildford. However, he was not at home. He arrived home at approximately 11.00 pm that evening or shortly after. Members of the family sought to confront him with their suspicions. Mr Hamoui refused to speak to them. Indeed, he summoned the police. The police came shortly after midnight on Tuesday 26 June 2001. Mr Hamoui told the police that he had not seen Julie Haklane. He knew nothing of her whereabouts. He complained of the harassment of the Haklane family. He said that he feared to go outside his home. 
     
      
    5 On Thursday 28 June 2001, the body of Julie Haklane was found in her car in Eton Street, Fairfield. The car was parked by the side of the road. Julie Haklane was seated in the passenger seat. She had been strangled. There was evidence from residents that the vehicle had been left in Eton Street on the Monday evening. 
     
      
    6 After a lengthy and persistent investigation, Abdul Razzak Hamoui was arrested on 3 November 2001. He was charged with the murder of Julie Haklane. He pleaded not guilty to that charge. On 17 December 2004, after a lengthy trial, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. It remains for me to pass sentence. To do so, I must first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion in a manner consistent with the jury's verdict. Where the facts are adverse, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Hamoui, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
       
      Background. 
       
      
    7 Mr Hamoui was born in Lebanon on 20 April 1974. He came from a Muslim family. His mother and father separated and divorced soon after his birth. In accordance with local custom, he was given into the custody of his father. His father later remarried. The family then emigrated to Australia in approximately 1985. At that time, Mr Hamoui was about 11 years old. 
     
      
    8 In 1996, or thereabouts, Mr Hamoui met Julie Haklane. He was then aged 22 years. She was 19 years old. She came from a Lebanese Christian family. At first they got on well. Ms Haklane said ""he treated me like a princess"". However, that was to change. Ms Haklane fell pregnant. Her mother, but not her father, became aware of the pregnancy and the subsequent termination. No doubt the family also learned something of Mr Hamoui's background. In 1993, before meeting their daughter, he had committed a number of serious criminal offences for which he had served various gaol sentences. The Haklane family plainly disapproved of Julie's relationship with Mr Hamoui. They sought to bring it to an end by taking her to Lebanon for an extended period. 
     
      
    9 Upon returning to Australia, however, Julie Haklane re-established contact with Mr Hamoui. They resumed their relationship. Again she became pregnant. Again the pregnancy was terminated. Indeed, Ms Haklane became pregnant a number of times, terminating the pregnancy each time. She chose not to disclose these matters, or the detail of her relationship with Mr Hamoui, to her family. 
     
      
    10 By 1999, the relationship between Julie Haklane and Mr Hamoui had changed. Mr Hamoui was a competitive kick boxer. On 3 July 1999, Ms Haklane went to the police. She complained that Mr Hamoui had kicked her in the thigh. She had severe bruising to her right thigh. However, she did not wish to press charges. She simply wanted the police to speak to Mr Hamoui, which they did. 
     
      
    11 By the end of 2000, Julie Haklane had broken off her relationship with Mr Hamoui a number of times. She had formed new relationships with other men, which were usually short lived. She even began working as a prostitute or sex worker at various massage parlours in the western suburbs. However, at the same time she continued an intimate relationship with Mr Hamoui. 
     
      
    12 In November 2000, Julie Haklane met Mr Allen Yousif. Mr Yousif met with the approval of her family. However, at the same time as she was seeing Mr Yousif, Julie Haklane was speaking to Mr Hamoui and occasionally seeing him. Mr Hamoui, meanwhile, became increasingly disturbed about her new relationship. 
     
      
    13 On 4 January 2001, Ms Haklane and Mr Hamoui had an argument. Fearing violence, Ms Haklane phoned her mother, so that she would hear their conversation. Her mother then asked her father to go to Mr Hamoui's home in order to sort the matter out. He did so. By the time he got there Julie Haklane had left. There was, nonetheless, a confrontation between Julie Haklane's father and Mr Hamoui, where it was said that threats were made. Mr Hamoui's father was also present. 
     
      
    14 Soon after that confrontation, Mr Hamoui complained to the police that someone had shot at his car. He showed the police the bullet hole through the windscreen of the car. He told the police of a further incident when he was in his car outside Julie Haklane's home. He said that he was threatened by Mr Allen Yousif, who placed a gun in his mouth and warned him to have nothing further to do with Julie Haklane. Mr Yousif denied that allegation. 
     
      
    15 As a consequence of these events, Mr Hamoui, on his own account, became increasingly disturbed. On Monday 21 January 2001, five months before Julie Haklane's death, Ms Haklane went to the police in the early hours of that morning. She made a complaint against Mr Hamoui. She alleged that he had abducted her at gunpoint as she was driving her car. In the course of the abduction, he had threatened to shoot her and to shoot himself. A detailed statement was taken from her by the police, which she signed. 
     
      
    16 The police then obtained a warrant to search the home of Mr Hamoui. A gun was found conforming to the description provided by Ms Haklane. Mr Hamoui was charged, both with the abduction and with the possession of an unauthorised firearm. 
     
      
    17 However, four days later, Ms Haklane again went to the police. She said she wished to alter her statement. She insisted that Mr Hamoui had not threatened her. Rather, he had threatened to kill himself, such was his despair at their separation. She claimed that she had gone to the police to obtain help for him, not intending that he be charged. 
     
      
    18 The charge of abduction was later withdrawn and dismissed. The charge of being in possession of an unauthorised firearm remained. Mr Hamoui was given bail in respect of that charge. 
     
      
    19 By the end of February 2001, the relationship between Julie Haklane and Mr Allen Yousif had come to an end. Ms Haklane and Mr Hamoui resumed their relationship more or less, although in secret. 
     
      
    20 However, in May 2001, Ms Haklane met another man, Mr Raymond Bayeh, at a family wedding. Mr Bayeh came from a Christian family well known to her family. She began seeing Mr Bayeh, encouraged by her family. Soon they formed a relationship which was intimate. At the same time, however, Ms Haklane continued to communicate with and occasionally see Mr Hamoui. Her relationship with Mr Hamoui remained intimate. 
     
      
    21 Mr Hamoui was, understandably, not happy about Julie Haklane's new relationship. He confronted her on 9 June 2001, two weeks before her death. The following day Ms Haklane attended the local police station with a friend. She alleged that she had been assaulted by Mr Hamoui and her phone stolen. Although Mr Hamoui denied these allegations, I have no doubt that he did assault Ms Haklane. Ms Haklane made it clear, however, that she did not wish to press charges. She simply asked the police to retrieve her telephone. 
     
      
    22 Notwithstanding the assault, Julie Haklane again began communicating with Mr Hamoui within a matter of days. She continued to see him. At the same time she continued to see Mr Bayeh. On Saturday 23 June 2001, Mr Hamoui followed Ms Haklane's car. She had told him that she would be babysitting. He plainly doubted her assurance, believing that she would be seeing the other man. A confrontation took place involving Ms Haklane's sister, Naha Erdem. Ms Haklane's continuing relationship with Mr Hamoui was clearly a source of frustration and irritation to the family who wanted her to have nothing to do with him. An argument ensued between Julie Haklane and her sister. 
     
      
    23 After the argument, and notwithstanding the pressure of the family, Julie Haklane again communicated with Mr Hamoui. She made arrangements to see him for lunch on Monday 25 June 2001, the day that she disappeared. 
     
      
       
      The Incident. 
       
      
    24 Ms Haklane began a new job on Monday 25 June 2001. The demands of that job meant that she was not able to keep her luncheon arrangement with Mr Hamoui. She nonetheless continued to communicate with him throughout the day by text messages, or by speaking to him on the phone. Ms Haklane also saw and spoke to her new boyfriend, Mr Bayeh, and made arrangements with him. 
     
      
    25 At 4.27 pm on Monday 25 June 2001, Ms Haklane spoke for a minute with Mr Hamoui. Immediately after that conversation Mr Hamoui began to walk from his home in Guildford to the Merrylands Police Station, where he was required to report in answer to his bail. He signed the bail form at 5.10 pm. 
     
      
    26 At about the same time, Julie Haklane also left her place of employment at Seven Hills, driving towards Merrylands. During her journey she repeatedly tried to speak to Mr Hamoui on her mobile phone. Mr Hamoui, however, did not have his mobile phone with him. Her calls went through to voicemail, as did her text messages to him. Her last message at 4.43 pm was, ""Where r u?"". 
     
      
    27 The jury obviously inferred that Julie Haklane met Mr Hamoui at or about the time he reported to the police station, that is, 5.10 pm. It was unsurprising that they should have done so. They had, as mentioned, spoken to each other at 4.27 pm, before they each set out for Merrylands. Ms Haklane's persistent messages to Mr Hamoui after 4.50 pm make it plain that she was trying to meet up with him. Her last call (made to her new boyfriend) at 5.03 pm was received by equipment within the Holroyd District, which is immediately adjacent to the Merrylands Police Station. Moreover, Ms Haklane had, in the weeks preceding 25 June, often dropped Mr Hamoui at the police station in order that he could report for bail. 
     
      
    28 As mentioned, at 5.40 pm on Monday 25 June, all calls to Ms Haklane's mobile phone were diverted to voicemail. I infer that, between approximately 5.10 pm and 5.40 pm, Mr Hamoui met Ms Haklane and that she was thereafter within his power. When her body was found three days later, it was apparent that she had been strangled. There was significant bruising to her neck. A ligature had not been used.  
     
      
    29 The pathologist who performed the autopsy, Dr Little, observed a number of bruises and abrasions to Ms Haklane's wrists. They were roughly parallel. Dr Little also found a sticky substance on her wrists. The same sticky substance was found on her abdomen near her belly button. Within the car there was black sticky tape. Dr Little thought that the pattern of bruising and the sticky substance were consistent with Ms Haklane's hands having been bound, either in front or behind. Both the Crown and Counsel for Mr Hamoui, when addressing the jury, approached the matter upon that basis. Obviously, if she were bound, it was before she was strangled. There would be no point in binding her wrists after she had been strangled. 
     
      
    30 Mr Hamoui did not give evidence during the trial. Nor did he give evidence on sentence. He was, however, interviewed by the police on a number of occasions before his arrest. On each occasion he said that he was innocent. He had not strangled Julie Haklane. He knew nothing of her fate. When asked to account for his movements between 5.10 pm on the afternoon of Monday 25 June 2001 and approximately 11.00 pm when he said he got home, Mr Hamoui said that he went to the Merrylands Oval. The Merrylands Oval is a sports complex a short distance from the police station. He said that he sat in the park for perhaps four or five hours contemplating his life. He then walked home. 
     
      
    31 The Crown suggested, and the jury obviously accepted, that Mr Hamoui's account was a lie told with a consciousness of guilt. It was mid winter. It would certainly be odd to sit in a park at that time for four or five hours. Moreover, Mr Hamoui, in his answers to the police, stated and restated that he had only seen one or two people in the park, walking their dogs. He said the park was illuminated only by lights on the footpath. In fact, on the evening of Monday 25 June 2001, the park was crowded. It was used by a number of football and soccer teams who trained under floodlights. 
     
      
    32 The charge Mr Hamoui faced was murder. In order to be convicted of murder, the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had eliminated provocation. Here, the jury, by its verdict, was not so satisfied. It is not possible to say which particular aspect of provocation the Crown had not eliminated beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    33 The Crown has invited me to find that, because Mr Hamoui knew about Julie Haklane's new boyfriend and because she was bound before she was strangled, the claim for provocation is ""diminished"". Mr Ierace SC, for Mr Hamoui, submitted that such a submission inevitably involved speculation about matters which were essentially unknowable on the evidence. 
     
      
    34 Inevitably, a detailed reconstruction of what probably happened does involve speculation. Nonetheless, a number of observations can be made. First, it is plain that at some point before her death Ms Haklane was bound and helpless. I infer that she was already in a weakened state, having not had insulin, and that this was something well known to Mr Hamoui. Secondly, Mr Hamoui was both jealous and volatile. I infer that, whilst Ms Haklane was helpless, he strangled her, probably as a result of loss of self control. Thirdly, in the nature of things, manual strangulation involves the application of force to the victim's throat for a significant period. I would infer an intention to kill. Fourthly, I am urged by the Crown to find that binding Ms Haklane in the manner described amounted to gratuitous cruelty. I believe it appropriate to so characterise Mr Hamoui's actions. One can only imagine the terror felt by Ms Haklane as these events unfolded. Finally, it is said on behalf of Mr Hamoui, that Ms Haklane suffered from a heart defect which severely occluded one of her arteries, such that death was likely to have been more rapid than it might otherwise have been. Whilst that may be so, strangulation, as a means of death, is inevitably much slower than other forms of killing. There can be no doubt that the victim suffered, whatever the state of her arteries. 
     
      
    35 Let me move from the crime committed by Mr Hamoui to his subjective circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances of Mr Hamoui. 
       
      
    36 Mr Hamoui was 27 years old when this crime was committed. He is now almost 31 years. 
     
      
    37 His early years were troubled. As mentioned, his mother and father separated and divorced when he was a few weeks old. He was brought up by his stepmother. He was abused, both emotionally and physically by her. He believed, until about the time of his arrival in Australia, that his stepmother was, in fact, his mother. 
     
      
    38 Once in Australia, Mr Hamoui attended local schools. He described himself as an average student. He obtained the School Certificate. Having left school, he worked for a fencing contractor for about a year. Thereafter, he worked occasionally. Part of his difficulty, in terms of employment, was an association with ""drugs"" and what he described to psychologists as ""a bad crowd"". He experimented with various drugs, although he said he did not become addicted to any of them. 
     
      
    39 In March 1993, having been convicted of malicious damage, he was placed upon a recognizance to be of good behaviour for two years. In December 1993, during the currency of that bond, Mr Hamoui was convicted of armed robbery. He was sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment with a minimum term of 18 months. Having been released to parole on 30 November 1994, Mr Hamoui's response to supervision by the Parole Service was poor. He committed further offences. On 28 August 1995, he was sentenced to periodic detention for five months in respect of the charge of assault and three months in respect of violent disorder. He was, at the same time, placed upon a one year bond for carrying a cutting weapon. 
     
      
    40 On 9 October 1995, Mr Hamoui was again brought before the Parramatta Local Court. He was charged with malicious damage. He was sentenced to two months imprisonment. The orders for periodic detention were converted to orders for full time imprisonment. On 12 October 1995, the Offenders' Review Board revoked his parole, backdating the revocation to 8 May 1995. 
     
      
    41 Mr Hamoui was then released on 1 May 1996. According to the Parole Service his compliance with supervision on this occasion improved. However, he was convicted of a series of driving offences (driving whilst disqualified and driving an uninsured vehicle) which were dealt with and which have no particular relevance to the present matter. 
     
      
    42 On 26 July 2001, Mr Hamoui was sentenced to three months imprisonment for the unauthorised possession of a firearm. This was the charge brought by the police after they searched Mr Hamoui's home, following the complaint of abduction by Julie Haklane on 24 January 2001. It will be remembered that, at the time he strangled Julie Haklane, Mr Hamoui was on bail for the firearms offence. That is a circumstance of aggravation. 
     
      
    43 Although Mr Hamoui's record included serious offences involving violence, that record was not, in terms of s21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, an aggravating factor (cf Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465). Nonetheless, Mr Hamoui, by reason of his record, cannot expect the leniency which may otherwise be extended if there were no such record. 
     
      
       
      Prospects of Rehabilitation. 
       
      
    44 Mr Hamoui has been in custody since his arrest on 3 November 2001. It is clear that he has used his time well. He has worked whilst in gaol. He has learned to cook and is known within the gaol as ""the Chef"". 
     
      
    45 He came to the notice of the Staff Officer of the MRRC at Silverwater, Mr Ian Gregory, some two years ago as the delegate representing Lebanese prisoners. Mr Hamoui has returned to his Muslim faith, making an informal study of aspects of that religion. He is looked upon by others within the gaol as a religious leader. He has, on occasions, led other Muslim inmates in prayer. He is highly regarded by Mr Gregory and prison staff. He is well mannered and well behaved. Unlike many other inmates, he is always neat in appearance and his cell always tidy. However, Mr Hamoui lost the position of Delegate through a breach of prison discipline which involved the unauthorised possession of a mobile phone. 
     
      
    46 Mr Hamoui said to the psychologist who interviewed him that he now condemns his own promiscuous sexual behaviour during the time of his relationship with Julie Haklane, and his drug taking and alcohol consumption. 
     
      
    47 Since March 2004 Mr Hamoui has formed a relationship with another woman. She is aged 22 years. She is the sister of another inmate. She visits Mr Hamoui regularly and speaks to him almost every day on the telephone. She has introduced her parents to him. She is engaged to him. She has provided him with religious books and describes Mr Hamoui as being ""at peace"". 
     
      
    48 Counsel for Mr Hamoui, upon the basis of this material, has urged a finding that Mr Hamoui's prospects of rehabilitation are good. Mr Hamoui has affirmed to the psychologists that, upon his release, he intends to find work, possibly connected with his renewed Muslim faith.  
     
      
    49 I do not doubt that, insofar as Mr Hamoui has embraced the Muslim faith, and especially the morality which underpins that faith, that this is a positive development. His commitment to that faith, and that morality, must be examined however in the context of other matters which bear upon his prospects of rehabilitation. First, Mr Hamoui maintains his innocence in the face of what must be regarded as a strong Crown case. There is no acknowledgement of responsibility. There is no contrition. 
     
      
    50 Secondly, it is plain that Mr Hamoui has a history which includes serious criminal offences, many involving violence.  
     
      
    51 Thirdly, on any view, Mr Hamoui's behaviour in the weeks and months before Julie Haklane's death can only be described as ""disturbed"". On his own account, he was contemplating ending his own life in January 2001 by shooting himself. Since that time he has been taking antidepressant medication prescribed by his doctors. 
     
      
    52 Fourthly, a psychologist, Ms Robilliard, carried out a number of tests. She made findings which suggest caution in predicting Mr Hamoui's future. She said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Razzak's performance on the personality test administered evidenced a markedly paranoid disposition. Depression and anxiety also features and elements of passive/aggressive behaviour. From the information he gave it appeared Razzak has had problems with depression over the past several years as in the months leading up to the offence he reports being on antidepressant medication which has been continued in custody. As noted in the introduction to this report, at our meeting he did not appear to be mood disordered and his emotional expressions were appropriate to themes of our discussion."" 
        
       
      
    53 Weighing these matters, one cannot say that the prospects of rehabilitation are good. At this point there are both positive and negative features. Whilst there are reasons for hope, one must be guarded about the future. 
     
      
    54 I have not been urged to find special circumstances. I see no particular basis for such a finding. The sentence I have in mind will provide for adequate supervision, after a small adjustment to the statutory ratio. Such sentence should date from 3 November 2001, when Mr Hamoui entered custody. 
     
      
    55 Manslaughter involves the taking of another life. It is obviously a most serious crime. The life taken was that of a young woman, 24 years old. She was much loved. She had an extraordinary vitality and energy. Her loss, and the horror concerning the circumstances of her loss, has devastated her family. Her brother read to the court a Victims' Impact Statement which documented the profound effect of Julie Haklane's death upon members of her family. The statement described with great poignancy the torment and anguish of each member of the family and especially her parents, who continue to suffer and will suffer for the rest of their days. I must, of course, deal with such material in a manner consistent with The Queen v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85. 
     
      
    56 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. The circumstances in which manslaughter may be committed, however, vary enormously. The sentencing range is correspondingly large. I have examined the sentences imposed in a variety of cases for the insight they collectively provide into the sentencing range (cf Sentencing Homicides in New South Wales 1994-2001, p24ff and Table 9 p31). I am conscious of the fact that the sentence I believe appropriate is at the upper end of the range. However this was, in my view, a cruel, brutal and awful crime. 
     
      
    57 Abdul Razzak Hamoui, I sentence you to imprisonment for 11 years commencing on 3 November 2001 and expiring on 2 November 2012, with a non parole period of 8 years. You will be eligible for release to parole on 2 November 2009.

     REGINA v SARAH MILLERAT 
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an appeal by the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth asserting that sentence imposed by Dodd DCJ on the respondent at Sydney District Court was inadequate, and seeking increase thereof.  
     
      
    2 The respondent is a French citizen, born 21 January 1979. She entered Australia at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on Sunday 13 June 2004, arriving aboard an Austrian Airlines flight which had originated in Vienna. She was travelling on her own French passport. In accordance with routine, she completed an incoming passenger card which included her denial that she was bringing illicit drugs into Australia. At a customs barrier point her baggage was selected for examination.  
     
      
    3 Part of the examination included an ion scan swab being run over her suitcase and this produced a positive result for the prohibited drug cocaine. The respondent initially told customs officers that there was nothing in her suitcase but when the question was repeated she said “cocaine”.  
     
      
    4 The respondent’s suitcase was deconstructed by Federal police. Cocaine was not found but three packages were discovered secreted in the lining of the suitcase. The content of these packages consisted of approximately 28,750 tablets weighing 4,786.8 grams. Testing established that these tablets were methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and laboratory analysis established the nett weight of pure MDMA as 2,025.9 grams.  
     
      
    5 The respondent was charged with a single count of importing a commercial quantity of prohibited drug (MDMA) contrary to s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901. Such an offence carries a prescribed maximum penalty of life imprisonment, together with a fine. Upon being supplied with the appropriate prosecution brief the respondent pleaded guilty and adhered to that plea. She was before the District Court for the purpose of sentence and her arraignment upon indictment was a procedural step and did not operate to devalue her early plea of guilty before the magistrate. 
     
      
    6 The respondent had no prior convictions. His Honour imposed a sentence of five years six months imprisonment with a non parole period of two years nine months. 
     
      
    7 The respondent participated in an interview with police on the day of her arrest. At the time she told police how she came to journey to Australia in possession of illicit drugs and of instructions given to her to proceed to a particular hotel at Parramatta and telephone a number with which she had been supplied. Her description of events was substantially included in a statement of facts prepared for the purpose of sentencing proceedings. The respondent gave evidence, as did her father and mother, who travelled from France in order so to do. His Honour also received into evidence a letter addressed to him from the respondent, which she had written whilst in custody.  
     
      
    8 The respondent’s father is French by nationality and her mother was described as Yugoslav. When the respondent was aged about three years her parents divorced and she remained with her mother who subsequently entered into a long term relationship with a man whom the respondent regarded as her stepfather. He had died in early 2004. The respondent was raised in France but frequently spent extended periods of school vacation and the like in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, where she had relatives on her mother’s side of the family. Whilst in Yugoslavia on one of these occasions she was subjected to sexual abuse by a male member of that family. In the course of time the respondent developed a closer relationship with her father and was employed in his business in Paris for several years. She obtained some qualifications in business administration but at the time of her journey to Australia she was unemployed. 
     
      
    9 For an extended period of years she was an abuser of drugs and alcohol. Arrangements have been made for her entry into a rehabilitation program commencing in June 2004. As at that time she had been in a relationship with a boyfriend who was not a drug user and who was, and remains, supportive of her. Her father gave evidence of his good opinion of this young man.  
     
      
    10 However, to paraphrase what the respondent has said from time to time, she determined to go to Amsterdam for “one last fling”, as it were, before commencing rehabilitation. Having spent her money on drugs and alcohol she found herself without the means to return to accommodation which she had in that city. She was approached by a man by the name of Jeff. Jeff enquired as to whether she wished to earn 2000 euros by going to London for one day. She indicated her assent. However on the following day Jeff introduced her to another male called Moxol. The latter told her that he had a bigger job and if she went to Australia she would be paid 4,050 euros. She was told that she would be carrying cocaine. Upon her agreement, Moxol put her up in a hotel in Amsterdam for two days and brought to her an empty suitcase into which she packed her clothes. Jeff and Moxol took her passport and later returned it with air tickets and visa. They gave her instructions as to what to do when she arrived in Sydney. She was told that the person who collected the suitcase would pay her the agreed fee. These men gave her some pocket money and she set off on her journey. She was driven by the recruiters from Amsterdam to Brussels. She flew from Brussels to catch the flight from Vienna. That aircraft stopped in Kuala Lumpur on the way to Sydney. There was no evidence that she was supervised by anyone connected with the importation during her journeys nor did she indicate that she believed she was subject to any. Obviously, she did not take the opportunity to terminate the arrangement by leaving at one of the stopping points. 
     
      
    11 There was evidence, which his Honour accepted that the respondent was being pursued by lawyers acting for debt collectors in France. Her total indebtedness was in the order of 7,000 euros, and she had accrued the debt in significant part by expenditure on drugs and alcohol. 
     
      
    12 Whilst it is true that on the representation of those who recruited her she believed that she was carrying cocaine, and his Honour accepted that she did not know what quantity of illicit drug she was carrying, these were not matters of particular relevance in the circumstances, having regard to her recklessness, her knowledge that she was carrying drugs of some sort, and her own statement during interview that she had told her recruiters that she would “take the risk”. She was neither naïve nor uneducated, however, her role was specifically that of a courier. 
     
      
    13 The ground of appeal relied upon is that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. In support thereof challenge was made to three findings by his Honour: 
     
      
       
      (a) That the respondent suffered from severe depression; 
       
      (b) That there was a reduced importance of general deterrence in such circumstances, and that the head sentence be reduced as a result, and 
       
      (c) That the respondent’s cooperation with police warranted further discount. 
       
      
    14 His Honour made reference to the need for general deterrence as a factor looming large for such an offence, but indicated that he was of a view that in the particular case the starting point for a head sentence should be lower. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, and it seems to me in the view of the courts generally, the weight to be accorded to deterrence factors is less in a case where the crime is being committed by a person suffering from a mental illness or from a psychological disability. In fact, it is a well known principle. In this case it is clear to me that you are suffering from severe depression and anxiety, as well as your drug addiction, and that those factors led to your vulnerability to the overtures to engage in the commission of the drug importation offence. If it were only your drug addiction and drug taking and your alcohol bingeing which had created that situation, then I would not be disposed to reduce the starting point for the head sentence for the commission of this offence. However, as I have said, that is not the only factor contributing to your vulnerability. Your general psychological condition, and it was a severe condition obviously from the necessity for treatment and for medication on an ongoing basis, in my view was a significant contributing factor to the commission of this offence. In those circumstances it seems to me that it is appropriate to deal with you differently from the general run of cases of drug importation and as I have said, to reduce the starting point or to take a different starting point for the head sentence.” 
        
       
      
    15 The appellant contends that his Honour’s conclusion that the respondent was suffering from severe depression and anxiety was not warranted on the evidence. Reference is made to the report of the psychologist Ms Kennedy, and it is contended that she did no more than report on what the respondent had told her. It cannot be gainsaid that that is a fair general description of Ms Kennedy’s report. However, the report seems to be premised upon an assumption that the psychologist is supportive of that history and there is some indication of expression of opinion in that part of the report where she stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Her family history renders her susceptible to health difficulties, and given the number of stressors she has encountered, reactive depression may be expected. Sarah’s only treatment for her mental health difficulties began shortly before she came to Australia when she was placed on medication, and this has been continued.” 
        
       
      
    16 Counsel for the respondent has pointed to the express submission that the sentencing judge could readily conclude that matters in the respondent’s history are matters which “led to a real and true psychological illness and that being an illness of depression and anxiety”, and that no contradictory submission was advanced by the appellant at first instance. It is also observed that the respondent was not cross examined about her claim to have been treated for depression, prescribed medication or that her history was in any relevant way inaccurate. 
     
      
    17 I am unpersuaded that it has been shown that his Honour’s finding was not open to him. 
     
      
    18 In another submission by the Crown (which I take to be an alternative by reason of its inconsistency with the submission just mentioned) it was argued that there was no basis for finding a causal relationship between “the mental disorder of the respondent and the offence”. Once it is accepted that it was open to his Honour to find that the respondent was suffering from severe depression and anxiety, then it becomes a matter for judgment whether those factors are to be weighed in terms of causality. It has long been recognized that causation is a difficult legal concept, but it is capable of being found by the application of common sense and experience and I see no error in his Honour’s determination that those existent factors led to vulnerability and hence acceptance of the overtures to engage in the commission of the offence.  
     
      
    19 The mere existence of a causal link does not inevitably lead to marked reduction in sentence. It is necessary to make an assessment of the “mental disorder” (whatever diagnostic label may be applicable) in order to determine what effect, if any, it should have upon sentence to be imposed. Whilst the evidence spoke of depression, it could not be insignificant that the scheduled rehabilitation treatment was for drug addiction not mental illness. It can be mentioned that the respondent’s excursion to Australia made fulfilment of arrangements to enter rehabilitation unlikely. 
     
      
    20 The other specific matter relied upon by the appellant challenged what his Honour described as “cooperation with police”. It is not suggested that the respondent had any further information to give but the criticism is focussed upon telling police that she did not wish to assist by going to the hotel and, presumably, pretending to continue with the crime. It is fairly conceded by counsel for the appellant that the discount allowed is not of great moment, and it is submitted that with other matters complained of it contributes to the manifest inadequacy of sentence. 
     
      
    21 The demonstration of manifest inadequacy is sought to be supported by the production of a schedule of cases involving MDMA and other amphetamine based narcotics in this Court. Approximately sixty cases are epitomized. Whilst I am conscious of the convenience which must attach to producing such schedules at the touch of a word processing button, I express the view that it would be more helpful if counsel, seeking to rely upon referenced cases, were to extract therefrom those in particular from which it is said that a useful guide might be derived.  
     
      
    22 The documentation includes cases involving persons whose activity was higher up the scale of responsibility than acting as a courier. There is also contrast to be drawn, of course, concerning the amount of pure drug involved.  
     
      
    23 It is useful, however, to scan some of the cases whilst bearing in mind that the respondent’s sentence was five years six months with a non parole period of two years nine months and that her involvement was not alleged to range beyond being a paid courier.  
     
      
    24 In making comparisons and contrasts, it should not be overlooked that most cases were determined before the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914. 
     
      
    25 In R v Benais [1999] NSWCCA 236 the offender brought drugs (MDMA) from Holland to Sydney and was to be paid $7,000 upon delivery. Coincidentally this amount is very close to 4,050 euros at current exchange rates. The sentence in this case was six years imprisonment with three years non parole period. The amount of drug was .061 kgs contrasted with the 2.025 kgs imported by the respondent. 
     
      
    26 In R v Spillane [1999] NSWCCA 280 the offender arrived at Sydney Airport from Singapore with narcotics concealed in luggage. He had a criminal record for dishonesty but no prior drug convictions. He was sentenced to six years imprisonment with a non parole period of three and half years. The quantity was .447 kgs. The prescribed commercial quantity is .5 kgs. 
     
      
    27 In R v Bowers 1997 97 A Crim R 461 the offender arrived at Sydney Airport on a flight from London with narcotics (0.719 grams of MDMA) attached to his body. He was sentenced to eight and half years imprisonment with a non parole period of four and half years.  
     
      
    28 In R v Simon [2003] NSWCCA 147 the offender arrived from Europe with .921 grams of MDMA concealed in body packs. She was a courier to be paid $5,000 on delivery. She was sentenced to four and half years imprisonment with two and half years non parole period.  
     
      
    29 Whilst it is clear from the sampling which has been offered that the sentence imposed upon the respondent was extremely lenient it also shows that in a very like case of Simon, a sentence less than that imposed upon the respondent eventuated.  
     
      
    30 The difficulty facing the respondent is that the quantity of pure drug involved in the present case is more than twice that involved in the case of Simon, which appears to be the lowest sentence in the range of those to which attention has been drawn. Quantity is not an exclusive factor delineating some scale of punishments but it is an important factor in any overall assessment of the seriousness of offence. 
     
      
    31 Counsel for the respondent also drew attention to cases, in particular R v Schofield [2003] NSWCCA 3 where, on Crown appeal, by majority a sentence of five years imprisonment with a non parole period of three years was imposed in lieu of a first instance sentence of two years and four months with a non parole period of eighteen months. The case is not parallel to the present, the principal charges being two charges of attempting to possess a prohibited import (MDMA) with two further offences also taken into account on a schedule. The dissenting judge (Hulme J) would have imposed seven years imprisonment with four and half years non parole period. His judgment has attached to it a lengthy schedule of cases which it is not necessary to recite, but observation of which can be noted as well as the need for a large number of them to be considered in the light of the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914. 
     
      
    32 We have also been referred to R v Klein 2001 121 A Crim R 90 where a Crown appeal was dismissed against a sentence of three years and nine months with a non parole period of two years and six months for importing cocaine which was in the offender’s shoes and taped about her body. However the quantity was less than the commercial quantity and sentence was assessed against a maximum of 25 years’ imprisonment and fine. A substantial discount of sentence was given for the offer of assistance held to be genuine. Wood CJ at CL, in dissent, considered the sentence manifestly inadequate but joined in the dismissal of the appeal in the exercise of the discretion attaching to a Crown appeal. 
     
      
    33 Whilst cases and statistics must be approached with caution, it is useful to observe that collated Judicial Commission statistics since the repeal of s 16G show that in twenty five cases of importing a commercial quantity of MDMA the lowest head sentence was five years imprisonment (two cases), the next lowest was six years (one case), the next seven years (three cases), and all of the balance received longer terms. Similarly, the statistics of non parole periods showed the lowest at three years (two cases), the next four years (three cases) and the balance upwards of those periods. The statistics provide no details of the ranges of facts which might affect assessment, such as cooperation with authority and quantity of import. As to the latter, the statistics would be likely to include cases where the quantity was anything over 500 grams (the minimum commercial quantity) in contrast with the respondent’s import of an amount in excess of four times the minimum commercial quantity. 
     
      
    34 A table of cases where pleas of guilty had been entered contained only five instances. The range of head sentence was five years imprisonment (one case), seven years (one case), eight years (one case) and twelve years (two cases). The non parole periods were three years (one case), four and half years (one case), five years (one case), and seven years (two cases).  
     
      
    35 It can thus be observed that a comparison of the respondent’s sentence with the larger collation of all offenders places her head sentence as less than all but two offenders and her non parole period as less than any other offender. In the small collation, comparison shows that her head sentence is less than all but one other offender and, again, her non parole period less than any other. 
     
      
    36 There is a recognized difficulty in applying these statistics in the absence of any detail of the particular offences and offenders beyond the presence of the essential ingredients of offence. It is, however, difficult to postulate that the respondent, particularly having regard to the quantity of prohibited drug involved, should find a reflection of her culpability among those whose sentences reflect the lowest level of appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    37 I turn to examine the basis upon which Dodd DCJ came to his assessment of five and half years imprisonment with two years nine months non parole period. His express starting point was imprisonment for eight years which he reduced to six years to reflect the early plea of guilty. He reduced this by a further six months on account of cooperation with police in providing details of her instructions as to contact when she arrived in Australia. He set the non parole period at about two thirds of the head sentence which he further reduced to take into account “circumstances analogous to special circumstances” as provided by New South Wales Sentencing Procedures. 
     
      
    38 The starting point of eight years as revealed by his Honour’s remarks on sentence was selected to reflect a finding that the respondent’s depression and anxiety should lead to a reduction in “the weight to be accorded to deterrence factors”. He added, however: 
     
      
       
        
        “If it were only your drug addiction and drug taking and your alcohol bingeing which had created that situation, then I would not be disposed to reduce the starting point for the head sentence for the commission of this offence”. 
        
       
      
    39 His Honour did not specify what this unreduced starting point was. Counsel for the Crown submitted that appropriately such a point lay in the range of twelve to sixteen years imprisonment. That would broadly accord with an overall analysis of sentencing patterns. 
     
      
    40 I would uphold the Crown submission that the selection of a starting point of eight years imprisonment must reflect such an overestimate of an appropriate reduction proportionate to the respondent’s depression and anxiety and that the consequent sentence became manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    41 This Court should set aside the manifestly inadequate sentence and proceed to resentence. For that purpose I would take into account also the recent certificate of Dr Maj-Pelissier dated 23 March 2005 and the affidavits of the respondent and her father who, we were made aware, had returned to Australia for the hearing of the appeal. It is clear that the respondent has family support of which she can avail herself when released. 
     
      
    42 Allowing for the restraint which is recognized to be appropriate when resentencing after successful Crown appeal and allowing for factors favourable to the respondent with the exception of her plea of guilty, I would impose a head sentence of twelve years imprisonment. I would reduce this to nine years to reflect the value of the early plea of guilty. I would set a non parole period of four years six months. The sentence and non parole period should commence on the date of arrest and the non parole period would therefore expire on 12 December 2008. In determining these sentences I have taken into account the various matters specified to be so taken into account by s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914.  
     
      
    43 In setting the non parole period, I have adopted the proportion to head sentence applied at first instance principally in the light of the written submission by the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given his Honour’s factual findings on the (respondent’s) prospects of rehabilitation, the Crown does not complain about the non parole period as a proportion of the head sentence ……” 
        
       
      
    44 The consequence is very favourable to the respondent and I emphasize that the adoption of this proportion is in response to that express concession by the Crown in this particular case. 
     
      
    45 The formal orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (a) Crown appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
      (b) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (c) In lieu thereof the respondent sentenced to imprisonment for nine years with a non parole period of four years and six months, both to date from 13 June 2004. The non parole period specified to expire on 12 December 2008. 
       
      (d) The respondent’s legal representatives directed to make the necessary explanation required by s 16F of the  
      Crimes Act 1914 
      . 
       
      
    46 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J and his reasons for those orders. 
     
      
    47 HALL J: I have read in draft the judgment prepared by Grove J. I respectfully agree with the reasons and orders proposed.

     JUDGMENT 
    1. SANTOW JA: I agree with Smart AJ2. HISLOP J: I agree with Smart AJ.3. SMART AJ: The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against a sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months imposed upon the offender on a charge of manslaughter of the male child of his de facto to which he had pleaded guilty. The agreed basis of the plea was that the offender caused the child's death by an unlawful and dangerous act. The Director contends that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 4. In January 2002 the offender, then aged 18, and AK, then aged 17, were living together in a flat at Casino in a de facto relationship with AK's two children, a male child born 23 January 2000 and almost two years of age, and a female baby born on 26 November 2001. The male child's natural father was serving a prison sentence in Queensland.5. The mother and the offender both lied to the police when they were interviewed on 17 January 2002, the day of the infliction of the fatal injuries and the day of the admission of the child to hospital. Eventually, on 22 July 2003, the mother told the police in detail of the events immediately leading up to the ultimately fatal injury to the child. The mother was in the laundry and heard the child screaming. She ran into his bedroom: 
     
      
       
        ""I ran in there and saw DJ [the offender] had him up on the window sill holding him by the shoulders. DJ wanted him to jump and he would let go of him. DJ said, 'I want him to jump.' I said, 'Can't you see he's scared, he's shaking.' [The child] started screaming louder and DJH grabbed his head and just pushed it into the window, just the once, he pushed him backwards into the window. I went over to grab [the child] but DJ pushed me away. When he pushed [the child's] head into the window he used two hands, he grabbed him over the ears and just thrust his head back against the window, it was just too quick. It was loud but the window didn't smash or crack. He then took him off and chucked him on the mattress. It was a forceful chuck. He chucked him on his back and his head was on the edge."" 
       
      
    6. The child lost consciousness immediately after that.7. The child was admitted to Casino Hospital just after 3.30pm on 17 January 2002. He was still unconscious. The admitting doctor concluded that the child had been ""violently assaulted and was probably going to die from his brain stem injury"". The child was transferred to Lismore Base Hospital where Dr C Gavaghan, the Director of Accident and Emergency, noted bruising on the right side of the child's face in the form of three circular bruises in a row between the right eye and the mouth which were black in colour and measured under two centimetres each. There was evidence of retinal haemorrhages in both eyes and haemorrhages behind the left and right tympanic membranes of the ears, symptomatic of accelerative brain injury. There were a number of other small older bruises over the chest wall. The child had significant bleeding in his brain. A skeletal survey revealed multiple arm fractures of different ages in the left arm and an old fracture in the right arm. There was a clearly visible fracture of the left wrist. Dr Gavaghan thought that ""the child was most likely subjected to continuous abuse over a prolonged period of time and this is evidenced in his skeletal survey and his general nutritional state.""8. The child was placed on life support in the Intensive Care Unit. He died about 10.50am on 18 January 2002.9. The post mortem examination disclosed bruises over the child's body, especially the face, chest, right forearm and right thigh, head injuries, spinal injuries and fractures of different ages. He concluded that the injuries were indicative of non-accidental injury and that the cause of death was head and possibly spinal injuries.10. Dr Kieran Moran, the Director of the Child Protection Unit, Sydney Children's Hospital, was consulted by police and reported:  ""The child died as a result of abusive head trauma and that he had been severely abused prior to the fatal incident. It is likely that he suffered a variety of severe impacts to the head during the fatal assault.""11. In his evidence in the committal proceedings on 14 February 2003 Dr Moran stated that the fatal injury could have occurred as a result of an extremely severe acceleration against a soft surface such as a mattress which included a whip-lashing movement to the head. He agreed that a male taking hold of a child and throwing it with great force and power onto a mattress on the floor could have caused the fatal injury.12. There is a considerable body of evidence that prior to 17 January 2002 the offender smacked the child excessively, dragged the child by the arm, lifted him by one arm and smacked him, hit him on the head with an open hand, on some occasions causing him to fall heavily on the ground and force-fed the child by taking hold of his mouth and forcing him to chew. The offender was not charged with any of these acts. Before the offender, the mother and the child moved into their flat he was spoken to by his mother and sister and others about his treatment of the child.13. The mother of the child said that the offender became more violent towards the child after they moved into their flat. She said that one way or the other the offender was violent towards the child every day. He threatened her that if she told DOCS about what was happening they would take the child away from her and she was scared this might happen. They would often argue. The situation became worse and despite her pregnant condition, the offender started to push the mother when she went to pick up the child, though mainly he just threatened her.14. The judge expressly reminded himself that the offender was to be sentenced for manslaughter alone and that he had not been charged with any of the other acts mentioned. The judge held that the relevance of these other acts was to demonstrate that the violence of 17 January 2002 was not isolated, it was not accidental and it was not momentary. It was the culmination of continued physical abuse. 15. The offender in his evidence, expressed his sorrow for what had happened but the judge very much doubted that this was deeply felt. The judge wondered whether his impression reflected the offender's difficulty with expressing emotion other than anger.16. Dr Brendan Lloyd, psychologist, interviewed the offender for 1 hour 37 minutes at Grafton Gaol. He also read the facts prepared for the Court and the mother's statement of 22 July 2002. The offender verified the history which he gave Dr Lloyd.17. The offender described himself as having a ""short fuse"" and easily aroused into anger. He said that he found it hard to calm down once he is aroused into anger.18. The offender experienced a disadvantaged and disruptive childhood. His natural father beat him with jug cords and fan belts. His mother was the victim of violent domestic abuse at the hands of his father. The family moved around a lot. His mother provided food and comfort for the children and cared for them. His father drank a lot and was frequently absent. His mother left his father when the offender was about five. When the offender was about eight, his mother met a man who was called ""Steve"" and lived with him. The offender said that Steve was kind to him, but it seems that there was inadequate discipline in the home. The offender's early teens were a mixture of trouble and attempts to participate in life generally.19. The offender was much affected by the death of his elder brother, Colin, after his release from Grafton Gaol in what the offender believed were suspicious circumstances and the deaths of a substantial number of other relatives.20. The offender described his mid to late teens as a time largely dedicated to marijuana and alcohol. From the time he left school around 16 to the time of his arrest on 10 September 2002, he fell into a pattern of daily use.21. Dr Lloyd recorded that the offender had a history of self-harming. In response to racial vilification, especially at school, towards himself and his sisters he was prone to run into walls with the deliberate intention of causing harm to himself. Now he is prone to punching brick walls, including those in gaol. The offender complains of arthritis in his hands as a consequence.22. Dr Lloyd reported that the offender was ""on protection"" in gaol due to the danger he faces from other prisoners. This has resulted in less opportunities for exercise and education.23. Dr Lloyd thought that the offender possessed a little higher than average intelligence. A more detailed psychometric assessment was needed to reveal the full extent of his capabilities.24. Dr Lloyd diagnosed the offender as suffering from a Borderline Personality Disorder. This is difficult to manage and requires prolonged and highly skilled treatment with at least 12 months of weekly contact. Dr Lloyd described in detail what is involved in such treatment. It is not always successful. Dr Lloyd believed, ""a mandated treatment program has a strong potential for helping Mr Dalton back into the world at large"".25. Dr Lloyd wrote that if there was progress during the period of intense treatment of 12 months, the frequency of the sessions could be reduced. He concluded, ""I would estimate that four years to follow up would be a minimum. I would hope this would translate into four years of psychotherapy and support to make a personality change in Dennis.""26. Dr Lloyd sounds this unsettling note of warning:  
     
      
       
        ""Without a therapeutic intervention, should Dennis find himself in a similar situation in the future, it is likely that within a year the pattern of abuse will be back. He might learn from this current experience and the harm he could inflict in the future may not be as lethal, but it will be nonetheless damaging physically and psychologically."" 
       
      
    27. The judge referred to the ""undoubted immaturity"" of the applicant, a fact which the judge was able to assess from hearing and seeing the offender give evidence. This advantage was also important in his forming the view ""that the offender did not realise the serious potential for grave injury that his actions caused"".28. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        ""It is important in the context of this case to give weight to the fact that the offender is Aboriginal and hence part of a marginalised community which, in his case, I think has contributed significantly to his own feelings of inadequacy and self-hatred to which Dr Lloyd has referred: see  
       R v Fernando  
       (1992) 76 A Crim R 58."" 
       
      
    29. The judge regarded the relative youth of the offender as ""a most significant factor"" and pointed to the ""great importance of rehabilitation in this particular case."" He held that ""objectively, the offence was a very serious one"" and that the offender ""was well aware that his actions were criminal assaults, quite capable of causing painful injuries, to which he was apparently angrily indifferent."" The judge added, ""I think he still feels that the child's death at his hands was accidental; this might merely be a mark of the offender's relative immaturity"".30. The judge concluded: 
     
      
       
        ""I have reluctantly concluded that the circumstances of the offender's crime are so serious that I am bound to impose a term of imprisonment which will result in the offender serving some more time in prison. Though unexpected, a small child was killed by the offender's act of deliberate cruelty, an act which he knew to be wrong and of a kind which he had been told on many occasions he should not commit."" 
       
      
    31. The judge held that the relative youth of the offender and his psychological dysfunction must qualify the application of the element of general deterrence.32. The judge stated: 
     
      
       
        ""…the offender has been in custody since 10 September 2002. He has spent most of that time in special protection and will continue to do so. Moreover, the conditions of imprisonment whilst on remand are significantly more harsh than ordinary imprisonment, so that merely to backdate the sentence is an inadequate adjustment. This is an important factor which requires an allowance to be made in the term still to be served. There are, as is obvious, special circumstances that justify a departure from the statutory calculus in s44 of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       , primarily to enable a lengthy period of supervision and support after the offender's release. I have taken into account the offender's expression of contrition in addition to the utilitarian discount."" 
       
      
    33. The judge granted a discount in the order of 10 per cent for the plea of guilty which came on the verge of the commencement of the offender's trial. The judge held that the utilitarian value of the plea was not great and that in addition to avoiding the expense of a trial its main virtue was that it avoided the mother having to give evidence.34. The judge was faced with a difficult sentencing exercise in a tragic case.35. The Crown's principal ground of appeal was that on the facts of this case the sentence was so inadequate as itself to bespeak error. The Crown further submitted that there were identifiable errors and I shall deal with each of these alleged errors.(a) His Honour erred in treating the mens rea requited for manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act as a mitigating feature of the case.36. I doubt if this formulation of the ground accurately reflected the Crown's contentions. The Crown submitted that the judge  
     
      
      (i) regarded the lack of an intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm (the mens rea for murder) as a matter lessening the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter in this case; 
       
      (ii) qualified his assessment of the objective seriousness by reason of this fact and said he was reluctant to impose a term of imprisonment. 
       
      
    37. Manslaughter by an unlawful dangerous act does not require an intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm. What is required is proof of an intention to commit the unlawful and dangerous act and proof that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that he was exposing the victim to an appreciable risk of serious injury.38. The Crown contended that the judge erred in treating the offender's belief that the death was accidental as a mitigating feature and in the weight he gave to this factor. The Crown relied on the offender having been warned on at least one occasion of the risk of such injury to the child by reason of one of his assaults.39. On a fair reading of the judge's remarks none of these complaints is justified. The judge at no stage said expressly or by implication that the lack of an intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm lessened the objective seriousness of the manslaughter. The judge specifically acknowledged the seriousness of the offence.40. The judge's comment that, though unexpected, a small child was killed by the offender's act of deliberate cruelty, an act which he knew to be wrong and of a kind he had been told on many occasions he should not commit reflected the factual position. By ""unexpected"" the judge means unexpected by the offender. It is an impermissible jump to say that the judge, by the use of the words ""though unexpected"" was lessening the seriousness of the offence. Nor do I accept that the judge in referring to the offender's belief that the death was accidental treated that as a mitigating feature. In the context the judge was pointing out that the applicant did not realise the serious potential of his acts and therefore regarded what happened as accidental. In making this remark the judge probably also had in mind Dr Lloyd's report and the difficult task of rehabilitation which lay ahead.41. The Crown's submissions read too much into the judge's remarks. These submissions should be rejected.(b) His Honour Failed to Impose a Sentence That Reflected the Objective Seriousness of the offence.42. This complaint is essentially one of manifest inadequacy and is better dealt with under the principal ground.(c) The Fernando Principles43. The Crown contended that the judge misapplied the principles enunciated in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 in that the judge had treated the offender's aboriginality as requiring mitigation of the sentence with proof of nothing further relating his race to the commission of the offence.44. The judge was not relying solely on the offender's Aboriginality. He was relying on the offender's Aboriginality, the race vilification he experienced at school and the effect that that had had upon the offender as detailed by Dr Lloyd. That vilification followed on the childhood experiences of the offender briefly summarised earlier. In combination these factors had led, at least in part, to Borderline Personality Disorder.45. Dr Lloyd was relying on principles formulated by Dr Linehan in his published works, Skills Training for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder and Cognitive Behavioural Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder, the Guildford Press New York. Dr Lloyd applied those principles to this case when he wrote: 
     
      
       
        ""Deemed self invalidation. Dennis' early childhood experiences were fragmented invalidating and dangerous. All through his childhood he experienced racial vilification at school."" 
       
      
    46. Dr Lloyd expressed the view that the conduct of the offender towards the child, namely, the months of physical harm, with the harm becoming lethal for the child, ""describes a set pattern of behaviour that contributes to describing Dennis' personality"". Dr Lloyd saw the racial vilification as playing a part in the onset of the Borderline Personality Disorder.47. The judge did not deal with the matter in the detail set out earlier in these reasons, but his reference to the offender's aboriginality and Dr Lloyd's assessment encompassed that.48. This is not a case of the misapplication of the Fernando principles as further explained in R v Morgan (2003) 57 NSWLR 533 and R v Newman, R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102, but a development of them to meet a different factual situation. This complaint should be rejected. 
     (d) Failure to Take Into Account As An Aggravating Feature That the Offender was on a Good Behaviour Bond at the Time of the Commission of the Offence.49 .The Crown accepted that the offender was not on a bond at the time the offence was committed. This complaint fails. (e) His Honour failed to fix a non-parole period that adequately reflected the seriousness of the offence.50. The Crown pointed out that the adjustment for special circumstances involved a reduction in the non-parole period from the standard ratio of 75 per cent to 46.4 per cent of the total sentence. The Crown submitted that by so varying the statutory proportions the judge has compounded the undue leniency of the head sentence by arriving at a wholly inadequate non-parole period that does not reflect the seriousness of the offence. The Crown submitted that there had been double counting for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence and therefore reflected in the standard non-parole period.51. The Crown complained that the judge referred to the ""obvious"" special circumstances without identifying anything other than the desire for a lengthy period of post release supervision. The Crown conceded that the judge had earlier referred to the youth of the offender as requiring both amelioration of the sentence and a structure that would encourage rehabilitation. The Crown contended that the standard statutory ratio would have provided an adequate period of post release supervision on parole and that the non-parole period fixed did not adequately give expression to the need for general and specific deterrence.52. The Crown submissions overlook the terms of Dr Lloyd's report which the judge accepted. Dr Lloyd envisaged intensive treatment for one year and treatment extending over a further four years. The intensive and highly skilled and specialised treatment Dr Lloyd regarded as necessary may well not be available in gaol. If that is so and Dr Lloyd is correct as to the level of treatment needed, not a great deal of rehabilitation may take place in gaol. It would be surprising if the offender was able to afford the level of treatment deemed necessary by Dr Lloyd. I am not aware whether that treatment could be otherwise funded. These questions were not raised at the sentencing hearing. The prospect of the offender not receiving the treatment he needs is disturbing. Dr Lloyd's report, if substantially accepted, warranted a major extension of the period on parole and a corresponding reduction in the non-parole period.53. The ultimate question of whether the judge failed to fix a non-parole period that adequately reflected the seriousness of the offence is better dealt with under the general ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. (f) His Honour gave too much weight to the subjective circumstances of the offender.54. It is a fundamental rule that a sentencing judge should not permit the subjective features of a particular offender to overshadow the seriousness of the offence. The Crown complained that the judge placed too much weight on the offender's youth and immaturity and failed to appreciate sufficiently that the offender was living as an adult in a de facto relationship and was in a position of trust in respect of a small child.55. It was pointed out that the offender fled following the offence, and initially lied to police about his involvement. The Crown submitted that there was little by way of contrition to ameliorate the sentence, that the conduct culminating in the offence was deliberate and sustained, despite warnings from others.56. These are also matters better dealt with under the general ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. (g) His Honour failed to comply with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  in that he failed to firstly set out the full term of the sentence, and secondly to set a non-parole period.57. The Crown submitted that the judge had sentenced the offender in accordance with s 44 of that Act as it stood at the date of sentencing, whereas in that form s 44 applied to offences committed on and after 1 February 2003. The current form of s 44 was introduced by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002. The Crown contended that the offender should have been sentenced in accordance with s 44 as enacted in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Under the legislation the offender fell to be sentenced under s 44 as enacted in 1999, the offence being committed in January 2002.58. Under s 44 as enacted in 1999 the Court is required to set the term of the sentence and secondly to set a non-parole period for the sentence (the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention). Under the amended s 44 the Court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention) and the balance of the term must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period. In each instance the Court is empowered to vary the ratio if there are special circumstances.59. Adams J said: 
     
      ""Dennis Dalton, you are sentenced to serve a minimum term of imprisonment of three years and three months from 10 September 2002 so that you will be eligible to be released on parole on 9 December 2005. The balance of the term of seven years imprisonment will expire on 9 September 2009 …"" 
    60. It does not follow that, because the judge in his formal sentence announced the minimum term first followed in the next sentence by the length of the full term of the sentence, he did not firstly set the term of the sentence. The use by the judge of the phrase ""minimum term"" rather than ""non-parole period"" was a slip and reflects the words in parenthesis in the legislation.61. This is not a point that has any practical importance. The minimum period that the offender has to spend in gaol has been specified as have the first date on which he is eligible for release on parole and the length of the full term of the sentence.62. This point is one of form and would not of itself lead to any alteration of substance to the sentence. The Principal Ground of Appeal – Manifest Inadequacy.63. The protection of children is of fundamental importance to society (R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309 at [18] per Wood CJ at CL. In crimes against young children heavy sentences reflecting the need for severe punishment are required: R v Ditford, unrep 17 March 1992 per Hunt CJ at CL. The law attaches great importance to the sanctity of human life. The Crown correctly contended that the sentence imposed does not reflect any of these long-established principles.64. The Crown submitted that on any test of objective seriousness this offence was in the most serious category of manslaughter as it involved sustained and gratuitous cruelty to the child. This was not a case of momentary loss of control or error of judgment.65. It was also pointed out that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.66. The youth and immaturity of the offender are matters of importance as was his borderline personality disorder which was at least in part contributed to by his disrupted and disadvantaged childhood and the racial vilification endured. The offender was of not less than average intelligence. He had been warned against ill-treating this young child. Even as an immature 18 year old he was aware that his conduct was capable of severely injuring the young child, especially on the morning of 17 January 2002. Any reasonable person would have realised this. His actions were deliberate and the child was not in a position where he could effectively resist the offender's actions.67. The offender had a strong subjective case but his criminality was grave.68. Both the full sentence and the non-parole period (or minimum term) were manifestly inadequate. There is no sufficient reason why this Court should not re-sentence. I have not overlooked that the offender was sentenced in April 2004 and is due to be released in December 2005. This was a very grave crime.69. The offender is entitled to the discount in the order of 10 per cent allowed by the judge. His powerful subjective features must be and are taken into account. Any re-sentencing must be approached with the restraint which is appropriate to Crown Appeals.70. It is also important to take into account that the applicant has served and will serve his sentence on strict protection. This is more arduous. Further, the applicant's affidavit of 20 September 2004 points out the limited education facilities which are available in practice and the limited activities and amenities actually available. The offender has found it hard to get a job in strict protection. He tells of a memory loss he has suffered and the consequent trouble he has had with reading, writing and spelling. He has not seen the psychologist. It is not stated why this has occurred. The offender may need help to enlist the psychologist's services. He probably needs specialist psychological services.71. There are special circumstances. The offender is going to need skilled and extended treatment as outlined by Dr Lloyd and he will need support and supervision. I doubt if treatment of the length, regularity and quality required will be available in gaol. Rehabilitation will be long and difficult but essential for the community if the offender is to overcome or cope with his borderline personality disorder. 72. This Court should proceed under the original form of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act when re-sentencing as the offence occurred prior to 1 February 2003.73. The offender should be sentenced to a full term of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months.74. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Crown appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
       
      2. In lieu of the sentence imposed the offender (Dennis James Dalton) is sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years commencing on 10 September 2002 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months expiring on 9 March 2007 on which day the applicant will become eligible for release on parole, which should be under the supervision and control of the Adult Probation Service.  
       
       
      3. Direct that a copy of Dr Lloyd's report accompany the warrant to the Corrective Service Authorities.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
     
       
      
    1 STEIN AJA: The court is in a position to proceed to judgment in this matter now. I will ask Grove J to deliver the first judgment of the court. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Kinchington ADCJ in the Sydney District Court on 17 September 2004. The applicant, at relevant times a senior constable of police, pleaded guilty to soliciting a bribe contrary to s 200(1) of the Police Act 1990 for which the prescribed maximum penalty is seven years’ imprisonment and/or a fine. In passing sentence his Honour was asked to take into account, pursuant to the Form 1 procedure, one further similar offence. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for two years commencing on 17 September 2004 with a non-parole period of sixteen months commencing on that date and expiring on 16 January 2006. Given the length of sentence, release to parole on that date ought to have been ordered by the court, but this is an omission which does not require resort to appeal in order to be corrected. 
     
      
    3 The facts in relation to the offence charged were that at about 8.15am on 14 January 2004 the applicant was performing highway patrol duties on the F3 freeway near Ourimbah. He stopped a vehicle being driven by a seventeen year old provisionally licensed driver named Daniel Phillips. There was another occupant of the car. The applicant asserted to Mr Phillips that he was travelling at 145 kph although later in the conversation he mentioned 140 kph. Mr Phillips responded that he may have exceeded 90 kph which was applicable to him as a provisional driver but disputed the applicant’s assertions. 
     
      
    4 The applicant commenced to fill in an infringement notice but did not complete it. Conversation revealed that Mr Phillips worked in a part time job concerning Quad motorbikes. The applicant indicated that he would like a couple of these and did not care whether they were “legitimate” or not. He said that the infringement notice could not be withdrawn (no doubt there is a system for auditing the use of such documents) but offered to make it out for a minor offence such as having a bald tyre which would not affect Mr Phillips’ licence status. 
     
      
    5 A mobile telephone number was supplied and thereafter a number of conversations took place between the applicant and Mr Phillips. The applicant wrote out his recollection of the conversation in a diary and the solicitation by the applicant is obvious from the terms of this record. Among other things he said to Mr Phillips, “If you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours” and “Call (it) what you want. It’s bribery and corruption, but we are doing each other a favour and I am very old fashioned”. 
     
      
    6 Thereafter the matter was reported to the relevant police professional conduct authorities and warrants obtained permitting interception of telephone calls and the use of listening devices. Among other things, the applicant in a conversation offered to pay the fine for the “bald tyre” infringement himself. 
     
      
    7 In due course an arrangement was made for delivery of a Quad bike by Mr Phillips to the applicant and this took place on 8 February 2004. The applicant assisted moving a Quad bike onto his trailer and thereafter he was arrested and charged. On legal advice he exercised his right to decline an interview. 
     
      
    8 The facts relating to the offence taken into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure were that in about November/December 2003 the applicant, again performing highway patrol duties, stopped a truck being driven by a man named Divola. Divola was a disqualified driver and he gave a false name and details relating to a friend of his, Shane Johnston. Shane Johnston’s father operates an earthmoving company on the Central Coast known as Julcat Earthmoving. 
     
      
    9 It is not necessary for present purposes to detail all the steps which led up to the ultimate acquisition by the applicant of earthmoving work, namely excavating a swimming pool, by Julcat. The agreed facts were that work to the value of $1,171.50 was carried out. The applicant did not pay for this work. On the occasion of its being carried out Shane Johnston was in attendance and introduced himself. He was, as stated, a friend of Divola and he had persuaded his father to do this work in order to avoid the possibility that his trucks would be “targeted” by police, or, at least by the applicant. Julcat Earthmoving and Mr Divola operated trucks of similar appearance. It might be noted that on 11 March 2004, after the arrest of the applicant, he contacted the office of Julcat and subsequently spoke to Shane Johnston whom he told that there had been “some dramas at work” and enquired of him whether he had had any “strange” phone calls. Mr Johnston replied in the negative and the applicant asked if they could meet, but Mr Johnston declined. 
     
      
    10 The applicant had no prior convictions. He had been divorced but was remarried and presented as a devoted family man. Evidence was also called from a number of police officers regarding his general good repute with them. He had been in receipt of commendations for police work. I see no reason to conclude that his Honour underestimated the applicant’s former commendable behaviour. It is, I should observe, easy to contemplate that amongst colleagues in the Police Force the applicant would not reveal his darker side in which activity he in effect practised extortion upon his victims. 
     
      
    11 The applicant relies upon a number of specified grounds of appeal, the first of which asserts that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Such is, of course, an ultimate submission and it is convenient to deal with some express submissions first. 
     
      
    12 Ground 2 asserts that the sentencing judge failed to accept and act upon unchallenged evidentiary material. The applicant had tendered on his behalf a letter from a general practitioner, Dr McGrath, and a psychologist, Mr Grant. Neither was required to attend for cross-examination. His Honour made extensive reference to the report by Mr Grant and expressed his conclusion that: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is evidence to support the fact that you presently have a number of psychological and physical problems to address at this time. I am not satisfied that those problems so impacted on you at the time you committed these two criminal offences as to fully explain or excuse them in any way because each of them was not a spontaneous act on your part but was a result of deliberate and conscious conduct over some weeks following the initial contact.” 
        
       
      
    13 That was a finding open to his Honour. There were several other references in his remarks on sentence to the applicant’s conditions. What his Honour was bound to do was to take the material into account and give it such weight as he found in the circumstances was appropriate. There is no indication that he did not do so. On the contrary, it is plain that he discharged his obligation in this regard. 
     
      
    14 The next ground asserts that his Honour inappropriately applied previous decisions in this court in the sentencing process. In the course of his remarks his Honour recited some general observations from the decisions in R v Nomchong (unreported, NSWCCA, 10 April 1997) and R v Pangallo (1991) 56 A Crim R 441. Counsel for the applicant has pointed to the circumstance that in each of those cases the offender faced charges laid pursuant to s 319 of the Crimes Act for which a prescribed maximum penalty of fourteen years’ imprisonment without the option of a fine was applicable, whereas the charge against the applicant (and the offence taken into account on the Form 1) carried half that prescribed maximum. That observation is not intended to suggest that the offence taken into account on the Form 1 is to be taken into account as if it were a second charge, but is to be taken into account in accordance with the judgment of this court in In The Application of the Attorney General No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. 
     
      
    15 It is plain from his Honour’s remarks that he was not engaging in an impermissible comparison between those cases and the present. What he referred to were observations about this type of criminal conduct. The emphasis is added. In R v Nomchong McInerney J had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The police are in a position of authority and trust in the community and the public depends on them to uphold the rule of law. The crime of bribery by a police officer is one that strikes at the very heart of the justice system.” 
        
       
      
    16 Those remarks are pertinent to the present offence and not just to an offence higher in the scale of criminality such as was the circumstance in that particular instance. Similarly, Lee J in R v Pangallo said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The crime of bribery by a police officer therefore must be severely punished whenever detected. The police are in constant contact with members of the public and the opportunity for bribery is always great. Those circumstances themselves mean that the element of general deterrence is always a matter that must be kept very much in the forefront of the mind of a sentencing judge when a police officer is charged with an offence such as this. It is important to deter other officers who may be inclined to similar conduct.” 
        
       
      
    17 Once again, these are remarks of general application to this type of offence and are not limited to an offence higher up the scale of criminality such as was the case in Pangallo. There is no basis for a conclusion that his Honour made the asserted error. 
     
      
    18 I see no relevant consequence emerging from the circumstance that, at the time the cases cited were decided, the extant sentencing options did not include suspension of sentence. 
     
      
    19 The next ground asserts that the sentencing judge failed to reveal his reasoning process. As is implicit in the written submissions on behalf of the Crown, little can be said in response to this submission other than to invite reading the whole of his Honour’s remarks on sentence which reveal that he considered the facts which constituted the objective seriousness of the offence and he took into account subjective matters in favour of the applicant. He made express reference to matters which are set out in the litany or checklist now to be found in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is not suggested that there is any identifiable error by his Honour in those regards. 
     
      
    20 Submissions are made concerning his Honour’s conclusion that he should allow a “discount” on sentence of approximately thirty per cent. He first made reference to that figure in his remarks when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am also satisfied that your plea of guilty has a utilitarian value and in the circumstances of this case I propose to allow you a discount on sentence of approximately thirty per cent.” 
        
       
      
    21 That discount is of course higher than the upper figure in the range suggested in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 but, of course, the range suggested in that case was not expressed to be determinative of either an upper or a lower limit. 
     
      
    22 The second reference in his remarks came when his Honour was turning to the assessment of the actual sentence. He nominated some seven considerations, the seventh of which he described as “The fact that you are entitled to a discount of sentence approximating thirty per cent”. 
     
      
    23 His Honour did not follow the course of expressing a notional figure before applying the discount although this references on each occasion to approximation suggest that he may have commenced with a head sentence assessment of three years reduced to two years which, arithmetically, is a discount of thirty-three and a third per cent on that element of sentence but approximately thirty per cent. 
     
      
    24 The complaint is made that, if his Honour had assessed a relevant utilitarian discount of thirty per cent, then there ought to have been discount for such other factors as were favourable to the applicant. Irrespective of how his Honour approached the task, it was his clear duty not to impose a sentence which was less than appropriate to the whole of the circumstances. I do not perceive that his Honour failed in his duty in that regard. There is no basis for concluding that he did not take requisite matters into account in his overall assessment. 
     
      
    25 It is contended that by reason of the express submission made to the judge, that a suspended sentence should be imposed and the failure of the sentencing judge expressly to reject it, error is demonstrated. 
     
      
    26 His Honour’s introductory remark to final imposition of sentence that “The only way I can ensure that you are adequately punished on this offence is to subject you to a term of imprisonment” clearly implies a rejection of the proposition that the term of imprisonment should be suspended as he forthwith embarked upon imposition of sentence. To incant his rejection of a submission which is necessarily rejected is an unnecessary exercise and, again, I am unpersuaded that error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    27 The ultimate question which, as I have said, is encompassed by the first ground asserting that the sentence was manifestly excessive, is whether this court concludes that some lesser sentence ought to have been imposed. The sentence was, in my view, well within the range of the sound exercise of discretion in all the circumstances and I am unpersuaded that a lesser sentence ought to have been imposed. 
     
      
    28 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    29 STEIN AJA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    30 HOWIE J: I also agree. 
     
      
    31 STEIN AJA: Accordingly, the order of the court is that leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.
