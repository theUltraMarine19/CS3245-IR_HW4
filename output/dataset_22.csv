ss 42 & 65 Road Traffic Act (Cap 276)
 
The appellant in this case was charged with having committed an offence under s 65 of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) by using a handphone whilst driving along the Pan Island Expressway on 26 July 1996. He was said to have held the handphone in his right hand whilst controlling the steering wheel of his vehicle with his left hand. On 24 September 1996 he pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced by the district judge to a fine of $300. He was also disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence in respect of all classes of vehicles for one year.
The present appeal was brought against the sentence of disqualification. On behalf of the appellant, it was submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case. In particular, it was argued that the appellant had not in any way made it necessary for other road-users to take preventive action. I could see no mitigating value, however, in such a fact. In pleading guilty in the court below, the appellant admitted without reservation that his using the handphone whilst driving `lessened his ability to control his vehicle and [diminished] his concentration on the road`. It is patently clear, in short, that persons such as the appellant who make use of handphones whilst driving are deliberately laying themselves open to distraction from the task of driving. They show blatant disregard for the safety of their fellow road-users; and it scarcely lies in their mouths to say that no one appears to have been actually alarmed by their driving. The prospect of a sentence of disqualification is necessary to deter such inconsiderate and heedless drivers; and the district judge in this case was, in my view, justified in imposing such a sentence on the appellant.
I was further of the view, however, that the disqualification period of one year ordered by the district judge was manifestly excessive, having regard to the fact that the appellant was a first-time offender. For this reason, I allowed the appeal and ordered that the sentence of disqualification be reduced to six months.
