APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal

dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction for possession of
house-breaking instruments, contrary to s. 309(1) of the Criminal Code.
Appeal allowed and conviction quashed.

S. Goldberg, for the appellant.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear you in
reply Mr. Goldberg. We are all of the opinion that the appeal should be
allowed and the conviction quashed. It appears from the trial judge’s reasons
that he tried and convicted the accused under the predecessor of the present
s. 309(1) of the Criminal Code under which the offence was
differently formulated; and his report to the Court of Appeal candidly
recognized the merit of the grounds of appeal to that Court. Having come to the
conclusion on these grounds that the conviction should be quashed, it is
unnecessary for us to consider any of the other points raised in argument. The
appeal is accordingly allowed and the conviction is quashed.

Judgment accordingly.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Defences—Entrapment—Police
informer—Possession of cocaine and heroin—Narcotics Control Act, R.S.C., 1970,
c. N-1, ss. 3(1), (2), 4(2), (3).

Appellant was found by Metropolitan Toronto
police to be in possession of heroin and was arrested. He told the police that
he worked as an informer for the R.C.M.P. but that the R.C.M.P. were unaware
that he had bought the heroin and was going to sell it. He was also found to be
in possession of cocaine. Appellant was a drug addict and this was known to the
R.C.M.P. He had been used by the R.C.M.P. as a decoy and informer, and this
involved him, according to his evidence, in purchasing drugs with money
supplied by the R.C.M.P. and in selling drugs. The R.C.M.P. contact’s evidence
was that appellant had not told him that he was selling drugs as well as buying
them and that appellant was used by the R.C.M.P. as a paid informer even after
his arrest, not an unusual practice of the R.C.M.P. in their use of informers.
Appellant was convicted of possession and possession for the purpose of
trafficking after his defence of entrapment was withdrawn from the jury by the
trial judge.

The Court of Appeal in affirming the convictions
but reducing the sentence asserted that the defence of entrapment was not open
to the accused, adding that no such defence is available in England and that U.S. judgments dealing with entrapment have not been applied in Canada. The Supreme Court granted leave to
appeal further on the question of law: “Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in
holding that the learned trial judge was right in not putting the defence of
entrapment to the jury?”

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and Pratte JJ.: The sole point raised by counsel for the
appelant was that entrapment should have been left to the jury because the
evidence showed a police-concocted plan to

[Page 488]

ensnare him going beyond mere solicitation.
The evidence was not open to such a view. Without expressing an opinion on any
other question the appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: The use of spies and informers is an
inevitable requirement for detection of consensual crimes and of discouraging
their commission. Such practices do not involve such dirty tricks as to be
offensive to the integrity of the judicial process. Nor can objection on this
ground be taken to the use of decoys who provide the opportunity to others intent
upon the commission of a consensual offence. In such cases the offender can
claim no extenuation that would mitigate his culpability or the use of evidence
to establish it or his punishment upon conviction. The problem which has caused
judicial concern is the one which arises from the police instigated crime,
where the police have gone beyond mere solicitation or mere decoy work and have
actively organized a scheme of ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to
prosecute the person so caught. It is only in this situation that it is proper
to speak of entrapment and to consider what effect this should have on the
prosecution of a person thus drawn into the commission of an offence. In England and in New
 Zealand, judicial revulsion against entrapment of an
accused has been manifested not through recognition of it as a defence but
rather through a discretionary control of the admissibility of evidence and
through mitigation of sentence. While in Canada there is no appellate Court
judgment in which entrapment has been accepted as providing a defence or even
as going to discretionary power to exclude evidence, it was touched on in R.
v. Ormerod, [1969] 2 O.R. 230. No conclusion was reached in that
case because the issue did not arise on the facts which did not go beyond
ordinary solicitation of a suspected drug seller. The present case like Ormerod
and others does not squarely confront the Court with the need to decide
what legal effect should be given to such entrapment.

The evidence in the present case taking it most
favourably to the appellant failed to show entrapment in respect of the
offences charged. Appellant had initiated a transaction which he carried out on
his own for his own benefit. The view of the Court of Appeal in this case or of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Chernecki (1971), 16
C.R.N.S. 230, rejecting entrapment as a defence should not be endorsed. That
question should be left open.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] dismissing an
appeal by the appellant from his conviction on charges under the Narcotics
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, ss. 3, 4. Appeal dismissed.

Victor S. Paisley, for the appellant.

S.M. Froomkin, Q.C., and Michael Dambrot,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Estey JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This appeal is here by leave
of this Court on the following question of law:

Did the Ontario Court of Appeal err in holding
that the learned trial judge was right in law in not putting the defence of
entrapment to the jury?

The appellant was convicted after a jury trial
of two drug offences, namely, possession of cocaine contrary to s. 3(1), (2) of
the Narcotics Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1 and possession of heroin
for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4(2), (3) of the same Act. His
main defence was entrapment, which was withdrawn from the jury in the trial
judge’s charge to them. In affirming the convictions but reducing the sentence,
the Ontario Court of Appeal asserted that the defence of entrapment was not
open to the accused, adding that no such defence is available in England and
that judgments of Courts in the United States dealing with entrapment have not
been applied or followed in Canada: see R. v. Kirzner[2].

The trial judge’s charge to the jury shows that
he took a broad view of entrapment, taking it to embrace the use of an agent
provocateur or the use of an informer as well as inveiglement by the
police. However, he distinguished the situation where there was a complete
concoction, presumably by the police, so that there was no actus reus and
perhaps not even any mens rea by the accused. The trial judge obviously
had in mind the judg-

[Page 490]

ment of this Court in Lemieux v. The Queen[3], to which I will return later in these reasons.

The following three passages in the charge to
the jury show how the issue of entrapment was dealt with by the trial judge:

(1)… Entrapment is basically where a police
officer or somebody in authority has inveigled somebody or tricked them to
carry out some duty, or possibly it may be argued that the person who claims
they are entrapped, did it on their own volition. In other words, it arises in
a case such as this where we have an agent provocateur, the police agent or
undercover agent who uses an informer. Now, entrapment in our law is no
defence.

(2)… If you found the accused in fact
committed the offence with which he is charged and had done this at the
solicitation of an agent provocateur, that is an undercover agent, that would
have been irrelevant as to the question of guilt or innocence It may go to the
question of sentence but if you find he has acted as an agent in an illegal act
he would still be guilty.

(3)… it is not a defence for a person who
carries out a forbidden act or consents to do it knowing what he is in fact
doing. The only thing is that it would go to the mitigation of sentence. So
that a crime in some instances may be committed from the best of motives, but
it is still a crime.

…

So, I repeat to you, basically in this country
entrapment is not defence to the charge unless the only way that you could find
would be on the evidence that the accused really had no intention of committing
the crime, it wasn’t his act, this was a complete concoction. That wouldn’t
even involve entrapment in such a case, it would really be that a crime had not
been committed. It would be something similar to what I have told you of the
undercover arrangement for the break-in.

Again I must remind you that an accused if
he in fact did commit the offence with which he was charged, and in the
circumstances he had committed the act at the solicitation of an agent
provocateur, this would go to the question of his guilt or innocence.

It was contended by counsel for the appellant
that this Court should recognize the defence of

[Page 491]

entrapment both where a drug offence has been
committed through the mere solicitation of a police agent and where the police,
through a plan or design to ensnare a person in order to prosecute him, have
induced him to commit an offence. On the other hand, counsel for the Crown has
urged this Court to refuse to recognize the defence in either situation but
contended that even if it be proper to accept entrapment as a defence, the
distinction recognized in the American cases, between mere solicitation or use
of an informer and origination of a criminal design by the police into which
the accused is drawn, would exclude it as a defence in the present case. This
submission by the Crown depends, of course, on a particular view of the evidence
as not being capable of supporting a finding that there was here a plan or
design by the police to inveigle the accused into the commission of an offence.

Entrapment is not self-defining, and, in a
generic sense, may encompass a wide array of practices involving police action
which, directly or indirectly, reveals or brings about the commission of an
offence by another. The police, or the agent provocateur or the informer
or the decoy used by the police do not have immunity if their conduct in the
encouragement of a commission of a crime by another is itself criminal. Of
course, whether they are prosecuted is a matter for the Crown attorneys and
ultimately, for the Attorneys-General. What, however, of the person who is
charged as a result of the action of an informer or who commits an offence
through the solicitation or encouragement of a spy or decoy or through police
instigation or through a plan or design of the police to ensnare him? Absent
duress, as dealt with in s. 17 of the Criminal Code, what should the
Court’s attitude be if the evidence shows police involvement, in any one of the
ways above-mentioned, in the commission of the offence?

The role of the police and the role of the
Courts in the enforcement of the criminal law are distinct although interacting.
The former are charged with the investigation and detection of criminal conduct
and with gathering the evidence upon which

[Page 492]

charges are laid to bring the alleged offenders
before the Courts for judicial determination of their culpability. Courts are
concerned with the proper interpretation and application of the criminal law
invoked against accused persons, with the propriety of the conduct of the
prosecution and of the defence, especially in the light of the fundamental
principle of the presumption of innocence, and in this connection, with the
behaviour of the police authorities in respect of their dealings with an
arrested or about-to-be arrested accused. It was in the exercise of this
judicial oversight that the Courts recognized duress as a defence (see R. v.
Steane[4]), developed
the exclusionary rules respecting confessions (see, for example, Boudreau v.
The King[5] and Piché
v. The Queen[6]) and,
in this country, have accepted res judicata or issue estoppel as a bar
to a second conviction (see Kienapple v. The Queen[7]). These were common law developments,
although, in the case of duress, codification in s. 17 of the Criminal Code has
overlaid the common law: see Paquette v. The Queen[8].

There is, of course, a balance to be struck
between giving reasonable latitude to the police in the employment of
stratagems to control the spread of crime, especially in the case of the
illegal drug traffic, and controlling behaviour that goes beyond any reasonable
latitude. American jurisdictions have, on a constitutional basis, sought to
control the introduction of illegally obtained evidence; in England, the Courts have continued to
exercise a discretionary power to control the admissibility of evidence that
would operate unfairly against an accused. Control techniques may thus relate
to the recognition of substantive defences or to rules against the admission of
evidence or to a discretion as to its reception. Abuse of process or stay of
proceedings have also been put forward as techniques of control.

Methods of detection of offences and of
suspected offences and offenders necessarily differ according to the class of
crime. Where, for example, violence or breaking, entering and theft are

[Page 493]

concerned, there will generally be external
evidence of an offence upon which the police can act in tracking down the
offenders; the victim or his family or the property owner, as the case may be,
may be expected to call in the police and provide some clues for the police to
pursue. When “consensual” crimes are committed, involving willing persons, as
is the case in prostitution, illegal gambling and drug offences, ordinary
methods of detection will not generally do. The participants, be they deemed
victims or not, do not usually complain or seek police aid; that is what they
wish to avoid. The police, if they are to respond to the public disapprobation
of such offences as reflected in existing law, must take some initiatives. They
may, for example, use a spy, either a policeman or another person, to obtain
information about a consensual offence by infiltration; they may make
arrangements with informers who may be parties to offences on which they report
to the police to enable the other parties to be apprehended; or the police may
use decoys or themselves act under cover to provide others with the opportunity
to commit a consensual offence or to encourage its commission. Going one step
farther, the police may use members of their force or other persons to
instigate the commission of an offence, planning and designing it ab initio to
ensnare others.

The use of spies and informers is an inevitable
requirement for detection of consensual crimes and of discouraging their
commission; otherwise, it would be necessary to await a complaint by a “victim”
or to try to apprehend offenders in flagrante delicto, an exercise not
likely to be crowned with much success. Such practices do not involve such
dirty tricks as to be offensive to the integrity of the judicial process. Nor
can objection on this ground be taken to the use of decoys who provide the
opportunity to others intent upon the commission of a consensual offence. In
all such cases, the offender can claim no extenuation that would mitigate
either his culpability or the use of evidence to establish it or his punishment
upon conviction.

[Page 494]

The problem which has caused judicial concern is
the one which arises from the police‑instigated crime, where the police
have gone beyond mere solicitation or mere decoy work and have actively
organized a scheme of ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to prosecute the
person so caught. In my opinion, it is only in this situation that it is proper
to speak of entrapment and to consider what effect this should have on the
prosecution of a person who has thus been drawn into the commission of an
offence.

There is no doubt that it may be difficult in
particular cases to draw the line between mere use of spies, decoys or
informers and the use of agents provocateurs who go beyond mere
solicitation or encouragement and initiate a criminal design for the purpose of
entrapping a person in order to prosecute him. The principle of the distinction
has, however, been recognized in a series of cases in the Supreme Court of the
United States which has established that entrapment, in the ensnarement sense
above-mentioned, is available as a defence. The line of cases begins with Sorrells
v. United States[9] and
extends through Sherman v. United States[10], United States v. Russell[11] and Hampton v. United States[12]. The issue in the United States, as
reflected in the foregoing judgments of its Supreme Court and in a host of
judgments of other federal Courts and of state Courts, is no longer whether
entrapment should be recognized as a defence or a bar to conviction but whether
the approach to it should be subjective, fastening on the predisposition of the
particular accused, or objective, fastening on the police conduct and on
whether that conduct would have caused a reasonable person to commit the
offence. On the subjective approach, an accused with a predisposition to the
crime would not have the benefit of the defence of entrapment, regardless of
the degree of police involvement.

In England, judicial revulsion against entrapment of an accused has been
manifested not through recognition of a defence on that ground

[Page 495]

but rather through a discretionary control of
the admissibility of evidence and through mitigation of sentence: see Mealey
and Sheridan v. The Queen[13]; R.
v. Birtles[14]; R.
v. Ameer and Lucas[15]. The
Courts of New Zealand have taken the same view: see R. v. Capner[16]; R. v. Pethig[17]. In Canada there is no appellate Court judgment in which entrapment has been
accepted as providing a defence or even as going to discretionary power to
exclude evidence. Although it was touched on by me as a member of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Ormerod[18],
I was of the opinion there that I did not think it wise in that case to come to
any conclusion on the acceptability of entrapment as a defence. That was
because the issue did not arise on the facts, which did not go beyond ordinary
solicitation of a suspected drug seller.

In R. v. Chernecki[19], the British Columbia Court of Appeal
likewise found that the facts did not show such “calculated inveigling or
persistent importuning” (words used by me in R. v. Ormerod as a
description of entrapment) as to make it necessary to consider whether
entrapment should be recognized as a defence. The Court added that it did not
think that any such defence existed at the time in Canada. However, in R. v. Bonnar[20],
the Nova Scotia Appeal Division stated that if entrapment (as opposed to merely
providing an opportunity for the commission of an offence) was established the
proper course was to stay proceedings or to discharge the accused where he did
not have a prior intention or predisposition to commit the offence charged.
Macdonald J.A. speaking for the Court considered that there was abuse of
process in such a situation and that the entrapment was contrary to public
policy. In the particular case, it was held on appeal that the facts did not

[Page 496]

show entrapment.

The present case, like Ormerod, Chernecki and
Bonnar does not squarely confront the Court with the need to decide what
legal effect should be given to a showing of entrapment as I have described it.
The facts, taking them, as we must, most favourably to the accused, are against
such a showing, and I shall come to them shortly. In these circumstances, I
would not, however, endorse the view of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the
present case or of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Chernecki rejecting
entrapment as a defence. There are good reasons for leaving the question open.
Indeed, if that position is based on a static view of s. 7(3) of the Criminal
Code I find it unacceptable. I do not think that s. 7(3) should be regarded
as having frozen the power of the Courts to enlarge the content of the common
law by way of recognizing new defences, as they may think proper according to
circumstances that they consider may call for further control of prosecutorial
behaviour or of judicial proceedings.

Although Courts may agree that entrapment
outrages one’s sense of decency and shames the administration of justice, there
is a difference of opinion as to what the control mechanism should be. The
division of opinion in the United States between the subjective and objective
approaches to entrapment is one aspect of the problem although it appears that
there is growing disposition in lower Court decisions, especially in those of
state Courts, to opt for the objective approach as being one which avoids
problems that arise in fastening on the predisposition of particular accused.
Among the extensive literature on the subject reference may be made to
Donnelly, Judicial Control of Informants, Spies, Stool Pigeons and Agents
Provocateurs (1951) 60 Yale L.J. 1091; Park, The Entrapment Controversy (1975-76)
60 Minn. L. Rev. 163. The Model
Penal Code of the American Law Institute, promulgated in 1962, appears to have
incorporated an objective approach in its

[Page 497]

broadened definition of entrapment in s.
2.13(1), reading as follows:

(1) A public law enforcement official or a
person acting in cooperation with such an official perpetrates an entrapment if
for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, he
induces or encourages another person to engage in conduct constituting such
offense by either:

(a) making knowingly false
representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct is not
prohibited; or

(b) employing methods of persuasion
or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be
committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.

The English Law Commission, which has given some
consideration to the problem and has examined the way in which the American Law
Institute’s Model Penal Code has dealt with the matter was undecided on whether
there should be a defence of entrapment but would circumscribe it as narrowly
as has the Model Penal Code: see English Law Commission, Working Paper No. 55
(1974). Professor Glanville Williams in his work The Criminal Law, The
General Part (2nd ed. 1961) at p. 785 says this:

Is there any technical means by which the
courts could give effect to a defence of official instigation or procurement,
if they were so minded? If one thinks merely in terms of established legal
concepts, as the English courts have hitherto done, it may seem difficult to
give an affirmative answer. The police have no general power to consent to or
authorise acts that would otherwise be breaches of the criminal law. The strict
doctrine of estoppel has not been applied in criminal law, except in respect of
estoppel by judgment; and in any event the situation is not precisely one of
estoppel. In civil law the doctrine of estoppel is not allowed to be used to
extend the limits of governmental power. There is no other ready-made doctrine
to cover the situation.

Another English writer, J.D. Heydon, The
Problems of Entrapment, [1973] Camb. L.J. 268 would reject entrapment as a
defence but would give it legal effect through a discretionary bar on the
admission of evidence and as a mitigating factor in sentencing.

[Page 498]

Another issue concerns the range or class of
offences on which entrapment should have a bearing, either as a matter of
defence or of discretionary control of admissibility of evidence or of the
course of proceedings: see Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections,
Towards Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections, 1969 (The Ouimet Report), at
pp. 79-80. The American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code has taken the position
that with respect to some offences, as for example offences of violence, the
social interest in controlling the behaviour of an accused outweighs that
involved in disapprobation of undesirable police behaviour: see s. 2.13(3).

There is the further problem arising in jury
trials whether entrapment should be dealt with by judges alone, or should
involve the jury as a trier of fact. The Model Penal Code takes the position
that the issue of entrapment should be tried by the Court in the absence of the
jury: s. 2.13(2). The jury would not be excluded on the subjective test
since, if there was evidence of entrapment, it would be for the jury to
determine if there was entrapment in fact and if there was predisposition in
the accused. This is consistent with Canadian practice in respect of factual
issues in a trial with a jury, which is to limit the judge to a determination
of whether there is evidence to go to the jury and to leave it to the jury to
act on its view of the evidence once the issue is left to them.

In short, there are difficult questions that
arise in respect of entrapment which prudence dictates we should leave for
consideration when a decision thereon is demanded by the record. Canadian
writings on the subject have been alive to this policy of avoidance in their
examination of a number of cases, two of them in this Court, which raised
entrapment issues but the writings, useful survey articles, have also been
alive to the dilemmas that entrapment raises: see Shafer and Sheridan, The
Defence of Entrapment (1970), 8 Osg.H.L.J. 277; Watt, The Defence of
Entrapment (1971), 13 Cr.L.Q. 313; Sneideman, A Judicial Test for
Entrapment: The Glimmerings of a Canadian

[Page 499]

Policy on Police-Instigated Crime (1973), 16 Cr.L.Q. 81.

I wish to refer to the two cases in this Court
in which an issue of entrapment was allegedly raised by the facts. They are Lemieux
v. The Queen, supra, and Patterson v. The Queen[21]. In Lemieux v. The Queen, supra, an
informer, acting under police instruction, induced the accused to participate
in a break-in as driver of the car in which the informer and a third person
were taken to the particular house. The owner co-operated by giving the police
a key to the premises. It was found that the accused had no thought of being party
to any such offence until induced by the informer to participate. This Court,
speaking through Judson J., held that it was open to the jury to find that
there was no actus reus in view of the owner’s consent to the
breaking and entering. The facts, leaving aside the participation of the owner
of the premises selected for the break-in, fit exactly the defence of
entrapment as accepted in the American cases. In concluding his reasons, Judson
J. said this, at p. 496:

Had Lemieux in fact committed the offence
with which he was charged, the circumstance that he had done the forbidden act
at the solicitation of an agent provocateur would have been irrelevant
to the question of his guilt or innocence.

This observation was not, of course, necessary
to the decision, and in so far as it envisages the same set of facts but
without the house owner’s involvement, it would involve entrapment as I have
viewed it in these reasons. On the other hand, if there was solicitation by an
informer without the complicity of the police, there would be no question of
entrapment.

Patterson v. The Queen involved a charge of keeping a bawdy house, a charge which arose out
of a telephoned sexual proposition by a police agent, resulting in an
assignation at certain residential premises where the police disclosed their
identity and made an arrest. This Court allowed an appeal from conviction on
the ground that there

[Page 500]

was no evidence of frequent or habitual use of
the house for the purpose of prostitution and it does not appear that any
question of entrapment was argued; certainly it was not dealt with. In any
event, the mere telephone solicitation would not qualify, in respect of a
willing accused, as an entrapment within the rationale of the cases that have
recognized such a defence.

A different set of facts concerning police
instigation of an offence is found in R. v. Woods[22], a judgment of the Ontario Court of
Appeal. That Court set aside a conviction of breaking and entering and theft
(and in the result, directed an acquittal) where it appeared that off duty
police officers in plain clothes, passing themselves off as toughs from
Toronto, threatened violence to the accused, whom they had not previously met,
if he did not produce a stolen outboard motor which they wished to purchase at
a discount. The accused yielded to the threats, broke into a marina and stole
an outboard and was then charged. The fact of the threat of violence came out
in the evidence of the police officers but the magistrate who tried the accused
convicted on the basis of giving credit to the evidence of one of the officers
because the magistrate knew him personally. The Court of Appeal found this to
be an extraneous circumstance and concluded the conviction must be quashed and
then (the Crown agreeing) ordered an acquittal. No consideration was given to
entrapment as a possible defence.

There are two lower Court decisions, R. v.
Shipley[23], an
Ontario County Court judgment R. v. MacDonald[24], a judgment of a British
 Columbia Provincial Court, in which, on a finding of
entrapment, a stay of proceedings was directed in the first case and an
acquittal in the second. In another more recent British Columbia Provincial

[Page 501]

Court judgment, R. v. Haukness[25], in which the aforementioned two cases
were considered as well as Ormerod and Chernecki, an acquittal
was also entered on a direct recognition of entrapment as a defence, the Court
saying that “notwithstanding [the accused’s] commission [of the drug] offence,
it would be contrary to the principles of the administration of justice in this
country to convict him”. Having indicated that I prefer to leave open the
question whether entrapment, if established, should operate as a defence I
express no view on the approach taken in the Haukness case. Similarly, I
leave open the question whether the appropriate way to deal with entrapment is
by a stay of proceedings, a matter considered by this Court in another context
in R. v. Rourke[26]. In
the present case, although the factum of the accused mentions stay of
proceedings, his counsel did not press the point, nor did he found any of his
submissions on any issue of admissibility of evidence. His main, indeed, sole
point was that entrapment should have been left to the jury because the
evidence showed a police‑concocted plan to ensnare him going beyond mere
solicitation.

I do not think that the evidence is open to such
a view. Although the trial judge’s charge is confusing on what is meant by
entrapment, the accused cannot complain of the withdrawal of entrapment as a
defence (assuming it to be a defence, if established by a preponderance of
evidence) if there was no evidence upon which it could be based.

The accused was found by the Metropolitan
Toronto police to be in possession of heroin and was arrested by them. He made
certain statements to the police, including assertions that he worked as an
undercover agent, as an informer in fact, for the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. The state-

[Page 502]

ments were admitted in evidence after a voir
dire as to their admissibility. He told the Toronto police that the R.C.M.P. were unaware that he had bought the heroin
and unaware that he was going to sell it. When taken to the police station he
was found in possession of cocaine as well as heroin. Upon his release from
custody and while awaiting trial, the accused had several conversations with
members of the Toronto police force about acting as a paid informer but nothing
came of it.

The accused was a drug addict, and this was
known to the R.C.M.P. and to a particular officer of that force, one Gascon. He
had been used by the force on various occasions as a decoy and informer to
ferret out information on drug pushing in the Montreal area, and this involved him, according to his evidence, in
purchasing drugs with money supplied by the R.C.M.P. and in selling drugs as
well. He reported these activities to his R.C.M.P. contact. It was also
Kirzner’s evidence that he told Gascon of a chance encounter with a person in
the illegal drug trade through whom he could set up a big “buy” and that Gascon
agreed to the plan. Gascon was on vacation when the chance for the “buy”
arrived, but the accused went ahead on his own and consummated the deal,
although it was by no means clear that he was under instruction by Gascon to go
ahead in the latter’s absence. It was in respect of this “buy” of heroin that
the accused was arrested. Gascon’s evidence was that the accused had not told
him that he was selling drugs as well as buying them. He was used by the
R.C.M.P. as a paid informer even after his arrest, but this was not an unusual
practice of the R.C.M.P. in their use of informers.

I fail to see how this evidence, taking it most
favourably to the accused, shows entrapment in respect of the offences
committed by the accused. To me it is obvious that he saw his police contacts
as a shield for activities which he carried out on his own, activities
amounting to trafficking in drugs. He had initiated a transaction which he
carried out for his own benefit.

[Page 503]

In the result, while not agreeing with the
reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal, I come to the same conclusion and would
dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz
and Pratte JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—As the Chief Justice says in reasons
which I have had the advantage of reading, the sole point raised by counsel for
the accused at the hearing was that entrapment should have been left to the
jury because the evidence showed a police-concocted plan to ensnare him going
beyond mere solicitation. I agree that the evidence is not open to such a view
and that accordingly the accused cannot complain on that account although the
trial judge’s charge was confusing. Without expressing an opinion on any other
question, I concur in the disposition of the case proposed by the Chief
Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Testimony of
accomplices—Other witnesses not accomplices—Judge’s duty to warn jury.

Respondent, who is president of the Quebec
Federation of Labour, was charged with mischief for remarks he made during a
union meeting. The Crown claims that respondent suggested acts of sabotage and
vandalism for the purpose of making a slowdown effective. The day after the
meeting such acts were in fact committed.

The prosecution’s evidence was given entirely
by members of the local union, most of whom had been apprehended for the
activities that took place the day after the meeting. The trial judge did not
warn against the danger of convicting respondent on the uncorroborated evidence
of accomplices. Respondent was convicted by the jury and appealed his
conviction. Two of the three judges who heard the appeal held that the trial
judge had erred in failing to give the warning to the jury and ordered a new
trial. The third member of the Court did not deal with this issue, but would
have allowed the appeal on another ground, which was not raised in this Court.
This Court has only to resolve the issue of law upon which leave to appeal was
granted, namely, whether the Court of Appeal erred in holding that where the
majority but not all of the witnesses of a fact are accomplices, the trial
judge is required to warn the jury against the danger of accepting their
testimony.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

This Court recognized in Horsburgh, [1967]
S.C.R. 747, and it is now settled law that in a criminal trial, where a person
who is an accomplice gives evidence on behalf of the Crown, it is the duty of
the judge to warn the jury that, although they may convict upon his evidence,
it is dangerous to do so unless it is corroborated.

[Page 1008]

Without disputing the validity of this rule,
appellant contends that it applies only if the Crown’s case depends solely upon
the evidence of one or more accomplices, and that if there are other witnesses,
not accomplices, who give like evidence, the evidence of the accomplice or
accomplices is corroborated and the warning becomes unnecessary. The
authorities cited by appellant do not support this contention. Whenever the
Crown tenders as a part of its case against the accused the evidence of a
person who is an accomplice, it becomes the duty of the trial judge to warn the
jury that it is dangerous to convict upon uncorroborated evidence. This the
trial judge failed to do in the case at bar.

Horsburgh v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 747, followed; Brunet v. The King, [1928]
S.C.R. 375; Vigeant v. The King, [1930] S.C.R. 396; Lopatinsky
v. The King, [1948] S.C.R. 220, distinguished; Boulianne v.
The King, [1931] S.C.R. 621, referred to.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec[1]
setting aside the conviction of the accused and ordering a new trial.
Appeal dismissed.

Gérard Girouard, for the appellant.

Philip Cutler, Q.C, and Jacques Fortin,
for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This appeal is brought, with leave
of this Court, upon the following question of law:

Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that
where the majority but not all of the witnesses of a fact are accomplices, the
trial judge is required to warn the jury against the danger of accepting their
testimony?

The respondent was at all material times
president of the Quebec Federation of Labour (Fédération des travailleurs du
Québec). On the evening of 29th May, 1974, he was in l’Assomption to attend a
meeting of a local of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, a union affiliated with his federation. This meeting had been called
to give him an opportunity to explain the advantages of affiliation with the
federation and the use to which the dues paid to it

[Page 1009]

were put. The meeting became, however, confused
with one called to consider a dispute between Hupp Canada Ltd. and its
employees, members of the local union, arising from the refusal of the company
to raise wages to compensate for the increase in the cost of living.

The respondent was of the opinion that, in view
of the terms of the collective agreement between the company and its employees,
the refusal to increase wages was not a ground for a legal strike and so warned
those at the meeting. It was suggested that, instead of a strike, there might
be a slowdown. Questions were asked as to how a slowdown might be made
effective, and it was in reply to these questions that the respondent was
alleged to have suggested acts of sabotage and vandalism. The very next day,
such acts were in fact committed. It is not suggested that the respondent
personally took any part in these acts.

The evidence adduced by the Crown as to what was
said by the respondent at the meeting was given entirely by members of the
local union. Most, though not all of these, had been apprehended by the police
as the result of the activities in the Hupp Canada plant the day following the
meeting and had implicated the respondent as the result of questions put to them
by the police.

The respondent, who alone testified for the
defence, gave his own version of what happened at the meeting. He stated that
he had advised the union members to attempt to negotiate with their employer on
a reasonable basis and had suggested that it was only if negotiations should
fail that they should try other means, such as a slowdown. He acknowledged
that, in reply to questions put to him from the floor, he had made some
suggestions as to how slowdowns were made effective but denied that he had at
any time advocated damage to property.

In his charge to the jury the trial judge did
not warn against the danger of convicting the respondent on the uncorroborated
evidence of accomplices. The respondent was convicted.

[Page 1010]

The respondent appealed his conviction to the
Court of Appeal. Two of the three judges who heard the appeal held that the
trial judge had erred in failing to give the warning to the jury and ordered a
new trial. The third member of the Court did not deal with this issue. He would
have allowed the appeal on another ground, but his view was not shared by the
majority of the Court. We are concerned on this appeal only with the one issue
of law upon which leave was granted.

Dealing with that issue, Montgomery J.A., who
delivered the reasons of the majority, had this to say:

There remains the question as to whether
the warning was required, in view of the fact that this testimony was not the
only evidence against Appellant. I find nothing in the authorities to suggest
that the application of the rule should be thus restricted. I can understand
that, where the remaining evidence is sufficiently strong, it may be a matter
of no particular consequence that the warning has not been given, but here the
majority of those who testified as to what was said at the meeting were
accomplices. The rule is stated by Martland J., in the Horsburgh case,
in the following terms (at p. 754):

“It is now settled law that in a criminal
trial, where a person who is an accomplice, gives evidence on behalf of the
prosecution, it is the duty of the judge to warn the jury that, although they
may convict upon his evidence, it is dangerous to do so unless it is
corroborated.”

Ritchie, J., for the minority, cited (at
p. 767) the rule as given by Lord Abinger in R. v. Farler (1837), 8
Car. and P. 106, at p. 107:

“It is a practice which deserves all the
reverence of law, that judges have uniformly told juries that they ought not to
pay any respect to the testimony of an accomplice, unless the accomplice is
corroborated in some material circumstance.”

Further on (at p. 773), he put the
rule as follows:

“The well-known rule concerning the
evidence of accomplices was stated in this Court by Anglin C.J.C. in Vigeant
v. The King, [1930] S.C.R. 396, where it was recognized as a rule of law
that where an accomplice has given evidence the Judge must first instruct the
jury as to what in law constitutes an accomplice and then proceed to tell them
that although they are at liberty to do so, it is dangerous to convict on the
uncorroborated evidence of such witnesses.”

[Page 1011]

In my opinion, a substantial number of
those witnesses who testified as to what was said at the meeting were
accomplices and the trial Judge was required to warn the jury against the
dangers of accepting their testimony. This he failed to do, and for this reason
the conviction cannot stand. I express no opinion as to whether there was in
fact corroboration; this will be a matter for a jury to decide.

I am in agreement with the conclusions of
Montgomery J.A. In my opinion the issue before us is settled by the views
stated in the Horsburgh[2] case,
which, on this question, were unanimous.

The contention of the appellant is that, while
recognizing the existence of the rule, it was not incumbent on the trial judge
to give the warning to the jury because the Crown’s case did not depend only
upon the evidence of the accomplices, since there were other witnesses, who
were not accomplices, who also testified as to the statements of the respondent
at the meeting. In other words, it is submitted that the rule only applies if
the Crown’s case rests solely upon the evidence of one or more accomplices. If,
it is said there are other witnesses, not accomplices, who give like evidence,
the evidence of the accomplice is corroborated and the warning becomes
unnecessary.

In support of this proposition the appellant
relies upon quotations from reasons delivered in three cases in this Court. The
first of these is Brunet v. The King[3],
where Smith J., said at p. 381:

As stated, there seems to be no case in
which it is explicitly laid down that the warning must be given where there is
some corroborative evidence to go to the jury, but I think it necessarily
follows from the principle laid down in the cases referred to, where the evidence
of the accomplice is necessary to sustain the conviction and the corroborative
evidence may or may not be accepted as sufficient by the jury.

This passage, cited in the appellant’s factum,
is an excerpt from a paragraph in which this quotation is preceded by these
words:

It seems clear, therefore, that there was
in fact no admissible corroborative evidence to be submitted to the

[Page 1012]

jury, and that it was the undoubted duty of
the learned judge to have given the warning. It is not, however, to be taken
that the warning would have been unnecessary had there been some corroborative
evidence proper to be submitted to the jury. It is for the jury to say whether
or not the corroborative evidence is to be believed, and if it is not believed
by the jury, and yet they convict, no warning having been given, they are
convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the accomplice without having been
warned of the danger of doing so.

Read as a whole, the passage does not support
the appellant’s contention.

Reference was made to a statement of Anglin
C.J.C., who delivered the judgment of the Court in Vigeant v. The King[4], at p. 400:

He should then proceed to instruct the jury
that, if they concluded that the witness was, at any stage of the proceedings,
an accomplice in the crime charged against the defendants, there would be
danger in convicting them of that crime upon his evidence standing alone and
uncorroborated; that the law does not preclude their doing so—indeed, they are
at liberty to do so—but that there is danger in basing a conviction on such
uncorroborated evidence. If, after this warning, the jury had faith enough in
the evidence given by the accomplice to convict, their verdict will not be set
aside. The jury should not be told to acquit the prisoner; but they should be
warned of the danger of convicting. Rex v. Boycal (1920), 31 Que. K.B.
391. Where there has been failure so to charge a jury with regard to the
uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice the conviction must be quashed. Gouin
v. The King, [1926] Can. S.C.R. 539; Brunet v. The King, [1928] Can. S.C.R. 375.

The appellant stresses the use of the words
“standing alone”, but Chief Justice Anglin was not discussing the circumstances
in which the warning must be given. He was stating what the trial judge should
tell the jury if a witness is an accomplice. The word “alone” is used in
conjunction with the words “and uncorroborated”. He is referring to the
evidence of an accomplice tendered without corroboration. He is not confining
the application of the rule to a case in which the accomplice is the only
witness.

[Page 1013]

In this connection it may be noted that in the
following year in Boulianne v. The King[5],
a case involving the evidence of an accomplice, Chief Justice Anglin, at
p. 623, said:

We should add that we entirely disagree
with the view of Mr. Justice Hall that the rule requiring warning does not
apply where there is, in fact, corroboration. The rule applies equally whether
there be or be not corroborative evidence of the testimony of an accomplice.

The third case cited in support of the
appellant’s argument is Lopatinsky v. The King[6]. It was pointed out that in that
case this Court sustained the conviction of the accused and that it was a case
in which two other witnesses besides the accomplice had given evidence
implicating the accused. The case is not of assistance to the appellant’s
submission. The trial had been by a judge alone, without a jury. The trial
judge did not record his reasons for convicting the accused. Estey J., who delivered
the reasons of the Court for refusing the appeal by the accused, based his
decision on the following grounds:

The learned trial Judge did not record his
reasons upon which he founded his verdict of guilty and it may be that he did
not direct himself upon the foregoing points with that precision which the law
contemplates. However, the facts and circumstances of this case are such that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred within the
meaning of section 1014 of the Criminal Code.

I do not regard the authorities cited on behalf
of the appellant as supporting the proposition that the warning in respect of
the evidence of an accomplice need not be given if there is other evidence
apart from that of the accomplice which could support a conviction. In my
opinion if the Crown in a criminal trial tenders as a part of its case against
the accused the evidence of a person who is an accomplice, it becomes the duty
of the trial judge to warn the jury that, although they may convict upon his
evidence, it is dangerous to do so unless it is corroborated.

I would dimiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Accused charged with conspiring
to traffic in MDA, trafficking in MDA and having MDA in possession for purpose
of trafficking—Appeal by Crown against acquittals on first and third counts and
appeal by accused against conviction on second count—Conspiracy appeal
dismissed—Conviction of accused set aside and acquittal entered because
evidence disclosed accused trafficked in salt of MDA but not in MDA itself—Application
to amend third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA for purpose of
trafficking—Amendment allowed and new trial ordered on third count as
amended—Whether Court of Appeal erred in amending third count—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 529, 610, 613(8).

The appellant and another were tried on an
indictment containing three counts, namely, (1) conspiring to traffic in a
restricted drug, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA); (2) trafficking in MDA, and
(3) having MDA in possession for the purpose of trafficking. They were both
acquitted of the conspiracy charge, the appellant alone was convicted on the
second charge of trafficking but he was subsequently acquitted on the third
charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking, the acquittal being based
on the application by the trial judge of res judicata and of the
principle in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.
Proceedings against his co-accused on the third count were stayed.

The Crown appealed the acquittals on counts 1
and 3, and the accused appealed his conviction on count 2. The conspiracy
appeal was dismissed. On the appellant’s appeal from his conviction of
trafficking in MDA, the conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered
because the evidence disclosed that the accused trafficked in a salt of MDA but
not in MDA itself. The Court concluded that since the Crown had charged the

[Page 394]

appellant with trafficking in a specific
drug, MDA, proof of MDA was an essential element of the offence. The Court
rejected the contention that the relevant provisions of the statute, the Food
and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27, listing among the restricted
drugs “MDA or any salt thereof” embraced any salt of MDA in a charge that
specified MDA only. McIntyre J.A., speaking for the majority of the Court,
considered that an amendment to the indictment, even after the hearing of the
appeal, would have been appropriate. However, an amendment was not sought and
the Court decided that an acquittal had to be entered.

When the Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of
the appellant on the third count of possession for the purpose of trafficking
came on for hearing the Court was differently constituted. The Crown, on the
appeal, applied to amend the third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA
for the purpose of trafficking. The Court allowed the amendment, allowed the
Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittal and directed a new trial on the third
count as amended. From that judgment the appellant appealed to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: The only issue before this
Court on the present appeal was whether the Court of Appeal exceeded its powers
when it amended the third count of the indictment in such fashion as to conform
to the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in that
count as originally drawn, upon which the appellant had been acquitted. Having
regard to the extensive activities which the appellant was found to have been
conducting in the manufacture of MDA hydrochloride, it could not be suggested
that the appellant was in any way misled by the fact that that salt was not
mentioned in the particulars. He knew in any event that he was being charged
with possession of a restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking.

In directing a new trial, MacLean J.A.
incorporated the amendment to the information in his order as he felt that the
ends of justice required him to do. In granting this order the Court of Appeal
was acting pursuant to the provisions of s. 613(4)(b) and (8) of
the Criminal Code. The appellant’s contention that the order for a new
trial could not have been made unless the amendment had been granted and that
the amendment was therefore not an order “in addition” to the exercise of

[Page 395]

the court’s power under subs. (4)(b)(i),
but rather that it was a prerequisite to the granting of a new trial, was not
accepted. When Parliament authorized the Court of Appeal, in the exercise of
its power, to order a new trial, to “make any order, in addition, which justice
requires” it must be taken as having authorized that Court under those
circumstances to make any additional order which the ends of justice
require whether the order for a new trial is dependent upon the additional
order or not.

Since, in view of the evidence, the ends of
justice required the amendment which was here granted, it followed that it was
unnecessary to express any view as to the submission that the authority of the Court
of Appeal to grant an amendment stems from the provisions of s. 610(3) of
the Code which authorize the court to exercise powers “that may be
exercised by the court on appeals in civil matters…”.

As to s. 529 of the Code, which
bears the heading “Amending defective indictment or count”, the only mandatory
language in that section is contained in subs. (1) which provides for “an
objection to an indictment or to a count in an indictment for a defect apparent
on the face thereof” and requires such objection to be taken before plea or
thereafter by leave of the court or a judge. In the present case there was no
defect apparent on the face of the indictment and this
subsection accordingly had no application to the present circumstances.
There was no other language in the section which could be read as
curtailing the power of the Court of Appeal to make an order under
s. 613(8) which has the effect of amending the indictment so as to conform
to the evidence where the ends of justice require it.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ., dissenting: Three issues were
raised by the order of the Court of Appeal in this case: (i) whether a Court of
Appeal has power to amend an indictment; (ii) if so, whether that power can be
exercised so as to provide a basis for ordering a new trial; and (iii) whether
a Court of Appeal has power to substitute a charge different from the one laid
and upon which the appeal has proceeded. There was nothing in the case law, and
certainly nothing in the applicable legislation to authorize a court of appeal
to do what the British Columbia Court of Appeal did in this case, namely,
substitute a charge of a different offence, something which the trial judge
himself could not do under the wide amending powers given to him under
s. 529 of the Criminal Code.

The view that s. 610(3) of the Code confers
power upon a court of appeal to amend an indictment could not be accepted. That
section takes its context from the preceding provisions of s. 610
which concern evidentiary

[Page 396]

questions. The opening words of
s. 610(3) show its limited range; they provide that “a court of appeal may
exercise… any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that may be
exercised… on appeals in civil matters”. The subsection cannot, therefore,
be read as if it was a detached and separate provision. Still less can
s. 610(3) be relied upon to authorize a court of appeal to substitute a
different charge from the one on which the case came before it.

As to s. 613(8), the provision for “any
order, in addition, that justice requires” is sequential to the exercise of the
power to order a new trial under s. 613(4). It does not enable a court of
appeal to make an order upon which to found a direction for a new trial; and
certainly not when that order does not relate to the charge on which the
accused has been acquitted and to an error of law in respect of that charge.
This is obvious when reference is had, as it must be, to s. 605(1)(a)
upon which the Crown must base its right to appeal an acquittal. Assuming,
however, that s. 613(8) gives a court of appeal a wider power than that
which its terms appear to confer when considered alongside s. 613(4) and
s. 605(1)(a), the relevant question here was whether the
words “make any order, in addition, that justice requires” empower the Court of
Appeal to direct a new trial on a different offence from that on which the
appeal was taken.

There was here a usurpation of the function
of the Attorney-General and of the Crown. It is for them to decide, the
existing charge not being proved, whether to lay the different charge which the
Court felt should have been brought against the accused. It is not for a Court
to take an ad hominem view in a case like the present one and to do
violence to the separate functions of Court and Crown lest a person guilty of
an offence, but not the one charged, escape punishment.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia granting leave to amend the indictment and allowing the

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—This case
raises an important issue in the administration of the criminal law. The issue,
briefly stated, is whether a court, in particular an appellate court, has the
power to raise a charge against an accused and to direct that he be tried on
that charge, not being the one laid or sought to be laid by the Crown and not
being an included offence in that respect. I should have thought that the
answer must be emphatically “no”, but the British
 Columbia Court of Appeal resolved the issue in the
affirmative under what, in my view, was a misconception of the problem that it
faced. A recital of the facts makes this clear.

The appellant and another were tried on an
indictment containing three counts, namely, (1) conspiring to traffic in a
restricted drug, methylenedioxyamphetamine, more conveniently called MDA; (2)
trafficking in MDA, and (3) having MDA in possession for the purpose of
trafficking. They were both acquitted of the conspiracy charge, the appellant
alone was convicted on the second charge of trafficking but he was subsequently
acquitted on the third charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking, the
acquittal being based on an application by the trial judge of res judicata and
of the principle in Kienapple v. The Queen[1]. Proceedings against his co-accused
on the third count were stayed.

The Crown appealed the acquittals on counts 1
and 3, and the accused appealed his conviction on count 2. The conspiracy
appeal was dismissed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal on November 26,
1975, and is of no concern here. The appellant’s appeal from his conviction of
trafficking in MDA was heard on February 4 to 6, 1976, by a Bench composed of Maclean, Seaton and

[Page 398]

McIntyre JJ.A. The latter delivered the
principal judgment of the Court[2] on
March 26, 1976, whereby the conviction was set aside and an acquittal entered
because the evidence disclosed that the accused trafficked in a salt of MDA but
not in MDA itself. The Court concluded that since the Crown had charged the
appellant with trafficking in a specific drug, MDA, proof of MDA was an
essential element of the offence. The Court rejected the contention that the
relevant provisions of the statute, the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. F-27, listing among the restricted drugs “MDA or any salt thereof”,
embraced any salt of MDA in a charge that specified MDA only. In its opinion,
the trial judge had erred in making interchangeable references to MDA and salt
of MDA.

McIntyre J.A. concluded his reasons for judgment
as follows:

This is a case where in my view an
amendment to the indictment, even after the hearing of the appeal, would have
been appropriate. Had the Crown sought an amendment I would have been disposed
to allow it. However, no application having been made I feel obliged for the
reasons given above to consider that this appeal should be allowed and an
acquittal entered.

Seaton J.A., who wrote brief concurring reasons,
noted that although the expert evidence was to the effect that MDA and salt of
MDA were the same drug, a view accepted by the trial judge, the question was
one of law turning on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Food
and Drugs Act, and particularly Schedule H. Under the Act they were not the
same drug, and since the Crown did not seek an amendment, an acquittal had to
be entered.

The issue now before this Court arises from the
disposition by the British Columbia Court of Appeal of the Crown’s appeal
against the acquittal of the appellant on the third count, namely, possession
for the purpose of trafficking. In approaching

[Page 399]

the issue, I take no position on the correctness
of the decision of the Court of Appeal that the Narcotic Control Act created
two distinct offences, one relating to MDA and the other to a salt of MDA. That
differentiation must stand for present purposes. The appeal by the Crown from
the acquittal of the appellant on the third count of possession for the purpose
of trafficking came on for hearing on May 12, 1976, some six weeks after the
provincial Court of Appeal had disposed of the appellant’s appeal on the second
count favourably to him. The Court was differently constituted, consisting of
Maclean, McFarlane and Branca JJ.A. The Crown, on the appeal, applied to
“amend” the third count to charge possession of a salt of MDA for the purpose
of trafficking. In short reasons with which the other members of the Court agreed,
Maclean J.A. allowed the “amendment”, allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the
acquittal and directed a new trial on the third count as amended. He said only
this:

In my view the ends of justice require that
the amendment in this case be granted and in my view no substantial wrong would
be suffered thereby by the accused person.

It is thus clear that judges of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal who made up the different Benches that heard the
appeals on the second and third counts were in no doubt of the Court’s power to
“amend” an indictment so as to charge a different offence from the one on which
the accused was tried. This is not the view of my brother Ritchie, whose
reasons in this appeal I have had the advantage of reading, because he speaks
not of an “amendment” to charge a different offence but of an amendment “to
conform to the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in
[the third] count as originally drawn”. Since for the purposes of this case, as
I have already noted, it must be taken that the specification of a particular
drug in the charge made proof thereof an essential element of the offence, the
substitution in the wording of the charge of another drug amounts to a charge
of a different offence, even though the other essential elements, namely,
possession for the purpose of

[Page 400]

trafficking, are the same in either situation.
Indeed, counsel for the Crown conceded that in this case he must accept as a
fact that different offences were involved in the indictment as laid and as
altered by the Court of Appeal.

Does then a court of appeal have the power to
order an accused to be retried on a different charge from that originally laid
and different from that on which he was originally tried? It is one thing to
amend, so as to rectify an imperfect charge or indictment of an offence where
the charge or indictment is not itself a nullity; it is another thing to
substitute a charge of a different offence. Supplying an omitted essential
averment of a charge which is clearly indicated is one thing; changing a charge
to allege a different offence is something else.

II

Three issues are raised by the order of the
court of appeal in the present case. They are, first, whether a court of appeal
has power to amend an indictment; second, if so, whether that power can be
exercised so as to provide a basis for ordering a new trial; and third, whether
a court of appeal has power to substitute a charge different from the one laid
and upon which the appeal has proceeded. I think it relevant to these issues to
begin with a consideration of the powers of a trial judge to amend an
indictment.

Those powers are now set out in s. 529 of
the Criminal Code. It is unnecessary in this case to trace its history,
other than to note that it goes back not only to the original Criminal Code of
1892 (see s. 723) but beyond that Code to the Criminal Procedure
Act, 1869 (Can.), c. 29, s. 70. Although there was originally
some doubt whether the power to amend extended beyond the amendment of formal
defects, statutory clarification and ensuing judicial decisions settled that
question in favour of an extended power, including a power to supply an
essential averment of the offence charged as well as power to make changes in
the assertions of the charge to conform with the evi-

[Page 401]

dence as to any such details: see R. v.
Lacelle[3]; R.
v. Kerr[4];
Yanovitch v. The Queen[5]. Wide
as was the power to amend reposed in the trial judge, it did not extend to
authorize him to substitute an offence different from the one charged. This was
asserted more than fifty years ago in the Kerr case, supra, at
p. 231, where Meredith C.J.O. said, referring to the provision for
amendment of an indictment that “[it] does not, of course, authorize an
amendment which substitutes a different offence for that intended to be charged
or the addition of other offences”. The same view was taken more recently by
the Quebec Court of Appeal in Dupont v. The Queen[6], at p. 390, and re-affirmed by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Elliott[7], at p. 237. An earlier
authority to the same effect is R. v. Cohen[8].

I am not unmindful of s. 496 of the Criminal
Code which relates to the preferring of an indictment by the Crown and to
the inclusion of counts of offences disclosed by the evidence taken on the
preliminary inquiry, even if the accused was not committed for trial thereon.
Although this provision does not touch the powers of the trial judge, it
indicates that it is left to the prosecution to determine, in the defined
circumstances, whether to add or substitute a charge other than that set out in
the information. The farthest that the courts have gone in respect of the
substitution of offences is to permit the Crown to ask for an amendment to that
effect of an information upon which an accused has elected trial before a
magistrate but in such case the accused must be allowed to re-elect: see R.
v. Hollman[9]. I
do not pass on the correctness of this view of a court’s power. The substance
of the matter appears to be a withdrawal of one information by the Crown and
the laying of another, and

[Page 402]

this is open to the Crown in respect of
indictments.

Coming then to the powers of a court of appeal
in respect of amendments or substitutions, I find no provision of the Criminal
Code which gives a court of appeal greater powers in these respects than
are given to a trial judge; and, indeed, there is no provision which expressly
gives any power relating to indictments to a court of appeal. Neither Bench of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal discussed or even referred to any
provision of the Criminal Code which supported the power it asserted,
but during the argument before this Court ss. 610 and 613(8) as well as
s. 529 were brought to the fore.

I shall deal first with s. 610 which reads
as follows:

610. (1) For
the purposes of an appeal under this Part the court of appeal may, where it
considers it in the interests of justice,

(a) order the production of
any writing, exhibit, or other thing connected with the proceedings;

(b) order any witness who
would have been a compellable witness at the trial, whether or not he was
called at the trial,

(i) to attend and be examined before the
court of appeal, or

(ii) to be examined in the manner provided
by rules of court before a judge of the court of appeal, or before any officer
of the court of appeal or justice of the peace or other person appointed by the
court of appeal for the purpose;

(c) admit, as evidence, an
examination that is taken Under subparagraph (b)(ii);

(d) receive the evidence, if
tendered, of any witness, including the appellant, who is a competent but not
compellable witness;

(e) order that any question
arising on the appeal that

(i) involves prolonged examination of
writings or accounts, or scientific or local investigation, and

(ii) cannot in the opinion of the court of
appeal conveniently be inquired into before the court of appeal,

be referred for inquiry and report, in the
manner provided by rules of court, to a special commissioner appointed by the
court of appeal; and

[Page 403]

f) act upon
the report of a commissioner who is appointed under paragraph (e) in so
far as/the court of appeal thinks fit to do so.

(2) In proceedings under this
section the parties or their counsel are entitled to examine or
cross-examine witnesses and, in an inquiry under paragraph (1)(e), are
entitled to be present during the inquiry and to adduce evidence and to be
heard.

(3) A court of appeal may exercise in
relation to proceedings in the court any powers not mentioned in
subsection (1) that may be exercised by the court on appeals in civil
matters, and may issue any process that is necessary to enforce the orders or
sentences of the court but no costs shall be allowed to the appellant or
respondent on the hearing and determination of an appeal or on any proceedings
preliminary or incidental thereto.

(4) Any process that is issued by the court
of appeal under this section may be executed anywhere in Canada.

Although I have reproduced the entire
section for context, the only terms thereof relevant here are the opening
words of subs. (3), namely “A court of appeal may exercise in relation to
proceedings in the court any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that
may be exercised by the court on appeals in civil matters…”. Section 610 first
appeared as s. 1021(1) of the Criminal Code, enacted by 1923
(Can.), c. 41, s. 9, and was taken from s. 9 of the English
Criminal Appeal Act, 1907 (U.K.), c. 23. The concern of the English
Courts with this provision does not appear to have gone beyond reliance on it
to permit fresh evidence to be admitted on appeal: see R. v. Robinson[10]. A similar provision was at issue
in the New South Wales case of R. v. Burns[11] to support the power of an appellate court
to amend an indictment. In that case an indictment charged the accused with
obtaining a travel document by a false pretence to one N with intent to
defraud, but the evidence did not show a false pretence to N but rather to
another, and it was held that the provision was not ample enough to empower an
appellate court to make the amendment. Although dissenting on the ground that
there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in the conviction of
the accused, Chief

[Page 404]

Justice Cullen was nonetheless of the same
opinion as his colleagues in declaring that the provision comparable to our now
s. 610(3) did not enable an appellate court to make an amendment to an
indictment which had been finally dealt with by the trial judge; and he added
(at p. 356): “so drastic a power, if it had been the intention of the
Legislature to confer it, one would expect to have seen expressed in plain
words”.

Section 610(3) was considered in a series of
British Columbia cases, which I wish to examine. R. v. Danyleyko[12] may be put to one side because
there the British Columbia Court of Appeal sitting as the Yukon Territory Court
of Appeal relied on s. 610(3) and on the provincial Court of Appeal Act
to support its right to send a stated case back to a magistrate for
amendment; it does not, therefore, touch the issue in question here. In R. v.
McNutt[13], an
issue arose as to proof of the territorial jurisdiction of a magistrate under
an indictment charging an assault in place H whereas it occurred in place W,
both being within the territorial jurisdiction. No amendment was made or sought
before the magistrate. A new trial was ordered by the majority in view of the
course of the proceedings below (the dissenting judge concluded that
territorial jurisdiction had not been proved) but Davey J.A. in obiter also
adverted to what is now s. 610(3) as being broad enough to empower the
Court of Appeal to make an amendment to prevent a miscarriage of justice. This
statement was induced, however, by doubt whether the British Columbia Court of
Appeal was right in an earlier case, R. v. More and Melville[14] (Davey J.A. being a member of the
Court), which held that an allegation of the commission of an offence at a
defined place was an essential averment, and where the evidence showed its
commission at a different place and no amendment was made at trial, the Court
of Appeal could not itself amend but must quash the conviction. However, it was
held that it was open to the Court to order a new

[Page 405]

trial in the interests of justice, and it would
be for the trial judge to decide whether an amendment was necessary and, if so,
whether it should be made. In the McNutt case, Wilson J.A. was content
to apply the More and Melville case in this respect while also agreeing
with Davey J.A. that a new trial was warranted in McNutt because of the
course of proceedings there.

Among the authorities relied on in the More
and Melville case was R. v. Austin[15]
where the Ontario Court of Appeal held that on a charge of robbing a named
person, proof that the person robbed was the one named was essential, and in
the absence of an amendment at trial to make the indictment conform to the
evidence the Court of Appeal could not remedy the defect because it had no
power to amend, and consequently an acquittal must be entered. There was no
such additional ground in the Austin case as there was in the More
and Melville case to warrant a new trial; there was simply failure of proof
at trial of an essential averment, and the Court of Appeal did not think it
should enter the lists and do for the Crown what it was open to it to do and
what it failed to do for itself, namely, seek an amendment at trial.

This brings me to the later judgment of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt[16], in which the force of R. v.
More and Melville was eroded and in which the majority of the five-man
Bench concluded that (to use the words of Davey J.A. at p. 39) “this Court
may in appropriate cases exercise the powers of amendment conferred by the Code
upon trial Judges” but it was a power to be exercised with greatest care.
Davey J.A. did not himself indicate the provisions of the Criminal Code giving
this asserted power to a court of appeal. It is clear from his words that he
was purporting to exercise the

[Page 406]

powers of a trial court under what is now
s. 529. At the same time, he based his conclusion on adoption of the
reasons of Wilson J.A. who invoked what is now s. 610(3), pointing out
that there was no reference to that provision in the More and Melville case,
and holding that s. 529 did not extend to a court of appeal. I should say
at this point that the decision in Wixalbrown and Schmidt cannot be
justified by reliance on s. 529 which, by its own words, is restricted to
matters at trial. It is included in Part XVII of the Criminal Code—Procedure
by Indictment—while the powers of the Court of Appeal are set out in Part
XVIII—Appeals—Indictable Offences—and there is no incorporating reference.

What Davey J.A. said on the question of a court
of appeal’s power to amend, speaking also for Bird and Tysoe JJ.A., with
Sheppard J.A. dissenting on this point, was an alternative ground of decision,
having regard to the facts of the case. The two accused were charged with
breaking and entering certain premises at a specified time and committing an
indictable offence, to wit, theft. The charge was laid under what is now
s. 306(1)(b) (then s. 292(1)(b)) which concluded
with the word “therein” in defining the offence but that word was not included
in the indictment nor was objection taken to the omission at the trial which
proceeded on the basis that the alleged theft was committed in the specified
premises. The word “therein” had been included in the information upon which
the preliminary inquiry was conducted which resulted in the committal for
trial. On appeal from conviction, counsel for the accused took for the first
time two objections; first, that there were no or no sufficient particulars of
the alleged offence of theft, as was a requisite under s. 492, (now
s. 510) and, second, that the omission of the word “therein” was an
omission of an essential averment and hence the accused was convicted of an
offence not known to the law.

Davey J.A. disposed of the first objection by
agreeing that if theft alone had been charged the indictment would have been
fatally defective (rely-

[Page 407]

ing on Brodie v. The King[17], at p. 199), but theft being
alleged as part of a compound offence and there being sufficient particularity
to enable the accused to meet the charge, the objection failed. As to the
second objection, the omission of the word “therein” from the indictment, Davey
J.A. took alternative positions. He held, first, that as a matter of context
(purporting to distinguish this Court’s judgment in McNeil v. The
King[18], with,
in my opinion, questionable success) there was not an omission of an essential
averment but rather an imperfect allegation of such an averment which caused no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. His alternative position, agreeing
for this purpose that there was omission of an essential averment, was that in
principle (to quote him, at p. 39),

…no person ought to stand convicted or be
imprisoned on a charge that totally omits an essential averment required to
constitute an offence known to the law. That in itself is a substantial wrong.
I can see no difference in principle between a conviction for a charge that
lacks one averment necessary to constitute a crime, and a conviction for one
that is totally unknown to the law. To allow the former to stand would open the
door to grave abuses, the end of which cannot be foreseen.

He went on to say, however, that “that objection
can be met by amendment if we have the power”. He concluded, as I have already
noted, that a court of appeal “may in appropriate cases exercise the powers of
amendment conferred by the Code upon trial Judges”. He did not say whence
comes this power—it could only be given by statute—and I can only infer from
Davey J.A.’s reliance on Wilson J.A.’s reasons that in Davey J.A.’s view it
derived from what is now s. 610(3) of the Criminal Code. However,
s. 610(3) speaks of the power of a court of appeal in civil matters and it
is impossible to find authorization in it for the exercise of powers conferred
by the Criminal Code upon trial judges.

[Page 408]

Sheppard J.A. met the issue of the omission of
an essential averment, to which no objection was taken at trial, by invoking
the principle laid down in R. v. Leclair[19], namely, that when an accused has
failed to move to quash before pleading to an indictment and has failed as well
to object during the trial, the Court of Appeal may refuse to allow him to
raise the matter there unless it is of opinion that the accused has been in
some way prejudiced or misled. In Leclair, although an essential
averment was omitted, the section of the Code under which the
offence was charged was referred to, and this, it seems to me, must have some
bearing on the statement of principle which, otherwise, would appear to
contradict Davey J.A.’s opinion, quoted above, that omission of an essential
averment itself is a substantial wrong. I do not need, however, to dwell on
this point here but pass to Sheppard J.A.’s observation on whether there is a
power in a court of appeal to amend an indictment. He said this on the point
(at p. 44):

The Court of Appeal has not power to make
the amendment of the indictment and conviction by adding the word “therein” as
requested by the Crown. By reason that Parliament has expressly conferred on
the trial Court the power to amend indictments subject to certain restrictions
(s. 510) [now s. 529] there is difficulty in construing other
sections of the Code as impliedly conferring upon another Court,
such as the Court of Appeal, the power to amend the indictment and conviction,
either subject to the same restrictions on the trial Court or without any
restriction. Moreover, the primary question for the Court of Appeal is whether
or riot substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred (s. 592(1)(b)(iii))
[now s. 613(1)(b)(iii)]; if not the appeal would be dismissed and
the matter thereby ended. If substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has
occurred the appeal would be allowed and the conviction quashed, with the
direction of an acquittal, or of a new trial (s. 592(2)) [now s. 613(2)].
Only in the event of a new trial would any amendment be required and the power
to make such amendment has been given to the trial Court where the accused
would have an opportunity to plead thereto and to meet the issue raised
thereby. It would follow that the Court of Appeal has not the power to amend
the indictment and conviction as requested for the Crown.

[Page 409]

I have reviewed the Wixalbrown and Schmidt case
at some length because it has spawned other decisions to the same effect on the
power to amend. Certain observations must be made about it. In the first place,
and central to the present case, it does not deal with the substitution of a
charge of a different offence from that sought to be alleged. Second, Wilson
J.A. did not say what Davey J.A. said he did. Wilson J.A. noted that a court of
appeal could not found a power to amend an indictment on the now s. 529,
that provision being limited to trial judges, but it could be founded on the
now s. 610(3) as giving the same power to amend as the Court of Appeal had
in civil cases.

I am unable to accept the view that
s. 610(3) confers any power upon a court of appeal to amend an indictment.
That subsection takes its context from the preceding provisions of
s. 610 which concern evidentiary questions. The opening words of
s. 610(3) show its limited range; they provide that “A court of appeal may
exercise… any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that may be
exercised… on appeals in civil matters”. The subsection cannot, therefore,
be read as if it was a detached and separate provision. Although Wilson J.A.
purported to find support for his view in this Court’s judgment in Kissick v.
The King[20], that
case was concerned with an issue as to admissibility of evidence and thus
related to the very subject-matter of s. 610. Still less can
s. 610(3) be relied upon to authorize a court of appeal to substitute a
different charge from the one on which the case came before it.

Wixalbrown and Schmidt was invoked by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v.
Breland and George[21], where
essential averments were omitted from a charge but no objection was taken at
trial. The majority judgment proceeded on alternative bases, relying, first, on
the principle of R. v. Leclair, supra, that where no objection is taken
at trial the accused will not be allowed to take it on appeal unless he has
been misled or prejudiced; and, second, on the principle allegedly

[Page 410]

derived from the judgment of Davey J.A. in Wixalbrown
and Schmidt that even if the accused has been misled or prejudiced, the
Court of Appeal may amend and affirm the conviction under s. 529 of the Criminal
Code if there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. I
have doubts whether Wixalbrown and Schmidt goes this far (and the
dissenting judgment of Whittaker J.A. supports my doubt), since Davey J.A. was
mistaken as to what Wilson J.A. said in that case but, in any event, I need not
pursue this because we are not dealing in the Breland and George case
with the substitution of a different charge but only with the perfection of an
imperfect one.

There is another line of cases represented by Morin
and Morin v. The Queen[22] and
by R. v. Pearson[23] which
take a strict approach against the Crown where an essential particular of a
charge is not proved and no application to amend is made by the Crown to the
trial judge. In the Morin case, there was a charge of illegal possession
of goods on a stated date but the evidence showed possession at a later date.
The Crown did not move to amend but a conviction was entered at trial. The
Quebec Court of Appeal held that the offence charged was not proved and that it
had no power to rectify the matter, citing R. v. Volaine[24]. This class of case differs from
those where an essential averment or some particular is omitted; the charge is
good in all respects but, as in the Volaine case, it alleges an offence
committed on a specific date and the evidence does not show any of the
prohibited acts to have been committed on that date. No rectification having
been effected at the trial, it was held in Volaine that the Court of
Appeal had no power to rectify the mistake, with the result that a conviction
on the charge could not stand and an acquittal had to be ordered.

[Page 411]

In the Pearson case, supra, there
was a variance as to the place of commission of an offence between the
statement in the charge and the evidence that was adduced but no application
was made to amend. On appeal, a majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal held
that the conviction must be quashed and an acquittal entered because the Court
of Appeal had no power to amend the charge to conform to the evidence. Owen
J.A. dissented in an extensive review of the authorities, preferring to follow
and to apply, in respect of a variance as to the place of commission of an
offence, a line of cases, having their source in English case law, holding that
a variance as to date was not fatal to a conviction because the place, like the
date, was not an essential averment, and since the accused was not misled or
prejudiced the conviction should stand. He added this (at p. 26):

In view of this conclusion, I do not deem
it necessary to discuss whether this Court, in the present case, had the power
to amend the indictment so as to conform with the proof.

One further point may be noted, arising from the
judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. Christiansen[25]. That Court was unanimous in
holding that a charge of trafficking in narcotics by distributing was not
supported by the evidence and further that an attempt to commit the offence was
not established. However, it divided on the consequences of its holding. Since
it appeared that the evidence supported a finding of trafficking by giving, the
question was whether the trial judge should have amended the indictment suo
motu and whether, not having done so, this was a reversible error. Hughes
C.J.N.B. held on the authorities that there was no duty on the trial judge to
amend the indictment to conform to the evidence when the Crown did not seek an
amendment and hence would dismiss the Crown’s appeal against an acquittal. Ryan
J.A. was content to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the offence charged
was not proved. Only Limerick J.A., who dissented, viewed s. 610(3) as
giving the Court of Appeal power to amend the indictment

[Page 412]

but, apparently, only by reason of the trial
judge’s error in law in failing to make the amendment. It followed in his view
that a new trial should be directed on an amended indictment, invoking in this
respect s. 613(8) of the Criminal Code.

I cannot subscribe to Limerick J.A.’s
proposition that a trial judge has a duty to amend an indictment to conform to
the evidence when the Crown has not sought an amendment and hence the basis on
which he asserted an amending power in the Court of Appeal under s. 610(3)
disappears. Indeed, if he is correct in imposing such a duty on a trial judge
there is no need to invoke s. 610(3) since the issue then becomes merely
one of correcting an error of law below. I do not find the Christiansen case
of any assistance on the issues in the present case.

It is, of course, the fact that, with the power
given to a trial judge to amend to add an omitted essential averment, the line
between a charge which is a nullity and one which is merely imperfect has
become more difficult to draw. R. v. Hunt, Nadeau and Paquette[26] is an illustration, the British
Columbia Court of Appeal holding there that there was no offence disclosed in
the charge, which was thus not amendable. In R. v. Major[27], which came to this Court (see 27
C.C.C. (2d) 239) MacKeigan C.J.N.S. considered both R. v. Leclair and
R. v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt and, speaking for the majority, laid it
down (at p. 65) that “the omission of what used to be considered an
essential averment is not now sufficient to prevent a charge being cured by
amendment, even at the Court of Appeal level, so long as the accused is reasonably
informed and not misled, and especially where the offence is correctly
identified by section number”. The source of this power must have been
s. 529 because MacKeigan C.J.N.S. said that he respect-

[Page 413]

fully agreed with Davey J.A. in Wixalbrown
and Schmidt.

The issue for MacKeigan C.J.N.S. in the Major
case was whether the charge was an unamendable nullity or was amendable
despite its imperfection, and he concluded that it was amendable by supplying
an omitted essential averment but that it was necessary to see if the matters
covered by the missing averment were in fact proved in order to decide whether
the amendment should be made and whether the accused should have been
convicted. It was on the point of whether there was such evidence that Cooper
J.A. dissented from the majority and would, unlike them, have allowed the
amendment and affirmed the conviction which the majority quashed. In so far as
the Nova Scotia Court’s decision in the Major case stands for the
proposition that a court of appeal may exercise the powers of a trial judge
under s. 529 to amend a charge of an indictable offence to supply an
essential averment it is, in my opinion, wrong in law and this is very clear
from a mere reading of s. 529. The appeal to this Court was disposed of in
short oral reasons at the conclusion of the hearing whereby Cooper J.A.’s
assessment was preferred and the conviction was accordingly restored: see
(1976), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 239.

The Major case was considered by this
Court in its recent decision in R. v. Côté[28], which was a Crown appeal from
acquittal on an information charging an offence under s. 235(2) of the Criminal
Code, the information referring to the section but omitting from the
particulars of the charge the words “without reasonable excuse”. No objection
was taken by the accused to the omission either at first instance or on the
trial de novo, nor did he object in his notice of appeal that the charge
did not disclose an offence. However, leave to amend the notice of appeal to
raise this objection was given by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal which, in
the result, quashed the summary conviction on that ground. The case was brought
here on

[Page 414]

the question of the applicability of ss. 732(1),
(3) and 755(4) (as it stood at that time) of the Criminal Code. Whether
s. 732, which refers to the powers and position of a summary conviction
court, has any relevance to an issue arising in an appellate court is, at best,
doubtful, and I have grave doubt as well whether s. 755(4) has any
application to a court of appeal since it is a provision referring to an
“appeal court” defined in s. 747 as being the court for trials de novo whereas
the further appeal to a court of appeal is dealt with in s. 771. However,
neither s. 732(1), (3) nor s. 755(4) was necessary to the
determination of the Crown’s appeal (which was allowed in this Court) since
both de Grandpré J. who wrote for the majority and Spence J. who wrote in
concurrence were agreed that the information was sufficient and did not need
amendment.

However, in deference to the arguments advanced
by counsel on the question on which leave was given to bring the case to this
Court, de Grandpré J. went on to discuss the Major case, pointing out
(and in this Spence J. agreed) that we were concerned, on the appeal here, only
with the question whether there was sufficient evidence to prove an element of
the offence charged, and we supported the dissenting view of Cooper J.A. in the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that there was such evidence. The further observation
and conclusion of de Grandpré J. on the effect of ss. 732(1), (3) and 755(4)
(and I have already indicated my doubt of their applicability to a court of
appeal) that “it was an error on the part of the [Saskatchewan] Court of Appeal
to fail to consider the application of the relevant provisions of s. 732
and s. 755… in the circumstances of the case and to hold that the
information did not disclose an offence known to the law” (at p. 358 of 33
C.C.C. (2d)) have no relevance for the issue under consideration in the present
case.

This observation and conclusion was prefaced by
the words (referring to the Major case) that “this recent decision of
our Court settles the matter with the result that the question of law defined
in the order granting leave [in the Côté case] must be

[Page 415]

answered in the affirmative”. Whatever be the
view taken of our decision in the Major case, nothing in it touches the
power of a court of appeal to substitute a charge of a different offence, and
it must be assumed that Chief Justice MacKeigan’s reference to the Court of
Appeal’s power to amend can only have been a reference to s. 529 although
no Criminal Code provision was identified by him.

Since it is established—and a recent
illustration is seen in R. v. Vallée[29]—that
a charge or an indictment which fails to disclose an offence, one which is a
nullity, is not amendable by the trial judge even given the wide powers of
amendment reposed in him by s. 529, and that no power to breathe life into
a nullity rests in a court of appeal, it would be astonishing if on appeal a
court of appeal could exercise power to substitute a different charge when a
trial judge cannot do so. There is no express power to do so, indeed there is
not even any express power in a court of appeal to amend, as there is in New
Zealand under s. 392(1) of the Crimes Act, 1908 (N.Z.), No. 32, and
it would seem that the proper course for the Court of Appeal to adopt, if it
decides to order a new trial and not apply the Leclair doctrine to
foreclose the accused on any objection to the indictment, is to leave it to the
trial judge to decide whether an amendment should be made.

III

I turn now to s. 613(8) of the Criminal
Code and, in order to provide a context for its consideration I reproduce
as well s. 613(4) as that provision stood at the time of the proceedings
in this case in the British Columbia Court of Appeal (it was amended and re‑arranged
by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1975, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 93,
s. 75, effective July 26, 1976, but without any change in substance). The
two subsections read as follows:

613. (4)
Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set
aside the verdict and

[Page 416]

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect
to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found
guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law,
or

(ii) order a new trial.

…

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any
of the powers conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make
any order, in addition, that justice requires.

I supplement these provisions to make the short
point here that this Court’s power to entertain the accused’s appeal from the
setting aside of his acquittal is found in s. 618(2)(a) which gives
him a right of appeal in such circumstances on a question of law, here the
question of the proper construction and application of s. 613(4), (8).

Grammatically and as a matter of common sense
construction, a court of appeal, seized of a Crown appeal against an acquittal,
looks to s. 613(4) for the powers it may exercise on such an appeal, and
it is only where (in the words of s. 613(8)) “a court of appeal exercises
any of the powers conferred by subsection… (4) [that] it may make any order, in
addition [to that exercise (the italicized words are my own)] that
justice requires”. The provision in s. 613(8) for “any order, in addition,
that justice requires” is sequential to the exercise of the power to order a
new trial under s. 613(4). It does not, in my view, enable a court of
appeal to make an order upon which to found a direction for a new trial; and
certainly not when that order does not relate to the charge on which the
accused has been acquitted and to an error of law in respect of that charge.
This is, I think, rather obvious when reference is had, as it must be, to
s. 605(1)(a) upon which the Crown must base its right to appeal an
acquittal. There is a statutory framework, and only a statutory framework, for
appeals, and the limitations which have been placed by Parliament on Crown
appeals are clear. A court of appeal, limited to questions of law arising out
of the indictment on which an accused has been tried and acquitted, cannot, so
to speak, pull itself up by its own bootstraps to exercise its power to order a
new trial but must find a basis for doing so in respect of the charge as laid
and considered at trial. It is only that charge which an accused must be
prepared to

[Page 417]

defend (saving included offences) and fairness to
him, which the Criminal Code purports to express in accordance with the
fundamental conceptions residing in the presumption of innocence, dictates that
he not be taken beyond the bounds of what the Crown has chosen to lay against
him.

What is now s. 613(8) was considered by
Fauteux J., as he then was, in Welch v. The King[30], where he spoke for the majority of
the Court on an issue arising from a conviction on a charge of manslaughter
upon a second trial of the accused who had first been charged with murder and
convicted of manslaughter. The first verdict was set aside for misdirection and
the Ontario Court of Appeal either failed or refused to order a new trial or to
direct an acquittal, contenting itself with saying that although the conviction
would be set aside the accused was not acquitted. The second trial followed. In
the result, the majority of this Court allowed the accused’s appeal, quashed
the conviction on the second trial and ordered his discharge. What this Court
was concerned with in the Welch case was the incomplete judgment of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in the first proceeding and, hence, with the statutory
powers of courts of appeal on appeals in criminal cases. The explanation of the
Court of Appeal’s unusual decision neither to convict nor acquit nor to order a
new trial was the assumed impossibility under the Criminal Code of the
Crown laying a second indictment for manslaughter where the accused had been
acquitted on an indictment charging murder: see R. v. Pascal[31].

In the course of his reasons, and adverting
obviously to what is now s. 613(8), Fauteux J. said this (at p. 426):

…I fail, I must say with deference, to
appreciate the alleged obstacles standing in the way of the Court of Appeal to
exercise its authority if, as suggested, the

[Page 418]

majority judges wanted to direct a new
trial only on this sole undisposed of part of the indictment, that is, the
lesser charge of manslaughter. Legal and sufficient it would have been to
direct a new trial on the offence of manslaughter exclusively and to further
order that the original indictment of murder be, to that end, amended. Thus, on
this new trial, the accused could only be found guilty or not guilty of
manslaughter. The language of the statute is broad enough to embrace the
authority to make such “other order”, if the justice of the case suggests no
other. And I know of no principles of law which could have then been violated
by such order. I must, therefore, conclude that the exercise of the statutory
authority given to the Court of Appeal, under section 1014(3), to direct
an acquittal to be entered or to direct a new trial and in either case, to make
such other order as justice requires, is not permissive but mandatory.

This application of s. 613(8) does not
touch the present case but it clearly gives sensible subject-matter to the
provision in respect of the substitution of convictions for included offences
or orders for a new trial in respect of such offences.

A reference to what is now s. 613(8) is
also made in the dissenting reasons of Taschereau J., as he then was, Chief
Justice Rinfret concurring. The dissent was on another point but as to
s. 613(8), the learned justice said this (at p. 416):

I had the advantage of reading the reasons
for judgment of my brother Fauteux, and I agree with him, that when the Court
of Appeal allows an appeal against a conviction, in a case like the one at bar,
it has only two alternatives. It may quash the conviction and direct a verdict
of acquittal, or direct a new trial, and it is only when one of these two
courses has been followed that it may make such other order as justice
requires. It is however imperative and not only permissive, that
there should be an acquittal or that a new trial should be directed.

I entertain no doubt that the Court of
Appeal had power by virtue of section 1014(3) of the Cr. C., after
haying quashed the conviction, to direct a new trial limited exclusively to the
charge of manslaughter. This would have clearly been an order authorized by the
concluding part of section 1014(3) Cr. C.

[Page 419]

I subscribe fully to this view and would
underline Taschereau J.’s words that “it is only when one of these two courses
[direction of an acquittal or of a new trial] has been followed that [the Court
of Appeal] may make such other order as justice requires”. (The italics
are those of Taschereau J.)

The Welch case appears to have been
applied in R. v. Kelso[32], where
the accused on an indictment for rape was convicted of attempted rape, and in
ordering a new trial because of misdirection the Court felt it could properly
order the new trial to proceed on the charge of attempted rape, not a very
surprising conclusion and, indeed, it may be doubted whether in the
circumstances of the Kelso case there was any need to rely on
s. 613(8): see also R. v. Robertson[33]. However, such reliance in case of
an included offence (as to which see R. v. Popoff[34]) is a long way from the issue confronting
this Court here.

Assuming, however, that s. 613(8) gives a
court of appeal a wider power than that which I think its terms confer when
considered alongside s. 613(4) and s. 605(1)(a), the relevant
question here is whether the words “make any order, in addition, that justice
requires” empower the court of appeal to direct a new trial on a different
offence from that on which the appeal was taken. It would be incongruous to me
if the Court of Appeal, under the relevant words of s. 613(8), could do
what the trial judge could not do under the wide amending powers given him
under s. 529. That aside, a consideration of the history of the words in
question in their original setting and in their present one does not lead to
the conclusion reached by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in this case.

I begin the historical canvass with a statute of
pre-Confederation Canada, An Act for the Further Amendment of the
Administration of the Criminal Law, (1851) (Can.), c. 13, providing
for the reservation of questions of law arising in a criminal trial for the
opinion of a superior court. The question or

[Page 420]

questions of law were to be submitted by a
stated case and

…the Justices of either of the said
Superior Courts shall thereupon have full power and authority to hear and
finally determine the said questions, and thereupon to reverse, affirm or amend
any judgment which shall have been given on the indictment or inquisition on
the trial whereof such question or questions have arisen, or to avoid such
judgment, and to order an entry to be made on the record, that in the judgment
of the said Justices the party convicted ought not to have been convicted, or
to arrest the judgment, or order judgment to be given thereon at some other
Session of Oyer and Terminer or Gaol Delivery, or other Sessions of the Peace,
if no judgment shall have been before that time given, as they shall be advised,
or to make such other order as justice may require;…

This statute by its terms was in force only in
Upper Canada.

Similar provision for stating a case on a
reserved question of law is found in the Statutes of Lower Canada: see C.S.L.C.
1860, c. 77, s. 58. The Court of Queen’s Bench was authorized to
reverse, amend or affirm any judgment on the indictment in question, to avoid
or arrest judgment or “to make such other order as justice requires”. Section 3
of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada 1859, c. 112, was in similar
terms, and so was s. 101 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1864 (3rd
series), c. 171, and to the same effect was s. 23 of the Revised
Statutes of New Brunswick, 1854, c. 159. These provisions were virtually a
reproduction of English legislation, 1848 (U.K.), c. 78, and were
similarly entitled. When the statutes of Canada were first revised after
Confederation, the foregoing common provisions were superseded by s. 261
of the Criminal Procedure Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 174, which was as
follows:

261. The
justices of the court for Crown cases reserved, to which the case is
transmitted, shall hear and finally determine such question, and reverse,
affirm or amend any judgment given on the trial wherein such question arose, or
shall avoid such judgment or order an entry to be made on the record, that in
the judgment of such justices the person convicted ought not to have been
convicted, or shall arrest the judgment, or if no judgment has been given,
shall order judgment to be given thereon at some future session of the court
before

[Page 421]

which the person was convicted, or shall
make such other order as justice requires.

The new Criminal Code of 1892 retained
provision for the reserving of questions of law arising during a trial but to
be considered by courts of appeal upon a case stated: see s. 743. The Code
improved upon the previous law governing appeals in criminal cases by the
enactment of a composite provision, s. 746, reading as follows:

746. …

(a) confirm the ruling
appealed from; or

(b) if of opinion that the
ruling was erroneous, and that there has been a mis-trial in consequence,
direct a new trial; or

(c) if it considers the
sentence erroneous, or the arrest of judgment erroneous, pass such a sentence
as ought to have been passed or set aside any sentence passed by the court
below, and remit the case to the court below with a direction to pass the
proper sentence; or

(d) if of opinion in a case
in which the accused has been convicted that the ruling was erroneous, and that
the accused ought to have been acquitted, direct that the accused shall be
discharged, which order shall have all the effects of an acquittal; or

(e) direct a new trial; or

(f) make such other order as justice
requires: Provided that no conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial
directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or
rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some
misdirection given, unless in the opinion of the Court of Appeal some substantial
wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial: Provided that if the
Court of Appeal is of opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly
disallowed a new trial shall be granted.

2. If it appears to the Court of Appeal
that such wrong or miscarriage affected some count only of the indictment the
court may give separate directions as to each count and may pass sentence on
any count unaffected by such wrong or miscarriage which stands good, or may
remit the case to the court below with directions to pass such sentence as
justice may require.

[Page 422]

Section 746 of the original Code came
down in subsequently revised form to the present s. 613, and
s. 613(8) may be looked upon as a transformed version of s. 746(f).

The case law on the pre-Confederation and
post-Confederation legislation cited above, at least until it was subsumed
under the new Criminal Code, established that although the sufficiency
of an indictment was a question that could be reserved in arrest of judgment
(see R. v. Gibson[35], holding,
however, that the sufficiency of an indictment could not be challenged on a
motion to quash), there was no power on the consideration of a reserved
question to amend the indictment: see R. v. Garland[36]. The Court said in the Garland case,
at p. 227, that “our powers do not extend to amending the indictment. We
can only deal with the judgment; and if we amend the judgment here the record
will be wrong”. A fortiori, there was no power to direct the
substitution of a different charge.

I referred earlier in these reasons to the
judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. More and Melville[37], and, risking repetition, I wish to
mention again what was there decided. The Court took a cautious approach to the
question of its power to direct a new trial on an amended indictment involving
an essential averment, namely, the place of commission of the offence of
unlawful possession of stolen property. After considering the Welch case
and some others the majority concluded that it had no power to amend the
indictment in that respect but, in the special circumstances, it could order a
new trial, leaving it to the trial judge to determine whether an amendment to
the charge was necessary and whether it should be made. The dissenting Chief Justice
Desbrisay agreed that the Court of Appeal had no power to amend and would have
entered an acquittal. The Nova Scotia Supreme Court en

[Page 423]

banc applied More
and Melville in R. v. Rooney[38]
to deny to an appellate court the power to amend an indictment. In the
result in that case, which involved a conviction on a charge of obtaining money
by false pretences but the proof did not go higher than showing that the
accused had obtained a cheque by false representations, the majority of the
Court ordered a new trial because, in the words of McDonald J. for the majority
at p. 196, “it appears that evidence does exist by which a case may be
proved properly, with or without amendment of the charge by the magistrate”.
The opposing view was put by Ilsley C.J. in dissent (Currie J. concurring),
namely, that this was not a case where because of some mistake in the conduct
of the trial the conviction could not stand although there was evidence to
convict on a proper trial, but rather it was a case where the Crown had failed
to prove guilt of the offence charged and “for this Court to order a new trial
would be to place again the appellant in jeopardy… in order to give the Crown
another opportunity to secure his conviction on an amended charge” (at
p. 192).

I refer to one more decision, that of the New
Brunswick Court of Appeal in Budovitch v. The Queen[39]. It involved a conviction for
fraudulently failing to pay over or account for money, the charge alleging the
offence to have been committed in Fredericton. The evidence showed that, if
committed, it was in Saint John. On appeal, a new trial was ordered on a charge
which alleged an offence in Saint John, the majority purporting to invoke what
is now s. 613(8) in directing the amendment to be made at the new trial.
Hughes J.A., as he then was, would, following the Rooney case (as
holding there was no power to amend the indictment on appeal), have ordered a
new trial, leaving it to the trial judge to make the appropriate amendment
under what is now s. 529, pointing

[Page 424]

out there was uncontradicted evidence of a theft
in New Brunswick.

Although Budovitch goes beyond More
and Melville and beyond Rooney in directing a new trial on an
amended charge, it is nonetheless simply a case where the amendment was within
the trial judge’s power, relating as it did to an essential particular in the
charge, but not to a different charge, and, moreover, a particular on which
evidence had been adduced, that is as to the place of commission of the
offence.

I do not find anything in the case law, and
certainly nothing in applicable legislation to authorize a court of appeal to
do what the British Columbia Court of Appeal did here, something which the
trial judge himself could not do. There is here a usurpation of the function of
the Attorney-General and of the Crown. It is for them to decide, the existing
charge not being proved, whether to lay the different charge which the Court
felt should have been brought against the accused. It is not for a Court to
take an ad hominem view in a case like the present one and to do
violence to the separate functions of Court and Crown lest a person guilty of
an offence, but not the one charged, escape punishment.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal and restore the acquittal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—The appellant and one Arthur James
Williams were charged together on an indictment dated October 22, 1974, with
the following offences:

1. THAT in or about various places in the
County of Nanaimo, and elsewhere, in the Province of British Columbia, between
on or about the 23rd day of August, A.D. 1972 and on or about the 21st day of
December, A.D. 1973, they and Stuart Hunter Elliott, Lois Phoebe

[Page 425]

Elliott, Jerry Dean Elliott, Myron Zarry,
Shirley Ferguson, Ingrid Elliott, unlawfully did conspire together the one with
the other or others of them, and persons unknown to commit the indictable
offence of trafficking in a restricted drug, to wit, 3, 4,
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) contrary to the form of statute in such case
made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her Crown and
Dignity.

2. THAT in or about various places in the
County of Nanaimo, and elsewhere, in the Province of British Columbia, between
on or about the 23rd day of August, A.D. 1972 and on or about the 21st day of
December, A.D. 1973 they did unlawfully traffic in a restricted drug, to wit;
3, 4, Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) contrary to the form of statute in such
case made and provided and against the peace of our Lady the Queen, and her
Crown and Dignity.

3. THAT in the County of Nanaimo, Province
of British Columbia on or about the 17th day of December A.D. 1973 they did
unlawfully have in their possession a restricted drug, to wit; 3, 4,
Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) for the purpose of trafficking contrary to the
form of statute in such case made and provided and against the peace of our
Lady the Queen, her Crown and Dignity.

At the trial before Cashman C.C.J., both accused
were acquitted on the first count of this indictment, the appellant alone was
convicted on the second count but acquitted on the third. The learned trial
judge entered the latter acquittal on the ground that he had already convicted
the appellant of “trafficking” on the second count and that the offences
charged in these two counts were so intermingled that he could not distinguish
the one from the other; he therefore invoked the judgment of this Court in Kienapple
v. The Queen[40], and
thus concluded that the matter was res judicata.

When the appellant appealed his conviction on
the second count, the Court of Appeal directed an acquittal on the ground that
although it had been proved that the appellant had substantial quantities of a
salt designated MDA hydrochloride in his possession for the purpose of sale and
distribution, it was not shown that he was in possession of MDA itself for the
purpose of trafficking or otherwise.

[Page 426]

All the counts in the indictment were laid under
the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-27,
s. 40 of which defines a “restricted drug” as including
“methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) or any salt thereof”. The Court of Appeal
being satisfied that trafficking in the salt constituted a separate offence
which was not charged in the indictment, allowed the appellant’s appeal.

In appealing the verdict of acquittal on the
third count, the Crown applied to amend the charge by adding the words “a salt
of” prior to the words “3, 4,MDA” so that the allegation would comply with the
facts as disclosed by the evidence and found by the Court of Appeal in the
appeal against conviction on count 2. This application was granted and the
Court ordered “that the appeal against acquittal be allowed, the acquittal set
aside and a new trial ordered on the indictment as amended”. Judgment on this
application was rendered on behalf of the Court by Mr. Justice MacLean who
had presided at the appeal from the conviction on the second count and, as I
have said, it is clear that the Court of Appeal in disposing of that count
treated the charge of being in possession of MDA and being in possession of a
salt thereof as two separate charges, although McIntyre J.A., speaking for the
majority of the Court, clearly indicated that he regarded the designation of
“MDA” in the charge as a “particular” and would have considered an amendment
appropriate after hearing the appeal had one been sought.

In considering the third count, however, the
Court of Appeal, differently constituted, appears to have recognized that the
charge was that the accused “did unlawfully have in their possession a
restricted drug… for the purpose of trafficking” and that the failure to allege
possession of “a salt of MDA” constituted a failure to allege “a particular” of
the offence which was capable of being added by way of amendment, in order to
conform to the evidence which the Court had accepted in disposing of count 2.

The latter amendment did not in my opinion have
the effect of charging a new offence as it did

[Page 427]

no more than specify a particular of the offence
which had already been charged. If I thought the amendment to be tantamount to
the charge of a different offence from that contained in the original count,
other considerations might apply, but what we have here is a particularization
of an ingredient of the main charge which was made necessary by the evidence
which the Court had already accepted and which had in fact been in great
measure conceded by the appellant.

Mr. Justice MacLean’s judgment on this
application is very brief and I reproduce it in full:

In this case the Crown applies for an
amendment of the indictment, some considerable time after conclusion of the
trial, applying to this Court rather than to the court below.

In my view the ends of justice require that
the amendment in this case be granted and in my view no substantial wrong would
be suffered thereby by the accused person.

I would accordingly allow the amendment of
the third count in the indictment, allow the appeal of the Crown, set aside the
acquittal and direct a new trial on the third count as amended.

It is from this decision and the order granted
pursuant thereto that the appellant now appeals alleging:

(i) that as the trial judge had found count
three to be indistinguishable from count two, it followed that by acquitting
the appellant with respect to count two the Court of Appeal had necessarily
disposed of the Crown’s appeal on count three and that the Court of Appeal
lacked jurisdiction to entertain the Crown’s appeal on this count; (Kienapple
v. The Queen was cited in support of this contention.)

(ii) that proceedings by way of appeal relating
to several counts in an indictment which had been tried together cannot be
severed by the Crown in the Court of Appeal;

(iii) that there is no power in the Court of
Appeal to amend an indictment so as to conform with the evidence, this power
being limited to the trial court by reason of ss. 529, 610 and 613 of the Criminal
Code.

[Page 428]

In acquitting the appellant on count 2 the Court
of Appeal did not, in my view, dispose of the third count; it did on the other
hand dispose of the reason given by the trial judge for his acquittal on that
count. It will be observed that the gravamen of the offence under these counts
is in the one case that the accused did “unlawfully traffic in a restricted
drug…” and in the other that they did “unlawfully have in their possession a
restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking”. The whole gist of the decision
in the Court of Appeal on count 2 was that although the appellant was guilty of
having possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA) for the purpose of
trafficking, the salt was not a drug specified in the particulars of the
indictment. It remained for the Crown to seek an order amending count 3 of the
indictment so as to conform to the evidence. Far from having been disposed of
by the appellant’s acquittal by the Court of Appeal on count 2, the Crown’s
appeal from the acquittal on count 3 had not then been heard by the Court and
it was open to the Crown to pursue it.

Having found that the appellant was in fact in
possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA) for the purpose of trafficking,
Mr. Justice MacLean indicated that he would have been disposed to allow an
amendment to the second count of the indictment even after the hearing of the
appeal. The fact that the Crown did not seek such an amendment in no way
precluded it from applying to amend count 3 so as to conform to the evidence
described in Mr. Justice McIntyre’s reasons for judgment. The case of Kienapple
does not appear to me to have any application in this situation as that
case was concerned essentially with the proposition that an accused cannot be
convicted twice for the same offence.

The second ground of appeal advanced on behalf
of the appellant to the effect that counts in an indictment cannot be severed
in the Court of Appeal appears to me to overlook the course of proceedings at
trial in the present case. Here the learned trial judge disposed of the first
and second counts by a judgment rendered on January 31, 1975, and only then
proceeded to consider the

[Page 429]

third count against Elliott alone (a stay of
proceedings having been entered with respect to Williams). The third count was
thus effectively severed from counts 1 and 2 by the trial judge who proceeded
to consider that count separately and to dispose of it by a judgment dated
February 24, 1975.

In so doing, the learned trial judge purported
to act in accordance with s. 43 of the Food and Drugs Act and it
therefore appears to me to be desirable to consider the following provisions of
that statute:

42. (1) No
person shall traffic in a restricted drug or any substance represented or held
out by him to be a restricted drug.

(2) No person shall have in his possession
any restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking.

43. (1) In
any prosecution for a violation of subsection 42(2), if the accused does
not plead guilty, the trial shall proceed as if the issue to be tried is
whether the accused was in possession of a restricted drug contrary to
subsection 41(1).

(2) If, pursuant to subsection (1),
the court finds that the accused was not in possession of a restricted drug
contrary to subsection 41(1), he shall be acquitted, but, if the court
finds that the accused was in possession of a restricted drug contrary to
subsection 41(1), he shall be given an opportunity of establishing that he
was not in possession of the restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking and
thereafter the prosecutor shall be given an opportunity of adducing evidence to
the contrary.

In purported compliance with these provisions,
Judge Cashman made the following statement in his judgment on the third count:

As required by Section 43 of the Food
and Drugs Act… I made a finding that the accused Elliott was in possession
of MDA on December 17th, 1973.

It was then agreed by Counsel that I should
make findings on Counts 1 and 2 with respect to each accused on these counts
before the accused Elliott be given an opportunity to establish that he was not
in possession of MDA for the purpose of trafficking.

Later in his judgment the learned trial judge
reasoned as follows:

[Page 430]

If the accused was before me on a charge of
possession for the purpose of trafficking in MDA and that was the only charge
before me then in the circumstances in which the MDA was found I would have no
difficulty in concluding it to be a fair inference from the evidence that the
accused had that quantity of MDA for the purpose of physically making MDA available
to other persons.

And he went on to say:

The question is not whether the accused can
be convicted of possession for the purpose of trafficking in MDA in the
circumstances of this case but whether he should as a matter of law be
convicted of that offence, he having been convicted on the same evidence of
trafficking in MDA.

He then concluded:

In my opinion the two offences charged here
in Counts 2 and 3 are so intermingled that I cannot say that one is distinct
from the other.

It is my view that in the circumstances
here were I to convict the accused of both offences I would in reality be
convicting the accused twice of the same offence.

In Kienapple v. The Queen (supra) in
the C.R.N.S. volume at page 7, Laskin, J. said this:

In my view, the term res judicata best
expresses the theory of precluding multiple convictions for the same delict,
although the matter is the basis of two separate offences.

Accordingly I find that I cannot convict
the accused Elliott on Count 3 and I make that finding notwithstanding that
during the course of the Trial pursuant to Section 43 I found the accused to be
in possession of MDA. My inability to convict the accused Elliott is not due to
a matter of fact but rather to a matter of law for the reasons stated above.

As I have pointed out, the Court of Appeal has
found that the appellant was in possession of a restricted drug (a salt of MDA)
within the meaning of s. 41(1) of the Food and Drugs Act and the
effect of the amendment granted by Mr. Justice MacLean is to give the
appellant “an opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the
restricted drug for the purpose of trafficking” as provided by s. 43(2) of
the Food and Drugs Act.

[Page 431]

In my opinion the only issue before this Court
on the present appeal is whether the Court of Appeal exceeded its powers when
it amended the third count of the indictment in such fashion as to conform to
the evidence by adding a particular which had not been included in that count
as originally drawn, upon which the appellant had been acquitted. Having regard
to the extensive activities which the appellant was found to have been
conducting in the manufacture of MDA hydrochloride, I do not think that it can
be suggested that the appellant was in any way misled by the fact that that
salt was not mentioned in the particulars. He knew in any event that he was
being charged with possession of a restricted drug for the purpose of
trafficking.

In directing a new trial, Mr. Justice
MacLean incorporated the amendment to the information in his order as he felt
that the ends of justice required him to do.

In granting this order it seems to me to be
plain that the Court of Appeal was acting pursuant to the provisions of
s. 613(4)(b) and (8) which provide as follows:

613. (4)
Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may…

(b) allow the appeal, set
aside the verdict and

(i) order a new trial,…

(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any
of the powers conferred by subsection… (4),… it may make any order, in
addition, that justice requires.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the order for a new trial could not have been made unless the amendment had
been granted and that the amendment was therefore not an order “in addition” to
the exercise of the court’s power under subs. (4)(b)(i), but rather that
it was a prerequisite to the granting of a new trial.

In my view when Parliament authorized the Court
of Appeal, in the exercise of its power, to order a new trial, to “make any
order, in addition, which justice requires” it must be taken as having
authorized that Court under those circumstances to make any additional order
which the ends of justice require whether the order for a new trial is
dependent upon the additional order or not. I do

[Page 432]

not think that the wide powers conferred on the
Court of Appeal by s. 613(8) are to be narrowly construed but rather that
they are designed to ensure that the requirements of the ends of justice are
met, and are to be liberally construed in light of that overriding consideration.

In ordering a new trial it would normally be
undesirable to comment on the evidence, but I think that in this case the
concessions made by the appellant on his appeal are relevant as indicating the
material of which the Court must have been aware in determining that the ends
of justice required a new trial on the third count.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
appeal on the second count, Mr. Justice McIntyre, with whom all members of
the Court agreed, had this to say:

The appellant conceded that the police had
found M.D.A. hydrochloride a salt of MDA upon the premises and conceded that it
was manufactured by the appellant. Indeed, in the absence of such a concession
there was positive proof that MDA hydrochloride had been manufactured in
substantial quantity and that it was intended for sale and distribution.

Seized with knowledge of this evidence, it is
small wonder that Mr. Justice MacLean considered the ends of justice to
require the amendment which he granted and that no substantial wrong was done
to the appellant by granting it. I fully agree with this conclusion and would
affirm the order that implemented it.

In the course of the argument in this Court
reference was made to other cases in which provincial courts of appeal have
granted amendments to an indictment as to which there was no complaint made at
trial, but the circumstances disclosed in each of these cases differs
materially from the situation disclosed in this appeal and I prefer to base my
conclusion on the broad ground that the ends of justice required the amendment
which was here granted. It follows that I find it unnecessary to express any
view as to the submission that the authority of the Court of Appeal to grant an
amendment stems from the provisions of s. 610(3) of the Criminal Code which
authorize the court to exercise powers “that may be exercised by the

[Page 433]

court on appeals in civil matters…”. In my view
a final determination of this question can be appropriately considered when it
is an essential element in the disposition of the appeal.

In the course of the argument reference was made
to the provisions of s. 529 of the Criminal Code which bears the
heading “Amending defective indictment or count” but in my view the only
mandatory language in that section is contained in subs. (1) which
provides for

an objection to an indictment or to a count
in an indictment or a defect apparent on the face thereof…

and requires such objection to be taken before
plea or thereafter by leave of the court or a judge. In the present case we are
not concerned with a defect apparent on the face of the indictment and this
subsection accordingly has no application to the present circumstances. In
my view there is no other language in the section which can be read as
curtailing the power of the Court of Appeal to make an order under
s. 613(8) which has the effect of amending the indictment so as to conform
to the evidence where the ends of justice require it.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—I agree with the
conclusion reached by the Chief Justice in this appeal and the reasons
therefor, with one reservation. I would like to leave open the issue as to
whether s. 529(1) or s. 732(1) of the Criminal Code prevents
initial objection being taken in the Court of Appeal to a defect on the face of
the indictment or information and the effect of the judgment in R. v.
Leclair[41].

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Interpretation—Availability of
absolute or conditional discharge—Criminal Code, ss. 234, 662.1.

Respondent had been found guilty of having
care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 234 of the Criminal
Code. Rather than assessing a penalty as provided in s. 234 the provincial
court judge purported to exercise the jurisdiction given by s. 662.1 and
granted a discharge to the accused conditional upon a probation order. The
Crown successfully appealed by way of stated case, however the Court of Appeal
subsequently held that a conditional discharge could be granted.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Section 234(a) of the Criminal
Code prescribes an alternative penalty for which no minimum is set but this
notwithstanding it also prescribes a minimum punishment i.e. a
fine of fifty dollars. The offence in question is therefore an offence for
which a minimum penalty is prescribed by law and it follows that the provisions
of s. 662.1(1) do not apply.

R. v. Millen
(1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 395; R. v. Poulin (1974), 16 C.C.C.
(2d) 39; R. v. MacNeill (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 247 referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario allowing an appeal
from an order of Donohue J. allowing an appeal by way of stated case. Appeal
allowed, remitted to the Provincial Court Judge for the entry of a conviction
and the imposition of a sentence.

R.M. McLeod, for the appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

[Page 163]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal by leave of this
Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on May 23, 1974. In that judgment, the said Court of
Appeal, by a majority, allowed an appeal from the judgment of Donohue J.
pronounced on September 25, 1973. Provincial Court Judge Clendenning, on May 28, 1973, found the
respondent guilty of the charge that:

on or about the 9th day of March, 1973 at
the Town of Deseronto, in the County of Hastings
while his ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol he did have
the care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to Section 234 of the
Criminal Code

but rather than assessing a penalty as provided
in the said s. 234 of the Criminal Code, he purported to exercise the
jurisdiction given by s. 662.1 and granted a discharge to the accused
conditional upon a probation order. At the request of the Crown, the Provincial
Court Judge stated a case in which the following questions were put:

1. Did I err in law in applying the
provisions of Section 662.1 of the Criminal Code after first stating in
open court on the record that a conviction would be entered?

2. Did I err in law in applying the
provisions of Section 662.1 of the Criminal Code in proceedings under
Section 234 of the Criminal Code?

Donohue J., in his order, allowed the appeal by
way of a stated case holding that s. 234 of the Criminal Code did
provide a minimum punishment for the first offence and that, therefore, the
provisions of s. 662. 1(1) were not available. From that order, the respondent
here appealed to the Court of Appeal and the majority of that Court composed of
Dubin and Estey JJ.A. allowed the appeal and answered both of the questions in
the stated case which I have recited above in the negative. Jessup J.A.
dissented and would have dismissed the appeal.

The first question in the stated case was
concerned simply with the result of the Provincial Court Judge having declared
in open court that he

[Page 164]

would convict the accused and then upon hearing
evidence determining that, rather than registering a conviction, he would grant
the conditional discharge.

As Jessup J.A. pointed out in his reasons,
counsel for the appellant in the Court of Appeal, here respondent, submitted
that in announcing he was registering a conviction the Provincial Court Judge
used that term merely in the sense of making a finding of guilt and counsel for
the Crown did not attempt to answer that argument. The issue was not canvassed in
this Court and I see no reason to disturb the negative answer to the first
question given by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.

It will be seen, therefore, that the sole
question remaining for determination is whether or not a trial court judge,
coming to the conclusion that an accused person is guilty of the offence of
driving a motor vehicle when his ability was impaired by alcohol contrary to
the provisions of s. 234 of the Criminal Code, is free to refrain from
entering a conviction and grant to the accused either an absolute or a
conditional discharge as provided for in s. 662.1 (1) of the Criminal Code. These
two sections read as follows:

234. Every one who, while his ability to
drive a motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug, drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not,
is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable

(a) for a first offence, to a
fine of not more than five hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars or
to imprisonment for three months or to both;

(b) for a second offence, to
imprisonment for not more than three months and not less than fourteen days;
and

(c) for each subsequent
offence, to imprisonment for not more than one year and not less than three
months.

...

662.1 (1) Where an accused, other than a
corporation, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence,

[Page 165]

other than an offence for which a minimum
punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable, in the proceedings
commenced against him, by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life or by
death, the court before which he appears may, if it considers it to be in the
best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of
convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged
absolutely or upon the conditions prescribed in a probation order.

That exact issue was considered not only in the
judgment from which the appeal presently considered was taken but also by the
Appellate Courts of three other provinces. In R. v. Millen[1], the Appellate Division of Nova
Scotia, in a judgment pronounced on April 10, 1973, held that the provisions of
s. 662.1(1) did not apply, and in R. v. Poulin[2], the Court of Appeal for Manitoba
came to a similar conclusion citing Millen. In R. v. MacNeill[3], the Appeal Division of New
Brunswick, in a judgment pronounced on July 12, 1974, also came to a like
conclusion after considering the judgment in the present appeal as given by the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, and also Millen and Poulin. In each
one of the four cases, the provincial Appellate Courts were concerned with the
same problem.

Turning to the wording of s. 662.1(1), the
procedure of a discharge without conviction is available only when the offence
of which the accused has been found guilty is “other than an offence for which
a minimum punishment is prescribed by law”. Therefore, the problem is whether
the provisions of s. 234, para. (a), of the Criminal Code providing
for the penalty upon a first offence of impaired driving are provisions which
do prescribe a minimum punishment.

The reasons of the learned justices in the Court
of Appeal for Ontario are concerned with the weighing of the various possible
penalties set out in the said s. 234(a). Jessup J.A. would have
dismissed the appeal on the basis that the provision

[Page 166]

for a fine not less than fifty dollars was “a
minimum punishment” as he believed that the Parliament had intended that “a
fine is always minimal to imprisonment in the hierarchy of punishment provided
in the Code”. Dubin J.A., for the majority of the Court, relied on the
provisions of s. 645, subs. (1) and (2), of the Code which read as follows:

645. (1) Where an enactment prescribes
different degrees or kinds of punishment in respect of an offence, the
punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the
enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits
the offence.

(2) Where an enactment prescribes a punishment
in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the
limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that
convicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum
punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.

He pointed out that the trial judge had a choice
not only of degrees of punishment but of kinds of punishment and if the trial
judge chose to adopt imprisonment as the kind of punishment which he should
assess then s. 234 (a) of the Code provided no minimum for such
imprisonment. Dubin J.A. concluded that s. 234 (a) did not
prescribe a minimum sentence and the provisions of s. 662.1(1) were available.

I am of the opinion that it is not necessary to
weigh the various penalties prescribed by s. 234 (a) of the Code
or attempt to arrange them in a hierarchy or order.

I turn to consider the exact words of s. 662.1
(1), i.e., “other than an offence for which a minimum punishment
is prescribed by law”. (The emphasis is my own.) Certainly s. 234 (a)
does prescribe a minimum penalty, that is, a fine of fifty dollars. It
might prescribe an alternative form of penalty and fail to prescribe a minimum
for that other kind but it has none the less prescribed a minimum penalty.

Dubin J.A., in his reasons for judgment,
carefully reviewed the history of the enactment of the

[Page 167]

provisions for conditional discharge and also
for suspension and came to the conclusion that when the exact same phrase, i.e.,
“other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by
law”, was inserted in s. 663 dealing with suspension of sentence at the time
when such provisions as to suspension were to permit suspensions to be granted
to other than first offenders, it would not be proper to imply that Parliament
had, at the same time, removed the right to grant suspension to those who had
been found guilty of impaired driving for the first time. He said that since
the words in s. 663 as to suspension of sentence were exactly the same words as
in s. 662.1 (1), it should not be considered that Parliament had not intended
to permit a discharge of those found guilty for the first time of impaired
driving. With all respect, I am of the opinion that these sections do not
permit a court to come to this conclusion. It might well be that when
Parliament extended the provisions as to suspension of sentence to those who
had had more than one previous conviction and granted the additional right to
find guilt and give a discharge, it also concluded these ameliorating
provisions should not apply to first convictions for impaired driving.

We were informed by counsel for the Crown that
the wording of s. 234(a) is found only in that section and the
accompanying sections dealing with alcohol-related driving offences and
such offences have been for some years the very serious concern of Parliament.
I think also there is very considerable weight to the submission made by
counsel for the Crown that a discharge either absolute or conditional in form
after a person has been found guilty of a first offence of impaired driving
might permit that person to avoid the compulsory terms of imprisonment set out
in paras. (b) and (c) of s. 234 when convicted of

[Page 168]

subsequent like offences.

Section 592, subs. (1) and (2) of the Criminal
Code provide:

592. (1) Where an accused is convicted of
an offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous
convictions, no greater punishment shall be imposed upon him by reason thereof
unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that the accused, before making his
plea, was notified that a greater punishment would be sought by reason thereof.

(2) Where an accused is convicted of an
offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous
convictions, the court shall, upon application by the prosecutor and upon being
satisfied that the accused was notified in accordance with subsection (1),
ask the accused whether he was previously convicted and, if he does not admit
that he was previously convicted, evidence of previous convictions may be
adduced.

To comply with those sections, the Crown would
have to give notice and cite a previous conviction. If the penalty assessed
upon the accused being found guilty on the first occasion was a discharge then
the Crown could not cite a conviction. It is possible that the Crown could
submit a request that the compulsory jail term be imposed by not giving the
notice required by s. 692 but merely by proving the finding of guilt and the
granting of a discharge which occurred on the first occasion, but that result
would entail the accused upon a second or subsequent occasion being given the
compulsory jail term without having been served with a notice of the Crown's
intention to apply for such a sentence. It would not seem to be a sound
interpretation of the provisions of the Code to permit such a procedure.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
direct that the matter be remitted to the Provincial Court Judge for the entry
of a conviction and the imposition of a sentence.

Appeal allowed, remitted to the Provincial Court Judge for the entry
of a conviction and the imposition of a sentence.

evidence—Psychiatric opinion—Admissibility—Examination of accused at instance
of Crown without notice or court order—Criminal Code, ss. 465(c), 543, 608.2.

Appellant was arrested on February 1, 1973,
and held in custody. At the request of the Crown a number of psychiatrists
examined the accused at various dates all a considerable time prior to the
preliminary hearing. There was no judicial determination that such examination
should be permitted and it appeared that on the dates in question appellant was
not represented by counsel although he had been interviewed by duty counsel
under the provisions of the Ontario Legal Aid Scheme. At trial the judge
admitted the evidence of these psychiatrists when they were called to testify
in reply as witnesses for the Crown. The Court of Appeal decided inter alia that
the trial judge had not erred in admitting this evidence and dismissed the appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

As was said in the Court of Appeal, while it
would be preferable for the Crown to seek a Court order for psychiatric
examination of an accused under arrest and to advise defence counsel, where
applicable, of their intention to have such examination, the Crown’s failure so
to do is not by itself a basis for the exclusion of the psychiatric evidence.
As there does not appear to be a provision in the Criminal Code or
elsewhere which would authorize a court to give an order for examination of an
accused in the circumstances of his confinement in the Toronto Jail all a court
can do is to express regret that no such provision exists and that therefore no
Court order had been obtained.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal[1] for Ontario dismissing an appeal from a 

[Page 14]

conviction by Donnelly J., with a jury, of
capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

Arthur Maloney, Q.C., and Clare E. Lewis,
for the appellant.

David Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario
pronounced on January 25, 1974,
wherein that Court dismissed an appeal by the accused from his conviction on
October 1, 1973, at a trial before Donnelly J. and a jury of the offence of
capital murder. The judgment of the Court of Appeal has since been reported in
(1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 137. That report contains a very detailed account of all
the circumstances and I, therefore, do not intend to repeat them in these
reasons.

After counsel for the accused had presented his
argument before the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that Court called upon counsel for the Crown to argue only grounds
of appeal which counsel for the accused had, in his notice of appeal,
designated as grounds 1, 2 and 5.

In this Court, after counsel for the appellant
(the accused) had presented his argument, the Court called upon counsel for the
Crown to reply only on ground of appeal 1. This ground of appeal, as set out in
the appellant’s notice of appeal to this Court, was as follows:

THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO
ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE WAS CORRECT IN ADMITTING THE
EVIDENCE OF THE PSYCHIATRISTS CALLED TO TESTIFY IN REPLY AS WITNESSES FOR THE
CROWN.

Ground of appeal No. 1 before the Court of
Appeal for Ontario was cited in
the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Ontario as follows:

THE LEARNED TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN ADMITTING
THE EVIDENCE OF THE PSYCHIATRISTS CALLED TO TESTIFY IN REPLY AS WITNESSES FOR
THE CROWN.

[Page 15]

It will be seen that it is exactly the same
ground of appeal.

I have carefully perused the reasons given by
Gale C.J.O. for the dismissal of this ground of appeal. I am in complete agreement
with them and have very little to add. There is one matter, however, upon which
I feel it only proper to express concern.

The appellant, after his arrest on February 1,
1973, was, of course, held in custody. He appeared in police court in the City
of Toronto on February 2, 1973, and on February 9, 1973, for
remand. On each of those occasions, he was taken by detectives of the Toronto
Police Department to be interviewed by a solicitor who was the designated duty
counsel present under the provisions of the Ontario Legal Aid scheme. There is
no other indication of any kind that until after the examinations by Crown
psychiatrists, to which I shall refer, the appellant consulted or retained any
other legal counsel. The duties of the duty counsel under the provisions of the
Ontario Legal Aid scheme are set out in Reg. 557 (R.R.O. 1970) under The
Legal Aid Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 239, and I quote paras. 69 and 89 of such
regulations:

69. Where a person has been taken into
custody or summoned and charged with an offence, he may obtain before any
appearance to the charge the assistance of duty counsel who shall,

(a) advise him of his rights
and take such steps as the circumstances require to protect his rights,
including representing him on an application for remand or adjournment or for
bail or on the entering of a plea of guilty and making representations with
respect to sentence where a plea of guilty is entered;

89. The customary solicitor and client
relationship shall exist between a solicitor and his client.

The Crown called in reply the following
professional witnesses:

Dr. Joseph Thomas Marotta, who testified that on September 5, 1973, he had seen the appellant at the request of Dr. Davidson, a
psychiatrist who had testified on behalf of the defence, and that he had
conducted an EEG examination of the appel-

[Page 16]

lant which examination revealed no abnormality
of any description. It is to be noted that this witness had performed his
service at the request of the defence and I am not dealing further with his evidence.

Dr. Peter Watts Rowsell, who testified that he examined the accused February 9, 1973, at the
Don Jail in Toronto. This
examination was made at the request of counsel for the Crown. There is nothing
to show that the accused had any notice that he was to be so examined nor was
anyone who in any way represented him consulted. Dr. Rowsell gave expert
opinion evidence as to the mental condition of the appellant.

Dr. David Lang Common, the consultant psychiatrist at the Toronto Jail, examined the
appellant at the Toronto Jail on February 12, 1973. He testified that upon seeing the appellant, he introduced himself
and said “I am Dr. Common. I am the jail psychiatrist and I have been asked by
Mr. Whitehead, the superintendent, to examine you”, to which the appellant
replied, “What! Do I have to see another psychiatrist? There is nothing wrong
with me”. Again, there is no evidence that there was any previous notice to the
appellant that such examination would take place nor was anyone consulted on
behalf of the appellant. Again, the witness, Dr. Common, gave expert opinion
evidence as to the mental condition of the appellant.

Dr. Andrew Ian Malcolm examined the appellant on February 10, 1973, in the Don Jail. This
examination was also made at the request of the Crown and Dr. Malcolm reported
immediately to Crown counsel. Again, there is nothing in the evidence that the
appellant had any notice of such examination or that anyone was consulted on
behalf of the appellant.

All of these examinations took place a considerable
time before the appellant appeared on preliminary hearing and there was no kind
of judicial determination whatsoever that such examination should be permitted.
Since it would appear that at the time the examinations took place the
appellant was not in fact represented by counsel, there was no legal
representative with whom the counsel for the Crown could confer.

[Page 17]

It was the submission of counsel for the accused
to the Court of Appeal for Ontario and to this Court that under these circumstances the learned trial
judge should have refused to permit these three last-named witnesses to give
evidence and that a court order should have been obtained on notice prior to
such examinations taking place.

Gale C.J.O., in his reasons for judgment, said:

Although this Court has already pointed out
that it would be preferable for the Crown to seek a Court order for
psychiatrists’ examination of an accused under arrest, and when the accused has
retained counsel to advise defence counsel of their proposal to have a
psychiatrists’ examination of the accused, the Crown’s failure to do so is not
by itself a basis for excluding that evidence.

As I have said, I am in agreement with the
reasons of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario including that statement.

The learned Chief Justice was referring to the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Lafrance[2],
where speaking for the Court, he said:

Complaint was taken that he ought not to
have been so examined without notice to his counsel, or without an order of the
Court. We agree that it would have been better to have had the concurrence of
counsel, or an order of the Court, although in this respect we must point out
that Crown counsel did in fact attempt to obtain the permission of defence
counsel, but went ahead with the examinations when he could not reach him.
However, the evidence was not inadmissible, and we think the learned Judge
could not be said to have exercised his discretion incorrectly, if one was
available to him, in permitting that evidence to be introduced. In this
connection we have in mind the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R.
v. Wray, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 1, 11 D.L.R. (3d) 673, [1971] S.C.R. 272.
For these reasons the appeal will be dismissed.

It is noteworthy that in the Lafrance case
the examination by the psychiatrist to which defence counsel took objection was
made while the accused had been confined in the mental hospital at Pene-

[Page 18]

tanguishene and there may have been some
jurisdiction for a court to make an order under those circumstances. In the
circumstances in the present case, the accused was confined in the Toronto
Jail. I have been unable to discover any provision in the Criminal Code or
elsewhere which would authorize some court to give an order for his examination.

It must be remembered that these examinations
took place prior to the preliminary inquiry and it would appear that in the
opinion of the Crown counsel it was necessary in the due administration of
justice to have these psychiatric examinations at that time. Counsel for the
appellant referred to s. 465 (c), s. 543 and s. 608.2 of the Criminal
Code, but reference to these actions indicates that they are all concerned
with a later period when the accused was at preliminary inquiry, at trial, or
before the Court of Appeal, and I am of the opinion that they are quite
inapplicable to the circumstances in the present appeal.

The interest of the accused in the issue of
whether he should be subject to psychiatric examination and in the form and
content of that examination is, of course, evident. It would appear that a
provision whereby there could be an application made to a designated judicial
officer upon notice to an accused person for an order permitting such
examination would be a proper provision in the protection of the rights and
interests of an accused person. If notice of such an application were given to
an accused person, then the accused person would be in the position where he
could immediately seek advice from a solicitor in reference thereto and would
result in either the retaining of such a solicitor or seeking the services of
legal aid under the various provincial plans. At the present time, it would
seem that all a court can do is to express regret that no court order had been
obtained without being able to point out how such a court order could be
obtained. In the present circumstances, as I have said, I am of the opinion
that the appeal could not succeed.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Capital
murder—Evidence—Admissibility without a voir dire of previous testimony given
by the accused at the preliminary inquiry of an accomplice—Admissibility of
evidence of a similar act—Evidence of mistreatment by the
police—Self-defence—Instructions to the jury—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, ss. 17 and 619(a)—Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10,
s. 5(2).

The appeal is against a decision of the Court
of Appeal of Quebec dismissing
the appeal against a verdict of guilty of capital murder.

There are two main versions of the murder and
of the circumstances preceding and following it. The first version, which tends
to incriminate appellant, was given by him at the preliminary inquiry of an accomplice,
without objection and without requesting the protection of the law. The second
version was given by appellant at his trial. The relevant difference between
the two versions concerns the element of planning: according to the second
version, appellant was caught up in a misadventure which he could not have
foreseen, and in which he took no part except after the murder and under
compulsion. Appellant objects to the admission into evidence of his first
version, alleging that this testimony was extorted from him by threats and
violence. He claims that at his request the presiding judge should have
ascertained by a voir dire that this testimony was free and voluntary
before admitting it in evidence, since the courts have held only that it is
presumed to be free and voluntary.

Appellant also objects to evidence of similar
acts, admitted on rebuttal after a voir dire despite his objections.
Shortly after showing police the location of the grave of the victim of the
murder with which he was charged, appellant directed them to a second grave
where another body had been discovered by accident several days before. More
specifically, appellant claims that this evidence that he knew the location of
the second grave created the suspicion that he had participated in the second
murder. He maintains that even if this evidence were admisssible the presiding
judge

[Page 333]

should have exercised his discretion to
exclude it, because of the damage it caused him, as he did with the evidence of
appellant’s participation in the second murder provided by his testimony at the
Coroner’s inquest regarding the second body, evidence which the Crown also
wanted to present.

Appellant claims to have been denied the
right to a full and complete defence. He objects to the limits which the judge
imposed on the evidence he wished to introduce to persuade the jury to doubt
the probative effect of his first version (which he says was not free and
voluntary because at the time he was under the influence of violence and
threats inflicted on him by the police), by calling witnesses to testify that
they had also been mistreated by the police. The presiding judge allowed this
evidence if it dealt with mistreatment inflicted in the presence of appellant
or to his knowledge, or which was reported to him by the police or others, but
ruled it inadmissible in the case of the mistreatment, if any, which was
inflicted on others without appellant’s knowledge. It is this limitation to
which appellant objects. Appellant also alleges that the judge lacked composure
in presiding over the trial and objects to the aggressiveness of counsel for
the Crown.

Appellant argues in addition that
self-defence should have been submitted to the jury for consideration, and
alleges, finally, that the trial judge gave his opinion on the facts in his
charge to the jury and thereby influenced the verdict.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Appellant’s testimony at the preliminary
inquiry of an accomplice is admissible in evidence at his trial without a voir
dire. The testimony in question was an earlier judicial statement given
under oath, under compulsion of the law and by authority of the court, and the
jury remains free to assess its probative value in view of all the evidence, in
particular of the alleged illegal compulsion. The courts have long made a
distinction between statements made by an accused out of court to persons in
authority and those made in a judicial proceeding. Unlike the former, the
latter do not require the procedure of voir dire, whether or not they
were made under oath or under compulsion of the law and by authority of the
court. Appellant did not succeed in demonstrating the existence of a refutable
presumption that they were free and voluntary or that such a presumption could
be attacked. A witness may request the protection of the law at the time of his
testimony, but he may not do so after the event and this would be the effect of
withdrawal following a voir dire

[Page 334]

In accordance with well-established
principles governing the admissibility of this type of evidence, the evidence
of a similar act admitted by the presiding judge was admissible because the
similarity between the two murders tended to show a system. The prosecution had
to prove premeditation and guilty intent, and this is precisely what a
systematic course of action tends to establish. The testimony given by
appellant at the Coroner’s inquest into the second murder was also admissible
in principle since appellant had testified without requesting the protection of
the law and since nothing showed that appellant had at that time been charged
with the second murder. The presiding judge excluded it, exercising the
discretion recognized in Noor Mohamed v. R., [1949] A.C. 182, and Kuruma v.
R., [1955] A.C. 197, as they were interpreted at the time, but he
would have committed no error in law and would not have abused his discretion
if he had admitted this testimony. The exclusion of this evidence and the
instructions to the jury on the subject caused no prejudice to the defence.
They could only have been to its advantage, by allowing the jury to remain
ignorant of an even more incriminating piece of evidence which could have been
admitted. Appellant cannot possibly object to them.

With regard to the limits imposed on the
evidence of mistreatment by the police, the Court agrees with the trial judge
and the majority in the Court of Appeal that the use, if any, of other
repressive methods unknown to the accused could not have influenced the
testimony he gave at the preliminary inquiry of an accomplice, and that
evidence of this mistreatment was not relevant. Moreover, if four witnesses’
consistent testimony on this question did not change the jury’s verdict,
additional testimony would certainly not have had that effect except by
ultimately turning attention away from the primary issue by simple
accumulation.

The complaint regarding a lack of composure
on the. part of the presiding judge is not a serious one. With regard to the
aggressiveness of counsel for the Crown, it appears that the intemperate
language on both sides did not affect the jury. With regard to self-defence, in
the case at bar the judge would have erred if he had directed the jury to
consider it. Finally, there was nothing unlawful or irregular in the
instructions to the jury.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1]
dismissing an appeal from a conviction for capital murder. Appeal dismissed.

Bernard Lamarche and Michel Denis, for
the appellant.

François Tremblay, for the respondent.

The judgement of the Court was delivered by

BEETZ J.—The appeal, based on s. 619(a)
of the Criminal Code, is against a unanimous decision of the Court of
Appeal of Quebec, which dismissed the appeal brought by appellant against the
verdict of guilty pronounced against him by a jury of the Court of Queen’s
Bench at Quebec City on November 2, 1967, on the following charge:

[TRANSLATION] On or about September 18,
1965, near St-Etienne, in the district of Quebec City, Ovila Boulet, having
planned the said murder, unlawfully and deliberately killed Albéric Bilodeau,
thereby committing capital murder, contrary to ss. 201, 202A(2), 206(1) and 21
of the Criminal Code.

[Page 336]

Appellant was condemned to death but his
sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.

I. The evidence

It is useful to mention at the outset that four
persons were involved in this case: Jean-Jacques Gagnon, who according to his
own testimony fired at the victim; appellant, who again according to his own
testimony was an eyewitness to the murder and helped conceal the victim’s body,
clothing, car and other evidence; André Lamothe, occasional employer of
appellant: according to one version, Lamothe was also a witness to the murder,
while according to other versions he returned to Quebec City before the death
of the victim; and Fernand Quirion, also an occasional associate or employee of
Lamothe: he arranged a meeting with the victim and saw him the day before and
on the day of the murder, but was not present when it occurred.

The victim’s body was found on October 2, 1965
as a result of directions given by appellant, who led the police to the
location, within a swampy woodland, at Gosford road, Saint-Gilles, Lotbinière
County. The grave in which the body was buried was about seventy-five feet from
the road. It was covered by branches. The body was in a more advanced state of
decomposition than could be explained by the two weeks it had been in the
ground: an alkaline substance, probably caustic soda, which when activated by
water dissolves fats and turns them into soap, had been poured into the grave.
In the neck area of the body doctors found a.32 calibre bullet which had been
fired from in front. The bullet had been fired from a revolver which the police
found buried elsewhere, in Ham-Sud, and which, as appears to be uncontested, was
the weapon used to kill Bilodeau; it was a.32 calibre gold-plated revolver. The
body was identified by the fingerprint of the only remaining finger. The victim
was Albéric Bilodeau, of Sainte-Marie de Beauce, a church building painter.

Albéric Bilodeau had previously been the owner
of a hotel which had burned down. Jean-Jacques

[Page 337]

Gagnon admitted under questioning that he had
conspired with Bilodeau to set fire to the hotel. Appellant also admitted, on
cross-examination, that he had pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiring with
Jean-Jacques Gagnon to burn Bilodeau’s hotel.

There are two main versions of the murder and of
the circumstances preceding and following it. The first version is the one
given by appellant on December 2, 1965 at André Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry.
After ascertaining that appellant had given testimony without objecting to
answering on the grounds that his answers could tend to incriminate him, and
without requesting the protection of the law, the presiding judge admitted this
testimony in evidence despite the objections of counsel for the appellant, who
requested a voir dire, because he alleged that this testimony had been
extorted from appellant by violence and threats. The second version is that
which appellant gave at his trial.

According to the first version, Lamothe,
Quirion, Gagnon and appellant met at Lamothe’s home on Friday evening,
September 17, 1965. Gagnon and Quirion had just seen Bilodeau with the purpose
of urging him to deny the statements which he had presumably made to
investigators regarding the burning of his hotel. An offer of $5,000 to
Bilodeau to buy his silence or a retraction of the statements was discussed;
they were to meet with him again. Appellant spent the night in his car in front
of Lamothe’s house. The next morning, September 18, appellant went back to
his home in Cap-Rouge, returned to Quebec City to buy some heating oil and went
to Lamothe’s house. Fernand Quirion came to tell Lamothe and appellant that the
meeting was set for two o’clock in the afternoon. One Roger Arsenault, an
employee of Lamothe, gave the latter a gold-plated revolver and some
cartridges. Lamothe and appellant went to appellant’s house in Lamothe’s
Cadillac. Lamothe borrowed a bucket from appellant, filled it with caustic
soda and put it with a shovel into the trunk of his car.—The bucket and the
shovel were entered as exhibits at the trial.—Lamothe also put a jug of water
from his house in the trunk.

[Page 338]

A little later, Lamothe and appellant went to
meet Gagnon and Quirion. They crossed the Quebec City bridge and went toward
the Hotel St-Henri in Scott together, in Lamothe’s and Quirion’s cars; they
stopped a couple of miles from the hotel. At about two p.m. Quirion went to the
hotel to see whether Bilodeau was there. He was not. Quirion telephoned
Bilodeau’s home; he was out. Finally, they saw Bilodeau in his car going
towards the hotel, accompanied by someone else. Appellant remarked:

[TRANSLATION] “He is bringing a witness. It
could be the police… Don’t go”.

Gagnon
replied:

“One witness more or less doesn’t make any
difference to me”.

and:

“It doesn’t matter whether you get rid of
one or two”.

Lamothe gave the loaded revolver to Gagnon.
Gagnon and Quirion went to the hotel in Quirion’s car. Lamothe and appellant
waited in Lamothe’s car. Quirion came back alone to inform them that Gagnon and
Bilodeau had taken the St-Lambert’s road, and then he left them. Lamothe and
appellant, in Lamothe’s car, caught up to and followed Bilodeau’s car, in which
he was riding alone with Gagnon. The cars stopped on a secondary road.
Appellant heard two shots. He went to Bilodeau’s car and saw Bilodeau’s body on
the front seat. After this point, appellant states that he acted under the
influence of threats from Lamothe and Gagnon. He took the wheel and Gagnon sat
in the back seat. He followed Lamothe’s car to the Saint-Gilles woods. They
carried Bilodeau’s body into the woods. Appellant undressed the body and buried
it after pouring caustic soda into the grave. He did not need to use the jug of
water since the ground was wet. Lamothe and Gagnon left him alone to finish
this job; they went to try to dispose of Bilodeau’s car, which was
blood-stained. Lamothe and Gagnon returned in Lamothe’s car to get appellant.
Appellant brought Bilodeau’s clothing and personal effects and the shovel and
bucket. Along the way, they threw out Bilodeau’s watch, ring and wedding ring.
The clothing was burned later by appellant, at his home, with Gag-

[Page 339]

non’s clothing. Appellant learned from Lamothe
and Gagnon that Bilodeau’s car had run out of gas. Appellant and Gagnon went to
buy gas. In Bilodeau’s and appellant’s cars they went toward Plessisville. On
another secondary road they set fire to Bilodeau’s car with some heating oil.
They had previously removed the licence plates from the car. On the way back,
Gagnon folded the plates and threw them onto the road. These plates were later
found by the police. That evening, Lamothe gave the revolver to appellant and
asked him to put it away. Appellant hid the revolver under his neighbour’s
cottage.

In this testimony, appellant maintained that he
had not known Bilodeau before the incident.

The other version of events was given by
appellant in his defence at his trial. The following is a summary of it.
Appellant did not see Lamothe, Gagnon or Quirion on Friday, September 17, 1965.
He followed them, for no particular reason, on September 18, and with them he
met Bilodeau, whom he did not know, near the Hotel St-Henri in Scott. After
Lamothe and Quirion left, he went with Gagnon and Bilodeau in Bilodeau’s car,
at Gagnon’s request. Gagnon and Bilodeau talked business but appellant only
listened absentmindedly to their discussion. Gagnon and Bilodeau quarrelled.
They decided to stop to urinate by the side of the road. The three men got out.
Bilodeau went toward the trunk of his car, which he opened on the pretext of
getting out some bottles of beer. Bilodeau grabbed a rifle which he pointed at
Gagnon. Gagnon pushed the rifle barrel away which went off hitting no one. Gagnon
pulled out a revolver and fired several times at Bilodeau, who fell dead.
Gagnon and appellant placed the body on the front seat. Appellant advised
Gagnon to report the matter to the police. They went back toward the trunk of
Bilodeau’s car and discovered in it a shovel and a bucket of caustic soda.
There was also another rifle in the car. Gagnon said “He had everything
prepared to kill me; we’ll use it on him.” Gagnon threatened appellant. He told
him

[Page 340]

they had to find a wooded place. They covered a
distance of eight or nine miles, to the St‑Gilles woods. Appellant helped
Gagnon to carry Bilodeau’s body into the woods and removed the clothing from
it. Gagnon buried Bilodeau. Gagnon and appellant then went to get rid of
Bilodeau’s car by setting fire to it. The rest of this testimony is
substantially the same as the first statement made by appellant, except that he
stated that he did not know what Gagnon did with the revolver. Appellant stated
that the shovel and bucket produced as exhibits, which were found at his house
and which he had at first identified as those used to conceal Bilodeau’s body,
were not those which were in fact used for that purpose, since Gagnon had
disposed of those while returning from the St-Gilles woods. Appellant stated
that he did not know that Gagnon was armed. In short, the essence of this
second testimony and of the defence is that appellant found himself caught up
in a misadventure which he could not have foreseen, and in which he took no
part except after Bilodeau’s death and under compulsion from Gagnon. With
respect to his previous testimony, appellant says, it was a web of lies
fabricated by the police; they extracted these lies from him through violence,
including torture which they inflicted on him, and through threats including
threats on his life. The violence was inflicted on him about a month before the
testimony he gave at Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry, but the threat to inflict
the same on him again and the threats on his life were renewed the day before this
preliminary inquiry; moreover, the police had expressly told him not to refuse
to answer on the grounds that his answers could incriminate him, and not to
request the protection of the law. He did, however, request the protection of
the law, on the advice of the Crown attorney, he said, at Lamothe’s and
Gagnon’s trials.

The testimony of Jean-Jacques Gagnon and Fernand
Quirion were substantially to the same effect as appellant’s second testimony.

[Page 341]

The first and second versions of the murder differ
on two main points, of which only the second is relevant for the purposes of
the case at bar: the participation of Lamothe in the murder and the planning.
The first version, if believed, is overwhelmingly against appellant: the secret
meetings of Friday, September 17, 1965, Lamothe obtaining the revolver and
Gagnon receiving this revolver in front of appellant on September 18, the
incriminating remarks of Gagnon and appellant when they saw Bilodeau and a
witness going by, the shovel, the bucket, the caustic soda, the jug of water,
lead irresistibly to the conclusion that the murder was not only premeditated
but carefully prepared with the knowledge and assistance of appellant.

The first version was corroborated on several
points by other testimony.

Neither the defence nor the prosecution
questioned the police officers who were alleged to have mistreated and
theatened appellant. On the other hand, the prosecution attempted to discredit
appellant, Gagnon and Quirion, by bringing up their long record of convictions.

In rebuttal, the prosecution gave evidence of
similar acts. This rebuttal evidence, admitted after a voir dire despite
objections by the defence, was as follows: half or three-quarters of an hour
after showing police the grave where Albéric Bilodeau’s body was found,
appellant directed them to a second grave about a thousand feet from the first.
In this grave, pointed out by appellant, a roads worker had discovered by
accident several days before another body, nude and decomposed by a caustic
substance. The death had probably not occurred more than three months before;
the chest cavity contained two .32 calibre bullets, and the body also bore the
marks of two skull fractures. Identification was possible through a
fingerprint: it was the body of one Paul Brie. On cross-examination, appellant
admitted that he knew Paul Brie. The Crown also wished to introduce in rebuttal
the testimony appellant had given, without requesting the protection of the
law, at the inquest held by the Coroner into Paul Brie’s death. However, the
pre-

[Page 342]

siding judge refused to admit this testimony in
evidence because of the extreme prejudice it would cause to the defence. This
testimony is not in the record; according to what the presiding judge said
about it in his report to the Court of Appeal, appellant in it admitted his
participation in Brie’s murder and stated that it was he who had buried Brie.
The presiding judge allowed the defence to contradict the rebuttal evidence
with further evidence, but warned it that if appellant testified regarding the
second grave he exposed himself to cross‑examination. The defence stated
that its case was closed.

I would add in concluding this summary of the
evidence that, during cross-examination of Gagnon, a third body was mentioned,
found buried in Ham-Sud. It was in Ham-Sud that the police found the
gold-plated revolver. The Crown attorney showed Gagnon a photograph showing
Gagnon above Chandonnet’s grave and read him an extract from earlier testimony,
in which Gagnon had said that he had shot Chandonnet. Gagnon replied that this
testimony was extracted from him by torture and denied having killed
Chandonnet. The part of the statement Gagnon made in court regarding Chandonnet
was given under protection of the law.

II. Arguments in support of the appeal

1. Appellant’s first argument is that the
presiding judge should have ascertained by a voir dire, before admitting
in evidence the accused’s testimony at André Lamothe’s preliminary hearing,
that this testimony was voluntary. According to counsel for the appellant, the
courts have held only that previous testimony is presumed to be free and
voluntary, but this is a presumption which it is open to the accused to rebut
in a procedure comprising several stages:

[TRANSLATION] (a) the Crown moves for the
judge to decide on the admissibility of the statement after a voir dire;

(b) the Crown then puts in evidence that
the accused has made a statement in court;

[Page 343]

(c) the Crown gives evidence on a voir
dire to show that s. 5(2) of the Canada Evidence Act does not
apply to the said statement;

(d) when the Crown has established these
facts, the judge must ask the accused whether he has any defence to offer
before the judge rules on the admissibility of the statement;

(e) if the accused presents no defence on
the voir dire, his statement is then admitted in evidence;

(f) if the accused presents evidence and
succeeds in raising a reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of his
statement, the judge must refuse to admit it in evidence.

Appellant’s factum, at pp. 18-19.

The courts have long made a distinction between
statements made by the accused out of court to persons in authority and those
which are made in a judicial proceeding. The first are admitted in evidence
once the presiding judge has decided alone, without the jury, after a voir
dire, that they were freely and voluntarily made, the onus of proving these
conditions being on the prosecution: R. v. Warickshall[2]; Rex v. Baldry[3]; Ibrahim v. Rex[4]; Piché v. The Queen[5]; Powell v. The Queen[6]. This Court has nevertheless held
that statements made to a person in authority are not inadmissible merely
because they are required by law: (Walker v. The Queen[7]); other courts have, however, ruled
that the obligation imposed by law to make a statement out of court does not
exempt the prosecution from showing on a voir dire that the statement
was not obtained by a constraint other than that of the law: Reg. v.
Cleaveley[8] and
Reg. v. Fex[9]. This
Court did not deal with the question, at least not expressly, in Marshall v.
The Queen[10].

[Page 344]

The situation is different for statements made
by the accused during a judicial proceeding. Some such statements are not made
under oath. This is true, for example, with statements made after a warning,
following a preliminary inquiry, by a person committed for voluntary
examination. It is also true of guilty pleas. The courts have generally held
that statements of this type are admissible in evidence because they are given
voluntarily: Wig-more, On Evidence (3rd edition), Vol. 3, at pp. 298 to
302; Rex v. Lambe[11] Rex
v. James[12]; Rex
v. Bahrey[13]. In
the last case, however, the accused had inadvertently been placed under oath: Reg.
v. Dietrich[14].
Nevertheless, evidence of a guilty plea withdrawn with leave of the court is
inadmissible in a subsequent proceeding: Thibodeau v. The Queen[15].

With respect to statements previously made under
oath by the accused during a judicial proceeding, there is a relative abundance
of longstanding precedents which has consistently held them to be admissible
without evidence that they were made voluntarily. These statements are of two
types: either the law did not require the accused to make them, or they were
given under compulsion of law. Examples of the first type are found in Reg.
v. Coote[16] and
in Reg. v. Brown (No. 2)[17]. In
Coote, the Judicial Committee ruled that a statement that Coote, who was
accused of arson, had made previously without objection before the Fire
Commissioner was admissible. At that time, before enactment of the Canada
Evidence Act, the common law principles by which a witness could refuse to
answer on the ground that his answer would tend to incriminate him were
followed. If a witness agreed to reply to certain questions when he could have
refused to answer for this reason—and, according to the Coote decision,
at p. 605, Coote had in fact refused to reply to several questions—it
could then be said that his testimony was voluntary in the sense that his
answers were

[Page 345]

not given under compulsion of law. In Brown the
accused, charged with murder, was found guilty of manslaughter in a first
trial, but a new trial was ordered by this Court. The issue was whether the
accused’s testimony at the first trial was admissible in evidence at the
second. This Court held that it was, reversing a majority decision of the Court
of Appeal of the Northwest Territories and declaring itself in agreement “in
substance” with the reasons of Johnson J.A., dissenting in the Court of Appeal.
The accused Brown was not required to testify at his first trial; because he
had chosen to do so, his testimony could be considered voluntary. For a similar
conclusion, see also the following cases: Reg. v. Connolly and McGreevy[18]; Rex v. Deakin (No. 2)[19]; Rex v. Drew (No. 2)[20]; Marcotte v. Rex[21]; John McGregor v. Reg.[22]

In support of the first argument counsel for the
appellant cited, inter alia, two passages from Coote and Brown,
which in his submission tend to show that the authorities only presume
that previous testimony of the accused is voluntary:

Coote, at
p. 607:

…the depositions on Oath of a Witness
legally taken are evidence against him, should he be subsequently tried on a
criminal charge, except so much of them as consist of answers to questions to
which he has objected as tending to criminate him, but which he has been
improperly compelled to answer. The exception depends upon the principle “nemo
tenetur seipsum accusare,” but does not apply to answers given
without objection, which are to be deemed voluntary. (Italics are mine.)

Brown, at
pp. 102 and 103:

It is also argued that the rules applicable
to confessions apply to this testimony. It is said that the evidence of the
accused during cross-examination

[Page 346]

could not be said to be voluntarily given.
Confessions obtained by cross‑examination by a person in authority
outside courts have frequently been excluded as not being voluntary; no such
rule has been applied to evidence taken in court. Lord Russell C.J., referring
to, and adopting the Scott case, supra, said (Regina v.
Erdheim, (1896) 2 Q.B., 260 at 267, 18 Cox C.C. 355):

“As to the objection that the statements
were not voluntary, it was held that such an objection does not apply to a
lawful examination in the course of a judicial proceeding.”

It is difficult to see logic in saying that
although the accused may voluntarily give evidence in his own behalf his
evidence assumes the nature of an admission or confession given under
compulsion when cross-examination begins.

…

In the United States, where the power to
grant new trials is pretty general, the practice of admitting such evidence is
well established. In Massachusetts in 1877 Endicott J., speaking for the
Supreme Judicial Court (Commonwealth v. Reynolds (1877), 122 Mass. 454,
at 458) said:

“The statements made by the defendant while
testifying at a former trial were competent, either as admissions or for the
purpose of contradicting him. They were voluntary statements, in regard
to his connection with the transaction, and it is immaterial where or when they
were made”. (Italics are mine.)

In my opinion, these two passages in no way show
the existence of the presumption and the necessity for the procedure which we
are asked to recognize. They mean simply that Coote’s replies and Brown’s
testimony were given voluntarily because the law did not require them to be
given, which is an additional reason to subsequently admit them in
evidence; the primary reason is that these were statements under oath and given
in court, and not confessions. This primary reason is especially apparent in Brown,
where Johnson J.A. refers to the requirement of cross-examination once the
accused has submitted to examination,

[Page 347]

and in R. v. Scott[23], where the accused, charged with
having falsified his books, was confronted by the testimony which he had
previously been forced to give under the Bankruptcy Act.

Scott laid down
the principle that a statement made under oath by the accused during an earlier
judicial proceeding is admissible in evidence against him although it was
obtained under compulsion of the law and by authority of the court. This is the
position of appellant’s statement during Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry. Scott
is even more persuasive in that the witness did not even have the
protection now available under s. 5(2) of the Canada Evidence Act against
subsequent use of his testimony; he was deprived of any protection. The courts
have invariably followed this decision, and clearly it has been followed a
fortiori since the law of evidence was amended to permit the witness to
protect himself against subsequent use of an incriminating statement which he
is compelled to make: Reg. v. Bateman[24]
(admission of a statement made by the accused at a coroner’s inquest); Reg.
v. Hillam[25]
(admission of a statement made by the accused under the compulsion of the Bankruptcy
Act, 1869); R. v. Clark[26] (admission
of a statement made by the accused in testifying at the trial of another
accused); Rex v. Lunan[27] (admission
testimony given by the accused when he was examined under oath by a royal
commission of inquiry); Rex v. Mazerall[28]
(as in Lunan); Tass v. The King[29] (admission of a statement by the
accused testifying at the preliminary inquiry of another accused).

To offset this consistent line of authority,
which is not compatible with the first argument, counsel for the appellant could
not refer this Court to a single decision, English or Canadian, in which

[Page 348]

before admitting in evidence the previous
testimony of the accused a voir dire was held with respect to the
voluntariness of the testimony, or the testimony was declared inadmissible. I
myself found only one decision which appeared to incline toward the first
argument, Wahlberg v. The Queen[30]:
in that case the Court of Appeal of Quebec excluded the statement made by
the accused before the Fire Commissioner; the text of this decision is hardly
more explicit than the summary published in the reports, and it disposes of the
statement at the same time as a confession. The three principal findings read
as follows:

CONSIDERING that evidence was permitted by
the trial judge of admissions or a confession made by Appellant to a police
officer while under constructive detention, and before the Fire Commissioner;
and

CONSIDERING that the circumstances in which
the said confession was obtained give rise to the gravest doubt as to the
voluntary nature of the confession, which doubt the Crown failed to dispel; and

CONSIDERING further that no warning was at
any time given to Appellant that his statements might be used in evidence; and

CONSIDERING therefore that the said
evidence and confession were illegally admitted;

This isolated decision is not conclusive,
because the Court of Appeal did not discuss the question. When the opportunity
was again provided for that Court to discuss it, it decided the opposite: in
the case at bar and Lamothe v. The Queen[31]; in the latter case appellant,
convicted of the murder of Henri-Paul Chandonnet, objected that the presiding
judge had admitted the statement made by Lamothe at the Coroner’s inquest
without a voir dire. The Court of Appeal held that a voir dire was
not necessary and that Lamothe’s previous testimony could be used against him
because Lamothe had testified without requesting the protection of the law. I
would add that, in Tass, the accused had expressly pleaded that it was
necessary to hold a voir dire with respect to the volun-

[Page 349]

tariness of the testimony which he had
previously given; this plea was dismissed, as is clear not from the decision of
this Court but from that of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba: Rex v. Tass[32], at pp. 393 and 399. This ground
was also expressly relied on without success in Lunan and Mazerall. Finally,
in R. v. Drouin[33], a
judge sitting alone admitted in evidence, without holding a voir dire and
despite the objections of the defence, the confessions made by the accused
persons under oath before the Fire Commissioner, and then, deciding as a jury,
he set these confessions aside because he did not think that they met the
requirements of a voluntary statement, and he acquitted the accused. This
Court, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Quebec, dismissed the
Crown’s appeal: the questions of the admissibility of evidence and of its
probative effect are two distinct questions, one of law and the other of fact;
the trial judge ruled the accused’s judicial confessions under oath admissible,
and so it remained only to weigh the probative effect of the confessions, a
question of fact which did not give jurisdiction to this Court. This Court did
not have to decide the point, but it in no way implied that the trial judge had
erred in admitting the judicial confessions of the accused in evidence without
a voir dire.

In my opinion, it is an error to contend that
the law presumes that the accused’s previous statement was voluntary. Either
the accused was not a compellable witness and his testimony was in that sense
freely given, or he was compellable, and in that case he was not free because
he had to answer or be found guilty of contempt of court. However, whether he
testified freely or not he was not free as to his answers: he had to
tell the truth or risk being charged with perjury. That is why it is never
necessary to hold a voir dire with respect to the voluntariness of a
previous statement of the accused given in court.

However, it will be said that in all these
cases, except Drouin, Wahlberg and Lamothe, there was only a
legitimate constraint provided by law and

[Page 350]

imposed by authority of the court. It is still
conceivable for an accused to be exposed, prior to the first testimony, to
unlawful constraint, to threats, to mistreatment which may have caused him not
to tell the truth—because, if he did tell the truth, it was because of his
oath—or not to seek the protection of the law, thereby risking
self-incrimination. Would it not be proper, if the accused requested it, to
hold a voir dire which would allow him to prove that unlawful constraint
vitiated this first testimony to the point where it should not be used against
the accused?

I do not believe so. In my opinion, several
considerations make the accused’s previous testimony admissible as of right,
even if its voluntariness is disputed in the sense that it is allegedly
affected by unlawful constraint.

A statement in court carries more objective
guarantees and involves more important consequences than a mere extra-judicial
confession to a person in authority. It is given in open court and there is
generally no reason to doubt that it in fact was made and was reported
accurately. It is received by a judge who, it must be assumed, has done his
duty and safeguarded the integrity of the proceedings over which he is
presiding. The constraint, if any, cannot be physical and immediate. The
witness may request the protection of the judge who is hearing him, not only
against subsequent incriminating use of his testimony, but also against the
undue pressure to which he alleges he is subject. The testimony is in solemn
form and based on an oath to tell the truth on pain of perjury. The question
whether use of unlawful constraint can excuse perjury under s. 17 of the Criminal
Code is another matter. On the basis of this oath, reports were made,
judgments were pronounced, justice was rendered; men other than the accused
were cleared or condemned, released or sent to trial, found innocent or
criminally responsible for a fire or a homicide, civilly or criminally
acquitted or convicted, and possibly suffered loss of property, reputation,
liberty or even life. Why should the testimony which could involve such
consequences for third parties and for the administration of justice be hidden
from the jury, even if it

[Page 351]

is alleged that testimony is affected by
unlawful constraint?

These considerations override the risk, which is
all it is, of revealing the testimony to the jury, which is still able to
measure its probative effect, and disregard it if it does not believe it
because of the unlawful constraint or for any other reason. It is still open to
the accused to attack his earlier testimony and try to destroy it or lessen its
credibility. The testimony is not necessarily false even though the accused, at
the time he gave it, was subject to two constraints, the unlawful constraint
and the obligation to tell the truth. If the accused now says that this
testimony was false because it was forced from him, he admits his perjury,
whether or not it is excusable, and the function of deciding between
contradictory testimony coming from the same person is one which is clearly
within the competence of the jury rather than that of the judge. It is still
possible that the accused was unlawfully and expressly urged, at the time of
the earlier testimony, to incriminate himself without objecting. The law
provides a safeguard in this matter, but it only provides one: the witness may
request the protection of the law, and he should request it at the time he is
testifying both to prevent subsequent use of his testimony against himself and
to protect the integrity of the testimony which he is called on to give and of
the proceedings in which he gives it. However, the witness is not allowed to
request the protection of the law after the event, which would in practice be
the case if his testimony could subsequently be excluded following a voir
dire.

Appellant’s first ground is ill-founded and must
be rejected.

2. Appellant’s second argument was that the
evidence of a similar act with respect to Paul Brie’s death was inadmissible,
and that even if it were admissible, the presiding judge should have exercised
his discretion to exclude it, because its probative value was tenuous in
comparison to the damage it caused to the accused.

[Page 352]

It may immediately be noted that in the case at
bar the oft-debated question of whether, assuming that evidence of similar acts
were admissible, it could be established by evidence in chief or by rebuttal
evidence, was not raised; in fact, it was established by rebuttal evidence.
However, the presiding judge offered the defence an opportunity to reply to
this rebuttal evidence by further evidence, but the defence did not take that
opportunity.

The principles which determine the admissibility
of evidence of similar acts are still those given by the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council in Makin v. Attorney General for New South Wales[34], at p. 65:

It is undoubtedly not competent for the
prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty
of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of
leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal
conduct or character to have Committed the offence for which he is being tried.
On the other hand, the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to shew the
commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to
an issue before the jury, and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the
question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the
indictment were designed or accidental, or to rebut a defence which would
otherwise be open to the accused.

Evidence of similar acts is not designed to show
that, because he has committed other crimes, the accused probably committed the
act with which he is charged, and in principle it should not be admitted if
that is its only effect. However, although it may have this effect, it is still
admissible if it is relevant to a question which is important to the outcome of
the trial, which is the case, for example, when it establishes the accused’s
state of mind, intent (Leblanc v. The Queen[35]), systematic course of action,
premeditation, and so on.

In the case at bar, the evidence of Paul Brie’s
murder and the circumstances surrounding his burial were, in my opinion, a
classic example of a case where evidence of a similar act should prima

[Page 353]

facie be
admitted. The similarity of the circumstances described above concerning the
deaths and exhumations of Bilodeau and Brie is striking and tends to show a
system. The prosecution had to prove premeditation, and a systematic course of
action has a clear tendency to establish premeditation. On the other hand, the
prosecution was confronted by a defence which had several aspects. One of these
was that appellant found himself caught up by accident in an unforeseeable
misadventure, and that as a result his intent was innocent, since he in no way
willed the victim’s death. Evidence of a similar act showing a systematic
course of action, premeditation and guilty intent is admissible to rebut such a
defence. Another aspect of the defence, intended to explain how appellant and
Gagnon found the caustic soda after Bilodeau’s death and not before it, was
that not only was the victim the aggressor, but that he had himself planned to
murder Gagnon, going as far as providing himself with caustic soda to dispose
of the body. With respect to a defence which turned to its advantage part of
the same evidence which the prosecution had introduced in attempting to
establish premeditation on the part of the accused, the similar act evidence
presented the jury with, inter alia, the following question: if Bilodeau
had in fact formed the plan to murder Gagnon and bury him in a grave covered in
caustic soda, and if Bilodeau had been caught in his own trap, he nevertheless
could not have chosen his own place of burial; by what remarkable coincidence
was there, at the place chosen by appellant and Gagnon for that purpose,
another grave containing the body of a man known to appellant, killed in the
same manner as Bilodeau and also burned with a caustic substance? The similar
act evidence was relevant and at the very least admissible as rebuttal
evidence: even if it had the effect of reinforcing or confirming the evidence
in chief, that was not its purpose, which was to rebut the evidence of
premeditated aggression by the victim, in particular the evidence that the
victim was carrying in the trunk of his car enough caustic soda to burn a body.

[Page 354]

In fact, appellant objects primarily not to the
similar act evidence, but to the evidence of that act “as presented”:
the similar act was directly related to the accused but not so as to show
that he participated in it. The similarity created the suspicion that the
accused had participated in Brie’s murder or the concealment of his body, since
he knew the location of the grave, but it did not prove the participation of
the accused in Brie’s murder.

However, this evidence existed. The prosecution
wished to present the jury with it, but the presiding judge prohibited it, in
order not to unduly burden the accused. He expressed his view in his report to
the Court of Appeal as follows:

[TRANSLATION] TO refute this evidence of accident,
and to establish the possibility of a systematic course of action and even of mens
rea on the part of Boulet, I admitted the similar act evidence, that is,
that on the same day that Boulet led the police officers to Bilodeau’s grave,
he led them a few hundred feet from that spot, about an hour later, and showed
them another grave in which a body was found, nude and burned by caustic soda
like that of Bilodeau. This body was formally identified as that of a certain
Brie, who was a casual labourer for Boulet’s accomplices.

However, I did not allow the Crown to
introduce other testimony that Boulet had given at the Coroner’s inquest into
Brie’s death, when he stated without even requesting the protection of the
Court that, in short, he had been an accomplice in the murder of Brie, and that
it was he again in this case who had interred him.

Since he was found criminally responsible
for this death at the Coroner’s inquest, and was not assisted during that
testimony, I felt that the statements which the Crown wished to introduce would
probably cause considerable harm to the defence, disproportionate to the act
which the Crown wished to prove, that is, the similar act of pointing out
Brie’s grave, evidence which was already before the jury.

On the other hand, I informed the jury as
clearly as possible of the meaning that such evidence could have, that is, that
the directions Boulet gave in the cases of Bilodeau and Brie did not mean that
it was Boulet who had killed and buried Bilodeau and Brie, but was only
evidence that Boulet had knowledge of the existence of these graves, evidence
from which the jury clearly could draw the conclusions they saw fit.

[Page 355]

With respect to the instructions to the jury on
this point, the gist of them was as follows:

[TRANSLATION] It was requested, I admitted
this evidence, that evidence be introduced of similar acts, that is, that
Boulet’s directions had been followed to a little farther in the same area, on
the same morning, because similar acts, the circumstances of time and place, in
respect of similar acts, are important, the thing must not have occurred ten
months later, but there it was a whole, they had led him to a place where he
pointed out a grave, a thousand and some feet away, a grave which was then
empty, but the evidence showed later that another body had been found in that
grave, which was identified—at least if you accept the evidence that this is in
fact so, it is not for me to say—and which was apparently in the same condition
as Bilodeau, nude and with… burned by caustic soda, according to the testimony
of Dr Authier.

This does not mean, gentlemen of the jury,
that it was Boulet who killed them, nor does it even mean simply that it was
Boulet who had put them there. This means that you must conclude from these
similar acts that Boulet had knowledge of the existence of those things, and
then you may deduce that that rebuts a defence of accident, that it can
establish a systematic course of action, this is why the law permits it.

From those acts you should conclude that
Boulet had knowledge. Why did he have it? Ah! It is for you to decide that. How
is it that there was a second grave there, how is it that he knew that Bilodeau
[Brie (?)] was buried there? That similarity may also allow you to draw
conclusions as to the reason he should know what had happened there. It is for
you to do it, to draw those conclusions. (Parenthesis mine.)

In my opinion, if the sole purpose of the
similar act evidence was to rebut the defence of accident and to establish a
systematic course of action on the part of the accused, it would have been
logical to also admit in evidence the testimony given by appellant at the
Coroner’s inquest into Brie’s death. This testimony was admissible in principle
since appellant had testified without requesting the protection of the law and
that nothing showed that appellant had been at that time charged with

[Page 356]

Brie’s murder (Batary v. A.G. for Sask.[36]). This testimony not only showed
that appellant knew the location of Brie’s grave, but implicated him directly
in the murder. The presiding judge excluded this evidence, exercising the
discretion recognized in Noor Mohamed v. Rex[37] and Kuruma v. Reg.[38], as they were interpreted at the time.

In my opinion, the presiding judge would have
committed no error in law and would not have abused his discretion if he had
permitted the prosecution to introduce the evidence given by appellant at the
inquest held by the Coroner into Brie’s death. The exclusion of this evidence
and the instructions to the jury on the subject caused no prejudice to the
defence; to the contrary, they could only have been to its advantage, by
allowing the jury to remain ignorant of an even more incriminating piece of
evidence which could have been admitted. Appellant cannot object to its not
being admitted.

Appellant’s first two arguments were the only
ones that his counsel argued orally, although he specified that he was not
abandoning the others, which were mentioned in his factum.

The third, fourth and fifth arguments related to
the right to a full and complete defence, which appellant claims he was denied.

3. The third argument challenged the limits
which the judge imposed on the evidence which appellant wished to introduce, to
persuade the jury to doubt the probative effect of the testimony he had given
at Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry. The defence wished to call a number of
witnesses to testify that they also had received mistreatment at the hands of
the police. The presiding judge allowed this evidence if it dealt with mistreatment
inflicted in the presence of appellant or to his knowledge, or which was
reported to him by the police or others. Therefore, Gagnon, Quirion and one
Sicotte gave testimony on this point. However, this evidence was ruled
inadmissible in the case of the mistreatment, if any, which was inflicted on

[Page 357]

others without appellant’s knowledge. Appellant
objects to this limitation.

Of the five judges of the Court of Appeal who
unanimously dismissed the appeal only Montgomery J.A. found merit in this argument,
but he did not consider it decisive:

I agree with the trial judge that he was
not entitled to bring before the court any person who might be prepared to
state that at one time or another he had been maltreated by the police, but
what Appellant was seeking to establish was something far more specific: that
other persons accused of this murder or related offences were systematically
beaten by the same policemen during the same period and in the same premises
and that this was generally known to those who were being held by the police in
connection with these offences.

I might be disposed to order a new trial on
the above ground were it not for the fact that, despite the trial judge’s
ruling, evidence was in fact made before the jury that three of the Appellant’s
associates, namely his witnesses Gagnon, Quirion and Sicotte, were beaten by
the police. The Crown countered this evidence by discrediting these witnesses,
all of whom had criminal records, but did not produce as witnesses any of the
policemen named or bring any other evidence in refutation. In view of this, I
doubt that any further evidence that Appellant might have made regarding the
alleged system would have persuaded the jury to accept the version of the facts
that Appellant gave at his trial.

In the present state of jurisprudence, it
appears that any such evidence of coercion could not have led to the complete
rejection of the declaration previously made; it could merely give the jury
reasons for viewing it with scepticism. In my opinion, the jury accepted the
earlier version not because they believed that it was given freely and
voluntarily but because it was plausible and to some extent corroborated by
other evidence and because the later version appeared incredible.

While I am not entirely satisfied with the
conduct of the trial, I am of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred. I therefore agree with my colleague that
we should dismiss this appeal.

I agree with the trial judge and the majority in
the Court of Appeal that the use, if any, of other

[Page 358]

repressive methods unknown to the accused could
not have influenced the testimony he gave at Lamothe’s preliminary inquiry, and
that evidence of this mistreatment was not relevant. Moreover, if four witnesses’
consistent testimony on this question, including that of appellant, did not
change the jury’s verdict, I do not see how additional testimony would have had
that effect except by ultimately turning attention away from the primary issue
by simple accumulation.

4. Appellant’s fourth argument was that the
judge lacked composure in presiding over the trial. This complaint is not a
serious one. The Court of Appeal’s opinion was as follows:

[TRANSLATION] With respect to the attitude
of the judge presiding at the trial, it should be noted that if the judge from
time to time made severe comments to counsel for the appellant it was because
the latter provoked numerous long debates before the jury, which were often
acrimonious and futile, and several times showed tenacity of an offensive kind,
to say the least, putting the judge’s patience to many severe tests.

I am of the opinion that appellant had a
fair trial, that he suffered no significant prejudice and that the verdict was
justified by the evidence.

I would add that counsel for the appellant
repeatedly refused to accept the rulings of the trial judge, who had to assert
his authority and maintain control of the proceedings in a difficult
atmosphere. In my opinion he did so with the firmness necessary in the circumstances
and without losing his composure.

5. In his fifth argument, appellant objects to
the aggressiveness of counsel for the Crown. Their behaviour was not above
reproach, especially with respect to the epithets which they used in referring
to defence witnesses. They replied in exaggerations opposite to those used by
counsel for the defence, exaggerations which breached propriety. The lack of
moderation on both sides in the choice of words, while reprehensible, included
no statement of fact and as such did not relate to the evidence. Moreover, at
the beginning of his charge to the jury, the presiding judge alluded to the
climate in which the trial had taken place, to control of tempers, to

[Page 359]

counsel’s emotionalism, and his remarks were
clearly designed to neutralize the possible effect of some intemperate
language. I do not believe that in the context the jury could have attached
importance to this intemperance.

6. Appellant’s sixth argument was that the
presiding judge did not explain to the jury that Gagnon could have been acting
in self-defence when he killed Bilodeau. According to this theory, no crime
would have been committed by Gagnon or by appellant.

Gagnon was the first to use the word
“self-defence” in his testimony. However, he admitted that he had not relied on
this defence at his own trial for Bilodeau’s murder. Counsel for the appellant
at the trial also referred several times in his pleadings to what he called the
“theory” of self-defence. At best, however, this would be a secondary defence,
which moreover could not be urged without compromising the primary position
which tended to dissociate appellant from Gagnon.

When the presiding judge, after his charge to
the jury, invited counsel to bring to his attention omissions or errors which
he might have made, counsel for the appellant submitted another complaint to
him but did not in any way refer to self-defence, nor was there any question of
self-defence in the notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal, which did not
mention it in its decision.

In any case, the trial judge would have erred,
in my opinion, if he had directed the jury to consider this particular defence.
Even if the testimony of appellant and Gagnon was accepted as true, it did not
open the way to that defence: Bilodeau was alone against two people; the barrel
of the rifle he had pointed at Gagnon was pushed aside by the latter; the rifle
went off, and Gagnon then fired more than once at Bilodeau. This is not a
situation in which, in law, Gagnon was acting in self-defence.

7. Appellant’s seventh and last argument was
that the trial judge gave his opinion on the facts in

[Page 360]

his charge to the jury in such a way as to
influence the jury’s verdict. This complaint is also without basis. Even though
one might suspect or guess his opinion on certain specific facts in reading the
analysis of the evidence made by the trial judge, there is nothing unlawful or
irregular in that: the trial judge clearly outlined his role and that of the
jury, and repeated his instructions to the jury that they should not consider
his opinion on questions of fact. Following are examples of these instructions:

[TRANSLATION) If while I am speaking to
you you could have had or could now have the impression or the feeling that by
my attitude, my words, my actions… I may have suggested to you that I have an
opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, you may not consider it…
If by chance you may have had the idea that I have an opinion, I implore you in
conscience not to consider it.

It is the duty of the judge to draw the
jury’s attention to certain parts of the evidence, or to certain comments on
the testimony… That does not mean that what the judge says must be accepted by
you… I want this to be your decision and I do not want it to be influenced by
me.

I would also reject this last argument and I
would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Murder—Trial by judge without a
jury—Stricter standard of proof than required applied to particular elements of
evidence—Discretion properly exercised under s. 9(2) of Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1970 ,c. E-10.

On a charge of murder, the accused elected to
be tried by a judge without a jury under the provisions of s. 430 of the Criminal
Code. The trial judge found the accused not guilty. The Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court of Alberta allowed an appeal by the Crown and directed a
new trial. An appeal by the accused was then brought to this Court.

The judgment of the Appellate Division was
based on the following grounds: (1) the trial judge had failed to exercise
properly his discretion under the provisions of s. 9(2) of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10; (2) the references to motive in
the reasons for judgment of the trial judge do not represent the law on this
subject and (3) the trial judge had, on several occasions, assigned a burden of
proof to the Crown which was “far more stringent” than the burden put upon the
Crown in law.

Held: (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ: There was no misuse of the
trial judge’s discretion, under s. 9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, in
the direction he gave as to how a witness who was called by the Crown should be
examined before leave would be given for Crown counsel to cross-examine him as
to an inconsistent statement previously made.

The two other grounds of the judgment
appealed from could be summarized by saying that the trial judge misdirected
himself as to the standard of proof required. He fell into a double error, not
only did he apply repeatedly a much stricter standard than that which is

[Page 749]

required, but he applied it to particular
elements of the evidence taken in isolation. Instead of taking all the evidence
and properly relating every fact to all the others, he dealt separately with
each discarding them successively as insufficient to meet his exaggerated
standard of proof.

In a charge to a jury, the failure of the
trial judge to mention a large part of the incriminating evidence, to relate it
properly to the rest and to instruct the jurors that the whole must be
considered together in deciding whether there is proof beyond reasonable doubt,
would certainly constitute misdirection requiring a new trial. There was no
reason to hold otherwise in the case of a judge sitting without a jury. The
judgment in this case showed serious misdirection and not mere slips. The Court
of Appeal properly singled out as specially serious the manner in which
incriminating statements made to police officers were swept aside because each
of them taken separately did not prove anything beyond “any peradventure of
doubt” or “beyond any shadow of a doubt”.

Per Laskin
C.J., Spence and Dickson JJ., dissenting: The trial judge, preparatory to
exercising his discretion under s. 9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, considered
that the witness should have his memory refreshed and have an opportunity to
read his alleged inconsistent statement. Counsel for the Crown resisted that
reasonable request and, therefore, the trial judge exercised his discretion to
refuse to permit the Crown counsel to cross-examine his own witness. That
course could not be considered to be the failure to exercise his discretion in
a judicial manner.

There was no error in the trial judge’s
statement that the absence of motive is usually considered on the side of
innocence nor in his statement that if it is believed that it has been proven
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime of which he is
accused or if there is a reasonable doubt that he committed the crime the
matter of motive or absence of a motive becomes unimportant. Since the trial
judge used the words “After consideration of all of the evidence” and
since a very large part of the evidence at trial was concerned solely with the
question of motive, the submission by Crown counsel that what the trial judge
was saying was that if he considered all of the circumstances apart from the
evidence of motive and had a reasonable doubt then the evidence of motive was irrelevant,
could not be accepted.

[Page 750]

The third ground of the Appellate Division’s
judgment should be rejected. Under the circumstances, following the words used
by Crown counsel in his address, the trial judge’s use in his reasons for
judgment of the terms “beyond any peradventure of doubt”, “conclusively” and
“beyond any shadow of a doubt” cannot indicate his burdening of the Crown with
any stricter standard of truth than the criminal law requires. The trial judge
did not make findings of fact unsupported by the evidence. He merely drew
inferences from the evidence as he was entitled to do.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division, setting aside an acquittal by MacDonald J.,
sitting without a jury, on a charge of murder. Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J.,
Spence and Dickson JJ. dissenting.

A.M. Harradence, Q.C., for the appellant.

D.C. Abbott and J. Franklin, for the
respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and
Dickson JJ. was delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta
pronounced on November 12, 1975.

The appellant had been charged by indictment as
follows:

Albert Stewart, you stand charged that you
on or about the 13th day of August, A.D. 1973, at the City of Edmonton, in the
said Judicial District did kill and slay Marion Hilda Parker, thereby
committing murder punishable by life imprisonment, contrary to the provisions
of the Criminal Code.

At the commencement of the trial, H.J.
Mac-Donald J., stated:

Mr. Stewart has elected to be tried
with a judge alone.

That statement was confirmed immediately
thereafter by the counsel for the accused and by the accused himself. Such a
course is possible under

[Page 751]

the provisions of s. 430 of the Criminal
Code which reads:

430.
Notwithstanding anything in this Act, an accused who is charged with an
indictable offence in the Province of Alberta may, with his consent, be tried
by a judge of the superior court of criminal jurisdiction of Alberta without a
jury.

The trial proceeded at once and on November 9,
1974, H.J. MacDonald J. found the accused, the present appellant, not guilty
for reasons which he dictated. The Appellate Division, by its judgment
aforesaid, allowed an appeal by the Crown and directed a new trial. Sinclair
J.A. gave the reasons for the Court and based his judgment upon three factors.
Firstly, the learned justice on appeal found that the trial judge had failed to
exercise properly his discretion under the provisions of s. 9(2) of the Canada
Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10.

The Crown had called as a witness one Gordon
Andersen and had examined this witness in chief for some time when counsel for
the Crown made the following statement:

Now, My Lord, at this stage I am making
application under Section 9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act. I advise Your
Lordship that the witness has made a statement, previous statement, which I
submit is inconsistent with what he is now telling the Court, and in that
regard, sir, I have the case of Regina vs. Milgaard, M-i-l-g-a-a-r-d, which is
a decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, the judgment of the Court
delivered by the Chief Justice Culliton, and it is found in 1971 2 Canadian Criminal
Cases, at 206. I refer you to this decision, My Lord, because it contains a
suggested procedure which I would urge Your Lordship to adopt here.

The learned trial judge expressed the view that
prior to permitting the cross-examination of a witness on the basis that he had
previously made an inconsistent statement, the counsel for the Crown should
refresh the memory of the witness as to the making of such statement and permit
the witness to read that statement, being of the opinion that had such a procedure
been followed the witness might well have acknowledged that he had made the
previous statement and that that statement was true. The learned trial judge
said:

[Page 752]

I feel that any witness, knowing the
frailties of the human mind, that the witness, without being cross-examined,
should be examined carefully in direct examination and the questions put to
him, if necessary, in a variety of ways, and that should be exhausted before we
get into trying to get the evidence in some other manner. I am not going to
accept the proposition of the Crown that they can call a witness and then
almost immediately start cross-examining him under Section 9(2). Surely the
section is there as a remedy or as a means of obtaining evidence that
cannot be obtained in some other way, but we must exhaust the other ways of
doing it first, and then I am prepared, if the Crown wants to move that the man
be declared hostile or they want to take advantage of Section 9(2), to give it
every consideration.

and later gave the specific direction:

and, I think, in fairness, I would direct
that we carry on as I have suggested.

Counsel for the Crown, upon Andersen returning
to the witness stand, simply proceeded with his examination-in-chief and did
not present the witness with any previous inconsistent statement.

Sinclair J.A., in his reasons for judgment for
the Appellate Division, said:

In our opinion, it is clear from the record
that in dealing with the evidence of the witness Gordon Andersen, the learned
trial judge misconstrued s. 9(2), and failed to appreciate the purpose for
which the subsection was added to the Canada Evidence Act in 1968‑69.
He failed to draw a distinction between the objectives of subsection (1),
on the one hand, and subsection (2), on the other. Consequently he failed
to exercise the discretion given to him by s. 9(2) in a judicial manner.
This is particularly significant in view of the learned trial judge’s remarks
concerning the evidence of Andersen made during the course of his judgment.

With respect, I differ with the learned justice
on appeal. It was agreed that under the provisions of s. 9(2) of the Canada
Evidence Act the learned trial judge had a discretion as to whether he
would permit counsel to cross-examine his own witness. The learned trial judge,
preparatory to exercising his discretion, considered that the witness should
have his memory refreshed and have an opportunity to read his alleged
inconsistent statement. Counsel for the Crown resisted that reasonable request
and, therefore, the learned trial judge exer-

[Page 753]

cised his discretion to refuse to permit the
Crown counsel to cross-examine his own witness. I am quite unable to see how
that course could be considered to be the failure to exercise his discretion in
a judicial manner. I might add that although the complete allegedly
inconsistent statement does not appear in the record, the references to it in
the discussion between the learned trial judge and counsel for the Crown and
for the accused would seem to indicate that it is highly doubtful that the
learned trial judge should have found it to be an inconsistent statement. It
was a statement which was not as complete as the evidence which the witness
gave at his trial but there is nothing, so far as one could see from reading
the relevant evidence, that contradicts the evidence given at trial.

The second ground upon which Sinclair J.A. based
his reasons for judgment was the references to motive in the reasons for
judgment of the learned trial judge. Sinclair J.A. quoted that part of the learned
trial judge’s judgment as follows:

“Speaking of motive first. Were there a
jury I would say something along these lines in dealing with motive: The proof
of motive for an alleged crime is permissible and it is often valuable but
never essential. The evidence of motive is sometimes of assistance in removing
doubt and completing proof. Motive is a circumstance, but nothing more than a
circumstance, to be considered. The absence of motive is usually a circumstance
to be considered but on the side of innocence and to be given such weight as is
deemed proper. After consideration of all the evidence if it is believed that
it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the
crime of which he is accused or if there is a reasonable doubt that he
committed the crime the matter of motive or absence of a motive becomes
unimportant.”

And commented:

With respect, it is difficult to understand
what the trial judge meant to say by the last two sentences of the remarks just
quoted, but, in our view, they do not represent the law on this subject,
particularly in a case where there is evidence of threats against the deceased
having been made.

Again, with respect, I am unable to find fault
with the learned trial judge’s reasons. It is true that in those reasons there
is a certain degree of

[Page 754]

looseness which might result in a lack of
clarity but it must be remembered that the learned trial judge was not charging
a jury but was, rather informally, at the close of the trial, giving his
reasons for the acquittal of the accused. The last two sentences to which
Sinclair J.A. referred were, firstly:

The absence of motive is usually a
circumstance to be considered but on the side of innocence and to be given such
weight as is deemed proper.

Surely, it is true, as the learned trial judge
pointed out earlier, evidence of motive is always admissible and therefore the
absence of evidence of motive is a circumstance to be considered. Since the
absence of any evidence of motive would seem to make it less probable that the
accused did commit the act, such absence of evidence is usually considered on
the side of innocence. I find nothing in error in that sentence.

Secondly, that is the second sentence, was:

After consideration of all the evidence if
it is believed that it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused committed the crime of which he is accused or if there is a reasonable
doubt that he committed the crime the matter of motive or absence of a motive
becomes unimportant.

With respect, what the learned trial judge was
saying was that if it was found beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did
the act with the necessary mens rea then his motive for so doing was
irrelevant, and if, on the other hand, there was a reasonable doubt that the accused
did do the act with the necessary mens rea then even the presence of a
motive did not permit his conviction. That is a very trite statement of
ordinary law.

Counsel for the Crown attempted to persuade this
Court that what the learned trial judge was saying was that if he considered
all of the circumstances apart from the evidence of motive and had a reasonable
doubt then the evidence of motive was irrelevant. Since the learned trial judge
used

[Page 755]

the words “After consideration of all of
the evidence” (the underlining is my own), and since a very large part of the
evidence at trial was concerned solely with the question of motive, one could
not possibly attribute the meaning which Crown counsel advanced to the sentence
uttered by the learned trial judge. For these reasons, I find the judgment of
the Appellate Division in error as to this second ground.

The third ground upon which Sinclair J.A. based
his reasons for judgment was his view that the learned trial judge had, on
several occasions, assigned a burden of proof to the Crown which was “far more
stringent” than the burden put upon the Crown in law.

The learned trial judge used, in his charge,
certain words. Firstly, referring to the Crown’s evidence adduced as to
statements made to police officers, he said:

and if these statements were to be relied
on, then the statement or statements must convince the Court, beyond any
peradventure of doubt, that the accused is guilty of the charge. It isn’t a
matter of whether the accused was telling the truth or not telling the truth,
simply that there is no burden placed on the accused to prove his innocence,
that the entire burden is on the Crown to present evidence that conclusively
shows that the accused is guilty of the offence.

(The italics are my own.)

In the concluding half of the next paragraph of
his reasons, the learned trial judge said:

We are asked to put it together with the
statement that he made to Detective Hecht on the way back in the plane, that
“the main evidence is gone”. The Court is asked to conclude or to infer that he
must have been talking about the rifle that killed Mrs. Parker. There is
no evidence to show what he was talking about, there is nothing in front of me
that I feel that forces me to conclude, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that
it was the rifle he was speaking of when he mentions this. I feel that to
convict the accused were you to rely almost entirely on that would be to infer
more than what the statement itself suggests should be inferred.

(The italics are my own.)

The italicized expressions are those to which
the Appellate Division took objection and which the

[Page 756]

Appellate Division considered to be the
application of a much more stringent burden of proof than required by the
criminal law. A reading of this section of the reasons for judgment
demonstrates that there the learned trial judge was dealing with the probative
value of evidence that the accused had made certain statements to police
officers. Counsel for the Crown had stressed the weight of those statements in
his submission and had gone so far as to say:

Then, sir, you have the incident of the
plane, and this was some hours after the interview by Detective Hecht, and he
was sitting there and nothing was being said and the accused has had these
several hours to consider his statements to Detective Hecht and the subject
must have been on his mind. Out of the blue, to use my learned friend’s
suggestion, to Detective Hecht, the term he used, he says “Just between you and
me, the main evidence is gone”. Surely the only inference there to draw, My
Lord, is that he is referring to the firearm. No weapon was found.

In short, the Crown was putting to the learned
trial judge the submission that the only possible inference which could be
drawn from that evidence was that the accused was referring to the actual
weapon used to cause the victim’s death. It was quite evidently the view of the
learned trial judge that there was no such irresistible inference to be drawn
from the evidence and remembering again that he was giving reasons for judgment
and not charging a jury, his use of the stronger terms of “beyond any
peradventure of doubt”, “conclusively” and “beyond any shadow of a doubt” were
mere reflections of the positive nature of the Crown’s submission which could
be characterized as a submission that the matter had been proved in any of
those three strong fashions. In the very next paragraph, the learned trial
judge describing the onus said:

The decision of the Court must be made, of
course, on the evidence that has been presented. That evidence itself, no
matter how suspicious it is, must, when one considers everything that has been
said and what weight can be given to it it must convince the mind and satisfy
the conscience to the extent that no other rational conclusion could be
reached. I feel that in this case that there is room for a reasonable doubt.
There are, of course, a number of things that have not been explained,

[Page 757]

the fact they have not been explained does
not entitle one to place any burden on the accused.

And two paragraphs later when concluding his
reasons, the learned trial judge again referred to the recognized standard of
“beyond a reasonable doubt”.

Under the circumstances to which I have
referred, I can find no reason for a new trial in the learned trial judge’s use
of the three above-mentioned sets of words in his reasons for judgment.

A fourth ground was mentioned by Sinclair J.A.
in his reasons for judgment but the learned justice on appeal found it
unnecessary to deal with it in view of his finding as to the other three
reasons and that ground was that the learned trial judge erred in his
application of the rule in Hodge’s case.

In this Court, counsel for the respondent Crown
seemed to put this ground more on the basis that the learned trial judge, in
finding that he had a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, based his
conclusion on facts which were not substantiated by the evidence. Counsel for
the Crown outlined five different statements made by the learned trial judge in
his reasons all of which he alleged were not made on a basis of any evidence.
Without going through them in detail, I am strongly of the view that in each
one of the cases the learned trial judge was drawing an inference which a
finder of fact could draw from the evidence. For example, a consideration of
the injuries to the victim might lead a trier of fact to conclude that those
injuries had occurred in a struggle. It might well be that the counsel for the
Crown or members of the Appellate Division, or even members of this Court,
would not find that such an inference was a proper one from the evidence, but
we are not triers of fact. That was a task put upon the learned trial judge
under the unusual provisions of s. 430 of the Criminal Code and I
do not think that any appellate court is free to vary the findings of fact made
by the learned trial judge or inferences which the learned trial judge drew
from the evidence unless one can say that there was no evidence upon which the
learned trial judge could make such a finding. Counsel for the Crown was unable
to put any of

[Page 758]

the incidents to which he referred in that
class. I am, therefore, not ready to concur in this additional ground of appeal
which was urged in the Appellate Division but not dealt with.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal,
quash the judgment of the Appellate Division, and restore the judgment of the
learned trial judge directing the acquittal of the accused.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This appeal is from a judgment of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta setting aside an acquittal
pronounced by a judge sitting without a jury, with the consent of the accused,
on a charge of murder.

The judgment in appeal rests on three grounds.
The first is that the trial judge misconstrued s. 9(2) of the Canada
Evidence Act and failed to exercise in a judicial manner the discretion
given to him by that provision. In what respect the trial judge was thus in
error is not stated. At the hearing, counsel for the Crown complained of the
direction given as to how the witness should be examined before leave would be
given to cross-examine him as to an inconsistent statement previously made. I
fail to see any misuse of the trial judge’s discretion in the direction which
he gave. It was for him to decide whether the cross-examination on the
statement would be permitted. I cannot see why this would not include the power
to require examination along certain lines before the discretion would be
exercised in favour of allowing the cross-examination. In my view, no case was
made for considering such direction as an abuse of the power implicit in the
discretion to grant or to refuse leave to cross-examine.

The two other grounds are much more serious and
I find it desirable to deal with them together. They can be summarized by
saying that the trial judge misdirected himself as to the standard of proof
required. While in the end, he properly spoke of proof “beyond any reasonable doubt”,
twice before, in dealing with particular elements of the evidence, he referred
to a much higher standard.

[Page 759]

Dealing with statements made by the accused to
police officers, he said:

…if these statements were to be relied on,
then the statement or statements must convince the Court, beyond any
peradventure of doubt, that the accused is guilty of the charge. (Italics
added.)

Again, dealing with a statement to a police
officer that “the main evidence is gone”, he said:

There is no evidence to show what he was
talking about, there is nothing in front of me that I feel that forces me to
conclude, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that it was the rifle he was
speaking of when he mentions this. (Italics added.)

In my view, the trial judge fell into a double
error, not only did he apply repeatedly a much stricter standard than that
which is required, but he applied it to particular elements of the evidence
taken in isolation. In other words, instead of taking together all the evidence
and properly relating every fact to all the others, he dealt separately with
each discarding them successively as insufficient to meet his exaggerated
standard of proof. This is the error in which he fell in the somewhat equivocal
reasoning whereby, at the outset, he practically swept aside the evidence of
motive, saying:

The proof of motive for an alleged crime is
permissible and it is often valuable but never essential. The evidence of
motive is sometimes of assistance in removing doubt and completing proof.
Motive is a circumstance, but nothing more than a circumstance, to be
considered. The absence of motive is usually a circumstance to be considered
but on the side of innocence and to be given such weight as is deemed proper.
After consideration of all the evidence if it is believed that it has been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime of which
he is accused or if there is a reasonable doubt that he committed the crime the
matter of motive or absence of a motive becomes unimportant.

After this, the trial judge went on to mention
not mere evidence of motive but evidence of plan and design. He said:

In this case, to begin with, we have the
evidence of several witnesses, Mr. Serby, Gay Parker and her sister Edith
Parker and Gordon Andersen who mentioned that

[Page 760]

the accused made statements indicating or
stating that he was going to kill the victim and it is suggested by the Crown
that this proves a plan, a design, an obsession and yet no one of these
witnesses when they heard these statements made and when they heard them
repeated apparently considered that there was any danger involved. No complaint
was made to the police and nothing was done to protect the victim from what
they allege. The Court was asked to conclude there was a serious plan or
design.

I think the evidence of Gordon Andersen was
reliable evidence and I place some weight on it. He indicated that the mention
of killing he took as a rather flippant statement, he felt the man was joking.

Like the Court of Appeal, I wish to avoid going
into any detailed discussion of the evidence, but I must point out that there
was evidence that the accused had worked on making a silencer and gone to a
quarry for testing one which had exploded, that the victim had been shot in her
apartment and nothing but clicks heard by neighbors. There was also evidence
that shortly before the murder was committed, the accused had bought traveller
cheques with his savings, that afterwards, he had gone east as far as Winnipeg
as he had said he would when talking of his intention to kill the woman he had
recently deserted, that when he was arrested, rubber gloves were found in the
trunk of his car that he had tried to conceal, etc.

In a charge to a jury, the failure of the trial
judge to mention a large part of the incriminating evidence, to relate it
properly to the rest and to instruct the jurors that the whole must be
considered together in deciding whether there is proof beyond reasonable doubt,
would certainly constitute misdirection requiring a new trial. I can see no
reason to hold otherwise in the case of a judge sitting without a jury. It may
sometimes be presumed to a certain extent, that he is not misdirecting himself,
even when not spelling out every direction which he should give to a jury but,
in this case, the judgment taken as the whole shows serious misdirection and
not mere slips. The Court of Appeal properly singled out as specially serious
the manner in which incriminating statements made to police officers were swept
aside because each of them taken separately did not prove anything

[Page 761]

beyond “any peradventure of doubt” or “beyond
any shadow of a doubt”.

In my view, this was made all the more serious
by the trial judge considering the weight of various elements of proof taken
separately. In Côté v. The King[1], Taschereau
J. as he then was, said, speaking for all but one member of the Court (at
p. 76):

It may be, and such is often the case, that the
facts proven by the Crown, examined separately have not a very strong probative
value; but all the facts put in evidence have to be considered each one in
relation to the whole, and it is all of them taken together, that may
constitute a proper basis for a conviction.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Evidence—Robbery—Defence of
alibi—Illegal rebuttal evidence—Harm to accused—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 302.

Appellant was convicted on a charge of
robbery committed at the L … jewellery store. The evidence at the trial
centered on identification of the accused as a participant in the robbery. The
testimony of the victim, jeweller L …, and of a neighbouring jeweller, H …,
seems to indicate that on June 25, 1968, the accused was shown rings, and that
the next day he returned to commit robbery. The two jewellers identified the
accused from a set of photographs a month after the robbery. At the trial, only
the jeweller H. was able to identify the accused in court. The accused
testified in support of his defence of alibi. He stated he had worked on June
25 and 26, 1968. In cross-examination, he answered without objection when asked
if he knew a third jewellery store, S … He answered that he did not know this
jewellery store and that he had never gone there. The accused’s employer also
testified.

In rebuttal, the Crown introduced the
testimony of a sales clerk at the S … jewellery store. She recognized the
accused, both in a photograph and in person as the man who committed a robbery
at the S … jewellery store on September 13, 1968. It is the admission of this
rebuttal evidence that appellant objected to. The Court of Appeal dismissed his
appeal and affirmed the judgment at trial. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Appellant alleged that if this rebuttal
evidence was to attack credibility, it offended the principle that a collateral
fact put in evidence by the Crown in its cross-examination may not be
contradicted by the Crown and that if, on the other hand, the rebuttal evidence
attacked the alibi, it had no basis in fact since the alibi related to June 25
and 26, 1968 and the rebuttal evidence to September 13, 1968.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

If the right of the Crown to contradict a
defence of alibi is unquestionable, it is also indisputable that this right may
only be exercised by attacking the material

[Page 362]

points of the alibi. The rebuttal evidence
establishing the accused’s presence at the S … jewellery store on September 13
does not rebut the defence of alibi according to which the accused was not at
the L … jewellery store on June 25 and 26.

Viewed as an attack on credibility, the
rebuttal evidence is still inadmissible since it offends the principle that a
collateral fact put in evidence by the Crown in its cross-examination may not
be contradicted. This rebuttal evidence also cannot be used as similar fact
evidence, inadmissible in the case at bar. Moreover, the lack of objection by
the defence at the trial did not prevent appellant from raising the illegality of
the rebuttal evidence.

The admission of this illegal rebuttal
evidence caused harm to the accused. A new trial should be ordered but since
the Crown agrees, the Supreme Court enters a verdict of acquittal.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1] affirming a
conviction pronounced by a jury on a charge of robbery. Appeal allowed:
acquittal.

Michel Denis and Bernard Lamarche, for
the appellant.

Fernand Côté, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J.—Appellant obtained leave to
appeal from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal, affirming a conviction
pronounced by a jury on October 17, 1973 on a charge of robbery committed on June 26, 1968 in St-Rémi, at the Claude
Létourneau jewellery store, amounting to $23,000 (s. 288 of the Criminal
Code, now s. 302).

As the substance of the appeal is the admission
of rebuttal evidence against a defence of alibi, and appellant contends such
admission was illegal, it is enough to summarize in a few words the evidence

[Page 363]

of identification given by the prosecution. Two
witnesses were called, the victim Létourneau and Jean-Paul Houle, both
operating jewellery stores in St-Rémi a few steps from each other, and
according to their testimony:

(a) on June 25, in mid-afternoon, Latour and two
companions asked to be shown some expensive rings, by Houle and Létourneau in
turn;

(b) the next day, June 26, 1968, at about 10:30 a.m., Latour and two companions, one of
whom had been with him the day before, committed the robbery mentioned in the
indictment.

It should be noted that these witnesses reported
only what happened at their own businesses, having no knowledge of the events
at their competitor’s store. It should also be noted that the identification
was made the month following the robbery from a set of about a hundred
photographs, including one of appellant taken at the Montreal prison and inscribed as such. Houle added to this an identification
in court, which Létourneau could not do.

In support of his defence of alibi, Latour
offered his testimony. In chief, he stated in essence that he had worked all
day on June 25 and 26, 1968, and that he had never set foot in St‑Rémi.
In cross-examination, he described the usual occupation of his days with his
employer at the time, one Dulude, a grocer, and explained that he stated that
he had worked on those days because his employer had entered it in his books.
The cross-examination includes the following exchange, which according to the Crown
opens the way for the rebuttal evidence, which will be discussed below:

[TRANSLATION] Q. Sir, do you know the Serre
jewellery store? A. I don’t know the jeweller, no.

Q. I am not asking you about the jeweller,
I am asking you about the Serre jewellery store.

A. Serre—I don’t know where that is.

Q. I will tell you where it is: Chemin
St-Jean in Laprairie.

A. No, I have never heard of it.

Q. You swear that, sir?

A. Yes, I swear it.

[Page 364]

Q. You swear that you have never been to
the Serre jewellery store?

A. Yes, I swear it, I swear it, yes, I have
never gone there in my life.

Latour’s testimony ended with the statement that
his hours of work had been changed on October 22, 1968.

Latour’s employer, Dulude, also testified for
the defence. With respect to the dates, he could only testify by referring to
his books, which is not surprising since the trial was taking place almost five
and a half years after the event. On the basis of the entries he had made, he
stated that Latour had worked on June 25 and 26, 1968. He added that during the
two years Latour had been in his employ, he had never missed a day of work, but
that occasionally he had been given a couple of hours off. He admitted the
possibility that this had occurred on June 25 and 26, 1968, and his testimony
ended with the examination of certain entries in his books for December 1968
and a general description of Latour’s duties.

In rebuttal, the Crown introduced the testimony
of Lyne Martin, the whole of which follows below. Exhibit P-19 is the photograph
taken at the Montreal prison,
already used by the witnesses Latour and Houle.

[TRANSLATION] Q. Miss Martin, I show you an
exhibit which was introduced as P-19; would you look at it and tell the Court
whether you have, or whether you recognize this individual as having seen him
somewhere?

A. Yes, I recognize him, as having
committed a robbery at the Serre jewellery store in Laprairie.

Q. In Laprairie; what was your position at
that time?

A. I was a sales clerk.

Q. You were a sales clerk?

A. Yes.

Q. At the counter?

A. At the counter, yes.

Q. And when did you see this individual at
the Serre jewellery store?

A. I saw him at about one o’clock in the afternoon; he came in with
another boy.

Q. When?

A. …

[Page 365]

Q. What month?

A. Oh! Yes, excuse me, the thirteenth,
Friday, September 13.

Q. What year?

A. Sixty-eight.

Q. On September 13, 1968, you saw this
individual at the Serre drugstore?

A. At the jewellery store.

Q. At the Serre jewellery store in
Laprairie?

A. Yes.

Q. That’s correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you look at the dock: do you
recognize that individual?

A. I recognize him, but he was thinner.

Q. Do you recognize him as the one who went
to the Serre drugstore in Laprairie?

A. Yes, I recognize him, at the Serre
jewellery store.

Q. At the Serre jewellery store?

A. Yes.

Mr. Lagacé

Counsel for the Defence:

Q. Now, Miss Martin, on exactly what date
did this holdup occur?

Mr. Trudeau

Crown Attorney:

Your Lordship, she has just answered that
question.

That is not the purpose of
cross-examination, it is not to repeat the same thing, she has just said that
it was September 13, 1968.

Mr. Lagacé

Counsel for the Defence:

Q. You identified the photograph of
Mr. Latour how long after the robbery?

A. About three-quarters of an hour.

Q. After the robbery?

A. Yes, the time it took me to get to Montreal.

Q. Do you recognize Mr. Latour here
today?

A. Yes.

Q. Is he the individual you have seen when
the Serre jewellery was robbed?

A. Yes.

Q. You are sure—you are under oath?

A. I am as sure as I was when I identified
the photograph.

[Page 366]

Appellant submits that this rebuttal evidence
should not have been admitted for the following reasons, inter alia:

(1) if this rebuttal evidence was to attack
credibility, it offends the principle that a collateral fact, put in evidence
by the Crown in its cross-examination of the defence witnesses, may not be
contradicted by the Crown;

(2) if, on the other hand, this rebuttal
evidence claims to attack the alibi, it has no basis in fact, since neither
Latour nor Dulude stated that, according to Dulude’s books, Latour was at work
on September 13, 1968, though they did testify he was at work on June 25 and
26, 1968.

Bernier J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal,
rejected these two grounds of appeal:

[TRANSLATION] It appears from appellant’s
testimony that he was still working for the Dulude grocery store in October
1968; moreover, during cross-examination, the Crown Attorney drew from him that
he did not know the Serre jewellery store in Laprairie, and that he had never
been there. These questions were asked without objections; there is reason to
believe that if objections had been made, the judge presiding at the trial
would have allowed them, in the circumstances.

This is the context of the rebuttal
evidence. It appears that it had the purpose of further discrediting the alibi,
already greatly weakened by the cross-examination of the accused and Dulude,
and at the same time, the credibility of the accused with respect to the other
part of his testimony, that is, his statement that he had never been to St-Rémi
and did not know the Létourneau jewellery store.

In calling Lyne Martin, the Crown did not
complete the evidence which it should have given in chief, but, provided that
the jury believed Miss Martin, it established that the accused had lied during
cross-examination.

I cannot agree with this conclusion. The defence
of alibi related only to June 25 and 26, 1968: not a word was said about September 13, 1968; nor was this date mentioned
during the cross-examination of Latour regarding the Serre jewellery store. The
right of the Crown to contradict a defence of alibi is, it goes without saying,
unquestionable, but it is also indisputable that this right may only be
exercised by attacking the material points of the alibi advanced by the
accused. If, for example, Miss Martin had stated that she had seen appellant at

[Page 367]

the Serre jewellery store on June 25 or 26,
1968, her testimony would clearly have been relevant in the context of the
development of the evidence up to that time. However, that was not the case
here, and appellant was right to maintain that the rebuttal evidence designed
to establish that he was in Laprairie on September 13, 1968 does not rebut his
statement that he was not in St-Rémi on June 25 and 26 of that year.

Viewed as an attack on credibility, the rebuttal
evidence is still inadmissible. In the context of the charge against him, the
negative answer given by Latour in cross-examination to the prosecution’s
suggestion that he knew the Serre jewellery store in Laprairie relates to a
collateral fact, and does not open the way to rebuttal evidence. The principle
is clear, and as examples we need only refer to R. v. Cargill[2], R. v. Hrechuk[3] and R. v. Rafael[4].

The Crown did not suggest that in the case at
bar the testimony of Lyne Martin could be admitted because it established a
similar fact independently of the defence of alibi. That is what the trial
judge explained to the jury in his charge:

[TRANSLATION] A somewhat different
situation presented itself when Miss Martin was called to testify to the effect
that she identified the accused specifically when he had committed a holdup at
a later date, October 12, pardon me, September 13, this evidence normally—if
there had not been a question of an alibi—this evidence would justify me in
ordering a new trial, a mistrial, and discharging the jury. However, given that
there was a defence of alibi, the law permits similar fact evidence to be
given; in this situation, however, without examining the Crown’s intentions in
developing its evidence, I nevertheless find that this girl squarely
contradicted the testimony of the accused when she said that he had gone to the
Serre jewellery store, and that he did so in a holdup. So you must not take
this part of her evidence, relating to the holdup, as evidence of bad
character.

[Page 368]

This position of the Crown is clearly correct.
The conditions in which similar fact evidence is permitted are not found here;
they were examined recently in two decisions of this Court: Leblanc v. The
Queen[5] and
Boulet v. The Queen[6].

The Crown, moreover, did not contend that the
lack of objection by the defence at the trial prevented appellant from raising
the illegality of the rebuttal evidence. That also is in accordance with
principle, and I need only refer to R. v. Rosik[7].

Is this a matter in which, notwithstanding the
admission of illegal rebuttal evidence, it is possible to state that no
significant harm was caused, so that the appeal should be dismissed (s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code)? I do not think so. Not only does the Crown have
the burden of proving the absence of significant harm, see The Queen v.
Vézeau[8], but
the extract which I have cited from the judge’s charge shows the importance
which he attached to the testimony of Lyne Martin, an importance which surely
influenced the jury.

Faced with the conclusion I have reached, I
would normally have to order a new trial. However, appellant has asked the
Court to make an order of acquittal, noting, among other things, the
exceptional circumstances of the record. Crown counsel, at the hearing, agreed
with this proposal if we concluded that the appeal should succeed. In my
opinion, we should comply with this agreement.

I would allow the appeal and order that a
verdict of acquittal be entered.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Statutes—Interpretation—Ambiguities—Successive
revisions in both French and English versions—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, ss. 213, 306—Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 1-23, s. 36.

Criminal law—Murder—Burglary—Meaning of “burglary”—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 213, 306—Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. 1-23, s. 36.

At a jury trial in Toronto the respondents, together with Radco Govedarov and Sreto Dzambas,
were found guilty of murder. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of
Govedarov and Dzambas but ordered a new trial for the respondents, since, in
the opinion of the majority, the trial judge had erred in directing the jury
that breaking into the restaurant should be considered as burglary within the
meaning of s. 213 of the Criminal Code whereas, in their view, burglary
meant breaking into a dwelling-house only. The subsequent appeal was taken only
by virtue of the dissent in the Court of Appeal which relied particularly on
the expression “vol avec effraction” used in the French text of s. 213.

Held (Judson
and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: The Criminal Code,
1892, in s. 228 concerning constructive murder refers to “burglary”, using
in the French version the term “effraction nocturne”, and in Part XXX entitled
“Burglary and housebreaking” defines “burglary”, using in the French version
“effraction nocturne (burglary)”. It was clear that burglary as referred
to in these sections meant not common law burglary but burglary as defined
in that Code. Successive revisions of the Code introduced
discrepancies making the Code seriously defective in both languages.
However a review of the various revisions and of the legislation respecting the
Revised Statutes indicates that the provisions with respect to burglary of

[Page 309]

what is now s. 213 of the Criminal Code are
in substance the same as these of s. 228 of the Criminal Code, 1892, as
reproduced in the revisions of 1906 and 1927, to which no change was made in
the 1970 revision. “Burglary” therefore, in the absence of any indication of
Parliament’s intent to alter that provision, still means the offence defined as
such in s. 410 of the Criminal Code, 1892, coupled with the definitions
of “dwelling-house” and “break” in s. 407.

The conclusion, based on a review of previous
enactments of the Criminal Code made necessary in both languages by an
ambiguity in the Code presently in force, gives full effect to the
principles respecting the effect of codification as stated by Lord Herschell in
Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers, [1891] A.C. 107 at pp. 144-5.

Per Judson and
de Grandpré JJ. dissenting: The dissenting reasons delivered in the
Court of Appeal by Schroeder J.A. should be adopted in full, the appeal allowed
and the convictions at trial affirmed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario1[1]
ordering a new trial on appeals by the respondents against convictions of murder.
Appeal dismissed, Judson and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting.

D.A. McKenzie, for the appellant.

Patricia Peters, for the respondent,
Nicholas Popovic.

Michael Lynch, for the respondent, Elija
Askov.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Martland,
Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—At a jury trial in Toronto the respondents, together with
Radco Govedarov and

[Page 310]

Sreto Dzambas, were found guilty of having
murdered one Trevor Poll. The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of
Govedarov and Dzambas but ordered a new trial for the two others1.
In the opinion of the majority, the trial judge had erred in directing the jury
that breaking into the restaurant where the murder was committed could be
considered as burglary within the meaning of s. 213, Cr.C. In their
view, burglary meant breaking into a dwelling-house only. Schroeder J.A.
dissented on that point relying particularly on the expression “vol avec
effraction” used in the French version of s. 213.

The appeal to this Court was taken solely by
virtue of this dissent, the Attorney General for Ontario stating the ground of appeal as follows in his inscription:

That the Court of Appeal erred in law in
holding that breaking and entering the restaurant with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein did not constitute the offence of “burglary” as found in
Section 213 of the Criminal Code.

In the circumstances of this case, I find it
necessary to make a full review of the relevant legislation in both languages.

In the Criminal Code, 1892 (Can.), c. 29, the relevant part of s. 228
concerning constructive murder was as follows:

228.
Culpable homicide is also murder in each of the following cases, whether the
offender means or not death to ensue, or knows or not that death is likely to
ensue:

(a) If he means to inflict grievous
bodily injury for the purpose of facilitating the commission of any of the
offences in this section mentioned, or the flight of the offender upon the
commission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury;
or…

2. The following are the offences in this
section referred to:- Treason and the other offences mentioned

[Page 311]

in. Part IV of this Act, piracy and
offences deemed to be piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody, resisting
lawful apprehension, murder, rape, forcible abduction, robbery, burglary,
arson.

The term used for burglary in the French version
was “effraction nocturne”.

Burglary was defined as such in Part XXX
entitled “Burglary and housebreaking” as follows:

410. Every
one is guilty of the indictable offence called burglary, and liable to
imprisonment for life, who—

(a) breaks and enters a
dwelling-house by night with intent to commit any indictable offence therein;
or

(b) breaks out of any dwelling-house
by night, either after committing an indictable offence therein, or after
having entered such dwelling-house, either by day or by night with intent to
commit an indictable offence therein.

In the French version, the term used to describe
the offence was as in s. 228 “effraction nocturne” but followed by “(burglary)”.

Thus, it was perfectly clear that the “burglary”
mentioned in the constructive murder provision was not the common law burglary
but statutory burglary as defined in the Code. In this respect, I would
note further that while s. 228 had no counterpart in previous Canadian
statutory law, murder not being defined in the Act respecting Offences
against the person, R.S.C. 1886, c. 162, burglary was defined in the Larceny
Act, R.S.C. 1886, c. 164, as follows:

37. Every
one who enters the dwelling-house of another with intent to commit any felony
therein, or being in such dwelling-house, commits any felony therein, and, in
either case, breaks out of such dwelling-house in the night, is guilty of
burglary.

In the French version of the Larceny Act, the
words used were as in the Code “effraction noc-

[Page 312]

turne (burglary)”. In that act, “night” was also
defined in s. 2(k) as in the Code (9 p.m. to 6 a.m.), but
“dwelling-house” and “break” were not given the extended meaning stated in s.
407 of the Code.

As I have already said, I have no doubt that in
s. 228, “burglary” necessarily meant “the indictable offence called burglary”
as defined in s. 410 and related provisions, in other words, statutory burglary
as defined in the Code, not the common law offence. Although substantially
broadened, it remained an offence that could be committed only in respect of
dwelling-houses at night.

In the 1906 revision, which was not a
Parliamentary revision but the work of commissioners, considerable changes in
wording were effected in both versions. This was done under the authority of
the Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1903 (Can.), c. 61, where the first paragraph of
s. 3 was as follows:

3. The said
Commissioners in consolidating the said statutes and in incorporating therewith
the Acts or parts of Acts passed subsequent thereto and selected for inclusion
therein as above provided may make such alterations in their language as are
requisite in order to preserve a uniform mode of expression, and may make such
minor amendments as are necessary to bring out more clearly what they deem to
be the intention of Parliament or to reconcile seemingly inconsistent
enactments or to correct clerical or typographical errors.

The revision was not brought into force by
proclamation under that act but by the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, Act, 1907 (Can.), c. 43,
from which I shall quote the following provisions:

3. The
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, are hereby confirmed and declared to have and
to have had, on, from and after the thirty-first day of January, 1907, the
force of law as if herein enacted…

7. The said
Revised Statutes shall not be held to operate as new laws, but shall be
construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as
contained in the said Acts and parts of Acts so repealed, and for which the
said Revised Statutes are substituted.

[Page 313]

2. If upon any point the provisions of the
said Revised Statutes are not in effect the same as those of the repealed Acts
and parts of Acts for which they are substituted, then, as respects all
transactions, matters and things subsequent to the time when the said Revised
Statutes take effect, the provisions contained in them shall prevail, but, as
respects all transactions, matters and things anterior to the said time, the
provisions of the said repealed Acts and parts of Acts shall prevail.

10. The Governor
in Council may appoint two or more competent persons to prepare the French
version of the said Revised Statutes, and they shall proceed as speedily as
possible to make and complete such version and report the same to the Governor
in Council.

2. The Governor General shall thereupon cause a
printed roll of the version so made and reported, attested under the signature
of the Governor General and that of the Clerk of the Parliaments, to be
deposited in the office of the said Clerk, and such roll shall be deemed to be
the authentic original French version of the said statutes, and as such shall have
the force of law as if herein enacted.

Thus, the 1906 revised statutes were brought
into force at first in the English version only. The French version was so
carelessly done that in the re-arranged s. 260, corresponding to s. 228 of
the 1892 Code, four offences were omitted namely, “le meurtre, le viol,
le rapt, le vol à main armée” (murder, rape, forcible abduction, robbery).
While “burglary” remained unchanged in the English version, “effraction
nocturne” was replaced by “effraction de nuit”. Then, under the heading “Burglary
and Housebreaking”, in French, “Effractions” instead of “Des
effractions et escalades”, the words “called burglary” were deleted from s.
457 (formerly s. 410) as well as the words “called housebreaking” in s. 458.
Why this was done is not apparent.

As a result of all those changes, the two
versions, if considered by themselves, exhibited a most serious discrepancy. In
the English, the word “burglary” remained only in s. 260 and in the heading
preceding ss. 455 to 465 where it was coupled with housebreaking so that there
was no longer any-

[Page 314]

thing to indicate what was burglary and what was
housebreaking. Unless one went back to the previous enactment, it could be
argued that in s. 260 (constructive murder) “burglary” was now to be read in
its ordinary sense, nothing showing that under the heading “Burglary and
Housebreaking” the first word meant the offence described in s. 457. On the
other hand, in the French version of s. 260 “effraction de nuit” clearly meant
any break-in by night, “Effractions” being the heading under which
shopbreaking as well as burglary and housebreaking were defined.

Thus, if the two versions of s. 260 of the 1906 Code
were now read literally, the result was a major change concerning
“burglary” in both versions but in opposite directions. In the English, it
would be restricted to common law burglary instead of statutory burglary as
defined in the Code of 1892, in the French, it would be broadened to
include any break-in by night.

In my view, it is clear that neither Parliament
nor the commissioners intended to effect any change of substance. Although s.
16(2) of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, Act repealed the 1903 statute,
it is clear enough that, in effect, the 1903 statute was not repealed but replaced
by the new enactment. This is apparent from the first paragraph of s. 16 which
amends the 1903 enactment; if it was intended to be wiped out, it was pointless
to amend it. On account of the discrepancies between the two versions of the
1906 Criminal Code, the conclusion should be that no change of substance
was intended, and there were only misguided attempts at improvements in
drafting which resulted in making the Criminal Code seriously defective
in both languages.

What those actually responsible for these
unfortunate changes—the ill results of which persist to this day—failed to
appreciate was that they could not possibly give to the changes they were
making the kind of exhaustive consideration that had been given by the framers
of the original Code. They

[Page 315]

also did not take into consideration something
which the authors of the original Code had not overlooked, namely, the
importance of having such statutes in readable form. By this I mean enactments
that are readily understandable upon hearing them read. This is especially
desirable with respect to such provisions as the definitions of crimes which
must be read to the juries. For readability, it is necessary that sentences be
short and unencumbered by incidentals, lists and enumerations. These
requirements were substantially met in s. 228 of the original Code by
listing the offences separately as ss. 2. Also, it is obvious that for
readability the use of names rather than of section numbers for referring
to offences is preferable, provided the names used are specific enough and
their meaning is not too remote from the usual sense. These requirements were
met in the original Code where, in s. 410, the words “the indictable
offence called burglary” made the meaning of the word “burglary” in s. 228
perfectly clear.

The Revised Statutes of Canada 1927 were
made and proclaimed pursuant to the provisions of the Act respecting the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1924 (Can.), c. 65, s. 3 of this act was the
same as s. 3 of the 1903 Act, and s. 8 the same as s. 7 of the 1906 Act. The
numbering of Criminal Code ss. 260 and 457 was unchanged. The wording
also was unchanged in the English version. However, in the French version of s.
260, the words inadvertently omitted in 1906 were restored but the words “de
nuit” after “effraction” were dropped so that, instead of “burglary” in the
English, the French now meant “break-in”, no change being made in s. 457 or in
the heading “Effractions” preceding s. 455.

It is perfectly obvious that the 1927 revision
was never intended to alter the constructive murder provision so as to make it
applicable to every break-in as the words used in the French version would have
it. The fact that the English version remained entirely unchanged is a clear
indication that no change was intended to be made in the

[Page 316]

provisions with which we are concerned.
Therefore, the legal situation remained as after the 1906 revision, namely,
that in spite of the unfortunate ambiguities introduced by the altered wording,
the meaning of s. 260 was the same as of s. 228 of the Criminal Code, 1892,
namely, burglary as there defined.

The changes effected in 1947 by c. 55, ss. 6 and
7 consisted in putting “indecent assault” among the offences mentioned in s.
260 and in adding paragraph (d). These amendments have no bearing on the
question raised in this case.

In 1950, by s. 5 of c. 11, ss. 457, 458 and 459
were replaced by a single section which combined in a single offence
carrying the same penalty the offences which, in the 1892 Code, were
called burglary and housebreaking and the unnamed offence in s. 412 (then s.
459). The new section read:

457. (1)
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for
life who

(a) breaks and enters a
dwelling-house with intent to commit any indictable offence therein; or

(b) breaks and enters any
dwelling-house and commits any indictable offence therein; or

(c) breaks out of any dwelling-house
either after committing any indictable offence therein, or after having entered
such dwelling-house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein.

(2) Every one convicted of an offence under
this section who when arrested, or when he committed such offence, had
upon his person any offensive weapon, shall, in addition to the imprisonment
above prescribed, be liable to be whipped.

(3) The breaking and entering of a
dwelling-house or the breaking out of a dwelling‑house after having
entered such dwelling-house shall be prima facie evidence of an intent
to commit an indictable offence therein.

No change was made in the heading “Burglary
and Housebreaking” or in s. 260.

With respect, Martin J.A. is mistaken, I think,
in the view (at p. 27) that “thereafter, the offence of burglary in s. 260
referred to breaking and

[Page 317]

entering in a dwelling-house either by day or by
night”. This conclusion is at variance with the opinion previously expressed by
the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v. Lachance[2] in the following words (at p. 133):

By ss. 292, 295 of the present Criminal
Code the distinction between burglary or breaking and entering by night and
breaking and entering by day has been abolished, but since the framers of the
present Criminal Code continued to use the word “burglary” in the constructive
murder section, present s. 202, that word should be given the meaning assigned
to it in s. 410, combined with ss. 3 (q), 407 (b) and 407 (b)
(i) (ii) of the Criminal Code of 1892, 55-56 Vict., c. 29 above set out.

In s. 260 the crucial word is “burglary”. For
the reasons previously given, this word meant, when the 1950 amendment was
made, burglary as defined in the Code of 1892. To alter the scope of s.
260 and to make it applicable also to what was then known as “housebreaking”
plus another unnamed offence, there would have to be some indication of Parliament’s
intention to effect such a change. Constructive murder is a most serious
offence at that time carrying the death penalty, now mandatory life
imprisonment. I can find no indication of such intention.

It is true that in accordance with s. 7 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, 1906, Act and s. 8 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927, Act, the provisions of s. 260 are to be read as having the
same effect as s. 228 of the Code of 1892 in spite of the deletion of
the words “called burglary” in what was s. 410 and became s. 457. If those
words were in the new s. 457 enacted in 1950, it might be that Parliament would
be deemed to have had in mind that the word “burglary” was used in s. 260 and
intended that section to be read in the future as referring to the offence
now described under that name. Such is not the case. The words “called
burglary” were not only deleted by the 1906 revi-

[Page 318]

sion and left out in the 1927 revision, they
were not restored in the new s. 457 enacted in 1950. That new section did
not purport to define burglary; it only combined in a single offence what was
formerly known as burglary, housebreaking and another offence. Moreover, it
remained under the heading “Burglary and Housebreaking”. While the 1906
and 1927 revisions had to be construed not as new laws but as consolidations,
effect must also be given to the subsection directing that, for the
future, the new provisions shall govern although different from those that
existed before. Even accepting that the offence then defined in s. 457 was
still “burglary”, there was nothing to indicate that the combined offence was
to be “burglary” within the meaning of s. 260. There is no such indication in
the enactment itself or in the explanatory note quoted in Martin’s Criminal
Code 1955 (p. 514), which explanatory note, I am afraid, may no more be
considered for purposes of construction than any other portion of the
parliamentary history of an enactment. (Attorney-General of Canada v. Reader’s
Digest Association (Canada) Ltd.)[3].

We now come to the parliamentary revision
effected by c. 51 of the Statutes of Canada 1953‑54 (Can.). In the Criminal
Code thus enacted, the constructive murder provision is s. 202. Although it
was completely re-arranged in one long sentence including several paragraphs
and subparagraphs, no substantial change was made in the English version. There
was, however, a notable change in the French version. For “burglary” the
expression used now is “un vol avec effraction” instead of “effraction”. Of
course, “effraction” meaning any break-in was much too wide, but the new
expression is equally inappropriate.

As Schroeder J.A. noted (at p. 14), Harrap’s New
Shorter French Dictionary defines “bur-

[Page 319]

glary” as “vol de nuit avec effraction”. From a lexicographer’s point of view, this is quite accurate because
in an English dictionary, the French equivalent of English legal terminology
must be expressed in terms of the vocabulary used in the law of France. But the
meaning of words used to describe legal concepts is not purely a matter of
common usage in any given country. It is inevitably largely dependent on the
actual words used in its legislation, in France, in the Code pénal. In
that Code, “effraction” is defined in art. 393 but it is not a crime by
itself, only a “circonstance aggravante” (an aggravating circumstance), art.
381 to 389 prescribing varying penalties for theft according to the
“circonstances”. These include not only “effraction” but also night-time,
weapons, “maison habitée” (dwelling-house), etc. Thus, in order to describe the
crime of burglary in the vocabulary of the French Code pénal, one would
have to speak of “vol de nuit avec effraction dans une maison habitée” (theft
at night by breaking into a dwelling-house). Even this would not be completely accurate
because it would cover only theft, not any indictable offence as burglary does.

In section 228 of the Criminal Code, 1892,
the expression “effraction nocturne” was unequivocal only because, in s. 410
defining burglary, this was said to be the name of the offence. But, the
expression “vol avec effraction” in the French version of s. 202 (now s. 213)
of the present Criminal Code does not describe an offence known as such
anywhere in our Code. The only possible conclusion is that this
expression as used in the French version is imprecise and ambiguous.

One must now turn to s. 292 (now s. 306). The
words burglary and housebreaking have disappeared, the heading above ss. 292 to
295 (now ss. 306 to 311) is now “Breaking and Entering”, and s. 292 is
as follows:

Breaking
and Entering

292.

(1) Every one who

(a) breaks and enters a place with
intent to commit an indictable offence therein;

(b) breaks and enters a place and
commits an indictable offence therein; or

[Page 320]

(c) breaks out of a place after

(i) committing an indictable offence
therein, or

(ii) entering the place with intent to
commit an indictable offence therein,

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable

(d) to imprisonment for life, if the
offence is committed in relation to a dwelling house, or

(e) to imprisonment for fourteen
years, if the offence is committed in relation to a place other than a dwelling
house.

(2) For the purposes of proceedings under
this section, evidence that an accused

(a) broke and entered a place is prima
facie evidence that he broke and entered with intent to commit an
indictable offence therein; or

(b) broke out of a place is prima
facie evidence that he broke out after

(i) committing an indictable offence
therein, or

(ii) entering with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein.

(3) [Repealed, 1972, c. 13, s. 24.]

(4) For the purposes of this section,
“place” means

(a) a dwelling house,

(b) a building or structure or any
part thereof, other than a dwelling house,

(c) a railway vehicle, vessel,
aircraft or

(d) a pen or enclosure in which
fur-bearing animals are kept in captivity for breeding or commercial purposes.

It will be noted that shop-breaking has been
combined with burglary, housebreaking and kindred offences into a single
offence covering breaking and entering a “place”. However, the punishment
differs according to whether the “place” is a dwelling house or not. A
“dwelling house” is defined in s. 2 (14) which is substantially to the same
effect as previous enactments.

I have reviewed the dictionaries current in 1954
to see whether it might be said that, due to legislation enacted by many states
defining “burglary” so as to cover all break-ins, the word might have

[Page 321]

acquired a new meaning. The results of this
search have been so negative that I do not find it necessary to elaborate or to
supply references.

Concerning the French version, I need say
nothing more than that the heading has been changed to read “Introduction
par effraction”, which is far from being an improvement over the single word
“Effractions” that was a proper title. The word “introduction” seems to
have been added merely for the purpose of not having one word in the French
version where there were two in English, in my view, a wholly misconceived
notion. Each version should be written in accordance with the idiom (“le génie
de la langue”). If a single word is a proper expression in one language, I
consider it basically wrong to use two or more because that is desirable or
necessary in the other. In our present Code, this has been carried to
absurdity. The heading above s. 374 (now s. 389) is Arson and Other Fires. In
the French version this reads “Crime d’incendie et autres incendies” (Criminal
Fire and Other Fires).

Although it is an argument by analogy, and of
doubtful value at best, it was strenuously contended that “arson” in the
constructive murder section no longer has its common law meaning, but
extends to all those offences that are enumerated in s. 374 of the 1955 Code
(now s. 389). I do not find it necessary to express an opinion on this
point, but will note that in the 1906 revision, the name of this offence was
not eliminated as was done for burglary. Section 511 of 1906 read as s.
482 of the Criminal Code, 1892:

511. Every
one is guilty of the indictable offence of arson…

This was not changed in the 1927 revision and
the equivalent words remained “l’acte criminel d’incendie”. Just what was the
effect of the elimination of the word “arson” from the description of the
offence in s. 374 (now s. 389) coupled with the enlargement of the definition
of that offence need not be determined. However, it should be noted

[Page 322]

that the caption “ARSON” in Martin’s and
Cartwright’s Criminal Codes is the marginal note in the statute and by virtue
of s. 13 of the Interpretation Act “forms no part of the enactment”.

Consideration must however be given to the
following provisions of s. 36 of the Interpretation Act:

36. Where an
enactment (in this section called the “former enactment”) is repealed and
another enactment (in this section called the “new enactment”) is
substituted therefor,

…

(f) except to the extent that the
provisions of the new enactment are not in substance the same as those of the
former enactment, the new enactment shall not be held to operate as new law,
but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of
the law as contained in the former enactment;

…

It seems clear to me that with respect to
burglary the provisions of what is now s. 213 of the Criminal Code are
in substance the same as those of the former enactment which was s. 228 of the Criminal
Code 1892 as reproduced in the two successive revisions of 1906 and 1927.
No change was made in the 1970 revision and I cannot find anywhere the
slightest indication of Parliament’s intent to alter that provision. This means
that, in my view, “burglary” still means the offence defined as such in s. 410
of the Criminal Code 1892, coupled with the definitions of
“dwelling-house” and “break” in s. 407.

This conclusion gives full effect to the principles
respecting the effect of codification as stated by Lord Herschell in Bank of
England v. Vagliano Brothers[4] at pp.
144-5. I am not going back to the common law meaning of burglary and see no
reason for so doing. All common law offences have now disappeared. However, due
to inadequacies in the successive revisions, it is unfortunately necessary to
go back to the initial enactment because only thus is it possible to find the
proper meaning.

[Page 323]

It is certainly much to be deplored that such
should be the situation and I agree that the utmost should be done to ascertain
the intent of Parliament by considering only the Code presently in
force. However, there is here such an ambiguity that it is absolutely necessary
to go back to previous enactments. It is particularly regrettable that from
1906 to this day, both versions of what is now s. 213 should have been
ambiguous not to say misleading; I trust it will not be considered improper for
me to express the hope that this will soon be rectified and my observations
will be of some utility in this respect.

I conclude that the appeal should be dismissed.

The judgment of Judson and de Grandpré JJ. was
delivered by

JUDSON J. (dissenting)—I agree with the
dissenting reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal by Schroeder J.A.[5], and I adopt those reasons in full.

I would, therefore, allow this appeal and affirm
the convictions at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal law—Indictment—Construction—Wording
not clear whether offence charged one of “causing death by criminal negligence”
under s. 203 or “criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle”
under s. 233(1)—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 203, 233(1).

The respondent was convicted under
s. 203 of the Criminal Code on a charge that he “…was criminally
negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle and did, thereby, cause death…
contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code.” The trial judge sentenced him
to a term of five years and in addition prohibited him from driving a motor
vehicle on a highway anywhere in Canada for a period of 15 years.

On appeal, the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court of Alberta quashed the conviction under s. 203 but found the
respondent guilty under s. 233(1) of the Code. The Appellate
Division substituted a sentence of imprisonment for nine months and a
prohibition from driving for three years.

With leave, the Crown appealed to this Court.
The question at issue was whether the offence alleged in the indictment was
that of “causing death by criminal negligence” contrary to the provisions of
s. 203 of the Criminal Code or merely one of “criminal negligence
in the operation of a motor vehicle” contrary to s. 233(1).

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
allowed, the conviction at trial restored and the case returned to the Appellate
Division for consideration of the appeal against sentence imposed pursuant to
that judgment.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: The gravamen of the charge was
that the

[Page 843]

accused “was criminally negligent… and did
thereby cause death…”, and the fact that the means whereby the death was
caused, i.e., by being “criminally negligent in the operation of a motor
vehicle”, were also alleged did not alter the fact that the respondent was
charged as “one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person”
within the meaning of s. 203 of the Criminal Code. By specifying
the kind of criminal negligence which caused the death, the Crown was doing no
more than providing the respondent with particulars of the charge against him.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ., dissenting: The charge as framed
was capable of being regarded as charging either crime i.e., criminal
negligence under s. 233(1) of the Criminal Code or homicide under
s. 203. In this state of ambiguity, the ambiguity should be resolved in
favour of the accused. The Court ought not to construe an ambiguous charge as
referring to the graver of two possible offences but rather to the less serious
one, especially where, as in this case, its charging words are in the language
of the less serious offence.

[Schwartzenhauer v. The King, [1935]
S.C.R. 367, distinguished.]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta, Appellate Division, allowing the respondent’s appeal from his
conviction under s. 203 of the Criminal Code. Appeal allowed,
Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting.

B. Pannu and B.A. Crane, for the
appellant.

M. Harradence, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson
and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The only
question in this appeal with which I think it necessary to deal is whether the
charge against the accused was one of criminal negligence under s. 233(1)
of the Criminal Code or homicide under s. 203. These two sections read,
respectively, as follows:

233. (1)
Every one who is criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle is
guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for five years, or

[Page 844]

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

203. Every
one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

The charge upon which the accused was tried was
in these words:

You Wayne Donald McGloan stand charged
before the Honourable Mr. Justice M.E. Manning, that you at or near
Penhold in the Judicial District of Red Deer in the Province of Alberta, on or
about the 19th day of May, A.D. 1973, [were] criminally negligent in the
operation of a motor vehicle and did, thereby, cause death to Cary Lou Gatchke,
contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code…

This was the charge read to the accused at the
opening of the trial. I note particularly that there was no section number
of the Criminal Code that was part of the charge as read to the accused
and as recorded in the transcript. When Crown counsel opened he made no
reference to the Criminal Code identification of the offence on which
the accused was to be tried.

The submissions that counsel made to the trial
judge (who was sitting without a jury) at the conclusion of the evidence are
also in the record that is before this Court. Apart from Crown counsel’s
statement at the beginning of his argument, in which he simply repeated the
allegations in the charge in the words of the charge, adding only that “it was
admitted… that Cary Gatchke died as a result of injuries received in this
accident”, there is nothing in the argument to suggest that the Crown was
seeking a conviction under s. 203. The argument of counsel for the defence
proceeded clearly on the basis of a charge under s. 233(1) and he urged
that at the most there was dangerous driving under s. 233(4). He concluded
as follows: “There is no evidence to substantiate the charge of criminal negligence
within the meaning of the Criminal Code.” The trial judge in a comment at the
conclusion of the arguments of counsel spoke only of the “crime of criminal
negligence”. It was only after the trial judge found the accused “guilty as
charged” and Crown counsel proceeded to speak to sentence that the issue was
raised by Crown counsel of a penalty under s. 203. Defence counsel

[Page 845]

immediately objected, saying the charge was
under s. 233(1) and addressed himself to the question of sentence for that
offence.

The trial judge imposed a sentence of five
years’ imprisonment, the maximum for an offence under s. 233(1), and also
made an order prohibiting the accused from driving on any highway in Canada for fifteen years. This
last-mentioned order could only be related to a conviction under s. 203,
as is evident from s. 238 under which the order was made.

I am of the opinion that there ought to have
been a clearer indication from the beginning as to the charge on which the
accused was to be tried. True enough, the specification of a Code section in
the charge is not mandatory, but in this case it would have had a clarifying
effect. The record seems to me to suggest that counsel for the accused may have
been misled by the terms of the charge when preparing the defence. The Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta thought that the charge came under
s. 233(1) and not under s. 203 when it substituted a conviction under
the former provision. So we are left, at worst from the accused’s standpoint,
with a situation where the charge as framed was capable of being regarded as
charging either crime. In this state of ambiguity, I am of the view that the
ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the accused, a view obviously held by
the Alberta Appellate Division, if indeed, it felt that there was any
uncertainty.

The appeal case lodged here by the Crown in
respect of its appeal does not contain a copy of the indictment as laid, but
only a copy of the information which itself contains no Code section number
but is in the exact form of the charge read at the trial. The file of the case,
which was available to the Court, includes a number of documents to which I
wish to refer. There is the Provincial judge’s report of committal on the
charge in the information, a report which is signed by the Provincial judge and
which reports explicitly that the

[Page 846]

accused was charged with criminal negligence,
s. 233(1) Criminal Code and committed for trial accordingly. The
names of Crown counsel and defence counsel (they appeared at trial and in the
Appellate Division) are included. Next there is a copy of the indictment as
preferred by Crown counsel as agent of the Attorney General. There is no
variation in the wording of the charge as it was recited in the information but
at the bottom of the page are the typed words “Sec. 203 Criminal Code”.
Then there is a document headed “Report of the Criminal Trial”, signed and
verified as correct by the Deputy Clerk of the Court. This report shows that
the trial took place before Manning J., that the offence charged was “Section
233(1) C.C. Criminal Negligence”, that there was a plea of not guilty and that
the accused was convicted as charged and a sentence imposed in the terms I have
already set out.

I cannot agree that on this material the accused
or his counsel should have had no doubt as to the exact charge against him.
Perhaps defence counsel was as much at fault as Crown counsel in not clarifying
the nature of the charge when they were before the trial judge and at the
opening of the trial. In my opinion, however, it is for the Crown rather than
for the accused to bear the consequences of the uncertainty that the official
records created.

In Schwartzenhauer v. The King[1], the charge against the accused was
that he counselled or procured one [S] to use instruments on a woman [K] with
intent to procure her miscarriage “which offence the said [S] did commit and
did thereby kill and slay the said [K] against the form of the statute in such
case made and provided…”. The main point in the appeal to this Court was the
admissibility of a dying declaration which was the basis upon which the accused
was convicted of manslaughter. The conviction was set aside and an acquittal
entered on the ground that in the circum-

[Page 847]

stances the dying declaration was inadmissible,
but the opinion was expressed that the indictment did not charge homicide but
rather the counselling of a statutory offence of procuring an abortion. I
regard this opinion as supporting the view I hold here, namely, that the Court
ought not to construe an ambiguous charge as referring to the graver of two
possible offences but rather to the less serious one, especially where its
charging words are in the language of the less serious offence. That is the
present case, and I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.

I may add that were I of a different opinion so
as to hold that the indictment properly charged manslaughter under s. 203,
I would agree that the case should be remitted to the Alberta Appellate
Division to review the sentence in the light of a conviction under s. 203.
The accused did appeal sentence as well as conviction and the Appellate
Division should have the opportunity to consider the appropriateness of the
sentence on a conviction under s. 203.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court by the Attorney General of Alberta from a judgment of the
Appellate Divison of the Supreme Court of that Province whereby it was ordered
that the appeal of the present respondent from his conviction under s. 203
of the Criminal Code entered at trial before Mr. Justice Manning
sitting without a jury

…be allowed and the conviction be quashed
under section 203 but found guilty under section 233(1) of the Criminal
Code. Sentence varied to become nine months’ imprisonment and prohibited
from driving a motor vehicle for a period of three years.

It was argued on behalf of the respondent that
the Attorney General had no right to appeal to this Court under s. 621(1)
of the Criminal Code because the Appellate Division did not “set
aside a conviction” but rather substituted a conviction for another offence
than that charged in the indictment. This argument is based on the opening

[Page 848]

paragraph of the reasons for judgment delivered
by Mr. Justice Prowse on behalf of the Appellate Division which reads as
follows:

The Court is of the view that the appeal
must be allowed to the extent of substituting a conviction under
section 233(1) of the Criminal Code instead of a conviction under
section 203 on the ground that the indictment clearly alleges an offence
in the wording of section 233(1) and in our view the Appellant was guilty
of that offence.

I am unable to give effect to the contention
that the judgment of the Appellate Division did not set aside the conviction
having regard to the terms of the order allowing the appeal and particularly to
that part thereof which expressly stipulated that “the conviction be quashed
under section 203”.

The question at the heart of this appeal is
whether indeed the offence alleged in the indictment is that of “causing death
by criminal negligence” contrary to the provisions of s. 203 of the Criminal
Code or merely one of “criminal negligence in the operation of a motor
vehicle” contrary to s. 233(1). It is in my view desirable that both
sections should be reproduced in these reasons. Section 203 reads as
follows:

203. Every
one who by criminal negligence causes death to another person is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

Section 233(1) on the other hand provides that:

233. (1)
Every one who is criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle is
guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for five years, or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The indictment was framed in the following
language:

Wayne Donald McGloan stands charged

That he at or near Penhold in the Judicial
District of Red Deer in the Province of Alberta, on or about the 19th day of May,
A.D. 1973, was criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle and did
thereby cause death to Cary Lou Gatchke, contrary to the Provisions of the
Criminal Code.

[Page 849]

Dated this 1st day of November A.D. 1973 at
Red Deer, Alberta

Sec. 203 Criminal Code.


 
  
  B.S. PANNU
  
 
 
  
  Agent of the Attorney General
  
 


There is in my view no ambiguity in the charge
so laid although objection might have been taken to it as being duplicitous had
it not been for the provisions of s. 519(1)(b) of the Criminal
Code which read as follows:

519. (1) A
count is not objectionable by reason only that…

(b) it is double or
multifarious.

The respondent, however, cited and relied on the
case of Schwartzenhauer v. The King[2] in support of the view expressed by
Mr. Justice Prowse in the passage which I have quoted from his reasons for
judgment. In that case the accused was charged that he did

…counsel or procure a certain person, to
wit, Grietje Sundquest, to commit an indictable offence, namely, to use
unlawfully on the person of Veronica Kuva an instrument or instruments with
intent to procure a miscarriage of Veronica Kuva, which offence the said
Grietje Sundquest did commit and did thereby kill and slay the said Veronica
Kuva against the form of the statute in such case made and provided and against
the peace of our Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity.

This was treated at trial as being a charge of
murder and the accused was convicted of manslaughter. His conviction was
affirmed by the majority of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and the
matter came to this Court by reason of the dissenting judgment of
Mr. Justice McPhillips on the following grounds which are epitomized in
the formal judgment of the Court:

(1) The dying declaration of Veronica Kuva
was wrongfully admitted in evidence; or wrongfully admitted as to counselling;
and

(2) that the learned trial judge
misdirected the jury respecting the said evidence of the said Veronica Kuva.

In this Court it was unanimously agreed that the
dying declaration of a deceased could only be

[Page 850]

admitted where his or her death was the subject
of the charge and it was contended on behalf of the accused appellant that the
charge was one of counselling an abortion and not one of homicide and that the
declaration was therefore inadmissible. A careful consideration of the reasons
for judgment of the members of this Court discloses that the declaration was
found to be inadmissible on other grounds and the majority of the judges
expressly stated that they were disposing of the case without deciding whether
or not the charge might be considered one of homicide.

Counsel on behalf of the respondent in the
present case contended that it was held in the Schwartzenhauer case that
the “charge was one of counselling an abortion from which death resulted and
not homicide”, but as I have indicated the majority of the judges in that case
expressly refrained from making any such finding. The case therefore affords no
authority whatever, either by analogy or otherwise, to support the submission
that under the entirely different circumstances of the present case, the charge
was one of “criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle” contrary
to s. 233(1) and not one of “causing death by criminal negligence”
contrary to s. 203.

The gravamen of the charge here is that the
accused “was criminally negligent… and did thereby cause death…” and in my view
the fact that the means whereby the death was caused, i.e. by being
“criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle” are also alleged
does not alter the fact that the respondent is charged as “one who by criminal
negligence causes death to another person” within the meaning of s. 203 of
the Criminal Code. By specifying the kind of criminal negligence which
caused the death in this case, the Crown was, in my opinion, doing no more than
providing the respondent with particulars of the charge against him.

The second two paragraphs of the reasons for
judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Prowse read as follows:

With respect to the admissions supposedly made
at the beginning of the trial we are of the opinion that they

[Page 851]

were unsatisfactory and that in making
admissions the procedure set out in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada
in Castellani v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 310, should be followed.

Admissions should be made in clear,
unambiguous terms and if the procedure set out in that case is followed it
should assist counsel in that regard. The effect of the admissions in dispute
is unimportant in view of the substitution of a conviction under s. 233
(1) for the conviction entered under s. 203.

As I consider that the conviction entered at
trial was a proper one, it becomes necessary to deal with the two paragraphs
last recited.

In this regard I find it necessary to reproduce
the record of the admission in question which appears to have been agreed to by
Mr. Doz on behalf of the accused:

MR. PANNU: (For the Crown)

At the outset, My Lord, I might bring to
the attention of the Court it is agreed that the person who is alleged to have
died as a result of the accident was a passenger in the accused’s vehicle and
she died as a result of the injuries.

MR. DOZ:

That is correct, My Lord, sustained in the
accident.

THE COURT:

Cary Lou Gatchke referred to in the charge
died as a result of injuries sustained in the accident.

MR. DOZ:

In the accident.

MR. PANNU:

She was a passenger in the vehicle.

THE COURT:

She was a passenger in the vehicle?

MR. DOZ:

Accused’s vehicle.

THE COURT:

A vehicle being driven by the accused.

MR. DOZ:

The Crown will lead evidence to that
effect, sir.

Section 582 of the Criminal Code provides:

[Page 852]

Where an accused is on trial for an
indictable offence he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for
the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof.

In Castellani’s case an attempt was made
on behalf of the accused to have the Court accept a lengthy written admission
by the accused, one paragraph of which was objected to on the ground that it
had a tendency to disparage the Crown’s case and this paragraph was deleted.

In the course of the reasons for judgment which
he delivered on behalf of this Court, Chief Justice Cartwright commented on
s. 582 (562 as it then was) in the following language at p. 315:

In a criminal case, there being no
pleadings, there are no precisely worded allegations of fact which are
susceptible of categorical admission. An accused cannot admit a fact alleged
against him until the allegation has been made. When recourse is proposed to be
had to s. 562 it is for the Crown, not for the defence, to state the fact
or facts which it alleges against the accused, and of which it seeks admission.
The accused, of course, is under no obligation to admit the fact so alleged but
his choice is to admit it or to decline to do so. He cannot frame the wording of
the allegation to suit his own purposes and then insist on admitting it. To
permit such a course could only lead to confusion. The idea of the admission of
an allegation involves action by two persons, one who makes the allegation and
another who admits it.

In the present case the charge laid against the
respondent involved the allegation that Cary Lou Gatchke’s death was caused by
the manner in which the respondent operated his motor vehicle, and under the
circumstances, one of the facts which the Crown would have to prove in support
of this allegation was that the deceased died as a result of the injuries she
received while a passenger in the accused’s vehicle. The exchange between
counsel in open Court to which I have alluded, constituted an admission of this
fact, and with the greatest respect for Mr. Justice Prowse, it was made
“in clear, unambiguous terms” and I am further of opinion that the procedure
set out in the Castellani case was fully complied with.

It will be apparent that for all the above reasons
I am of opinion that the conviction entered at trial was a proper one and that
the trial judge did not

[Page 853]

err in accepting the admission then rendered. I
would therefore restore the conviction entered at trial.

The appeal to the Appellate Division included an
appeal from the sentence of five years’ imprisonment and a prohibition from
driving a motor vehicle in Canada for 15 years. The Appellate Division
substituted a sentence of imprisonment for nine months and a prohibition from
driving for three years on the basis of a conviction under s. 233 (1). The
Appellate Division, however, had no opportunity to consider the appeal from the
sentence imposed pursuant to the conviction under s. 203 entered by the
trial judge. For this reason it appears to me desirable that the question of
sentence be remitted to the Appellate Division for consideration.

In the result, I would allow this appeal,
restore the conviction of the learned trial judge and direct that the case be
returned to the Appellate Division for consideration of the appeal against
sentence imposed pursuant to that judgment.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Appeal—Supreme Court of
Canada—Jurisdiction—Appeal against sentence—No cross-appeal by Crown—Increased
sentence requested in Crown’s statement of fact and law—Sentence increased by
Court of Appeal—Right of Court of Appeal to increase sentence—Supreme Court Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, s. 41—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 603, 605,
607 and 614—Criminal Appeal Rules (Ont.), 10 to 25.

The accused had pleaded guilty to charges of
rape and wounding. He was sentenced to 12 years concurrent. On his appeal against
sentence this was increased to life imprisonment. Leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada was granted on the question whether, on an appeal by
the accused against sentence, where there was no cross appeal by the Crown to
have the sentence increased, the Court of Appeal on dismissing the appeal had
the power to increase the sentence imposed on the accused. The appeal was heard
before a Court composed of eight judges. In the result the appeal failed on an
equal division of the members of the Court. The accused made application for a
re-hearing; this was granted and the full bench considered the appeal on
re-argument.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be
dismissed.

Per Curiam: The
Supreme Court of Canada has jurisdiction under s. 41 of the Supreme Court
Act to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the commission of
an indictable offence but will not entertain an appeal against the fitness of a
sentence.

359; R. v. MacDonald, [1965] S.C.R. 831, referred to.

Per Martland,
Judson, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ.: Section 614(1) provides that, where an
appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the
sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed
against and may… vary the sentence with(in) the limits prescribed
by law for the offence… The words “vary the sentence within the limits
prescribed by law” are plain words which fix the scope of the power conferred
upon the Court by reference to the maximum applicable penalty and are not to be
read as restricted to a variation by way of reduction.

If the accused had not been given adequate
notice that at the hearing of his appeal consideration would be given to an
increase in his sentence, it would have to be held that he was not given an
opportunity to be heard before the adverse determination was made against him.
In this case, Counsel for the Crown made it known in the statement of fact and
law filed prior to the hearing. Due to this notice the objection to
jurisdiction is based purely on a matter of form. There is no basis for adverse
comment against Counsel for the Crown or the Court below.

Per Ritchie
and de Grandpré JJ.: Parliament having fixed the Court of Appeal with the
obligation to “consider the fitness of the sentence”, it would take clear
statutory language to limit that consideration to the question of whether the
sentence was too severe while precluding any consideration of whether it was
severe enough. There is no such language in the Criminal Code and s.
614(1) constitutes a mandatory direction to the Court of Appeal to consider
both aspects of the question. The Court of Appeal has power to increase a
sentence when an appeal is taken in accordance with s. 603(1) by a person
convicted at trial and this power is not dependant on an appeal being asserted
by the Crown under s. 605.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting: A right of appeal is
altogether statutory (s. 602) and is governed by the Criminal Code and
as to procedure (s. 607) by the rules of court, in this case the Criminal
Appeal Rules (Ont.), 10 to 25. The Crown in serving notice on the appellant
attempted to assert a

[Page 829]

right of appeal from sentence without
complying with the provisions of the Code or the Rules. Further, the
powers of the Court of Appeal defined in s. 614 of the Code are exact
and do not permit that court to exercise powers other than these given. The
powers in paras. (a) and (b) are disjunctive. The
word “or” at the end of para. (a) does not permit the Court to
exercise its jurisdiction under both paragraphs. It must choose whether to
exercise its powers under para. (a) by varying or under para. (b)
by dismissing the appeal. The Crown attempted to short-circuit the proper
procedure and to intimidate the accused from asserting his right of appeal.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting (after the first hearing): An appeal
should not be understood to carry additional jeopardy to an appellant beyond
that already incurred as a result of the trial, especially where criminal
justice is involved. The judgment in appeal is a departure by a provincial
appellate Court from judicial justice and a venture into a species of
administrative justice, a departure from ordinary appellate procedure all the
more startling because criminal justice is involved.

Per Beetz J., dissenting:
After a re-hearing of the appeal there is no reason to alter the views
previously expressed.

Per Beetz J., dissenting
(after the first hearing): The wording of s. 614 was not meant to relieve
the Crown from the need to seek leave and, such leave being granted, from
actually appealing, merely because a convicted person avails himself of his
right to try to have his sentence reduced; nor does s. 614 give to the Court of
Appeal jurisdiction to hear what amounts to an appeal as of right by the Crown
despite the explicit provision in the Code and where no formal notice
was given to the convicted person.

RE-HEARING OF AN APPEAL from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] imposing
a sentence of life imprisonment on the appellant on an appeal from sentence, 12
years concurrent, on a plea of guilty to rape and to causing bodily harm.
Appeal dismissed, Laskin C.J. and Spence, Dickson and Beetz JJ. dissenting.

J.R. Belleghem, for the appellant.

E.G. Hachborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. after
the first hearing was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—I have had
the advantage of seeing the reasons proposed by my brothers Spence and Pigeon.
There are two questions in this appeal, a preliminary question of jurisdiction
and the question going to the merits on which leave to appeal was granted. Like
my brother Spence, I am in agreement with my brother Pigeon in his disposition
of the question of jurisdiction, a disposition that affirms jurisdiction in
this case and which consequently involves the overruling of the Goldhar case[2], and of other cases which adopted its
approach to deny jurisdiction. On the question of the merits, I am fully in
accord with the reasons and conclusion of my brother Spence.

What prompts me to add observations of my own
is a troubled concern about the way in which I think the two questions in this
appeal have been assessed. Both in the Goldhar case and in other cases,
such as Paul v. The Queen[3], which
applied it, and in the reasons of my brother Pigeon in the present case, the
issue of jurisdiction was resolved according to different canons of statutory
construction leading to different results. My brother Pigeon declares in the
preseSupreme Court of Canadant case in favour of literal construction while
Fauteux J. (as he then was) in Goldhar and in Paul was of the
view that literal construction would lead to repugnancy with other statutory
provisions.

[Page 831]

Does this mean then that the choice of a canon
of construction determines the meaning and application of a statutory provision
which is under review? My experience does not persuade me that the matter is so
simple. The relevant question is surely that of determining why one approach is
selected rather than another, involving therefore a consideration of the
factors that bear on the selection. I assume in this connection that different
results will flow according to the selection made. This is not however
invariably so. In the vast majority of the cases where statutes have to be
interpreted and the interpretation determines the result, it makes no
difference which canon of interpretation (be it the so-called literal rule or
the golden rule or the mischief rule) is chosen.

There are contradictions or difficulties in all
of the canons that have been usually relied on. Judges may disagree on what the
plain meaning is even when they agree that it is the plain meaning or literal
approach that should prevail. Similarly, judges may disagree on what is the
social purpose of a statute, although agreeing that under the mischief rule
that is what they should seek in construing a statutory provision. In my view,
we cannot escape making our own determination of purpose, or policy, regardless
of the canon that is invoked; indeed, we make it when we purport to apply one
canon rather than another. The present appeal is illustrative of this view in
respect of both of the questions that are involved in it.

I take first the preliminary question of
jurisdiction. It is to me unreal to think that literal construction determines
the result when in order to arrive at it a detailed review of legislative
history is required (and properly so) and the purpose of the measure under
review is pursued through an examination of the changes made in the
jurisdiction and role of this Court. Once it is admitted, as it must be here,
that reasonable men can differ on the effect of language directed to a
particular end which itself is in issue, we are in a situation where our
conclusion will be influenced by our view of what this Court’s jurisdiction and
role should be. Since I would not exclude cases from the leave jurisdiction of
this Court unless it is quite plain

[Page 832]

that they have been excluded by statute, and
since I do not regard the present appeal as plainly excluded I support the
conclusion of my brother Pigeon on the question of jurisdiction.

On the question of the merits, I think this is
eminently a case where under any canon of construction the result reached by my
brother Spence is the preferable one. I readily admit to a predisposition to
that result by reason of my dissent, as a member of the Ontario Court of
Appeal, in R. v. Willis[4]. My
conclusion there was based on a full examination of the legislative history, on
an assessment of social purpose as I saw it reflected in the statutory
language, and on my appreciation of the nature of an appeal. I have never
understood an appeal to carry additional jeopardy to an appellant beyond that
already incurred as a result of the trial; and this must be especially so where
criminal justice is involved.

The result that I reached in the Willis case
and that I would reach here has been made even clearer to me by the canvass
that my brother Spence has made of the language of the various provisions of
the Criminal Code bearing upon the issue, a canvass which emphasizes literal
construction of the whole of s. 614(1) in the context of the rights of appeal
open to the Crown as well as to the accused.

The provincial appellate Courts in this country
appear to have been influenced by English cases without, at least so far as their
reasons disclose, dwelling on the terms of the English legislation on which
those cases were based. The judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R.
v. Christakos[5], which
seems to have become a pivotal case on the question at issue, contains nothing
but a bare reference to some English cases. The majority in R. v. Willis
purported to proceed on a literal approach and it was applied without more
by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Valade v. R.[6] Since this was the approach taken by
my brother Spence in reaching an opposite result, I am reinforced in

[Page 833]

my observations on the canons of construction.

As is well known, the English Criminal Appeal
Act of 1907 (U.K.), c. 23
gave express power to increase a sentence on an appeal by the accused. There
was no right of appeal against sentence in the Crown, and hence it might well
have been the view of the Court of Appeal that the language of s. 4(3) of the
1907 Act (which empowered it “if they think that a different sentence should
have been imposed… [to] pass such other sentence warranted in law by the
verdict”) would support the exercise of power to impose a harsher sentence even
without express authority to do so. But s. 4(3) included the words “whether
more or less severe”, indicating an appreciation by the British Parliament of
the ordinary limits of an appeal, especially in criminal matters. I may add
that the English Criminal Appeal Act of 1968 (U.K.), c. 19, s. 10, as
amended by the Courts Act, 1971 (U.K.), c. 23, s. 56 and Sch. 8 has
removed the express power theretofore given to increase a sentence upon an
appeal against it by an accused.

I regard the judgment in appeal as a departure
by a provincial appellate Court from judicial justice and as a venture into a
species of administrative justice, a departure from ordinary appellate
procedure all the more startling because criminal justice is involved.

I would allow the appeal as proposed by my
brother Spence.

Laskin C.J. and Dickson and Beetz JJ. also
concurred in the judgment of

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This appeal was
argued at an earlier date before a court composed of eight judges. Several
members of this Court, including myself, wrote reasons for judgment and in the
result the appeal failed upon an equal division of the eight members of the
Court. The

[Page 834]

appellant made application for a rehearing which
application was granted and all nine members of the Court considered the appeal
upon reargument.

I am still of the opinion that the appeal should
be allowed and I, therefore, repeat hereunder my reasons for judgment as
previously delivered. They are as follows:

I have had the opportunity to peruse the reasons
for judgment written by Mr. Justice Pigeon and I adopt the facts as stated
in those reasons and will find it necessary to refer to very few other facts.

In so far as Mr. Justice Pigeon finds that
this Court had jurisdiction to consider this appeal, I am in complete agreement
with him and I have nothing to add. With respect, however, I am of the opinion
that the appeal should succeed and that the Court of Appeal for Ontario had no
jurisdiction to increase the sentence imposed upon the accused when the Crown
had chosen merely to serve upon the accused a notice that if he persisted in
his appeal the Crown would request the court to impose a more severe sentence.
This conclusion entails the determination that in my opinion, the decision of
the Court of Appeal in R. v. Willis[7], was in error and that also the
decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in R. v. Christakos[8], and
of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Valade v. The Queen[9], suffered from like defect.

I commence with the proposition that a right of
appeal is altogether statutory. This principle itself appears in the Criminal
Code in s. 602. It reads:

602. No proceedings other than those
authorized by this Part and Part XXIII shall be taken by way of appeal in
proceedings in respect of indictable offences.

The right of appeal of the attorney general or
counsel at his direction is granted by s. 605 of the Code and as to
sentence is dealt with in para. 1(b) thereof which reads:

[Page 835]

605. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

. . .

(b) with leave of the court
of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

Section 607 [am. 1972 (Can.), c. 13, s. 53]
of the Code governs procedure on appeals by either the Crown or the
accused and provides particularly that the appellant “shall give notice of
appeal or notice of his application for leave to appeal, in such manner and
within such period as may be directed by rules of court”. Those rules of court,
in the case of Ontario, are
contained in Rules 10 to 25 of the Criminal Appeal Rules and Rule 12(2) thereof
provides that:

12. (2) Where the appeal is from sentence…
the Notice of Appeal shall be served within thirty days from the day of
sentence.

Rule 13(b) provides:

13. (b) Service of a Notice
of Appeal shall be effected… in all other cases by delivering to the office of
the Registrar personally or by registered mail three copies of a Notice of
Appeal, and, in addition, in appeals by an Attorney General, by personal
service on the convicted person.

When the Crown served notice upon the accused,
the appellant in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, of an intention to
request a more severe sentence, it was, in fact, attempting to assert a right
of appeal from sentence. The Crown was doing so without carrying out the
formalities required by the provisions of the Code which I have cited
and the proper carrying out of such requirements was, in my view, requisite for
obtaining the right to ask the Court of Appeal to increase the sentence, and
failing due compliance with those requirements, the Crown had no jurisdiction
to apply for an increase in sentence and the Court had no jurisdiction to grant
such an increase: Dennis v. The Queen[10].

[Page 836]

If the Crown had complied with the requirements,
then the Crown would have had to make application for leave to appeal from the
sentence and both upon such application and on the appeal itself, if leave to
appeal had been granted, the Crown would have the same onus as has an appellant
on all appeals. Using the procedure which the Crown used in this particular case,
there was no statutory onus at all upon the Crown and it would appear that, in
fact, the onus was thrown upon the accused not only in his vain attempt to
demonstrate that the sentence imposed on him was too severe but to prevent that
sentence from being increased. I am, moreover, of the opinion that the powers
of the Court of Appeal defined in s. 614 of the Code are exact and do
not permit the Court to exercise powers other than those given.
Section 614(1) provides:

614. (1) Where an appeal is taken against
sentence the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law,
consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may upon such
evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,

(a) vary the sentence with
the limits prescribed by law for the offences of which the accused was
convicted, or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

In the present appeal, the certificate of the
formal judgment of the Court of Appeal reads, in part:

THIS COURT DID ORDER THAT the said appeal
should be and the same was thereby dismissed but that the sentence of twelve
(12) years on the charge of rape should be varied to one of life imprisonment.

Jessup J.A., in giving reasons for the Court of
Appeal, said:

In the result I would dismiss the
appellant’s appeal but vary the sentence on the charge of rape by changing it
to one of life imprisonment.

So the certificate of the formal order
accurately reflects the reasons given for the Court of Appeal.

It will be seen, therefore, that the Court of
Appeal purported to act under both para. (a) and para. (b)
of s. 614(1) in that it not only dismissed the appeal as authorized by
para. (b) but it also varied the sentence as authorized by para.
(a). The

[Page 837]

powers in paras. (a) and (b)
are disjunctive. The word “or” is the word which is at the end of para. (a)
and I am of the opinion that s. 6114 of this Code does not permit a
court on the consideration of a specific appeal to exercise its jurisdiction
under both paras. (a) and (b) but that the Court of
Appeal must choose whether to exercise its powers under para. (a) by
varying or under para. (b) by dismissing the appeal. I think this
is a convincing indication that by the words of s. 614(1)(a) “vary the
sentence with the limits prescribed by law for the offences of which the
accused was convicted”, Parliament only intended to permit a variation by way
of decrease upon the appeal of an accused person or, if the Crown were the
appellant, to consider a variation by way of increase upon the Crown’s appeal.

It is, I think, of some interest and value to
note that in the United Kingdom, when the power of the Court of Appeal to
increase sentence was granted by s. 4(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907
(U.K.), c. 23, the Appellate Court was empowered to quash the sentence passed
at trial and “(2) pass such other sentence warranted in law by the verdict
(whether more or less severe) in substitution therefor”. Thus, the Parliament
in the United Kingdom by
specific words granted a power to increase. No such words as “whether more or
less severe” appear in s. 614(1)(a) of the Code and, in my view,
the words “such other sentence warranted in law” as they appear in the United
Kingdom statute and the words “the sentence with the limits prescribed by law”
as they appear in the Criminal Code are exactly in pari materia. It
is, I think, indeed significant that Parliament in the United
 Kingdom thought it necessary to add a specific
authorization for the imposition of a more severe sentence.

I note also the opening words of s. 614(1)
“where an appeal is taken against sentence” and that the words are not “where
any appeal is taken against sentence”, again indicating that the power to vary
is limited to a power in considering an appeal not in considering a motion by
the Crown urged at the time that an appeal by the accused is before the Court.

[Page 838]

There is another reason for my conclusion which
I find most convincing. In the present case, counsel for the Attorney General
relying on R. v. Willis, supra, first advised counsel for the
appellant by telephone and later confirmed by letter that if the appellant had
put his sentence in issue the Court of Appeal would be at liberty to increase
it if it saw fit and that the Crown would be asking the Court of Appeal to
increase the sentence, possibly to life. The Crown and the appellant’s counsel
agreed to adjourn the appeal and maintain the status quo of the proceedings to
enable the appellant’s counsel to obtain instructions. Jessup J.A., in his
reasons for judgment, said:

The appellant was given notice of the
Crown’s motion from its Statement of Law and Fact and did not abandon his
appeal but rather argued it with vigour.

I am of the opinion that this is a most
objectionable in terrorem procedure.

An accused person, on the advice of counsel, is
of the opinion that he has a serious appeal as to the quantum of sentence which
he wishes to urge before the Court of Appeal. The Crown seeks to intimidate him
from doing so by threatening that if he does urge his appeal then the Crown
will ask that the sentence be increased. If the Crown desires to obtain an
increase in sentence, then the Crown should apply for leave to appeal against
sentence and take on the burden of an appellant to which I have already
referred, rather than by threatening the accused that if he is bold enough to
assert his own right of appeal dire results will ensue.

To the foregoing reasons, I wish to add the
following.

I am of the opinion that there is another factor
of some importance. Had the Crown acted in accordance with the usual procedure
and cross-appealed against sentence as I have already pointed out, the Crown
would have had to obtain leave to do so. The time for application for leave, as
I

[Page 839]

have noted above and as fixed by Rule 12(2) of
the Criminal Appeal Rules, was within thirty days from the date of
sentence.

The sentence was passed on July 11, 1973. The appellant appealed to the
Court of Appeal by notice dated July 13, 1973 but served on July 18, 1973. The time for application for leave
to cross-appeal, therefore, had expired on August 10, 1973. There is nothing in
the appeal to show that the Crown had at that date any intention to
cross-appeal and, in fact, there is no indication that the Crown was
considering asking for an increase of sentence until October 16, 1973 when
counsel for the Attorney General verbally advised counsel for the appellant of
an intention to ask the Court of Appeal to increase the sentence.

If the Crown had sought to bring the matter
before the Court of Appeal at that time, it would have had to apply for an
extension of the time within which application for leave might be given. Such
application is governed by the provisions of s. 607(2) of the Code which
provides:

(2) The court of appeal or a judge thereof
may at any time extend the time within which notice of appeal or notice of an
application for leave to appeal may be given, but this subsection does not
apply where a sentence of death has been imposed pursuant to a conviction.

Although the said subsection does not set
out any criteria for the grant of such extension of time, it has been said in a
series of cases that such extension will not be granted as of course butt only
upon special circumstances. So, in R. v. Raymond[11], Montgomery J.A., considering such
an application, said at p. 659:

The reason given is insufficient: It should
not be beyond human ingenuity to devise an administrative system whereby the
proper officers of the Crown could decide whether or not to appeal within 15
days of such a judgment; if this cannot be arranged, the department should make
representations to have either the Court’s rules of practice or the Criminal
Code suitably amended. To accept this as a reason for extending the delay would
be tantamount to deciding that the Crown is more or less automatically entitled
to a delay in every case of

[Page 840]

an appeal of this nature. The accused, if
he wishes to obtain a delay, must demonstrate some special circumstances; there
is no reason why this rule should not apply to the Crown.

and in R. v. Antoine[12], Guy J.A., considering such an
application as a member of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, held that in order to grant the application he would have had to
find that there was an intention to appeal sentence prior to the time for
making the application for leave having expired. As I have said, no such
intention on the part of the Crown was manifest in the present case.

I cite this point as further demonstration of
the fact that the Crown, by choosing the procedure it has chosen in the present
case, has in fact short-circuited the proper procedure provided in the Criminal
Code for bringing to the Court of Appeal the Crown’s submission that a
sentence passed at trial should be increased. Not only must theCrown, under the
ordinary procedure, apply for and obtain leave to appeal but the Crown must do
so within a thirty-day period after the sentence and if the Crown does not make
application within that limited period it must obtain an extension of that
period for some special reason. None of that procedure, of course, was required
from the Crown under the circumstances existing in the present appeal.

The result of the rehearing is that the appeal
stands dismissed by a majority of five judges to four. Therefore, it is
apparent that after two arguments in this Court the appellant still is
condemned to a sentence of life imprisonment by this slim majority after an
experienced provincial court judge having heard all the evidence was of the
opinion that a twelve-year sentence was proper.

It may well be that Parliament will wish to
consider whether the provisions of s. 614 of the Criminal Code should be
at least clarified if not amended. Parliament, in such consideration, might

[Page 841]

have regard for the fact that the statutes in
the United Kingdom, which as I have pointed out previously made specific
provision permitting the Court of Criminal Appeal to increase the appellant’s
sentence upon his application to decrease it, have been amended by the Criminal
Appeal Act, 1968 (U.K.), c. 19, s. 11(3), by which the power of the Court
of Appeal was limited to quashing the sentence or passing such sentence or
making such order as the Court thought appropriate for the case and as the
court below had power to pass or make “but the Court shall so exercise their
powers under this subsection that, taking the case as a whole, the
appellant is not more severely dealt with on appeal than he was dealt with by
the court below”. This provision was enacted despite the fact that the Crown in
the United Kingdom has no
appeal against the sentence passed after trial.

For all of those reasons, I would allow the
appeal and restore the sentence imposed by the Provincial Court Judge.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Pigeon and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—This case having been reheard before
the full Court I will first repeat the reasons written by me after the first
hearing.

Before Provincial Court Judge, D.V. Latimer, the
appellant pleaded guilty to charges of rape and wounding. He was sentenced to
twelve years concurrent. On his appeal against sentence, this was increased to
life imprisonment. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the following
question of law:

On an appeal by the accused against
sentence, where there is no cross-appeal by the Crown to have the sentence
increased does the Ontario Court of Appeal on dismissing the accused’s appeal
have the power to increase the sentence imposed upon the accused?

[Page 842]

Rather than summarize the reasons stated by
Jessup J.A. for the Court of Appeal, I will quote the essential.

The Appellant appeals his sentence of
twelve years imposed after his plea of guilty to a charge of rape and his
sentence of twelve years concurrent imposed upon his plea of guilty to a charge
of causing bodily harm with intent to wound, maim or disfigure. The sentences having
been put in issue, the Crown moves for their increase, citing Regina v. Willis,
[1969] 1 O.R. 64. The appellant was given notice of the Crown’s motion from
its Statement of Law and Fact and did not abandon his appeal but rather argued
it with vigour.

Under circumstances indicating planning and
deliberation, the appellant went at night to a home where the
fourteen-year-old, virginal complainant was baby-sitting. After assaulting her
with his fists he forcibly stripped her of all her clothes and, although she
was menstruating, then raped her. He then forced the complainant, unclothed
except for a jacket she threw on, to go outside with the evident intention of
taking her somewhere in his car. When the complainant attempted to run away he
overtook her and forced her back into the house. When the complainant then
attempted to use the telephone, the appellant knocked her to the floor and with
a paring knife stabbed her repeatedly in the face and eyes and about the throat
until the knife broke. As a result the complainant may lose the sight of one
eye. The appellant then fled the house abandoning the wounded complainant.
While the appellant had considerable to drink the evening of the crimes, there
is no suggestion that he lacked the requisite intent to commit them.

. .
.

The reports and evidence available to the
learned Provincial Judge at the time of sentencing show that the appellant is
not insane, mentally ill or psychotic. However, he suffers from a personality
disorder manifested in impulsiveness, low stress tolerance, anger which he does
not know how to handle properly and difficulty in knowing his own sexual
identity. Dr. Karen Galbraith, a psychologist, and Dr. Peter Rowsell, a
psychiatrist, both agreed that he was dangerous to the community. Both were testifying
for the appellant.

. .
.

[Page 843]

When an accused has been convicted of a
serious crime in itself calling for a substantial sentence and when he suffers
from some mental or personality disorder rendering him a danger to the
community but not subjecting him to confinement in a mental institution and
when it is uncertain when, if ever, the accused will be cured of his
affliction, in my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of life. Such a
sentence, in such circumstances, amounts to an indefinite sentence under which
the Parole Board can release him to the community when it is satisfied, upon
adequate psychiatric examination, it is in the interest of the accused and of
the community for him to return to society. The policy expressed in my opinion
is that of the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal, cf. Thomas,
Principles of Sentencing at pp. 272-279.

In the result I would dismiss the
appellant’s appeal but vary the sentence on the charge of rape by changing it
to one of life imprisonment.

On the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the
Crown objected to the jurisdiction of this Court relying on Goldhar v. The
Queen[13], a
decision rendered on an application for leave to appeal heard by a court of
five judges in which it was held, Cartwright J. dissenting, “that this Court
has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the
commission of an indictable offence”. In my view, that decision is not binding
and should not be followed for the following reasons.

Before the 1949 amendments, the Supreme Court
Act did not confer jurisdiction to this Court in criminal cases. This was
due to the following words in s. 36: “except in criminal causes and in
proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or
prohibition arising out of a criminal charge”. Therefore, any jurisdiction in
criminal matters had to be found in the Criminal Code or other statute.

In Goldhamer v. The King[14], the appeal to this Court was from
a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal increasing the sentence passed on
conviction. This had been done on an appeal by the Crown under s. 1013 of the Criminal
Code then in

[Page 844]

force as replaced by 1923 (Can.), c. 41, s. 9 and reading in part as
follows:

1013. A person convicted on indictment may
appeal to the Court of appeal against his conviction,…

(2) A person convicted on indictment, or
the Attorney General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave
of a judge of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence
passed by the trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.

Appeals to this Court were then governed by ss.
1024 and 1024(a) of the Criminal Code. The latter section*
governed appeals by leave from judgments setting aside or affirming a
conviction of an indictable offence in the case of a conflict with a judgment
of another court of appeal in a like case. Therefore, it was clear that the
only possible foundation for the appeal was in s. 1024 of which the only
relevant part, subs. 1, then read as follows:

1024. Any person convicted of any
indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under
section ten hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
against the affirmance of such conviction:** Provided
that no such appeal can be taken if the court of appeal is unanimous in
affirming the conviction, nor unless notice of appeal in writing has been
served on the Attorney General within fifteen days after such affirmance or
such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge
thereof.

It was held that this Court had no jurisdiction
Duff J. saying:

As my brother Idington points out, the word
“conviction” cannot, perhaps, be said to be capable of only one necessarily
exclusive meaning, and it may be capable of being employed with a signification
including the sentence. Section 1013 does, however, I think, distinguish
very clearly between the conviction and the sentence for

[Page 845]

the purposes of appeal, and the Act of
13-14 Geo. V, by which the present section was brought into force, made no
change in section 1024. Accordingly, I think the word “conviction” in the
last mentioned section should be read in its less technical sense, and
consequently that there is no right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
from the judgment given by a court of appeal on an appeal under
subsection (2) of section 1013.

In 1949, after the Privy Council had affirmed[15] (A.G. Ont. v. A.G. Can.) the
opinion of this Court on a reference[16] (Re
Privy Council Appeals), Parliament enacted important amendments to
the Supreme Court Act by 1949 (Can.), c. 37. Appeals to the Privy
Council which had previously been abolished in criminal matters only, by
re-enacting in 1933 s. 1024.4 of the Criminal Code, were definitely
abolished in all cases. Much wider provision than before was made for appeals
by special leave in a new s. 41, the material part of which is as follows
(parentheses indicate words deleted in 1956):

41. (1) Subject to subsection three
(and to section forty-four) an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada
with leave of that court from any final or other judgment of the highest court
of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had
in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada,
whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada has been refused
by any other court.

(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting
or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an
indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction,
of an offence other than an indictable offence.

The first case in which leave to appeal in a
criminal cause was sought to be obtained under those provisions appears to be The
Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. et al. v. The Queen. It
is unfortunately reported on the merits only[17].
The judgment appealed to this Court was a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario

[Page 846]

affirming with variation an order of prohibition
issued out of the Supreme Court of Ontario under the provisions of s. 31 of the
Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as amended, subsequent
to a conviction upon indictment for an offence under that Act. The appeal to
the Court of Appeal for Ontario had been taken under the provisions of the Criminal
Code pertaining to an appeal from a sentence and the Court of Appeal had
varied the judgment appealed from expressly holding it to be a sentence by virtue
of s. 1012(e) of the Criminal Code providing that for the
purposes of appeal: “ ‘sentence9 includes any order of a trial court made on
conviction with reference to the person convicted.” ([1954] O.R. 377, at
p. 396). The application for leave was first heard on June 22, 1954. A re-argument was directed that
took place on December 6, 1954. On January 25, judgment granting leave was
rendered by the full Court. No written reasons were delivered and the decision
was recorded as follows in the Minute Book:

The majority being of the opinion that this
Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal, the applications therefor are
allowed.

The material filed by the applicants on the
motions for leave shows that the applications were made exclusively under s. 41
of the Supreme Court Act. The decision in Goldhamer was referred
to as showing that this Court did not have jurisdiction under the Criminal
Code. On the merits, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was affirmed and
this would seem to indicate that this Court did not consider that the Court
below had erred in asserting jurisdiction to deal with the order as being a
sentence.

The next case of an application for leave to
appeal in a criminal cause under the Supreme Court Act was Parkes v.
The Queen[18]. The
subject-matter of the appeal was a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from a
decision of a County Court judge finding

[Page 847]

that the appellant was an habitual criminal and
sentencing him to an undetermined term in the penitentiary under the provisions
of s. 660 of the Criminal Code. It was held unanimously by a Court of
five judges that such a decision is a judgment within the meaning of that word
in s. 41(1) and does not fall within the terms of s. 41(3) so that this
Court had jurisdiction to grant leave. In the reasons of the Court no reference
was made to the decision in the Goodyear case, but it was referred to in
the material on the application for leave. On the merits, the appeal was
allowed unanimously and the sentence of preventive; detention was quashed[19]. (This precedent has been uniformly
followed in appeals from sentences of preventive detention, jurisdiction being
asserted to hear such appeals in a number of cases culminating in Poole v.
The Queen[20] where
the majority of the full Court held that this applied not only against the
finding that the accused is an habitual criminal but also to the conclusion
that it is expedient to sentence him to preventive detention.)

A few years later, s. 41 was considered in
connection with an offence other than an indictable offence in Smith v. The
Queen[21]. The
appeal was from the dismissal of an application for a writ of certiorari against
a finding of delinquency against a child under the Juvenile Delinquents Act.
Leave to appeal was granted subject to argument as to the right to grant
leave. On the merits, the appeal was allowed. The reasoning of Kerwin C.J. (at
p. 642), concurred in expressly by Judson J. and inferentially by the other
members of the Court, was as follows on the question of jurisdiction.

This Court had power to grant leave to
appeal under subs. (1) of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 259:

41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an
appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or
other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge
thereof, in which

[Page 848]

judgment can be had in the particular case
sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.

Subsection (3) reads:

41. (3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies
under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting
or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable
offence or, except in respect of a question of law or jurisdiction, of an
offence other than an indictable offence.

It has no application as the judgment of
the Court of Appeal is not one affirming a conviction.

It will be noted that up to nearly ten years
after the enactment of s. 41, this Court uniformly adhered to literal
construction and granted leave to appeal in criminal matters from any judgments
not excluded by subs. (3). Consideration must now be given to the decisions in
which a different view was taken. This will be done in chronological order.

In Goldhar v. The Queen[22], the application was for leave to
appeal a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal against a sentence imposed on conviction for
an indictable offence. In the reasons of the majority of the five judges
sitting, Fauteux J., after saying that no right of appeal to this Court was
given in such case by the provisions of the Criminal Code, pointed out
the inconsistencies that would ensue if this Court had jurisdiction in the
matter of sentence under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act and said (at p.
70):

I cannot think that Parliament ever
intended or even contemplated these inconsistencies flowing from either one of
these interpretations. And this, in my view, clearly indicates that it was never
intended by Parliament that the right of appeal given under s. 41 would extend
to indictable offences, as distinguished from non indictable offences.

Reference was made to Goldhamer v. The
King but not to any of the previous decisions above mentioned dealing with
the application in criminal matters of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act after
its replacement by the statute of 1949.

[Page 849]

In Paul v. The Queen[23], substantially the same reasoning
was made on an application for leave to appeal from the refusal of a Court of
Appeal to hear an appeal in a summary conviction matter or alternatively from
the dismissal of the appeal to a County Court judge. It was held on a four to
three division that this Court did not have jurisdiction. Taschereau J. (as he then
was) said (at pp. 457-458):

It was held in Goldhar v. The
Queen, that if an appeal from a sentence was not given by 41(3), nor the Criminal
Code, we could not find any authority in 41(1) to review a sentence imposed
by the Courts below. In that case it was stated by Fauteux J. with whom all the
members of the Court agreed, Cartwright J. disisenting, that in order to
determine if a convicted person could appeal against a sentence in a matter of
indictable offence, it was not permissible to look to s. 41(1) for the
authority to intervene, but only in the Criminal Code which does not
permit an appeal against a sentence.

The general proposition that matters which
are not mentioned in 41(3) must be taken to be included in 41(1) has been ruled
out in Goldhar, supra.

Fauteux J. said (at p. 467):

The proposition that judgments which are
not within the scope of s. 41(3) are necessarily embraced in s. 41(1) has been
ruled out in the Goldhar case, where a strict adherence to the rule of
literal construction of s. 41 was, in the matter, shown to lead to repugnancy.
Such a result would equally obtain if the judgment refusing leave to appeal, in
this case, was held to come within s. 41(1). For on the same reasoning, one
would have to hold that, for indictable offences, s. 41(1) authorizes an appeal
to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal
to its Court from the verdict or judgment of first instance on grounds of mixed
law and facts or pure facts. Such a jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the
limitation of our jurisdiction to pure questions of law in criminal appeals
from convictions or acquittals of offences.

The majority decision in Paul v. The
Queen was followed by a Court of five judges in R. v. J.

[Page 850]

Alepin Frères Ltée[24]. Also in R. v. MacDonald[25], a four to three decision, an
appeal by the Crown from a judgment setting aside a sentence of preventive
detention was quashed, the majority relying on the decisions in Goldhar,
Paul and Alepin Frères.

There is a clear conflict between the four last
mentioned cases and the other judgments adhering explicitly or implicitly to a
different view of s. 41. This means that on any view of the rule of stare
decisis the Court has to choose between the two conflicting views.

In my opinion, the literal construction is
preferable not only because in the absence of ambiguity the literal meaning
should always be adhered to despite any inconsistencies short of absurdity, but
also because any assumption that Parliament did not intend to depart from the
previous state of the law is unjustified. Section 41 was enacted
substantially in its present form at the time when appeals to the Privy Council
were being abolished and this court was being made truly supreme. The Privy
Council had enjoyed unlimited jurisdiction by special leave and it is apparent
that the new provision was intended to effect the change from a limited
specific jurisdiction to a broad general jurisdiction. To hold that the
inconsistencies resulting from this sweeping change indicate the intention of
leaving some wide gaps open is, in my view, entirely unwarranted. On the
contrary, the enactment of a provision that undoubtedly confers some
jurisdiction in criminal matters beyond that existing under the Criminal
Code, clearly indicates Parliament’s will to remedy the omission to extend
the jurisdiction of this Court in criminal cases when the Privy Council’s
jurisdiction in such cases was effectively abolished after the Statute of
Westminster.

No reason has been advanced for construing the
words “convicting” and “conviction” in subs. (3) of s. 41 otherwise than
the same words in s. 1024.1 of the Criminal Code in force when it was
enacted

[Page 851]

had been construed in the Goldhamer case.
It is already firmly established by a long line of cases in this Court that
those words in s. 41(3) do not include a judgment imposing a sentence of
preventive detention. It is also established by the decision of the full Court
in the Goodyear case that those same words do not apply to an order of
prohibition that was a sentence within the meaning of the definition of that
word in the same Criminal Code. Although the possibility of a
distinction with respect to other sentences was left open in Poole, this
now appears impossible on further consideration especially in view of what was
said in Goldhamer.

For those reasons, it does not appear to me that
s. 41(3) should be construed otherwise that in accordance with the strict
meaning of “convicting” and “conviction” as established by the Goldhamer decision.
This means that, in my view, the objection to jurisdiction fails. However, I
consider it appropriate to point out that such conclusion implies no departure
from our rule of never entertaining an appeal concerning the fitness of a
sentence.

Dealing now with the question on which leave was
granted in this case, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are
the following:

603. (1) A person who is convicted by a
trial court in proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

(a) against his conviction.

or

(b) against the sentence passed by
the trial court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless
that sentence is one fixed by law.

605. (1) The Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal

. .
.

(b) with leave of the court
of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in

[Page 852]

proceedings by indictment, unless that
sentence is one fixed by law.

607. (1) An appellant who proposes to
appeal to the court of appeal or to obtain the leave of that court to appeal
shall give notice of appeal or notice of his application for leave to appeal,
in such manner and within such period as may be directed by rules of court.

(2) The court of appeal or a judge thereof
may at any time extend the time within which notice of appeal or notice of an
application for leave to appeal may be given, but this subsection does not
apply where a sentence of death has been imposed pursuant to a conviction.

. .
.

614. (1) Where an appeal is taken against
sentence the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law,
consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may upon such
evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,

(a) vary the sentence with the
limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted, or


(b) dismiss the appeal.

(In 614(1) (a) “with” is a
typographical error, it should read “within” as in s. 593 of the Criminal
Code as enacted by 1953-54, c. 51).

The question, in my view, is whether, on an
appeal against sentence by the accused, the words “vary the sentence within the
limits prescribed by law” are to be read as restricted to a variation by way of
reduction.

Counsel for appellant relied heavily on the
judgment of this Court in Richard v. The Queen[26].It was an appeal in a summary
conviction case. At trial, the accused who had been charged with criminal
negligence in the operation of his motor vehicle, was convicted of the lesser
offence of driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public. On his appeal
from this conviction he was, at the end of the trial de novo, convicted
of criminal negligence as originally charged. The majority in this Court,
reversing the Ontario Court

[Page 853]

of Appeal, held that, in what is now s. 755(1),
the words “the appeal court shall hear and determine the appeal by holding a
trial de novo” meant in the case of an appeal “from a conviction” a
determination in respect of such conviction, not in respect of the charge
originally laid. Consequently, the judge hearing the appeal had no power to
enter a conviction of the more serious offence originally charged, because the
conviction for the lesser included offence involved an acquittal of the more
serious offence. There was no provision which, on an appeal by the accused from
the conviction for the lesser offence, authorized the judge hearing such appeal
to set aside that acquittal.

In my view, this decision on the construction of
a different provision concerning appeals from summary convictions is of no
assistance in the instant case. It dealt with the meaning of the words
“determine the appeal from a conviction”, while here the words used are “vary
the sentence within the limits prescribed by law”. In my view, those are plain
words which fix the scope of the power conferred upon the court by
reference to the maximum applicable penalty, irrespective of the prior
decision. I am unable to find any good reason for departing from this plain
meaning or for introducing restrictions.

A full review of the legislative history of the
enactment was made by Laskin J.A. (as he then was) in his dissenting reasons in
R. v. Willis[27]. Concerning
the power to vary mentioned in Rule 503 (Ontario) and in Rule 100 of the Supreme Court of Canada Rules, I
cannot, with respect, agree that, without those provisions the power to
increase or decrease damages in civil cases, even without a cross-appeal or
notice to vary, would exist. In my view, those rules involve a recognition that
the jurisdiction exists to do it and do not

[Page 854]

create it. Rule 100 reads:

Rule 100.—It shall not, under any
circumstances, be necessary for a respondent to give notice of motion by way of
cross-appeal, but if a respondent intends upon the hearing of an appeal to
contend that the decision of the court below should be varied, he shall, within
fifteen days after the service of the notice of appeal, or such further time as
may be prescribed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers, give notice of such
intention to all parties who may be affected thereby. The omission to give such
notice shall not in any way interfere with the power of the Court on the
hearing of an appeal to treat the whole case as open, but may, in the
discretion of the Court, be ground for an adjournment of the appeal or for
special order as to costs.

It seems to me that this provision as
writtenclearly implies that, once the case is inscribed in appeal, jurisdiction
exists to “treat the whole case as open”. The giving of notice to vary is only
aprocedural requirement which can be remedied or waived, if omitted. The same
should be said, I think, with respect to the prescribed form for prisoner
appeals including this notification:

11. Further take notice that if you appeal
from sentence the Court of Appeal may increase your sentence without further
notice to you if the Court of Appeal considers the sentence inadequate.

Although those rules and forms cannot have the
effect of conferring a jurisdiction which the courts of appeal would not
otherwise have, they ought, I think, to be considered as of great authority in
support of the proposition that the jurisdiction does exist. I will also note
that decisions similar to that of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Willis case
were rendered by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Christakos[28] and by the Quebec Court of Appeal
in Valade v. R.[29]

[Page 855]

If the accused had not been given adequate
notice that at the hearing of his appeal, consideration would be given to an
increase in his sentence, I would think that the same rule ought to be applied
as in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen[30] where sentence was passed without
hearing submissions. It would have to be held that the accused was not given an
opportunity to be heard before the adverse determination was made against him.
In this case however, counsel for the Crown made it known prior to the hearing
that an increased sentence would be required. This was mentioned in the
statement of fact and law filed by the Crown on the appeal.

Due to this notice, it seems to me that the
objection to jurisdiction is based purely on a matter of form. Counsel for the
Crown could, under s. 605(b) apply for leave to appeal against the
sentence. The time for making this application is not fixed by law and may be
extended at any time by the Court of Appeal under s. 607 as well as Rule 28(1)
of the Supreme Court of Ontario Criminal Appeal Rules,

Even assuming that an application by counsel for
the Crown to the Court of Appeal was necessary for directing an increase in
sentence, I fail to see what could prevent the Court at the hearing of
the appeal from treating the statement of fact and law as a notice of appeal
and granting an extension of time, no question could be raised as to counsel’s
instructions, R. v. Badall[31].
To say that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction because all this was
not spelled out in a formal order is, in my view, to treat as going to
jurisdiction a purely formal objection. Sometimes, as in Dennis v. The
Queen[32], a
failure to comply with certain formalities is destructive of jurisdiction, but
this is so only when, by law, jurisdiction is made dependent on a particular
formality that was omitted. This is not one of those cases as I see it.

[Page 856]

I would also consider as without substance the
objection that, under s. 614(1) the Court of Appeal may vary the sentence or
dismiss the appeal and therefore cannot do both as was done by the formal
order in this case. What was intended to be done is abundantly clear: it was to
vary the sentence. This cannot be nullified by the superfluous addition of
words purporting to dismiss the appeal.

It does not appear to me that the construction
of s. 514 Cr. C. can be influenced by consideration of s. 4(3) of the
United Kingdom Criminal Appeal Act 1907 (7 Edw. VII, c. 23) which was in
the following terms:

4. (3) On an appeal against sentence the
Court of Criminal Appeal shall, if they think that a different sentence should
have been passed, quash the sentence passed at the trial, and pass such other
sentence warranted in law by the verdict (whether more or less severe) in
substitution therefor as they think ought to have been passed, and in any other
case shall dismiss the appeal.

It must first be noted that the United Kingdom
Act gave a right of appeal to the person convicted only, not to the Crown as
well. In such a situation, one can readily see why it was deemed necessary to
provide explicitly that, on an appeal, the Court would have jurisdiction, not
only to decrease, but also to increase the sentence. No such implication ever
arose under our Code in which there is a right of appeal by the Crown as
well as by the person convicted.

It must also be considered that while the
sections of our Criminal Code dealing with appeals were, in 1923,
generally replaced by verbatim copies of the corresponding provisions of the
above-mentioned U.K. Act, such was not the case with respect to the particular
provision with which we are here concerned. The right of appeal from sentence
by the Crown as well as by the person convicted was preserved.
Section 1015(1) defining the powers of the Court of Appeal on appeals
against sentence was a re-enactment of s. 1055A enacted by 1921 (Can.) c. 25,
s. 22, as noted by Laskin J.A., as he then was, in R. v. Willis,
supra,

[Page 857]

at p. 73, it was not copied from s. 4(3) of the
U.K. Act, anymore than present s. 614 was.

I should also say that I doubt very much
whether, in any case, the omission in an enactment of some words found in a
similar enactment of another jurisdiction can ever have the effect of
restricting the clear meaning of the words actually used. Would not this imply
that words used elsewhere could never be omitted as surplusage?

Concerning the propriety of Crown prosecutors,
on an appeal from sentence by the accused, requesting an increase without a
formal inscription in appeal to that end, I would quote those words of Goddard
L.C.J. spoken on behalf of a Court on which he sat with Lewis J. and Denning J.
(as he then was) (Re: Harry John McBain[33],
at pp. 114-5):

The appellant was convicted on the clearest
possible evidence, and was sentenced to three years’ penal servitude. He had
not been convicted before. He applied for leave to appeal against both
conviction and sentence. The Court refused his application for leave to appeal
against conviction, but gave him leave to appeal against sentence for one
reason only, in order that it might consider whether or not it should
substantially increase his sentence.

Hitherto, when this Court has considered an
application for leave to appeal against sentence, and has formed the opinion that
the sentence was not severe enough, it has generally warned the applicant that
if he persists in his appeal the Court may increase his sentence. This Court no
longer intends to take that course. The Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, does not
require it, but by section 4(3) provides that where a prisoner applies for
and obtains leave to appeal against his sentence, this Court, if it thinks that
a different sentence should have been passed, shall pass such sentence as it
thinks ought to have been passed, whether greater or less than the sentence
actually passed.

In that case there was no increased sentence,
but the benefit of time served pending judgment in

[Page 858]

appeal was denied. However, three other cases
are noted in which a two year increase was ordered. Two other such cases are
noted in the 1962 Criminal Law Review (pp. 495, 853). It is true that
the United Kingdom Parliament provided by the Criminal Appeal Act 1968
(U.K.), c. 19 s. 11(3), that the Court of Appeal shall so exercise their powers
that the appellant is not more severely dealt with on appeal than he was dealt
with by the Court below. However, the Canadian Parliament has not so amended s.
614(1) Cr. C. and has not repealed the right of appeal by the Crown
against sentence.

Inasmuch as counsel for the accused had
reasonable notice that an increased sentence was sought and opportunity to be
heard on that, as was the case herein as in Willis, every essential of
proper judicial conduct was met. On any view of this case, there is no basis
for adverse comment against counsel for the Crown or the Court below.

At the rehearing, counsel for the appellant
pressed the argument that, if the power of the Court of appeal was sought to be
supported on the basis that it could grant an extension of time to the Crown
for a cross-appeal against sentence and treat its request for an increase as
such a cross-appeal, the accused was entitled to urge that no proper ground was
established for such use of the Court’s discretion. In my opinion, the mere
fact that the Court of Appeal at the hearing feels that there are serious
grounds to question the adequacy of the sentence is quite sufficient to justify
a decision to grant an extension and entertain submissions on that issue,
provided the accused is not taken by surprise and given an adequate opportunity
to be heard on the point. Furthermore, I remain of opinion that upon any appeal
against sentence for an indictable offence the Court of Appeal has anyway full
jurisdiction to vary as deemed proper.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 859]

de Grandpré J. also concurred in the judgment of

RITCHIE J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment of the other members of the Court which were delivered
on the first hearing of this appeal and I agree with their unanimous conclusion
as to the jurisdiction of this Court.

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal of Ontario was invoked by the appellant
himself in accordance with the provisions of ss. 603, 607 and 614 of the Criminal
Code, and s. 614(1) makes it plain that in the exercise of that
jurisdiction the court “shall… consider the fitness of the sentence.” In
the discharge of this duty, the court is not limited to considerations
affecting the appellant but must also have regard to the welfare of the
community and the public interest generally. The deterrent effect which the
sentence may have on others and to some extent the standards which have been
established in other cases of a like kind, are also relevant and in the present
case the stark horror of the crime itself would of necessity be compelling
consideration.

Parliament having fixed the Court of Appeal with
the obligation to “consider the fitness of the sentence”, it would, in my view,
require clear statutory language to limit that consideration to the question of
whether the sentence was too severe while precluding any consideration of
whether it was severe enough. There is no such language in the Criminal
Code, and I am of opinion that the opening paragraph of s 614(1)
constitutes a mandatory directory direction to the Court of Appeal to consider
both aspects of the question.

In the result, where an appeal against sentence
is taken by the person convicted seeking to have the sentence reduced, the
court may see fit to increase the sentence and this is a risk to which all such
persons are exposed whether or not the Attorney General has appealed.
Conversely, where an appeal is taken against sentence by the Attorney General
seeking to have the sentence increased,

[Page 860]

the court may consider it fitting to reduce the
sentence and is empowered so to order without any appeal having been asserted
by the convicted person.

Whether an appeal is taken by the accused or at
the instance of the Attorney General, it is characterized in the Criminal
Code as an appeal “against the sentence” and in either event the only
restriction upon the power of the court to vary the sentence is that contained
in s. 614(1) (a) which provides in effect that the sentence can only be
varied “within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the
accused was convicted”.

It has been suggested that as the powers of s.
614(1)(a) and (b) are phrased in the alternative, the
section does not permit a court to exercise its jurisdiction under both
subsections in the same case and that it must choose whether it is to vary
the sentence or dismiss the appeal. In the present case the court ordered that
the appeal be dismissed “but that the sentence of twelve (12) years on the
charge of rape should be varied to one of life imprisonment”. I take the view
that in exercising its power to increase the sentence the Court of Appeal by
implication dismissed the appellant’s appeal and that the portion of the formal
judgment ordering that the appeal be dismissed was pure surplusage which in no
way vitiates the order.

As I have indicated, I am of opinion that the
Court of Appeal has power to increase a sentence when an appeal is taken in
accordance with s. 603(1) by a person who has been convicted at trial and that
this power is in no way dependant upon an appeal being asserted by the Attorney
General under s. 605. I would accordingly answer the question of law upon which
leave to appeal was granted in the affirmative.

I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

BEETZ J. (dissenting)—After a rehearing
of this appeal, I see no reason to alter the views I had previously expressed,
[v. infra]

[Page 861]

BEETZ J. (dissenting) [after the
first hearing]—I agree with Mr. Justice Pigeon as to the jurisdiction of
this Court to hear this appeal. But I find myself in agreement with
Mr. Justice Spence’s analysis and construction of s. 614 of the Criminal
Code.

By virtue of s. 603(1)(b) and s. 605(1)(b),
a person convicted by a trial court and the Attorney General may both, with
leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof, appeal the sentence passed by
the trial court. The wording of s. 614 reflects both possibilities in a single
enactment. However, such economy of words was not, in my view, meant to relieve
the Attorney General from the need to seek leave and, such leave being granted,
from actually appealing, merely because a convicted person avails himself of
his right to try to have his sentence reduced. Nor does s. 614 give to the
Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hear what amounts to an appeal as of right by
the Crown where the Code explicitly provides against such a right and
where no formal notice was given to the convicted person. Even if failure to
observe formalities relating to application for leave, to the granting of leave
and to notice may be remedied in time, it was not remedied in this case.

I would dispose of this appeal as is proposed by
Mr. Justice Spence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Charge to Jury—Motor vehicles—Criminal
negligence causing bodily harm—Accident as a defence—Whether theory of defence
outlined to jury—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 191, 193.

The appellant was convicted, after a trial
before a judge and jury, on a charge of causing bodily harm to one L by
criminal negligence in the operation of an automobile. The appellant was in a
restaurant when a fight broke out involving L, a white man, and another person,
a coloured man who was injured. The appellant, also a coloured man, took the
injured man into his car, intending to drive him to a hospital. He then drove
off, turned left into a side street, turned off his lights and slowed down as
if to park. A minute or two later he accelerated and pulled to the right so as
to mount the curb and hit L who had just crossed the street and reached the
sidewalk. The appellant continued to the hospital and telephoned the police. In
his statement to the police he admitted that when he glanced down at his
passenger who was injured, he drove onto the curb and there was a possibility
he might then have hit a pedestrian. The appellant gave no evidence and his
defence was based on the statement he had given to the police. The conviction
was affirmed by the Court of appeal without recorded reasons. The appellant was
granted leave to appeal to this Court.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Martland, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ.: The trial judge did
not err in refusing to grant the motion for a non-suit made on

[Page 288]

the ground that the evidence did not support
a charge under s. 193 of the Code.

The second question is whether the trial
judge failed to outline to the jury any theory of the defence which was
consistent of the appellant having acted otherwise than with wanton or reckless
disregard for the lives and safety of others. The defence was based on the
statement the accused had given to the police. It was read to the jury towards
the close of the Crown’s case, it was made the subject of extensive comment by
counsel for the accused in his address to the jury which was concluded less
than an hour before the judge started his charge, and it was left with the
jury. The trial judge did not err in not reading it to them again. The theory
of the defence that absence of motive (i.e. intent) is established by the
statement, was made clear in the judge’s charge.

What would be a proper charge to the jury in
a case in which there are no racial overtones does not become an improper
charge in a case involving the same facts merely because such overtones exist.
In the absence of manifestations of racial prejudice, racial overtones
surrounding a trial do not make a proper charge into an improper charge. As
there was not suggestion that there had been any manifestation of racial
prejudice in the present case, any racial overtones which may have existed at
the time of the trial had no relevance to this appeal.

Per Hall J., dissenting:
It must have been evident to everyone, and particularly to the presiding
judge, that there could be racial overtones to the proceedings with the added
dimension that the appellant was defended by a junior counsel of his own race.
Crown counsel was white as were the jurors. The trial judge did not put the
defence of accident to the jury and, in essence, denigrated the defence
contentions to an extent that vitiated the trial.

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ., dissenting: The trial judge failed lamentably to put before
the jury the defence of the accused. There was not a single sentence in the
entire charge that goes to any defence of the accused under the law and,
especially in

[Page 289]

respect of the parts of his statement that
would be exonerating, if believed. Accident, as a defence, required not only
mention but explanation since it could have more than one meaning, including
complete absence of negligence as well as momentary inattention. The charge was
devoted to a minute repetition of the evidence of the Crown witnesses, and this
recital was associated with express to the theory of the Crown. A trial judge
does not put the defence to the jury merely by emphasizing that the Crown
carries the ultimate burden of proof to the end of the case or by telling the
jury what the issues are under the applicable law. If he sends the case to the
jury he must send it evenhandedly, with equal fairness to the accused,
according to the evidence, and to the Crown. This was not done here; in fact,
the charge can best be described as drawing an obscure curtain over any
exonerating factors telling in favour of the accused, keeping them from the
jury’s view.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ.
dissenting.

A. Maloney, Q.C., and D. O’Connor, for
the appellant.

E.G. Hachborn, for the respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and of Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—I have had the advantage of
reading the reasons of my brothers Ritchie, Hall, Spence and Laskin in this
case, and I am in agreement with the reasons and the conclusions stated by my
brother Ritchie. I only wish to add that, until after reading the reasons of my
brother Hall, I was unaware that any question had arisen or could arise in this
case as to justice not having been administered with impartiality, without
regard to race, colour, creed or ethnic origin.

[Page 290]

I was not previously aware, from the record or
otherwise, of the race, colour, creed or ethnic origin of counsel engaged in
the trial, or of the members of the jury. I was aware by the record that the
appellant was a coloured man, but there is nothing in the proceedings to
indicate that counsel for either side, the trial judge or the jury varied in
any way from proper court procedures and the recognized standards of fairness,
because of that fact, during the hearing of the evidence, the arguments, or the
charge to the jury. Indeed addressing the jury the learned trial Judge said:—

Now, during the course of the trial counsel
for the accused, Mr. Lindsay, referred to the fact that his client, the accused
man Arthurs is coloured. Now, gentlemen, you must disregard that altogether,
because in our administration of justice in Canada, all are equal before the law, regardless of race, colour and
creed, and it makes no difference whether a man is black, white, yellow or red,
they are all entitled to the same consideration.

My brother Hall says, quite properly, that he
does not suggest at all that the trial judge was actuated by malice or
prejudice and that he is sure that the trial judge was not so motivated. I
would infer from this that it is his view that the errors which he finds in the
charge to the jury did not result from the fact that the trial judge knew that
the accused was a coloured man.

The substantial criticism which is made is
stated as follows:—

“His failure was that he did not hold the
scales of justice in balance in a situation in which it should have been made
apparent to all that he was so doing.” The latter part of this sentence, I
assume, relates back to an earlier statement that “there could be racial
overtones to the proceedings” and to “a delicate situation”.

My view is that the duty of the trial judge to
hold the scales of justice in balance exists in

[Page 291]

every case. What would be a proper charge to the
jury in a case in which there are no racial overtones does not become an improper
charge in a case involving the same facts merely because such overtones exist.
Racial overtones are only of importance in the event that they result in a
charge in which racial prejudice is manifested, in which case the charge is not
a proper one. But in the absence of such a manifestation, racial overtones
surrounding the trial do not make a proper charge into an improper charge.
There is no suggestion that there was any manifestation of racial prejudice in
the charge in the present case. That being so, in my opinion, any racial
overtones which may have existed at the time of the trial have no relevance to
this appeal.

I agree with the disposition of this appeal
proposed by my brother Ritchie.

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson,
Ritchie and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal of Ontario rendered without recorded reasons, affirming the
conviction of the appellant after a trial held before His Honour Judge Walter
Martin, sitting with a jury, on a charge that he

on or about the 22nd of September, 1968, at
the Municipality of Metropolitan
  Toronto in the County of York, by criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle
caused bodily harm to one Robert Latus, contrary to the Criminal Code.

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on the
two following questions:

(1) Did the learned trial judge err in
refusing to grant the application of the defence made at the close of the
Crown’s case to dismiss the charge on the ground that the evidence adduced by
the Crown did not support a charge under section 193 of the Criminal
Code?

[Page 292]

(2) Did the learned trial judge err in
failing to outline to the jury in his charge the theory of the defence?

Section 193 of the Criminal Code (now
section 204) reads as follows:

Every one who by criminal negligence causes
bodily harm to another person is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable
to imprisonment for ten years.

“Criminal negligence” for the purposes of the Criminal
Code is defined in section 202 (formerly 191) as follows:

202. (1) Every one is criminally negligent
who

(a) in doing anything, or

(b) in omitting to do anything that
it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.

The evidence in this case is to be tested in
accordance with the provisions of the last-quoted section which is to say
that conduct disclosing wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of
others constitutes prima facie evidence of criminal negligence.

The Crown’s “case” proved against the appellant
was that between 4 and 5 a.m. on September 22, 1968, the appellant drove his
car south on Avenue Road in the City of Toronto in the centre lane of three
south-bound lanes and upon reaching Webster Avenue he turned left into this
side street, turned off his lights and slowed down as if to park, but a minute
or two later he accelerated and pulled to the right so as to mount the curb and
hit Robert Latus who had just crossed the street and reached the sidewalk.
Having hit Latus and knocked him four or five feet into the air, the
appellant’s car, which had gone about three feet six inches up on the sidewalk,
continued towards Hazelton Avenue where it proceeded in the wrong direction
down a one-way street. Included in the Crown’s evidence was a statement made by
the appellant to the police after he had been duly cautioned, in

[Page 293]

which he admitted that he drove his car down Webster Avenue and that when he glanced
down at his passenger who was injured, he drove into the curb and that there
was a possibility he might then have hit a pedestrian.

In the face of this evidence, counsel for the
defence submitted that there was no case to go to the jury in support of the
charge as laid, upon which the learned trial judge made the following ruling
with which I agree:

THE COURT: Oh well, there is an abundance
of evidence, the accused’s statement to the police officer, Constable Laing,
and Detective Stevenson, and the other officer, and he admits he was driving
the car and the evidence of the witnesses who saw the man struck, so there is
certainly plenty of evidence to go to the jury so your motion is dismissed; of
course, it is noted.

It was, however, contended before this Court
that the Crown’s evidence and the theory of the prosecution were consistent
only with the appellant having run over Latus deliberately and that, while this
evidence might support a more serious charge, it negatived “criminal
negligence” and thus afforded a good ground for granting the motion for
non-suit made by the appellant’s counsel. The only authority cited in support
of this proposition was a decision of Crisp J., who, when sitting alone in the
Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in the case of Regina v.
Barnard[1], held
that an indictment charging the offence of causing bodily harm by wanton
driving could not be supported in a case where the bodily harm occasioned by
the wanton driving resulted in the death of the victim.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
Barnard case, Crisp J. indicated that his reasoning and conclusions in
this regard differed from those of his brother Judge, Gibson

[Page 294]

J., who had occasion to make a contrary ruling
on the same point in a prior trial of the same accused on the same charge. That
Crisp J. was reluctant to disagree with his brother judge is apparent from the
following excerpt from his judgment:

…normally I would wish to follow the
decision of Gibson J., not only because of the very real respect that I feel
for his judgments, but also because of the necessity to maintain the principle
of stare decisis. But there are, I feel, some very strong considerations
in this matter the other way. The first is that this is a matter which had not
been tested in any appellate court or any other superior court that I am aware
of,…

Since Mr. Justice Crisp’s decision, the matter
does not appear to have been made the subject of an appeal to a higher court,
and whatever the law may be under the applicable statute in Tasmania, I have no
hesitation in expressing the view that the proposition propounded by counsel
for the appellant in reliance on Mr. Justice Crisp’s reasoning is without any
substance in relation to a charge under s. 193 (now s. 204) of the Criminal
Code of Canada.

As I have indicated, I think that the learned
trial judge had no option but to dismiss the motion for a non-suit made by
appellant’s counsel and I would accordingly answer the first question in the
negative.

I think that the second question must be
governed by the test which I indicated at the outset, and that question
therefore is whether the learned trial judge failed to outline to the jury any
theory of the defence which was consistent with the appellant having acted
otherwise than with wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of
others.

The appellant gave no evidence and his defence
was based, as it had to be, on the statement he had given to the police which
his counsel interpreted as evidence of a simple accident that occurred when his
attention was momentarily distracted from his driving by the condition of his
injured passenger. The state-

[Page 295]

ment speaks for itself and the most relevant
portions of it are at the beginning and end.

The appellant opened his statement by saying,
with respect to the report that a pedestrian had been hit by his car on Webster Avenue: “Well, there is a
possibility that I may have hit him”. He then gave an account of a fight which
had taken place in a restaurant on Avenue Road in which a “coloured fellow” had
been hurt and continued:

…I left the restaurant and went and sit in
the car that was parked on Avenue Rd., just beside the restaurant. A few
seconds later the coloured fellow came staggering out and had blood all over
his face. So I managed to get him into my car and started up and turned around
to go along Webster Avenue and further up the avenue these two fellows were
crossing the road, and its a bit hazy what happened there but I can remember
them running across the road and the fellow beside me was groaning and I
remember glancing at him and I realized I was going into the curb and there was
a light post there and I swerved out and there was a impact and I knew the
fellows they jumped across and there was a possibility that I might have hit
one of the fellows. During this period I realized that one of the fellows was
the one who picked on me in the restaurant and out of fear I kept going until I
reached the Western Hospital where I phoned the Police. I later learned from one of the officers
that one of the fellows was injured thats about all so far.

This statement had been read to the jury by
Detective McCleave towards the close of the Crown’s case, it had been made the
subject of extensive comment by counsel for the accused in his address to the
jury which was concluded less than an hour before the judge started his charge,
and the written statement was left with the jury. I do not think that the
learned trial judge erred in not reading it to them again. In this regard,
Judge Martin told the jury that he had admitted the statements made by the
accused and he continued:

…you are to take the statements as
evidence, and you will treat them exactly the same as you treat any

[Page 296]

other evidence. In other words, you may
believe the statements made by the accused to the police, you may disbelieve
them or believe part and disbelieve the remaining part. You treat them exactly
the same as you do any other evidence which has been given by witnesses in the
witness box during the course of this trial.

And he later said:

I am not going to go over all the contents
of the written statement of the accused man because it is quite lengthy. You
will have it with you in the jury room and you will have ample opportunity to
consider it. He admits he was driving the car. There is no suggestion that he
was ill. There is no suggestion that there was something wrong with the car.
There was some talk about being hazy. I don’t know what hazy means. The first
officer didn’t say anything about being hazy. I think I indicated to you before
that insofar as the fight that took place in the restaurant, that does not
justify the accused or any other person in running a man down with a car.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
the learned trial judge did not sufficiently instruct the jury as to the theory
of the defence and in particular that the defence of simple accident which had
formed the basis of the motion for a non-suit made by appellant’s counsel was
not adequately placed before them.

After this motion had been dismissed, no
evidence was called on behalf of the defence and, as I understand it, in such a
case the theory of the defence must of necessity be based either on some Crown
evidence which is capable of affording a defence or upon the more general
submission that the Crown has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The appellant’s statement had been included in
the Crown’s case after the holding of a voir dire which was occasioned
by his counsel objecting to its admissibility. As I have indicated, any theory
of the defence had to be based on the contents of that statement and in my view
the learned trial judge left the matter to the jury on this basis.

[Page 297]

The theory of the defence must be considered in
light of the case as submitted by the Crown whereby Crown counsel treated the
charge as one which necessarily involved proof that the accused had
deliberately run Latus down. In my view, this was a wrong approach which placed
an unnecessarily heavy burden on the Crown, but it was the case which the
appellant was required to meet.

The theory of the defence as outlined by counsel
was that the Crown had failed to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,
that it was the duty of the Crown to prove motive and that this was not proved
because the jury should believe the statement made by the accused.

In instructing the jury the learned trial judge
adopted the approach taken by the Crown and by the defence that in order to
succeed the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
deliberately ran Latus down and he also instructed the jury that they must
treat the statement of the accused as they would any other evidence; that they
could believe it, disbelieve it, believe part of it or disbelieve part of it.
It was the same as evidence given in the witness box and they would have it with
them in the jury room, and would have ample opportunity to consider it.

In my view the theory of the defence that
absence of motive (i.e. intent) is established by the statement, was made clear
in the judge’s charge. This was the only defence urged before the jury on
behalf of the appellant and having regard to the course of the trial and the
whole of the evidence tendered by the Crown (including the statement) I do not
think that any other realistic theories of defence were open to him, or that
the learned trial judge erred in failing to outline any other such theory in
his charge.

[Page 298]

As deliberation is not, in my opinion, a
necessary ingredient of the offence here charged, I consider the learned judge
erred in instructing the jury that in order to find the appellant guilty they
must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he “did deliberately run
down Robert Latus thereby causing him serious injuries”.

I do not regard this misdirection as dealing
only with the burden of proof upon the prosecution, but rather consider it to
be a statement of the learned trial judge’s opinion as to the essential
ingredient of the offence with which the appellant was charged. In all the
circumstances it is difficult to conceive of a misdirection which would be more
favourable to the accused, but the jury’s verdict must be construed as meaning
that they were satisfied that the appellant not only showed wanton or rockless
disregard for the lives or safety of others, but that he ran into his victim
deliberately.

As I have indicated, I am, with the greatest
respect for those who may hold a different view, unable to find any error
prejudicial to the appellant in the charge of the learned trial judge and I
would accordingly answer the second question in the negative.

As I understand it, it has long been the
practice of this Court that upon leave being granted in respect of specific
questions of law, the Court hearing the appeal will confine itself to those
questions, and this is particularly so in my view when an attempt is made
before the Court hearing the appeal to raise a further question of law which
was proposed to and rejected by the Court hearing the application for leave. As
I do not consider the question of whether the judge ought to have directed the
jury on the offence of dangerous driving to be one which arises under the
second question of law upon which leave was granted, I do not find it necessary
to deal with that question.

[Page 299]

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

Since writing the above I have had the advantage
of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by the Chief Justice, with which I
am in respectful agreement.

HALL J. (dissenting)—The facts and
circumstances involved in this appeal are set out in the reasons of my brother
Laskin and I agree with him that there should be a new trial and with his
reasons therefor. There is an additional aspect to the case which I feel I must
comment upon.

The incident which culminated in the charge
against Arthurs that he

on or about the 22nd of September, 1968, at
the Municipality of Metropolitan
  Toronto in the County of York, by criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle
caused bodily harm to one Robert Latus, contrary to the Criminal Code.

began in the Webster Restaurant in Toronto. Arthurs who is a coloured man entered the restaurant to get
something to eat. He was accosted by Robert Latus, a white man, who, on his own
admission, was somewhat intoxicated. Arthurs ignored Latus and placed his
order. Having eaten and as he was about to leave the restaurant, two other
coloured men entered, one of them being Edward Payne. Latus accosted Payne,
slapped him in the face and a fight ensued. Arthurs left the restaurant and
went to his car which was parked nearby. A few seconds later the coloured man
(Payne) that Latus had fought with came staggering out with blood all over his
face. Arthurs got Payne into his car, intending to take him to Western Hospital. It was immediately after
this that the incident resulting in the charge is said to have occurred and the
Crown’s case was that Arthurs had waited until Latus came out and then
intentionally ran him down. At the hospital Arthurs phoned the police and
Police Constable Donald-

[Page300]

son interviewed him in the parking lot. Police
Constable McCleave came later and the accused was taken into custody.

On arriving at the police station Arthurs gave a
statement which was received in evidence in which he said in part: “Well there
is a possibility that I might have hit him. I’m not too positive about that.”
and later in the statement he said:

So I managed to get him into my car and
started up and turned around to go along Webster Avenue and further up the
avenue these two fellows were crossing the road, and its a bit hazy what
happened there but I can remember them running across the road and the fellow
beside me was groaning and I remember glancing at him and I realized I was
going into the curb and there was a light post there and I swerved out and
there was an impact and I knew the fellows they jumped across and there was a
possibility that I might have hit one of the fellows. During this period I
realized that one of the fellows was the one who picked on me in the restaurant
and out of fear I kept going until I reached the Western
 Hospital where I phoned the
Police.

When Arthurs came on for trial before His Honour
Judge Martin and a jury, charged as aforesaid, it must have been evident to
everyone, and particularly to the presiding judge, that there could be racial
overtones to the proceedings with the added dimension that Arthurs was being
defended by a junior counsel of his own race. Crown counsel was white as were
the jurors. Here was a delicate situation but one ideally structured to
demonstrate that the administration of justice in Toronto could and would be carried out with impartiality and without regard
to race, colour, creed or ethnic origin.

Having dealt in great detail with the evidence
for the prosecution, the trial judge in his charge referred to Arthurs’
statement but did not put the defence of accident to the jury and, in essence,
in my view, denigrated the defence contentions to an extent that vitiated the
trial. The verdict cannot stand; there must be a new trial. Justice requires no
less than this. I do not suggest at all that the judge was actuated by

[Page 301]

malice or prejudice—I am sure that he was not so
motivated. His failure was that he did not hold the scales of justice in
balance in a situation in which it should have been made apparent to all that
he was doing so. This does not mean that, if guilty, Arthurs should go
unpunished, but it does mean that whether guilty or not he was entitled to a
fair trial.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity to peruse the reasons delivered by my brother Laskin and I agree
with his view that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

I do not wish, however, to be taken to have
agreed with the view expressed by my brother Laskin that there was evidence
which justified the learned trial judge in sending the case to the jury at the
close of the Crown’s case. I am rather of the opinion that there was not, but I
find it unnecessary to deal with that issue in view of my concurrence with the
views of my brother Laskin as to the effect of the errors in the charge to the
jury.

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—The appellant
accused was convicted, after trial before His Honour Judge Walter Martin and a
jury, on a charge of causing bodily harm to one Robert Latus by criminal
negligence in the operation of an automobile. A three year term of imprisonment
was imposed by the trial judge. An appeal against conviction and sentence was
dismissed by the Ontario Court of Appeal without recorded reasons. Leave to
appeal to this Court was given on the following two questions of law:

(1) Did the learned trial judge err in
refusing to grant the application of the defence made at the close of the
Crown’s case to dismiss the charge on the ground that the evidence adduced by
the Crown did

[Page 302]

not support a charge under s. 193 of the Criminal
Code?

(2) Did the learned trial judge err in
failing to outline to the jury in his charge the theory of the defence?

Relevant to both questions and to the issues
raised thereon are the following considerations: (1) the Crown’s case was built
on evidence that could be taken to show that the accused deliberately ran down
one Robert Latus in circumstances recounted below; (2) the Crown adduced in
evidence a statement in writing given by the accused to the police which
indicated not deliberation or recklessness in driving his car at Latus but
inadvertent accident which was not, however, free from ordinary negligence; (3)
no defence evidence was offered; (4) counsel for the accused moved for
dismissal at the close of the Crown’s case, which motion was denied; and (5)
the trial judge charged the jury in terms only of the burden on the Crown,
without express or direct mention of any defence, referable either to the
evidence adduced by the Crown or to the statement of the accused, and without
indicating whether a verdict on a lesser charge, that of dangerous driving, was
open. I shall refer in more detail to the charge as well as to the evidence,
but the foregoing enumeration provides the backdrop for the questions on which
leave to appeal was granted.

The accused, a married man with two young
children, who was steadily employed prior to his conviction and without any
previous record, was in a restaurant in Toronto in the early hours of September
22, 1968, when a fight broke out involving Latus and another person named
Payne. The restaurant was on the east side of Avenue Road at the corner of Webster Avenue which runs east from Avenue
Road for one block to Hazelton Avenue, a one-way street for north-bound traffic. The restaurant had a
front entrance on Avenue Road and a side door on

[Page 303]

the north side of Webster
 Avenue. Payne was injured in the fight which was seen
from the street by a taxi driver parked on the west side of Avenue Road
opposite the restaurant.

The taxi driver radioed his dispatcher to
contact the police, and shortly afterwards a greenish car heading south on
Avenue Road stopped near his cab. The accused was driving and had as his
passenger Payne whose face was bloodied. The passenger door had been opened and
a third person, unknown to the taxi driver and not identified later, joined the
accused and Payne, and they discussed taking Payne to the hospital. The accused
then drove off, but instead of heading due south on Avenue Road he turned left
to go east on Webster Avenue,
at the same time turning off his lights. Thereafter the taxi driver heard the
sound of a collision, and on driving to the scene he saw Latus on the south
side of Webster Avenue lying
partly on the sidewalk and partly on the grass.

Evidence of what occurred on Webster Avenue was given by another taxi
driver who happened to be walking east on the north side of Webster Avenue at the material time. He
heard a car coming from behind him, and noticed when it passed him that it had
no rear lights on. The car, which proved to be that driven by the accused,
veered slightly to the right and struck a pedestrian, then continued to the end
of Webster Avenue and turned south on Hazelton Avenue in the wrong traffic
direction. The injured pedestrian was Latus who had left the restaurant by the Webster Avenue door and was crossing that
street at an angle when he was hit as he reached the south side. In his
statement, the accused said that he thought it possible he had struck someone;
and he kept going out of fear after the impact until he reached the Toronto Western Hospital and there he telephoned the police. He was found by them at the
emergency parking lot of the hospital, standing

[Page 304]

beside his car which had headlights and
windshield damage and a missing aerial, all on the right side.

After the Crown had completed its case, counsel
for the accused moved for a dismissal on the ground that “the Crown… failed to
establish a sufficient case to go to the jury”, that is, that there was no
evidence to go to the jury in that “the only evidence we have here, what we
have here is an accident and that is about all”. This motion was given short
shrift, with the trial judge stating “there is an abundance of evidence, the
accused’s statement to the police officer… and he admits he was driving the car
and the evidence of the witnesses who saw the man struck so there is plenty of
evidence to go to the jury…”.

The charge, to which the evidence had to be
related, appears to have been an amalgam of the offences created by ss. 193 and
221(1) of the Criminal Code (now ss. 204 and 233(1)); the former makes
it an offence to cause bodily harm by criminal negligence; the latter makes it
an offence to be criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle; the
indictment in this case charged that the accused “by criminal negligence in the
operation of a motor vehicle caused bodily harm to one Robert Latus”. However,
it is better viewed as charging an offence under s. 193 with an added
particular of the criminal negligence that was alleged. Counsel for the Crown
and for the accused both treated the charge as one under s. 193. The trial
judge, in charging the jury, made a passing reference to s. 193 as having been
read by defence counsel, then read to the jury s. 191 of theCriminal Code (now
s. 202), which he went on to paraphrase, and towards the end of his charge he
read to the jury s. 221(1) and repeated s. 191. He then went on to tell
the jury what was “the degree of negligence that the Crown must prove before an
accused may be convicted of criminal

[Page 305]

negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle”.
I shall return to this instruction shortly but I note that this exposition
followed earlier statements in the charge that the two issues in the case were:
“Was the accused driving this car at five o’clock in the morning on September
22 on Webster Avenue and was he driving it in a criminally negligent manner”;
and that “the theory of the Crown is that the accused deliberately ran down
Latus on Webster Avenue causing him serious injuries”.

It is manifest that the trial judge did not
present any clear picture of the offence which the jury had to consider; and,
if anything, he left them to consider criminal negligence in the operation of a
motor vehicle, but associated with the infliction of personal injury upon
Latus.

Criminal negligence, as defined in s.191 is as
follows:

(1) Every one is criminally negligent who

(a) in doing anything, or

(b) in omitting to do anything that
it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or
safety of other persons.

(2) For the purposes of this section,
“duty” means a duty imposed by law.

The trial judge, after telling the jury that
there is a duty in law upon the operator of a motor vehicle “to use reasonable
care to avoid endangering the lives and safety of other people on the roads”,
instructed them on criminal negligence as follows:

[Page 306]

I direct you gentlemen that the Crown must
prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused acted
either:—

(a) with the deliberate intention of
doing something or omitting to do something which was his duty to do, the
consequence of which he knew or should have known would endanger the lives or
safety of others, or

(b) with such disregard for the
lives and safety of others as would indicate that he was heedless of what the
consequences of his conduct would be.

From the foregoing it will be seen that as
regards the offence with which the accused Arthurs is charged, the Crown to
succeed must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt, each and
every one of the following items—

Item I.—that the
accused on the 22nd day of September 1968 while driving a motor vehicle along Webster Avenue in the City of Toronto, the accused did deliberately run
down Robert Latus thereby causing him serious injuries.

Item II.—that at the place and time
aforesaid the accused Arthurs showed wanton or reckless disregard for the lives
or safety of Latus and other persons.

This instruction is in the words of the late Mr.
Justice Morden speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal in Regina v.
Titchner[2], an
instruction which does not appear to have been followed, in respect of its
first branch, in other provincial jurisdictions: see, for example Regina v.
Belbeck[3], and Regina
v. Rogers[4]; and
there appears to have been a recession from that instruction by the Ontario
Court of Appeal itself: see Regina v. Torrie[5]. Indeed, I am of the opinion that the
instruction as to deliberate intention puts the obligation of the Crown at too
high a level in respect of a charge to which criminal negligence is basic.
Although the question of the type of mens rea involved in criminal
negligence, as defined in s.191(1), was not directly in issue in the judgments
of this Court in O’Grady

[Page 307]

v. Sparling[6], Binus v. The
Queen[7], and Peda
v. The Queen[8], these
cases support the conclusion that subjective intent is not a necessary
ingredient of criminal negligence.

This assessment has a bearing on the position
taken by appellant’s counsel on the first question on which leave to appeal was
granted. Counsel’s submission was that having regard to the purport of the
Crown’s evidence, to the theory of the Crown, and, indeed, to the like view of
the case taken by the trial judge (as revealed, for example, in his remarks
when imposing sentence), the ascription of deliberation to the accused
negatived criminal negligence and hence entitled him to an acquittal. The
principal pressed upon this Court was that expounded in Regina v. Barnard[9], where it was held by a single judge
(differing from the view of a brother judge on the same point in a prior trial
of the accused on the same charge) that an indictment charging the offence of
causing bodily harm by wanton driving could not be supported where the evidence
showed that the victim died as a result of the wanton driving. Accordingly, at
the conclusion of the Crown’s case, the jury was directed to bring in a verdict
of not guilty.

I do not find it necessary to consider here
whether the Barnard decision states a principle applicable in this case,
or how far it turned on particular provisions of Tasmanian law or whether the
fact that the evidence tended to

[Page 308]

show culpable homicide meant, in the light of
the local law, that it should have been charged as such, or whether it is
central to the submission of appellant’s counsel that he be able to show that
the appellant would be deprived of the right to plead autrefois convict or
acquit, as the case may be, if tried on a charge on which the evidence,
as lead, would show a graver offence. As to this last observation, reference
may be had to s. 519(1) of the Criminal Code (now s.538(1)) which reads
as follows:

Where an indictment charges substantially
the same offence as that charged in an indictment on which an accused was
previously convicted or acquitted, but adds a statement of intention or
circumstances of aggravation tending, if proved, to increase the punishment,
the previous conviction or acquittal bars the subsequent indictment.

What is clear here is that at the close of the
Crown’s case—and it is with this point of the trial that we are concerned—there
was evidence in the statement of the accused denying intent. It was proper,
therefore, to send the case to the jury, even on the erroneous instruction
given to them, since it could not be said that any conviction, if made, must necessarily
rest on evidence which would establish a more serious offence than that
charged. This is enough to dispose of the point raised under the first question
without embarking on any discussion of the Crown’s discretion to lay a lesser
charge than what the evidence that it has, if fully accepted, would support.

Turning to the second question, I am of the
opinion that the trial judge failed lamentably to put before the jury the
defence of the accused. There is not a single sentence in the entire charge
that goes to any defence of the accused under the law and, especially in
respect of the parts of his statement that would be exonerating, if believed.
Accused’s counsel raised the

[Page 309]

issue of accident when making his motion for
dismissal, and, in his address to the jury, read the accused’s statement and
asked that it be believed. Accident, as a defence, required not only mention
but explanation since it could have more than one meaning, including complete
absence of negligence as well as momentary inattention. The statement given by
the accused was as follows:

Well there is a possibility that I might
have hit him. I’m not too positive about that. It started with me going into
the restaurant and after entering the restaurant I was confronted by this fellow
who asked me what was I doing there? I asked him what that has to do with him
and he insisted to know what did I come in the restaurant for and he appeared
to be drunk. So I ignored him and placed my order. I was served and started to
go out and these two coloured guys was coming in and this fellow went over to
one of the fellows and wanted to know what he was doing in the restaurant also.
At one stage when he confronted me he told me that I was black and he was white
I replied that I knew this. Now, when he asked this coloured fellow what he was
doing inside this fellow smiled and the white fellow got nasty and slapped the
coloured fellow and then he slapped back and a fight broke out and I left the
restaurant and went and sit in the car that was parked on Avenue Rd., just
beside the restaurant. A few seconds later the coloured fellow came staggering
out and had blood all over his face. So I managed to get him into my car and
started up and turned around to go along Webster Avenue and further up the avenue
these two fellows were crossing the road, and its a bit hazy what happened
there but I can remember them running across the road and the fellow beside me
was groaning and I remember glancing at him and I realized I was going into the
curb and there was a light post there and I swerved out and there was an impact
and I knew the fellows they jumped across and there was a possibility that I
might have hit one of the fellows. During this period I realized that one of
the fellows was the one who picked on me in the restaurant and out of fear I
kept going until I reached the Western Hospital where I phoned the Police. I
later learned from one of the officers that one of the fellows was injured
thats about all so far.

[Page 310]

In his charge the trial judge first referred to
the statement to support the identification evidence of Crown witnesses. He
then told the jury that it was to be regarded in the same way as any other
evidence in the case; it could be believed or disbelieved in whole or in part.
Pages of the charge were devoted to a minute repetition of the evidence of the
Crown witnesses, and this recital was associated with express reference to the
theory of the Crown. Towards the end of the charge he came back to the
statement in these words:

I am not going to go over all the contents
of the written statement of the accused man because it is quite lengthy. You
will have it with you in the jury room and you will have ample opportunity to
consider it. He admits he was driving the car. There is no suggestion that he
was ill. There is no suggestion that there was something wrong with the car.
There was some talk about being hazy. I don’t know what hazy means. The first
officer didn’t say anything about being hazy. I think I indicated to you before
that insofar as the fight that took place in the restaurant, that does not
justify the accused or any other person in running a man down with a car.

The only other reference to the accused’s
position was this sentence:

So far as the defence is concerned Mr.
Lindsay [accused’s counsel] says that the Crown has failed to prove this case
beyond a reasonable doubt and he says that Latus is not to be believed.

A trial judge does not put the defence to the
jury merely by emphasizing that the Crown carries the ultimate burden of proof
to the end of the case or by telling the jury what the issues are under the
applicable law. Courts have said time and again that an accused is entitled to
have any defence, however poor it may be, which is raised by the evidence, put
directly to the jury; and this, whether or not his counsel has advanced it and
whether or not defence evidence was offered: see Henderson v. The

[Page 311]

King[10]. A fortiori is
this so where a defence has been advanced, as in this case, and where, if
accepted or if taken to raise a reasonable doubt when measured against the
Crown’s evidence, the verdict must be one of acquittal.

It is of no consequence in a jury trial that the
trial judge does not believe in the defences which the evidence raises. If he
sends the case to the jury he must send it evenhandedly, with equal fairness to
the accused, according to the evidence, and to the Crown. This was not done
here; in fact, the charge can best be described as drawing an obscuring curtain
over any exonerating factors telling in favour of the accused, keeping them
from the jury’s view. Of course, the jury heard the evidence; of course, the
accused’s statement was in its hands as an exhibit produced by the Crown (a
statement which the trial judge mentioned in its features adverse to the
accused when it was mentioned at all). These considerations are not a
substitute for the trial judge’s obligation to conduct the case fairly between
state and individual. He must tell the jury what is the legal significance of
the evidence put in by way of the accused’s statement. If they are to take the
law from him (and this is basic to our view of a criminal trial before judge
and jury), he cannot default in his duty to bring it into relation to the
evidence.

I do not say that the trial judge is under
obligation to give a meticulous review of the evidence, although as I have
pointed out he did this here in respect of the Crown’s case. From this point of
view, I do not dwell, in relation to the present case, on the situation which
this Court faced in Azoulay v. The Queen[11]. The paraphrase of the evidence, the
question of put-

[Page 312]

ting it substantially to the jury, is only one
part of the composite obligation of making clear to the jury what are the
defences to a charge. The other part is to give a legal characterization of the
evidence. There will be cases where greater or lesser attention is necessary to
the details of evidence supporting one or more defences. I cannot, however,
conceive of cases where, upon a trial after a plea of not guilty, it is
unnecessary to tell the jury what the defence is. In Provencher v. The Queen[12], Cartwright J., as he then was, speaking
for the Court, said (at p. 100) “The theory of the defence was simple
enough and no elaborate direction was called for; it was however
incumbent on the trial judge to point out to the jury [what] this theory was…”
[The Italics are mine]. Dispensation with an elaborate direction is one thing;
failure to give any direction is something else, and that is the present case.

I would, on this ground, allow the appeal, set
aside the conviction and direct a new trial.

One further point was taken by appellant’s
counsel under the second question of law, namely, that the trial judge ought to
have directed the jury on the offence of dangerous driving, as an included
offence, on which a verdict was open under the charge as laid and on the
evidence adduced in support of it. I would not construe the second question so
narrowly as to exclude this ground, which, indeed, was raised on the application
for leave. In any event, it is open to the Court to expand the grounds of
leave; and in this case, as its factum shows, the Crown was not taken by
surprise and responded fully in its factum to this ground, albeit it was very
shortly stated in the appellant’s factum.

[Page 313]

That dangerous driving may be an included
offence under a charge of an offence under s.193 is expressly stipulated in s.
569(4) (now s. 589(5)) which, so far as material, provides that “Where a count
charges an offence under section…193…arising out of the operation of a motor
vehicle…and the evidence does not prove such offence but does prove an offence
under subsection 4 of section 221…the accused may be convicted of [the latter]
offence…” The only question then is whether the evidence, including the
statement of the accused, could be viewed as supporting a conviction of
dangerous driving if it was not sufficient to prove the offence charged. In my
opinion, such a view was open; and I do not think that the mere assertion of
accident, which has a range of meanings, is enough to disentitle the accused to
have a direction on the lesser offence. I cannot accept what was said by
Richards J. in Regina v. Billingsley[13],
as stating a general principle, without regard to the nature of the offence to
which a defence of accident is raised.

This second defect in the charge reinforces the
direction I would make for a new trial; and I repeat that the appeal should
accordingly be allowed and a new trial directed. It would not be proper on the
record before us to accede to the request of appellant’s counsel to substitute
a conviction of dangerous driving, albeit there is power in this Court so to
do.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Game—Cheating—Milk bottle toss
at fair—Three bottles similar in appearance—Heavier bottles at bottom of pyramid—No
indication of varying weights—Difficulty of knocking them over—Whether “game of
skill”—Whether fraudulent intent—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51,
ss. 168 (1)(f), 181.

The appellant operated a game known as the
milk bottle toss at a fair. To play this game, the player throws a ball at
three metalic bottles so arranged on a platform as to form a pyramid, and tries
to knock down all three bottles. The bottles were all similar in appearance but
the two bottles at the foot of the pyramid were much heavier than the one on
top. The appellant was convicted of cheating while playing a game with intent
to defraud, contrary to s. 181 of the Criminal Code. The conviction
was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. He was granted leave to appeal to this
Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

If the game of bottle toss had been what it
appeared to be to the patron, it would have been a game of pure skill. But, by
the device of making the two bottles on the lower layer of the pyramid heavier
than the upper bottle, the operator turned a game of pure skill into a game of
mixed skill and chance. It is by the use of bottles varying so markedly in
weight that the game of skill which appeared to face the patron was changed to
a game of mixed skill and chance. The weighing of the bottles would have
constituted the addition of a requirement for a higher degree of skill if the
varying weights of the three bottles had been plainly indicated thereon. In the
present case the intent of the accused was not only to induce a state of mind
in the player but to induce a course of action by the instilling of that state
of mind. The trial judge was therefore correct in finding that the accused had
the

[Page 279]

intention to defraud. The weighing of the
bottles, without knowledge of the patron, constituted cheating.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, affirming the
conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed.

H.E. Stafford, Q.C., for the appellant.

Ian Cartwright, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal by leave of this
Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario pronounced on May 17, 1971. In that judgment the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissed the appeal from the conviction of the appellant by the
Provincial Court Judge on December 10, 1970, upon the charge that

Richard McGarey you are charged that on or
about the 9th day of May in the year 1970 at the town of Ajax in the County and Province of Ontario
you unlawfully did with intent to defraud one Barry Nolan, cheat while playing
a game to wit: milk bottle toss contrary to S. 181 of the Criminal Code of
Canada.

Section 181 of the Criminal Code of Canada (now R.S.C. 1970, c. C-74, s. 192)
provides

Every one who, with intent to defraud any
person, cheats while playing a game or in holding the stakes for a game or in
betting is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
two years.

The appellant as an employee of one Watson was
operating at a Canadian Legion fair in the town of Ajax a game known as the milk bottle toss. The complainant Constable
Nolan attended the fair upon the instructions of his superiors and was watching
this milk bottle toss when he was solicited by the accused to play the game. He
did so throwing four balls and paying a total

[Page 280]

of 75c being at the regular rate of 25c for the
first throw and then 50c for the next three throws.

Milk bottle toss was played on this occasion as
follows: Three metallic bottles were arranged on a platform, the platform being
about 1½ inches off the ground with two bottles set side by side some little
distance apart and the third bottle set on the top of the two to form the apex
of the pyramid. The player stood about 8½ feet to 10 feet away from this
pyramid of bottles which all had exactly similar appearance and threw a ball
much like the softball used in baseball at the pyramid in an attempt to knock
down all three bottles. Should the player be successful in doing so he was
awarded a prize which was said to be of a value of $2.75. As I have said the
bottles were all similar in appearance but that appearance was deceptive. The
bottle which sat on top of the two others at the apex of the pyramid weighted a
little less than 3 lbs. The actual one used in the game which the constable
played was 2 lb. 15 oz. The two bottles at the foot of the pyramid and upon
which the light bottle rested were very much heavier, in this particular case 8
lb. 7 oz. and a similar variation of weight appeared in the other two game
setups standing one on either side of the one actually used by the constable.
The constable on his first throw struck the right hand lower bottle and the top
bottle, both of which fell but the left hand lower bottle remained standing and
on a second throw he missed the pyramid entirely. On a third throw he missed
the actual pyramid and struck the base. In both these throws of course no
bottles fell. On the fourth and final throw the constable knocked off the top
bottle and left the two bottom bottles standing. The constable called for other
members of the police force. The accused man was arrested and charged. After a
trial the learned Provincial Court Judge registered a conviction and gave one
year’s suspended sentence to the appellant. The appellant appealed to the Court
of Appeal for Ontario and his
appeal was dismissed without written reasons. The appellant then by leave
appealed to this Court. The appellant took four

[Page 281]

grounds of appeal in his argument to the Court.
These grounds are as follows:

(1) That no offence was committed by the
Appellant in view of the evidence that Constable Nolan played the bottle toss
as a result of receiving certain information and instructions from persons
other than the Appellant.

(2) That the bottle toss is a game of skill
and not a game as contemplated by s. 181 and defined by s. 168 (1) (f)
of the Criminal Code.

(3) That the Appellant was not actually “playing
a game” in accordance with the wording of s. 181 of the Criminal Code.

(4) That the placing of the two heavier
bottles on the bottom of the pyramid merely had the effect of raising the
degree of skill necessary to win and did not constitute a fraudulent intent to
obtain money from Constable Nolan by a deceitful practice while playing a game.

It is my intention to deal with these grounds seriatim.
Firstly, the appellant submits that due to the fact that Constable Nolan
went to this fair on instructions to watch this game and to play it that the
representation made by the appellant had no bearing on the constable engaging
in the milk bottle toss. I think this submission is answered completely by consideration
of the words of the Section creating the offence “Every one who, with
intent to defraud any person, cheats”. It is the intent of the accused not the
intent of the victim which is the issue under the Section. The accused had no
knowledge that Constable Nolan had attended and played the game upon
instructions from his superiors. So far as he was aware Constable Nolan was
simply another member of the public who could be induced to spend his money in
playing this game and the accused with the intent to obtain money from the
person who turned out to be Constable Nolan did induce that person to pay money
and to play the game. The second ground of appeal is that the bottle toss game
was a game of skill and therefore not a game as contemplated by s. 181 and
defined by s. 168 (1) (f) of the Criminal Code. The latter

[Page 282]

subsection defines “game” for the purpose
of Part 5 of the Criminal Code to be:

“game” means a game of chance or mixed
chance and skill

I am ready to agree with counsel for the appellant
that if the game of bottle toss had been what it appeared to be to the patron
who stepped up to the booth, paid his fee and engaged in the game, it would
have been a game of pure skill. With the exception that the bottle was thrown
rather than rolled, it much resembles a game of bowls. Of course, the bowl
rolled by the player down the alley would not hit all of the pins whether there
were five or ten. In fact, to do so would have been impossible. Yet the skill
of the bowler very frequently causes all the pins to fall. This results from
what bowlers term the “action” when one pin hit by the bowl is thrown against
another pin and that pin against a third or fourth or fifth, resulting in all
of them falling. So, to outward appearance, the player of this game of milk
bottle toss could count on the “action” between three bottles alone which
composed the “set up” to cause all of the bottles to fall despite the fact that
only one of the bottles had been hit by the bell. The difficulty which the
appellant faces and with which I shall deal later when I discuss the fourth
ground of appeal was that this was not a situation which the patron faced. The
two bottles on the lower layer of the pyramid were many times heavier than the
upper bottle. Therefore, there could not be the “action” upon which a bowler
was entitled to rely and upon which the player in this game was entitled,
judging by all appearances, to rely, so that all the bottles would be knocked
down if only one bottle were struck, whether that bottle were the one on the
top of the pyramid or either one on the base of the pyramid. Therefore, by this
device, the operator, the employer of the accused, had turned a game of pure
skill into a game of mixed skill and chance. A lucky hit between the two lower
bottles might knock down all three bottles, but such a hit would be no more
skilful than one which struck the outer edge of either of the lower bottles and
which, if they were evenly weighted, would have caused

[Page 283]

inevitably the “action” resulting in all three
of the bottle falling. In Ross, Banks and Dyson v. The Queen[1], Pigeon J. said at p.791:

However, when the statute speaks of chance
as opposed to skill, it is clear that it contemplates not the unpredictables
that may occasionally defeat skill but the systematic resort to chance involved
in many games such as the throw of dice, the deal of cards.

It is by the use of bottles varying so markedly
in weight that the game of skill which appeared to face the patron was changed
to a game of mixed skill and chance and, in fact, the chance all weighed
against the patron.

As its third ground the appellant submits that
he was not actually playing the game and that the only player was Nolan. In his
Factum the counsel for the appellant describes the appellant’s act as being
mere passive presence while the game was being played. I am of the opinion that
the circumstances do not support such a contention. It was the accused who
solicited the constable to engage in the game. It was the accused who collected
the constable’s money when he paid the required fee. It was the accused who was
in charge of the placing of the bottles in the three-bottle pyramid and it was
the accused who would have had to part with a prize had the constable been so
fortunate as to knock down the three bottles. In my view the accused was an
active participant not a mere passive bystander.

The fourth ground of appeal submitted by the
counsel for the appellant that the placing of the two heavier bottles on the
bottom of the pyramid merely had the effect of raising the degree of skill
necessary to win and did not constitute a fraudulent intent to obtain money
from Constable Nolan by a deceitful practise while playing a game, I have
already dealt with in part. In

[Page 284]

my opinion, the placing of the heavy bottles in
such a fashion did much more than constitute the addition of a requirement for
a higher degree of skill. That would have been so if the varying weight of the
three bottles had been plainly indicated thereon. When the weights were not so
indicated, as I have pointed out, the game of pure skill had added to it, or to
put it another way, built into it an element of chance and in fact a very
unlikely chance. Did this weighing of the bottles without knowledge of the
patron constitute cheating? Again reference should be made to the actual words
of the section under which the appellant was charged “Every one who, with
intent to defraud any person, cheats”. The intention to defraud was dealt with
in the Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side of the Province of Quebec in Re Rosen[2].
There Martin J. giving the majority judgment of the Court was dealing with a
game of three card Monte and at page 382 said:

The gist of the offence here charged is
cheating that is to say, perpetrating some fraud or ill-practice of making use
of some unlawful device in the act of playing.

The offence is cheating with intent to defraud
and defrauding is dealt with by Buckley J. in Re London & Globe Finance
Corporation, Ltd.[3]:

To deceive is, I apprehend, to induce a man
to believe that a thing is true which is false, and which the person practising
the deceit knows or believes to be false. To defraud is to deprive by deceit:
it is by deceit to induce a man to act to his injury. More tersely it may be
put, that to deceive is by falsehood to induce a state of mind; to defraud is
by deceit to induce a course of action.

Although such a statement was obiter it
has received wide acceptance as being the distinction between deceiving and
defrauding. In the present case the intent of the accused was not only to
induce a state of mind in the player but to induce a course of action by the
instilling of

[Page 285]

that state of mind and I am of the opinion that
the learned Provincial Judge therefore was correct in finding the accused had
the intention to defraud. Then the question arises whether the accused did
cheat. I have quoted supra Martin J.’s definition of cheating in Re
Rosen, the “perpetrating of a fraud or ill-practice or making use of some
unlawful device.” Here the accused man caused three metallic bottles exactly
similar in appearance to be arranged so that the two which were much heavier
sat on the bottom and the light bottle on the top. The appearance of this
pyramid was such that anyone would believe that it would be very easy to knock
over these three bottles. One witness Slavnick said that if all the bottles
were the same weight and if they were all light the operator could not stay in
business as a four year-old child could knock them over. That was however, the
exact visual impression given to any prospective player of the game as he
looked at the pyramid and it was that visual impression which induced the
prospective player to play the game. That was the “perpetrating of the fraud or
ill-practice” to use again the words of Martin J. It was this feature which the
learned Provincial Court Judge stressed in his reasons for judgment when he
said:

The cogent matter is what they [a
tremendous lot of young people] believe and what they are not told. I think the
average youngster takes a look at those dozen bottles and they would
say—without examining them because they don’t get that opportunity—they would
say they were all the same… In reality they are not the same. If there were a
sign or some advertisement on these bottles saying this one is several times
heavier than this one, or if it were posted up on a board so the public knew
what they were doing, there would be no fraud.

The learned Provincial Court Judge found that
the like appearance of bottles which in fact were varied very markedly in
weight constituted a deceit and that the deceit was intended to induce the
player to part with his money and that therefore the operator did cheat the
player. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Admissibility—Conspiracy—Acts and declarations of one conspirator
acquitted—Criminal code, ss. 592 (1)(b)(iii), 619.

The appellants, G and P, together with Z and
M, were tried on a charge that they, with W.S. and M.S. and persons unknown,
conspired to commit the indictable offence of trafficking in a narcotic. The
jury convicted M and acquitted Z, but were unable to agree as to a verdict
respecting the two appelants. The indictment was amended so as to charge only
the two appellants of conspiring together, and with Z, M, W.S. and M.S. and
persons unknown, to commit the said indictable offence. Prior to the trial,
M.S., who had been a witness for the Crown, had died. By leave of the trial
judge, pursuant to s. 619 of the Criminal Code, the evidence of
M.S., given at the earlier trial, was read as evidence in the proceedings. A
portion of that evidence related to acts and declarations of Z in the absence
of the appellants. The convictions of the appellants having been affirmed by
the Court of Appeal, the appellants obtained leave to appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The evidence as to Z’s acts was properly
admissible. It is not necessary to express an opinion on the admissibility of
the evidence as to Z’s declarations, in the absence of the appellants, because,
even if that evidence was inadmissible, it was unimportant and s. 592(1) (b)(iii)
could properly be applied.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1]
affirming the convictions of the appellants. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 274]

H. Walsh, Q.C., and Jack McGivern, for
the appellants.

S.M. Toy, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—This is an appeal from the judgment
of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which dismissed the appellants’ appeal from conviction for
conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of trafficking in a narcotic.

In January, 1970, the appellants, together with
Ido Zamai and John McKeoff, were tried before a judge and jury on the charge
that they, with William T. Smith, Murray Theodore Spreckley and persons
unknown, conspired to commit the indictable offence of trafficking in a
narcotic. The jury was unable to agree, and a new trial on the same indictment
was held in May, 1970. At this trial, the jury convicted McKeoff and acquitted
Zamai, but were unable to agree as to a verdict respecting the two appellants.

On September 8, 1970, the indictment was amended
so as to charge only the two appellants of conspiring together, and with Zamai,
McKeoff, Smith and Spreckley and persons unknown, to commit the said indictable
offence. They were tried before a judge and jury and convicted.

Prior to this third trial, Spreckley, who had
been a witness for the Crown, had died. At this trial, by leave of the trial
judge, pursuant to s. 619 (now s. 643) of the Criminal Code, the
evidence of Spreckley, given at the earlier trial, was read as evidence in the
proceedings.

On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Bull J.A. and
Taggart J.A. applied the provisions of s. 592 (1) (b) (iii) (now
s. 613(1) (b) (iii)) of the Code and dismissed the appeals. Tysoe
J.A., dissenting, would not have applied this provision.

[Page 275]

Leave to appeal to this Court was granted on
three questions of law:

1. Did the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia err in failing to allow the appeal of the appellants and quash the
verdict when the charge on which the appellants were found guilty was one in
which Ido Zamai was a named co-conspirator?

2. Was the learned trial judge wrong in law
in permitting the evidence of Murray Theodore Spreckley given at a previous
trial to be read as part of the Crown’s case under the provisions of
s. 619 of the Criminal Code?

3. Was the learned trial judge wrong in law
in having failed to exclude from the evidence of Murray Theodore Spreckley,
given at a previous trial and read in at the trial of the appellants under
s. 619 of the Criminal Code, those portions of the evidence in
which Murray Theodore Spreckley testified to the acts and declarations of Ido
Zamai in the absence of the appellants?

After the submissions of counsel for the
appellants had been made to this Court in respect of these three questions,
counsel for the respondent was advised that he need only submit argument in
respect of Question 3.

With respect to the matter raised in this
question, Bull J.A. had this to say:

As to Zamai, I have no difficulty in
concluding that the not inconsiderable evidence of his associations with each
of the appellants and with Smith and Spreckley and the evidence of the latter
as to the purchases of narcotics from him was admissible and properly admitted
notwithstanding that, because of his earlier acquittal, the appellants could
not properly be found to have committed the crime of conspiracy with him.
That evidence was relevant and material to the Crown’s case unfolded to the
jury with respect to conduct and actions of the other persons alleged to be
parties to or participants in the charged conspiracy. It was evidence that
could have been admitted even if Zamai had not been tried for the conspiracy or
included in the charge as a named co-conspirator. It was evidence which was
relevant and admissible as key links in the chain in the carrying out of the
purposes and common design of the alleged conspiracy, quite aside from the
question of whether or not

[Page 276]

Zamai was a member of, or co-conspirator
in, that conspiracy.

However, in my view the situation is
different with respect to a certain conversation entered into evidence which
might have been prejudicial and which would have been admissible only on the
basis of Zamai being a co-conspirator with the appellants. See Paradis v.
The King [1934] S.C.R. 165; Koufis v. The King [1941] S.C.R. 481.
The evidence arose out of the deceased Spreckley’s testimony (read into
evidence by the Crown) in which a discussion between him and Zamai was related.
After recounting certain transactions and dealings with Zamai, Spreckley
testified:

“Well, on second plant that I got from
Zamai he told me next to get in touch with Dave Ponak, gave me a phone number
that, and so then…”

The reference was of course to the
appellant Ponak, and in my view that portion of the evidence should not have
been admitted. In fairness, I must say that Crown counsel offered to edit
Spreckley’s testimony being read into evidence by deleting that answer, but the
offer was not accepted by defence counsel. The evidence raised no prejudice to
the appellant Gunn, but obviously, on the surface, was prejudicial to the
appellant Ponak. However, the evidence of what occurred later demonstrates that
the error was of small moment. Spreckley went on to say that he did in fact
later communicate with Ponak by telephone, made arrangements for a rendez-vous and
purchased from him, directly, on two occasions in the next two or three weeks a
total of 800 capsules of heroin for $4,800.00 cash. In view of this direct and
admissible evidence of dealings with Ponak, the fact that Zamai told him to go
to that appellant becomes almost immaterial and certainly of little
consequence. I do not overlook that there were other incidents of conversations
related between Zamai and Smith and between Zamai and Spreckley, but, although
inadmissible, none of them can be said to have been prejudicial in the
slightest degree to either appellant. They all had references to transactions
between Zamai and Smith or Spreckley, the evidence of which I have determined
was admissible, and had no reference to the appellants.

In my respectful opinion, the evidence
improperly admitted into evidence was of insufficient importance to affect the
verdict, and I consider that its omission

[Page 277]

could not have affected the jury’s verdict
in any way. I would certainly apply to the error of law in question the
provisions of Code section 592(l)(b)(iii), about which I
will deal further later in this judgment.

We are all of the opinion that evidence as to
Zamai’s acts was properly admissible. If there was any error at all, it could
only be in respect of the admission of evidence as to Zamai’s declarations, in
the absence of the appellants. It is not necessary to express and we do not
express any opinion on this point, because, even if that evidence was
inadmissible, we agree with the view expressed by Bull J.A. as to its
unimportance, and we agree that s. 592(1)(b)(iii) could properly be
applied.

Accordingly, we are of the opinion that this
appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO

Criminal law—Trial—Discharge of
counsel—Refusal of trial judge to allow discharge—No error.

The appellant was indicted on six counts of
arson and related offences. He was convicted on five counts. He was represented
by counsel at the preliminary hearing. The same counsel appeared for him at the
trial. The first day was taken up by two motions, one for severance of the
counts and the other, for a change of venue. Both motions were denied. Counsel
participated in the selection of the jury. The next morning, before any
evidence was called, the appellant requested a postponement of the trial and a
change of counsel. The trial judge stated that he would not permit the accused
to discharge his counsel at the last minute and would not permit counsel to
withdraw. Counsel represented the accused throughout the rest of the trial,
cross-examined, lead the accused’s own evidence, addressed the jury and spoke
as to sentence. The conviction was affirmed by a majority judgment of the Court
of appeal. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson and Ritchie JJ: There was no request by the accused or by counsel
representing him that the accused should be permitted to defend himself. The
request was for a change of counsel and a postponement of trial until new
counsel could be retained. With all that had happened, the accused was not
entitled to this. If he wished to discharge counsel at this stage, he had the
right to proceed with the trial and conduct his own defence. The ruling made by
the trial judge was in the accused’s own interest. There was no unequivocal
discharge of counsel, there was a manoeuvre to frustrate the ruling of the
trial judge that there would be no change of venue and no severance of the
counts and, finally, there was a

[Page 254]

reaffirmation of the retainer. The evidence
against the accused was overwhelming.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The intention of the appellant to discharge his counsel was
made clear and unequivocal. It was within the discretion of the trial judge to
refuse to permit any postponement of the trial. However, the refusal to permit
any litigant to discharge his counsel whether during the course of a proceeding
in Court or on another occasion is a very different matter. The breach of the
accused’s right to make full answer and defence and of his fundamental right to
the conduct of his own trial is a miscarriage of justice and not a mere error
in law, and therefore, s. 592(1)(b)(iii) cannot be applied.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: It was the trial judge’s duty to consider the request of the
accused even if in the result the accused might have to conduct his own
defence. It is not suggested that an accused has an absolute right to interrupt
and delay a trial by a belated desire to be represented by another counsel, but
neither has a trial judge an absolute right to force an accused to continue
with his counsel. The trial judge dealt with this issue in too peremptory a
manner, and in consequence, erred in a material matter going to the rights of
the accused.

APPEAL from a judgement of the Court of
appeal for Ontario[1],
affirming the conviction of the appellant. Appeal dismissed, Spence and Laskin
JJ. dissenting.

C.R. Thomson, for the appellant.

D.A. McKenzie, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.
was delivered by

JUDSON J.—This case, which involves an attempt
by an accused person to have his trial postponed and an opportunity to retain
fresh counsel, must be unique on its facts. The appellant was indicted on six
counts of arson and related offences. He was convicted on five counts. He was
represented by counsel at the

[Page 255]

preliminary hearing. The same counsel appeared
for him at the trial. The first day was taken up by two motions, one for a
severance of the counts, and the other for a change of venue. Both motions were
denied. The jury panel was called and the jury selected, counsel for the
accused participating in the selection of the jury. The remainder of the panel
was then discharged.

The next morning, before any evidence was
called, the following exchange took place between counsel and the accused on
one side and the Bench on the other:

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, I wonder if I
might have some time?

THE COURT: Take whatever time you need. You
take whatever time you require. We will adjourn if Mr. MacKay wants to
consult with his client about some matter.

THE ACCUSED: I want a postponement.

THE COURT: Oh, well, the case now is being
tried, Mr. Spataro. I mean, there will be no… (interrupted.)

THE ACCUSED: (Interrupting) Change of
lawyer.

THE COURT: I beg your pardon?
Mr. MacKay?

MR. MACKAY: Had we better adjourn for ten
minutes?

…

MR. MACKAY: Just before the Jury return I
wonder if Mr. Spataro might be… oh, I see… just one moment…

THE COURT: Yes, Mr. MacKay, you take
your time. —(Mr. MacKay and accused off the record.)

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, Mr. Spataro
instructs me that he wishes to discharge me. He is not prepared to accept my
advice on a matter.

THE COURT: Mr. Spataro?

MR. MACKAY: Under the circumstances I’d ask
Your Honour’s permission to withdraw from the matter. I don’t know if I am
following these… those rules that are set out.

THE COURT: I may say, so far as Spataro,
you have been acting for him all along and, Mr. Spataro, I don’t permit
the accused to discharge his coun-

[Page 256]

sel at the last minute and I don’t permit
counsel to withdraw and so the case will go on and Mr. MacKay will act for
you. That is my order.

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, for the sake of
the record I am not precise on what those new rules of the Law Society are.

THE COURT: So far as withdrawing it must be
done in such time as to notify the Crown Attorney’s office and all other
officials.

MR. MACKAY: For the sake of the record
might I… I think I should perhaps object to that.

THE COURT: Oh, that’s fine. Oh, yes, that
is perfectly all right, Mr. MacKay. It’s on the record.

It is apparent from this exchange that the first
request made by the accused was for a postponement. Then he mentioned change of
counsel. Then there was a clear statement by counsel that his client had
informed him that he wished to discharge him, the client not being prepared to
accept his advice on a matter. This is all that we know about the reason for
the request. The request was not one either by counsel or the accused that the
accused wished to conduct his own defence. It was in essence a further request
for a postponement which had been involved in the motion for a change of venue.

After this incident, counsel represented the
accused throughout the rest of the six-day trial and made representations as to
sentence on another date. On the third day of the trial, counsel renewed his
motion for a change of venue and for a halt to the proceedings. The accused permitted
counsel to cross-examine, to lead the accused’s own evidence, to address the
jury and, finally, to speak as to sentence.

Following conviction and sentence, the accused
retained the same counsel to act for him on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Ontario.
Due to a misunderstanding between the accused and his counsel, this appeal was
not

[Page 257]

instituted. The next step was a prisoner’s
appeal, prepared with the assistance of a Legal Aid Counsel. Later, this was
converted into a solicitor’s appeal by the withdrawal of the prisoner’s appeal
and the filing and service of a new Notice of Appeal by the new solicitor.
Neither Notice of Appeal mentioned the matter now complained of. It appeared
for the first time in the appellant’s factum filed in the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal[2] was divided but in the result the appeal
was dismissed. Jessup J.A. held that there was error in law in the ruling of
the learned trial judge that he would not permit the accused to discharge his
counsel at the last minute and would not permit counsel to withdraw. However,
he was satisfied that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
and applied s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.

Kelly J.A. agreed with Jessup J.A., that there
would have been error in the judge’s ruling if he had refused to permit the
accused to terminate the retainer of counsel but he held that there had never
been an unequivocal discharge of counsel by the accused and that in effect he
had reaffirmed the retainer and continued to be represented by him throughout
the trial. I agree with this assessment of the situation which confronted the
trial judge.

Brooke J.A., dissenting, held that the accused
had the right to proceed without this particular person as his counsel, that
this right was wrongly denied him, and that there had been a mistrial.

There was no request by the accused or by
counsel representing him that the accused should be permitted to defend
himself. My opinion is that the request was for a change of counsel and a
postponement of trial until new counsel could be retained. With all that had
happened, the accused was not entitled to this. If he wished to discharge
counsel at this stage,

[Page 258]

he had the right to proceed with the trial and
conduct his own defence.

I am satisfied, after consideration of the whole
record, that the ruling made by the trial judge was in the accused’s own
interest. This accused was totally incapable of adequate self‑representation
in a trial of this magnitude, and had he been told that he must conduct his own
defence and that this was his only alternative, I feel sure that an Appellate
Court would have had reason to question whether justice had been done. No
criticism can be made of the manner in which counsel conducted the defence. It
is so stated by Kelly J.A., in the Court of Appeal. We are not faced here with
problems which arise when counsel is assigned at the last minute and the
accused takes the position that counsel is inadequately instructed and prepared
or that he is dissatisfied for good reason with the conduct of his defence.

In the circumstances of this case, I would hold,
first, that there was no unequivocal discharge of counsel; second, that what
happened was a manoeuvre to frustrate the ruling of the trial judge that there
would be no change of venue (which would involve a postponement of the trial)
and no severance of the counts; and third, that there was a reaffirmation of
the retainer. The words used by the learned trial judge must be understood in
relation to the particular situation with which he was confronted. He obviously
decided that the application was not made in good faith but for the purpose of
delay, and I agree with him. The right of defence is not a licence to obstruct
the course of justice and the trial judge was right that this was the real
issue.

The determination of this appeal is not helped
by the decision in R. v. Barnes[3]. This
was a plain case of improper judicial interference with

[Page 259]

the conduct of the defence. During the course of
that trial, the judge, in the absence of the jury, said that the accused was
plainly guilty and that the time of the court was being wasted. He went on to
comment on the growing frequency of hopeless defences and invited defending
counsel to reconsider his position. Under this outburst, counsel disclosed the
advice that he had given to his client and asked for leave to withdraw. The
judge then said that any other counsel would be bound to give the same advice
to the accused. He asked the accused whether he wished present counsel to
defend him or whether he would prefer to defend himself. He said that he would
defend himself and asked for a short adjournment. Being refused the
adjournment, he then agreed to continue to be represented by his present
counsel and maintained his plea of not guilty. The jury, which had been
excluded while all this was going on, brought in a verdict of guilty.

The Court of Appeal set aside the conviction and
refused to apply the proviso, counsel for the prosecution himself having
expressed doubts as to the propriety of applying it in such a case as this. The
ratio of the Court of Appeal on the point that is of concern in Spataro’s
present appeal was that the conduct of the judge had made it impossible for
defending counsel to do justice to the defence; that the judge had attempted to
interfere with the independance of counsel in advising his client and, finally,
that counsel had been compelled to disclose what advice he had in fact given to
the accused with the consequence that the relation of confidence between
counsel and client had been destroyed. There is, in Spataro’s case, no
interference from the Bench with counsel in the performance of his duty to his
client.

The problem with which we are faced in this
appeal is very similar to the one in Vescio v. The King[4]. Counsel for the accused had represented

[Page 260]

him at a long preliminary hearing. When the
accused was arraigned, counsel moved to have the trial adjourned to the next
assize and said that he was contemplating a motion for a change of venue. The
trial judge refused the motion. Counsel then withdrew from the case and the
judge said that he would appoint someone if the accused did not appoint counsel
within a day or two. The trial judge did make this appointment and fixed a date
for the trial. On this date, another counsel appeared stating that he was
“appearing on behalf of the accused, retained by his family”. He was not heard.
It is clear from the record that his function was to ask for a further
adjournment. The trial proceeded with the assigned counsel acting for the
accused. The verdict of the jury was guilty.

The reasons delivered in this Court clearly show
that there was no good reason for delaying the trial. They approve of the
determination of the trial judge not to allow the judicial process to be
frustrated by the tactics of counsel to bring about a delay. They contain a
finding that when these tactics failed, there was a ratification of the counsel
chosen by the Court. Vescio’s case goes further than the present case,
where there was an attempt at delay which was recognized for what it was worth.
The trial then proceeded with the same counsel who had represented the accused
from the very beginning.

The evidence against the accused was
overwhelming. If it had been necessary to apply s. 592(1) (b)(iii)
in order to decide this appeal, I would have done so.

I should mention that after the judgment of the
Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal had been entered, Kelly J.A., not knowing
that this had been done, delivered fresh reasons, holding that the learned
trial judge had made an error in

[Page 261]

law and that the case was not within the
proviso. The reasons that are before us on this appeal are those delivered from
the Bench orally at the conclusion of the hearing. The judgment of the Court of
Appeal was properly entered and I agree with the reasons given by Kelly J.A.
from the Bench.

I would dismiss the appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[5] pronounced on April 27, 1971, whereby that
Court dismissed the appeal of the accused from his conviction on April 15,
1970, at the General Sessions of the Peace in the County of York.

The accused had been convicted on five serious
charges connected with attempted arson and had been sentenced to a total
imprisonment of fourteen years in the penitentiary. Although there were various
grounds of appeal urged before the Court of Appeal for Ontario that Court
considered only one ground and the appeal to this Court is only in reference to
that one ground.

The trial commenced before W.M. Martin, Co.Ct.
J., on April 7, 1970, and continued through that day. On April 8, 1970, or so
soon as the Court opened, the following circumstances occurred and I quote from
the evidence:

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, I wonder if the
Jury may be just held for the moment.

THE COURT: Yes, surely, you want to see
your client? Do you want to see your client?

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, I wonder if I
might have some time?

THE COURT: Take whatever time you need. You
take whatever time you require. We will adjourn if Mr. MacKay wants to
consult with his client about some matter.

THE ACCUSED: I want a postponement.

[Page 262]

THE COURT: Oh, well, the case now is being
tried, Mr. Spataro. I mean, there will be no… (interrupted.)

THE ACCUSED: (Interrupting) Change of
lawyer.

THE COURT: I beg your pardon?
Mr. MacKay?

MR. MACKAY: Had we better adjourn for ten
minutes?

THE COURT: There is a lady in distress.

MR. MACKAY: Matron, would you assist that
lady, please.

THE COURT: Tell the Jury there has been a
short delay.

MR. MACKAY: Just before the Jury return I
wonder if Mr. Spataro might be… oh, I see… just one moment…

THE COURT: Yes, Mr. MacKay, you take
your time.

….(Mr. MacKay and accused off the
record.)

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, Mr. Spataro
instructs me that he wishes to discharge me. He is not prepared to accept my
advice on a matter.

THE COURT: Mr. Spataro?

MR. MACKAY: Under the circumstances I’d ask
Your Honour’s permission to withdraw from the matter. I don’t know if I am
following these… those rules that are set out.

THE COURT: I may say, so far as Spataro,
you have been acting for him all along and, Mr. Spataro, I don’t permit
the accused to discharge his counsel at the last minute and I don’t permit
counsel to withdraw and so the case will go on and Mr. MacKay will act for
you. This is my order.

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, for the sake of
the record I am not precise on what those new rules of the Law Society are.

THE COURT: So far as withdrawing it must be
done in such time as to notify the Crown Attorney’s office and all other
officials.

MR. MACKAY: For the sake of the record
might I… I think I should perhaps object to that.

THE COURT: Oh, that’s fine. Oh, yes, that
is perfectly all right, Mr. MacKay. It’s on the record.

The trial thereafter continued with
Mr. MacKay continuing to act as counsel for the accused and to
cross-examine witnesses and make submissions throughout the trial. At the

[Page 263]

close of the evidence for the Crown,
Mr. MacKay determined to adduce evidence and called the accused as the
only defence witness. Mr. MacKay addressed the jury on behalf of the
accused and after the accused was convicted made representations as to sentence
on his behalf.

Following the conviction and sentence, it would
appear from the legal aid file that the accused was advised by Mr. MacKay
that he had sufficient grounds for appeal and he therefore expected that
Mr. MacKay would take an appeal on his behalf. Upon discovering that
Mr. MacKay had not done so, the accused filed a notice of appeal on a
printed form without aid of counsel. In that notice of appeal, the only grounds
of appeal set out by the accused were these:

1. The conviction was against the evidence
and the weight of the evidence.

2. The Trial Judge failed to fairly and
adequately put to the jury, the defence of the appellant.

3. The sentence imposed was unduly
excessive and harsh.

Thereafter, the present counsel was retained,
applied for leave to withdraw the notice of appeal filed by the accused and for
an extension of time to file a new notice of appeal. On receiving such leave,
counsel proceeded to file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal dated
October 5, 1970, and again the ground of appeal dealt with in the Court of
Appeal and urged in this court was not mentioned.

Upon the appeal coming before the Court of
Appeal for argument, the other grounds set out in the notice of appeal filed by
counsel were urged in vain. The various members of the Court of Appeal then
considered whether the appeal by the accused should be allowed on the ground
that the learned trial judge had refused to permit the accused to discharge his
counsel during the course of the trial and had refused to permit the said
counsel to withdraw. All three members of the Court of Appeal were agreed that
if such was the effect of the learned trial

[Page 264]

judge’s ruling then it was a serious error in
law. Jessup J.A. said in an oral judgment given at the conclusion of the
argument:

I have no doubt that the learned trial
Judge seriously erred in law when he purported to direct counsel for the
accused that he could not withdraw from the case, notwithstanding the fact that
the accused, his client, apparently wished to discharge him.

And Kelly J.A. in his oral reasons given at the
close of the trial, concurring with Jessup J.A., said:

While I am in agreement with my brother
Jessup that it would have been a serious error for the trial Judge to have
refused to permit the accused to terminate the retainer of his counsel at
trial, as I read the transcript there was never an unequivocal discharge of
counsel by the accused.

Brooke J.A., again in an oral judgment at the
close of the trial, dissenting, based his judgment upon such error in law.

Despite his statement as to the error, Jessup
J.A. was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed on the basis of the
proviso contained in s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, now
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 613(1)(b)(iii). Kelly J.A. was of the
opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons which I have
already quoted, i.e., that the record did not demonstrate that the appellant
had unequivocally discharged his counsel.

On May 26, 1971, evidently in ignorance of the
fact that the formal judgment dismissing the appeal had been issued by the
Registrar on April 27, 1971, Kelly J.A. gave written reasons for judgment which
he commenced with the paragraph:

At the conclusion of the argument I
indicated that I was of the view that the appeal should be dismissed, giving
orally my reasons for that conclusion. In the interim, as a result of further
consideration, I have decided that, in dismissing the appeal, I was in error
and that, for the reasons that follow, the appeal against conviction should be
allowed.

Counsel for the Attorney General in this Court
urged as his first ground in the opposing of the appeal that the accused had
not

[Page 265]

unequivocally discharged his counsel, that is,
he adopted the position taken by Kelly J.A. in his oral reasons delivered at
the close of the argument. With respect, I am in agreement with the conclusion
expressed by Kelly J.A. in his written reasons, unfortunately delivered after
the formal judgment had been issued and which, therefore, were quite
ineffective, when he said:

While I was originally of the opinion that
the accused could be taken to have re-affirmed his earlier choice of
Mr. MacKay, on further consideration I find myself unable to say that, in
the absence of the mis-statement to him of the law, he would voluntarily have
elected to proceed with the trial represented by counsel whom he had expressed
the wish to discharge.

I have quoted above, the words of both the
accused and his counsel at the trial. It is true the words of the accused were
very brief, i.e., “Change of lawyer”, but the matter was put accurately by his
counsel when he said:

MR. MACKAY: Your Honour, Mr. Spataro
instructs me that he wishes to discharge me. He is not prepared to accept my
advice on a matter.

Under such circumstances, there can be no doubt
that the intention of the appellant to discharge his counsel was made clear and
unequivocal on that occasion and the learned trial judge’s ruling which was as
clear and unequivocal:

…I don’t permit the accused to discharge
his counsel at the last minute and I don’t permit counsel to withdraw and so the
case will go on and Mr. MacKay will act for you. This is my order.

It is true that the trial proceeded in the
ordinary fashion with Mr. MacKay acting as counsel for the accused
throughout and doing so, as Jessup J.A. noted, with outstanding skill and ability.
However, there is little else that the appellant or Mr. MacKay, as his
counsel, could have done. For Mr. MacKay to have attempted to withdraw
after the judge’s ruling would have

[Page 266]

left him open to immediate proceedings for
contempt of court and counsel would have every reason to expect such a result
were he to attempt to withdraw. As for the appellant, he was a prisoner in the
box and the trial was proceeding. He was plainly told that he could not
discharge his counsel and that the counsel would continue to represent him and
the trial would proceed. I do not think it could have been expected of him that
he continue to interrupt the trial by raising objections to the learned trial
judge’s ruling.

It was also alleged by counsel for the Attorney General
that the subsequent procedures indicated that the accused had become reconciled
to his counsel Mr. MacKay and therefore must be taken in some fashion to
have withdrawn his discharge of such counsel and reaffirmed his retainer. As I
have pointed out, the accused himself gave evidence and it was said during
argument that his course in doing so was approved by the accused himself. Once
the continued services of Mr. MacKay had been forced upon the accused then
one would expect that Mr. MacKay would advise the accused and the accused
acting on his advice determined to give evidence in his own defence. I see, in
the accused’s giving evidence, no indication that he had recanted from his
previous decision to discharge his counsel but that his decision had simply
been overruled by the learned trial judge. Counsel for the appellant in this
Court made an affidavit, which was sworn on September 30, 1970 in support of an
application permitting late service and filing and setting down of the appeal
to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and paragraph 6 of that affidavit declared:

6. The information in the Legal Aid file
indicates that Mr. Spataro was advised by his trial counsel that he had
sufficient grounds for appeal. Mr. Spataro apparently expected that an
appeal would be taken but no appeal was taken…

Counsel for the Attorney General argued that the
circumstances that the appellant had accepted the services of Mr. MacKay
and had

[Page 267]

instructed him to proceed to an appeal to the
Court of Appeal confirms his submission that the appellant had never
unequivocally discharged Mr. MacKay. I cannot accede to such submission.
The question is whether the appellant had discharged Mr. MacKay during the
trial and not whether he had re-retained him to present the appeal and the
paragraph of the affidavit which I have quoted goes no further than to say that
Mr. MacKay had advised that there were sufficient grounds for appeal and
that the appellant presumed an appeal would be taken on his behalf. Even if one
could read into the paragraph a statement that Mr. MacKay had been
retained to conduct that appeal but had failed to do so, and Mr. MacKay’s
failure to file an appeal would indicate he did not so understand those
instructions, then it is more than possible that the appellant would consider
that the person best able to act for him on the appeal was the counsel who had
appeared at the trial and who would be familiar with the situation in reference
to the other grounds of appeal as he had been present when those grounds of appeal
arose during the trial despite the fact that he was present only on the order
of the learned trial judge and against the plain words of his client who had
sought to discharge him.

The evidence may be taken to indicate that the
reason that the accused sought to discharge his counsel was that he desired a
postponement of the trial although the evidence which I have quoted, and which
was the only evidence on the subject, merely leaves that to be conjecture and
it might well be that the accused had other serious disagreement with his
counsel. It is true that it was perfectly within the discretion of the learned
trial judge to refuse to permit any postponement of a trial which already had
gone a full day, for which the jury had already been chosen and sworn, and
where counsel had submitted and obtained rulings on two different applications.
The refusal to permit postponement, however, is one thing and is a decision
quite within the discretion of the learned trial judge, a discretion which will
not be interfered

[Page 268]

with at trial unless it was reached without
regard for proper principles. The refusal to permit any litigant to discharge
his counsel whether during the course of a proceeding in Court or on another
occasion is a very different matter. With respect, I agree with Brooke J. when
he said:

In any event, I think it is fundamental in
our law that the accused man has this right.

Keith J., in Regina v. Mulligan[6], put the matter succinctly when he said:

The case before me raises one of
considerable difficulty inasmuch as the courts over many cases and many years
have reiterated the right of an accused to be represented by counsel of his own
choice.

In Regina v. Barnes[7], Parker L.C.J. said at p. 107:

However, the matter does not rest there,
because in the result the appellant was forced to continue with counsel in whom
he had lost confidence, and counsel who himself felt that it was in the
appellant’s best interests that he should no longer continue to act. It is
clear that in those circumstances counsel would be gravely handicapped in
conducting the defence, especially before a judge who had expressed his strong
view as to the appellant’s guilt, and as to the waste of time involved in
fighting the case.

The latter elements have no application to the
present appeal.

For these reasons, I have come to the conclusion
that I agree with the unanimous views of the members of the Court of Appeal
that the refusal to permit an accused man to discharge his counsel was a
serious error in law and I agree with the view expressed by Brooke J.A. at the
close of the argument and Kelly J.A. in his later written reasons that there
can be no doubt this accused did attempt during the trial to discharge his
counsel and was prevented from doing so by the ruling of the learned trial
judge. I, therefore, am of the opinion that only one question remains, that is,
whether such a fault at trial may be corrected under the provisions of s.

[Page 269]

592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code as
it was then known.

In Regina v. Barnes, supra, the learned
Chief Justice Parker considered the application of a like section in the
United Kingdom statute, the Criminal Appeal Act of 1968. That provision
read:

Provided that the court may,
notwithstanding that they are of the opinion that the point raised in the
appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if they
consider that no miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

And at p. 107-8 said:

Having said that, the Court has anxiously
considered whether to apply the proviso on the basis that it is difficult to
think that the result of the trial would have been any different had counsel
not suffered from these added difficulties. Very frankly, counsel for the
prosecution expressed doubts as to the propriety of applying the proviso in
such a case as this, and the Court shares his doubts. There are cases, of which
this is one, in which the principles involved are more important than the case
itself.

The appeal was quashed.

A detailed reference to the section in the Criminal
Code is of considerable importance. By its words, it is limited in its
application to cases in which any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii)
of the same section might be applied in deciding in favour of the
appellant. Subparagraph (a)(ii) reads:

the judgment of the trial court should be
set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law,

In my view, the action of the learned trial
judge in this case was not a wrong decision on a question of law but was rather
an action within subparagraph (iii) of the same subsection (a),
i.e., “on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice”.

As was noted by Brooke J.A. in his oral reasons
for judgment, the course taken by the learned trial judge not only goes to the
accused’s right to make full answer and defence but also to the accused’s
fundamental right to the conduct of his own trial. A breach of the accused’s
right to make full answer and defence

[Page 270]

and of his fundamental right to the conduct of
his own trial is a miscarriage of justice and not a mere error in law, and
therefore s. 592(1)(b)(iii) cannot be applied because it is only
applicable to errors in law when no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice has occurred. Moreover even if the subsection could be
applied, I am unable to understand how an appellate court could say that no
substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred. Had the accused been permitted
to act for himself, having discharged his counsel, or to have obtained the
services of some other counsel who would proceed with the trial immediately,
not requiring a postponement, no one could tell what the course of the trial
might have been. It might well have been that the accused without the aid of
Mr. MacKay’s advice or with the advice of some other counsel would have
determined that he should not give evidence in his own defence and subject
himself to a searching cross-examination and, therefore, the result of a trial
which would have been carried on in such a different fashion can only be
conjecture.

As I summarized the series of cases in this
Court upon that section in Colpitts v. The Queen[8] I adopted the test:

The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the
Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable
men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

I am of the opinion that the Crown cannot
discharge that onus when we are called upon to conjecture the course of a trial
if the accused had represented himself, as he was entitled to do, or had
obtained other counsel to replace the counsel he had discharged.

I, therefore, would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and direct a new trial.

[Page 271]

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—I agree with my
brother Spence, both as to his analysis of the facts, arising under the portion
of the transcript reproduced in his reasons and in those of my brother Judson,
and as to the application of the “harmless error” proviso of the then s.592(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code. There are two points that I wish to take, more by
way of emphasis than by addition to what has been set out in the reasons of my
brothers Spence and Judson.

First, it is not doubted that we are entitled to
look at the second set of reasons delivered by Kelly J.A. in the Ontario Court
of Appeal when they were before us as part of the record on appeal. Of course,
the order in appeal was not affected by them; but in my consideration of
whether that order was a proper one in this case, I find the second set of
reasons delivered by Kelly J.A. more compelling than the first. It is
shibboleth only that an appeal is from the order and not from the reasons; the
latter, where they exist, illumine the order. Kelly J.A. is not alone in having
second thoughts about a matter in appeal; they are endemic in the judicial
office. Although it is rare to have them available (along with the first
thoughts) in the same case, an illustration is provided by the reasons of
Kerwin J. in Boucher v. The King[9] where,
upon application of the accused, a rehearing took place and that judge modified
his previous position. The former Chief Justice of this Court exhibited this
kind of courage in Regina v. Drybones[10],
when he receded from a position that he took as Cartwright J. In Robertson
and Rosetanni v. The Queen[11].

The second point I take has to do with the
dilemma posed by an accused’s right to be represented by a counsel of his
choice and the effect on the orderly conduct of a trial if he

[Page 272]

exercises that right irresponsibly after his
trial has begun. In the present case, the trial judge either saw no such
dilemma or, if he did, made no attempt to explore the situation in order to
determine whether or how the dilemma could be resolved. In my opinion, it was
his duty to consider the request of the accused even if in the result the
accused might have to conduct his own defence. I do not suggest that an accused
has an absolute right to interrupt and delay a trial by a belated desire to be
represented by another counsel; but neither has a trial judge an absolute right
to force an accused to continue with his counsel irrespective of circumstances
that, if considered, would reasonably entitle him to discharge that counsel,
albeit at the risk of carrying on alone!

In my view, the trial judge dealt with the issue
in too peremptory a manner, and in consequence, erred in a material matter going
to the rights of an accused person.

Like my brother Spence, I would allow the
appeal, quash the conviction and order a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Statements—Admissibility—Stolen goods—Recent
possession—Explanation in written statement made by co-accused two hours after
arrest—Crown not tendering statement but relying on doctrine of recent
possession—Co-accused not testifying—Statement properly excluded.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1],
quashing the respondent’s conviction for possession of stolen goods and
directing a new trial. The respondent was jointly charged with one Patrick
Benedict Graham and the facts of the present appeal appear in the Queen v.
Graham, ante page 206. Appeal allowed and conviction restored.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

J.H. Cram, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Hall
and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—The respondent and Patrick Benedict
Graham were charged jointly with being in possession of a quantity of jewellery
of a value in excess of $50 knowing that it was obtained by the commission of
an indictable offence. Both accused were convicted at trial and the appeals by
the Crown from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia quashing
these convictions were heard successively in this Court, leave to appeal in
both cases having been granted on the following question:

[Page 234]

Did the learned Judges of the Court of
Appeal err in holding that a written statement of the Respondent Graham ought
to have been adduced in evidence in view of the circumstance that the Crown
relied on the presumption flowing from possession by the Respondent of goods
recently stolen?

It was contended on behalf of Miss McKenzie that
the written statement made by Graham was in all respects consistent with her
testimony and that if it had been tendered to the jury it would undoubtedly
have strengthened her evidence, so that she was unfairly prejudiced by the
non-admission of the statement before the jury. In the course of his reasons
for judgment in the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Bull dealt with this
submission as follows:

But if Graham’s explanatory statement had
been before the jury, as it should have been, the jury might well have found
(because of the consistency of her sworn story with that statement made after
arrest by Graham ten months earlier, having regard to the testimony of the
Crown witness Mendelman) enough to conclude that her story might reasonably be
true. As it was, the jury merely had Mendelman’s evidence as to the authority
given to Graham, but substantially nothing from the latter (whether by
testimony or admissions) to indicate that he had acted on that authority. It
seems to me that Graham’s written statement which the jury did not have before
them, was, in the unusual circumstances of this case, almost as important to
the appellant McKenzie as it was to the appellant Graham.

For the reasons which I have given in the case
of Graham[2], I am
of opinion that his statement was properly excluded from the evidence at the
joint trial, but other grounds for quashing her conviction were raised on
behalf of the present respondent in the argument before us.

The initial submission made on behalf of the
respondent is that this Court did not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal
under s. 621(1)(b) of

[Page 235]

the Criminal Code because the ruling as
to the inadmissibility of Graham’s statement did not involve a question of law
alone in that it was based on the particular circumstances in which it was
made.

As to this submission, it is to be observed that
the question of law upon which leave was granted in this case is concerned with
whether when the Crown is relying on the presumption of guilt arising from the
unexplained possession of stolen goods, it is required to adduce evidence of a
self-serving statement made by the accused more than two hours after the goods
were discovered, and whether such a statement can be introduced by cross‑examination
of the party to whom it was made.

Graham did not testity in this case but the
statement which he made, upon the goods being discovered in his possession, was
duly admitted and there is no dispute about the fact that he offered no further
explanation until making his written statement. It is thus clear that the
question of law upon which leave to appeal was granted does not involve any disputed
issue of fact.

It was also contended on behalf of this
respondent as it had been in the Court below, that even if it were found that
Graham’s statement was properly excluded, she was nevertheless entitled to
succeed in her appeal on the ground that the trial judge erred in commenting
adversely as to the credibility of that part of her evidence in which she
stated that she had learned about the whereabouts of the stolen jewellery from
a person who told her that the location of the jewellery in Vancouver had been
reported in the newspapers. The portion of the charge of the learned trial
judge to which objection was taken in this regard is the following comment
which he made concerning the respondent’s evidence:

In cross-examination she said that it was Friday
July 18th when she and Graham went downtown and this

[Page 236]

is ‘when I learned definitely that the
jewellery was in Vancouver and this was because of a Calgary newspaper
clipping.’ Well you may examine that with some care. It could be you may as a
result of your knowledge of life think it rather strange for a newspaper
clipping to be stating where stolen jewellery is. Generally speaking the police
are looking for stolen jewellery. It is not likely that any information coming
from the police would be given to the Calgary Herald or Calgary newspapers to
be published as to the location of stolen jewellery.

In the course of her evidence Miss McKenzie had
stated that she had been told by telephone of a newspaper article stating that
the police believed that the jewellery was on its way to Vancouver and it
appears that there was in fact an item published in the Calgary Herald three
days after the respondent arrived in Vancouver to the effect that the stolen
goods had “been shipped off to Vancouver for distribution through the black
market”.

In my opinion the statements made in the
last-quoted excerpt from the trial judge’s charge are directed exclusively to
the respondent’s evidence as to the source of her information that the goods
were in Vancouver and they are not calculated to reflect on any other part of
her evidence so that they do not affect the central question of her guilt or
innocence which depended entirely upon whether or not the jury accepted her
explanation of the fact that she was found to be in possession of goods which
she knew to have been recently stolen.

Miss McKenzie’s story was that the stolen goods
had been obtained by her from a man, who also knew them to have been stolen, on
the understanding that he would receive $1,000 of Mr. Mendelman’s money
when the goods were returned to Mendelman. The story of her girl friend, Linda
Petrus, who had accompanied her to Vancouver, was a very different one and was
to the effect that on the night of his arrival in Vancouver, Patrick Graham
sent the two young women out to the airport to pick up a suitcase which was
later found to contain the stolen

[Page 237]

goods, and further that Miss McKenzie had later
tried to sell the stolen jewellery in Vancouver but could get no offers because
it was “too hot”.

The portion of the charge to which objection is
now taken has no bearing on the wide divergence between these two stories.

All this evidence was before the jury and it
cannot, in my opinion, be suggested that they were not justified in bringing in
the guilty verdict which they did.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal
and restore the conviction entered at trial.

SPENCE J.—For the reasons which I have given in
the case of The Queen v. Patrick Benedict Graham[3] I am of the opinion that Graham’s statement
was properly excluded from his evidence at the joint trial. Therefore, this
respondent Jeanine McKenzie can have no basis for alleging that such statement
should have been available in aid of her defence.

I concur in the reasons given by Mr. Justice
Ritchie for refusal to accept the other grounds of appeal advanced by this
respondent in her appeal to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia with which
that Court did not have to deal.

I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction.

LASKIN J.—For the reasons I have given in the
appeal of Patrick Benedict Graham[4], a co‑accused
of the appellant Jeanine McKenzie, with whom he was jointly tried, his written
statement of explanation was not admissible to aid her any more than it was
admissible to aid him. On the other matters urged before this Court, I am in
agreement with my brother Ritchie and would, accordingly, allow the appeal

[Page 238]

and restore the conviction.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Statements—Admissibility—Stolen goods—Recent
possession—Explanation in written statement made two hours after arrest—Crown
not tendering statement—Accused not testifying—Statement properly excluded.

The respondent was charged and tried jointly
with one McKenzie with having possession of a quantity of jewellry of a value
in excess of fifty dollars knowing that it was obtained by the commission of an
indictable offence. The evidence disclosed that the respondent and his co‑accused
were found together by the police in a hotel room where an attaché case
containing jewellry recently stolen was found behind a chesterfield. The key to
the attaché case was in the co-accused’s possession and when it was found, the
respondent at once said “I have never seen it before in my life”. The
respondent and his co-accused were both then arrested and as they were leaving
the hotel the respondent told the police officer that he wished to telephone a lawyer
and that he might then have something further to tell about the matter.
Approximately two hours later the same police officer received a message from
the respondent to the effect that he wanted to speak to him. Two police
officers came to the jail where the respondent, in their presence, wrote out a
statement. The substance of that statement was introduced in evidence before
the jury from other sources. In the cross‑examination of one of the
officers, he testified that a written statement had been made to him by the
respondent and that he had read it over, but upon being asked as to the
contents of the statement, Crown counsel objected to its admissibility. The
trial judge ruled that it was inadmissible. Both accused were found guilty by
the jury. The Court of appeal quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.
The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court on the question as to
whether the written statement should have been adduced in evidence in view of
the circumstance that the Crown relied on the presumption flowing from
possession by the respondent of goods recently stolen.

[Page 207]

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ: The written statement was properly excluded. The
statement was inadmissible under the general rule that self-serving statements
cannot be introduced on the cross-examination of third parties because they
cannot themselves be tested by cross-examination of the accused person who made
them, and their introduction in such a manner deprives the jury of the benefit
of appraising his credibility from observing his demeanor. Explanatory
statements made by an accused upon his first being found in possession
constitute a part of the res gestae and are necessarily admissible in
any description of the circumstance under which the crime was committed.
However, the respondent did not “adduce further evidence by way of explanation”
and his written statement was not made contemporaneously with the discovery but
rather after ample time had elapsed for reflection.

Per Hall and
Laskin JJ: If the case is one where the accused has made a statement explaining
his recent possession, Crown counsel may have the statement go in as part of
the Crown’s case, thus avoiding any ruling on contemporaneity, or he may decide
not to put in the statement and seek to prove his case without the benefit of
any inference from the fact of recent possession. On the other hand, he may
decide not to put in the statement, intending to seek the benefit of the
inference arising upon proof of unexplained recent possession. But if he
proposes to follow this course, the defence must be informed that the statement
was made to enable it to decide whether to seek to adduce it on
cross-examination (subject to a ruling on contemporaneity), or to bring it in
during the examination of the accused (if he decides to testify) to show
consistency. The trial judge was not wrong in refusing to allow the statement
to be brought out in cross-examination having regard to the fact that the
accused made an immediate oral statement and then indicated he might have
something further to say after he saw his lawyer.

Per Spence J:
If the Crown is to rely on the presumption arising from recent possession then,

[Page 208]

under the particular circumstances here, it
was the duty of the Crown to prove the statement made only two hours after his
arrest by the accused and leave it to the jury to find whether that statement
could reasonably have been true. Otherwise, the accused is driven to give
testimony in his own defence. In this case, the Crown was not required to rely
upon any doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods in order to prove its
case and did not so rely. Therefore, the Crown was not required to produce any
explanation and the attempt to adduce such explanation in the cross-examination
of the constable was an attempt by the defence to prove a defence without the
production of evidence from the accused. The trial judge was therefore correct
in his ruling that the written statement could not be produced.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of appeal for British
Columbia[1],
quashing the respondent’s conviction for possession of stolen goods. Appeal
allowed.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
appellant.

B.A. Crane, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie, and
Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal by the Crown,
brought with leave of this Court pursuant to s. 621(1)(b) of the Criminal
Code, (formerly 598(1)(b)) from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia quashing the conviction of the respondent for possession of
stolen goods and directing a new trial.

The respondent was charged and tried jointly
with one Jeanine McKenzie with having possession of a quantity of jewellery of
a value in excess of $50 knowing that it was obtained by the commission of an
indictable offence, and upon trial before His Honour Judge Schultz sitting with
a jury, both were found guilty.

[Page 209]

The evidence disclosed that the respondent and
his co-accused, Miss McKenzie, were found together by the police in a hotel
room where an attaché case containing jewellery recently stolen from a shop in
Calgary was found behind a chesterfield. The key to the attaché case was in
Miss McKenzie’s possession and when it was found, the respondent at once said
“I have never seen it before in my life.” The respondent and Miss McKenzie were
both then arrested and as they were leaving the hotel the respondent told the
police officer that he wished to telephone a certain lawyer and that if he
could get in touch with him he might then have something further to tell about
the matter. The Officer replied that they were still conducting the
investigation and as soon as possible they would do what they could for him in
that regard. Approximately two hours later the same police officer received a
message from the respondent to the effect that he wanted to speak to him, and a
short time later two police officers came to the jail where the respondent, in
their presence, wrote out a statement which is reproduced in full in the
reasons for judgment of Bull J.A. in the Court of Appeal and which reads as
follows:

I have a friend in Calgary, Morris
Mendelman, who owns and operates Switzer’s Jewellers. His store was broken into
and some jewellery was stolen. He contacted me and asked me if I could ask
around and see if I could find it for him, as he was not covered by insurance.
He said to offer a reward of one thousand dollars for the return of the
jewellery. I found out through asking around, that the jewellery was possibly
in Vancouver. I had to come to Vancouver for other personal business anyhow.
While I was here I contacted Jean McKenzie who knew of someone who she called
Joe Fields or Shields that knew of some stolen jewellery. I told her I wanted
to do everything through a lawyer and didn’t want to see or touch or have
anything to do with any jewellery in any event that I might come in contact
with jewellery which was stolen, other than the articles which belonged to
Mr. Mendelman. I was going to contact Mr. Nick Mussallem (I believe
that’s a lawyer in the City of Vancouver) this morning, and make arrangements
to have the jewellery taken to his office, if after phoning Mr. Mendelman
in Calgary it proved to be his property, I would have arranged to have it sent
back to him. Miss McKenzie was acting as an agent in my

[Page 210]

behalf and I was acting as an agent for
Mr. Mendelman, the owner of the jewellery. If the jewellery and the sachel
was not the jewellery belonging to Mr. Mendelman, I state that neither of
us would have accepted it. We were only interested in Mr. Mendelman
getting back his merchandise and that’s all. Mr. Mendelman is a personal
friend of mine for many years and a member of the club I operate in Calgary. I
asked for a lawyer when the jewellery was discovered in the hotel and we were
charged and offered to make up a statement at that time. I still—and offered to
make this statement at that time. I still have not seen a lawyer, but am making
a voluntary statement now. The first time I have seen the officers since my
arrest. I had no knowledge that Jean McKenzie had the merchandise in the hotel
room while I was there, and if it is not the merchandise belonging to
Mr. Mendelman I would not have anything to do with it. When the Police
found the sachel Miss McKenzie said that I did not know it was in the room. It
was not my room, I stayed there with McKenzie for the night. This is a
voluntary statement.

Mr. Mendelman, who gave evidence for the
Crown, testified that he had indeed asked the respondent to try and get the
jewellery back because he had no insurance and that he had also offered him
$1,000 if he could return it and Graham’s statement is also borne out by the
evidence given at the trial by his co-accused. It is thus clear that the
substance of Graham’s statement was introduced in evidence before the jury from
other sources, but it is obvious that they did not place any faith in it as a
defence to the crime with which he was charged.

The first reference to this statement was in the
cross-examination of Detective Lifton when he testified that a written
statement had been made to him by the respondent and that he had read it over,
but upon being asked as to the contents of the statement, Crown counsel
objected to its admissibility and the learned trial judge ruled that it was
inadmissible.

[Page 211]

The Court of Appeal found the circumstances of
the present case to be governed by the case of Reg. v. Hodd[2] and therefore held that the learned
trial judge was in error in ruling that the written statement made by the
respondent more than two hours after he had been found in possession of the
stolen property was inadmissible. It is this determination by the Court of
Appeal which is the subject of the sole question upon which leave to appeal was
granted to this Court, namely:

Did the learned Judges of the Court of
Appeal err in holding that a written statement of the Respondent Graham ought
to have been adduced in evidence in view of the circumstance that the Crown
relied on the presumption flowing from possession by the Respondent of goods
recently stolen?

In the present case the respondent did not give
evidence and generally speaking, self-serving statements of accused persons
cannot be introduced by means of cross-examination of others, but in accepting Reg.
v. Hodd as a binding authority, the Court of Appeal adopted the view that
in a case where the Crown relies on the presumption of guilt flowing from the
possession of recently stolen goods, it is fixed with the burden of proving
either that the accused made no explanation or if he did that it was one that
could not reasonably be true. It accordingly becomes necessary to examine the
nature and effect of the presumption referred to.

The presumption flowing from the possession of goods
recently stolen has been considered in this Court in Richler v. The King[3], Ungaro v. The King[4], and Graham v. The Queen[5], per Judson J. at 653, all of which
appear to approve the principle as it was stated by Lord Reading speaking on
behalf of five members of the

 [Page 212]

Court of Criminal Appeal in England in the Schama
case[6], where
he said:

Where the prisoner is charged with
receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the
possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the
jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any
reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is
given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence whether
the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury think that the
explanation may reasonably be true, though they are not convinced that it is
true, the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal, because the Crown has not
discharged the onus of proof imposed upon it of satisfying the jury
beyond reasonable doubt of the prisoner’s guilt. That onus never
changes, it always rests on the prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not
pronouncing new law, but is merely re-stating it, and it is hoped that this
re-statement may be of assistance to those who preside at the trial of such
cases.

In commenting on the Schama case, which
is also reported in 79 J.P. Rep. at page 184 and 59 Solicitors’ Journal at 288,
Lord Goddard C.J. stated the rule in the following terms in Rex v. Booth[7]:

In the case of receiving stolen goods, the
prosecution may discharge the onus of showing that the prisoner was in
possession of property recently stolen, and, in the absence of any explanation
given by the prisoner, the jury are entitled, on that evidence alone, to
convict. If, however, the prisoner gives in evidence a story which leaves the
jury in doubt, that is to say, creates a doubt in their minds whether he
received the goods feloniously, they should acquit.

In the Ungaro case, supra, after
reviewing the earlier cases, Mr. Justice Estey concluded, at page 436 that
when these authorities refer to the failure of the accused to explain recent
possession

… they mean no more than that the evidence
of recent possession unexplained raises a prima facie case upon which,
if the accused does not adduce

[Page 213]

further evidence by way of explanation, the
jury may, not must, find the accused guilty.

There is nothing in any of these authorities to
suggest that in relying upon the presumption of guilt flowing from possession
of recently stolen goods, the Crown has the burden of proving that no
explanation has been given by the accused at any time prior to his trial, or
that if such an explanation has been given, it could not reasonably be true. On
the contrary, in all the cases to which I have referred, except the case of
Hodd, the accused had given an explanation on oath at the trial, and this was
also true of the case of Rex v. Hagen, alias Smith[8], to which reference was made in the Hodd
case.

In cases such as that of Schama where the
accused has given an unsworn explanation before the trial and a later
explanation from the witness box in the presence of the jury, I think, with all
respect for those who take a different view, that when the Court of Appeal
refers to the result “if the jury think that the explanation may reasonably be
true” they are to be taken to be referring to the sworn explanation which the
jury has heard and seen delivered in the court rather than any unsworn
statement made before the trial.

There may, of course, be cases in which the
prosecution elects to use a declaration made by an accused out of court as a
part of the Crown case and the declaration then becomes evidence for the
prisoner as well as against him (see The King v. Hughes[9]). If in such a case the declaration
is capable of being construed as an explanation which might reasonably be true,
the accused is, of course, entitled to all the advantages of it.

In the present case the respondent’s verbal
statement made when the attaché case was found, that he had never seen it
before in his life, being one which was immediately connect-

[Page 214]

ed with the initial discovery of the stolen
goods, was properly admitted in evidence. Explanatory statements made by an
accused upon his first being found “in possession” constitute a part of the res
gestae and are necessarily admissible in any description of the
circumstances under which the crime was committed, but Graham did not “adduce
further evidence by way of explanation” and his written statement was not made
contemporaneously with the discovery but rather after ample time had elapsed
for reflection. In my view if this statement were to be admitted it would mean
that any person accused of receiving stolen goods could, after due
consideration, devise an explanation which might easily be true for the goods
having been found in his possession and could thus avoid the necessity of
presenting himself as a witness and be afforded the full benefit of his
explanation without being subjected to cross-examination. Such an explanation
is, in my view, inadmissible under the general rule in criminal cases that
self-serving statements made by an accused cannot be introduced on the
cross-examination of third parties because they cannot themselves be tested by
cross‑examination of the accused person who made them, and their
introduction in such manner deprives the jury of the benefit of appraising his
credibility from observing his demeanour.

Unlike the Court of Appeal, we are not bound by
the decision in Reg. v. Hodd, supra, and I have concluded that the
Judges of the Court of Appeal were wrong in holding that the written statement
made by Graham ought to have been adduced in evidence.

I would accordingly allow this appeal and
restore the conviction entered at trial.

The judgment of Hall and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Spence for allowing this appeal and for
restoring the conviction at trial. Although I agree with

[Page 215]

the result they have reached under their
respective treatments of the issues, my appreciation of the so-called doctrine
of recent possession impels me to write separately in concurrence.

The use of the term “presumption”, which has
been associated with the doctrine, is too broad, and the word which properly
ought to be substituted is “inference”. In brief, where unexplained recent
possession and that the goods were stolen are established by the Crown in a
prosecution for possessing stolen goods, it is proper to instruct the jury or,
if none, it is proper for the trial judge to proceed on the footing that an
inference of guilty knowledge, upon which, failing other evidence to the
contrary, a conviction can rest, may (but, not must) be drawn against the
accused.

Although unexplained recent possession will
support such an inference, two separate questions of law may first have to be
disposed of by the trial judge in favour of the prosecution. These involve (1)
the recency of the possession and (2) the contemporaneity of the explanation,
if any. No adverse inference can be made from the fact that an accused is found
in possession without explanation unless the possession was recent, and this
may involve a question of law for the presiding judge according to whether
there is any evidence upon which a finding thereon can be made. Second, if the
accused has made a pre-trial statement in explanation of his recent possession,
it is for the trial judge to decide as a question of law whether that statement
has contemporaneity; and if so, no adverse inference of guilty knowledge is
open if the trier of fact, upon instruction to that effect, should find that
the explanation is one that may reasonably be true.

[Page 216]

The second question of law may arise at the
point where a Crown witness is cross-examined and it is sought to ask him about
any explanation made by the accused which that witness or another did not
disclose in chief. If the trial judge rules that the statement in explanation
was sufficiently contemporaneous, it becomes admissible, and will blunt any
inference of guilty knowledge if it is found as a fact that the explanation was
one that might reasonably be true. No conviction can in such a case be rested
on the doctrine of recent possession alone. If the ruling is against
admissiblity, because the explanation was made beyond the time when it would be
reasonable to expect the person found in possession to give an innocent account
for it, the Crown may rely on the inference, provided the recency of the
possession is established.

The accused may, of course, give evidence at his
trial, and if an explanation of his recent possession is part of his testimony,
it simply goes into the record as part of his defence referable to the burden
on the Crown to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If he had made a
pre-trial explanation, it may be brought out in his examination but only to
show the consistency of his trial evidence, and for no other purpose.

The course of Crown counsel in this branch of
the law is, in my opinion, clear if the case is one where the accused has made
a statement explaining his recent possession. He may have the statement go in
as part of the Crown’s case, thus avoiding any ruling on what I have called
contemporaneity; and any inference of guilty knowledge from the fact of recent
possession will then depend, other evidence aside, on whether the jury or other
trier of fact finds that the statement is one that could not reasonably be
true. He may decide not to put in the statement and seek to prove his case
without the benefit of any inference from the fact of recent possession, so
informing the trial judge. On the

[Page 217]

other hand, he may decide not to put in the
statement, intending to seek the benefit of the inference arising upon proof of
unexplained recent possession, because of his view that the statement would be
inadmissible; but I think that if he proposes to follow this course, the
defence, if not aware of the statement, must be informed that it was made to
enable it to decide whether to seek to adduce it on cross-examination (subject
to a ruling on contemporaneity), or to bring it in during the examination of
the accused (if he decides to testify) to show consistency: see Welstead v.
Brown[10]. If
the accused testifies, the Crown may cross-examine on any pre-trial statement
of explanation to show inconsistency as going to the credibility of the
accused.

Perhaps only a moral dilemma arises where Crown
counsel deliberately refuses to put in an explanatory statement of the accused
which was clearly contemporaneous with his being found in recent possession. I
would myself give Crown counsel the benefit of the doubt on its contemporaneity
and consequent admissibility, so long as there was the protective obligation to
bring it to the attention of the defence to enable counsel for the accused to
deal with it in cross-examination or otherwise, as already indicated. I would
to this extent qualify what was said in Regina v. Hodd[11], with which I otherwise agree.

The inference of guilty knowledge which may be
made upon proof of unexplained recent possession ought not to be magnified as
some

[Page 218]

uniquity which necessarily stands out above all
other evidence in the case. The misuse, in my opinion, of the term
“presumption” in this connection may lead to injustice because of its strong
connotation. Cross-examination of Crown witnesses and examination in chief of
defence witnesses may yield testimony that, if believed, supports a contrary
inference, and the Crown’s burden of proof remains, as always, the resolutive
element.

What is important in this area of the law is to
distinguish between an out-of-court statement of explanation given by the
accused and an explanation which he gives as a witness at his trial. There is
no basis for reliance by the Crown upon the inference of guilty knowledge if
either in its own case in chief or in cross-examination of its witnesses an
out-of-court statement of the accused has been put into the record and it
carries an explanation of his recent possession which may reasonably be true.
This is not then a question of imposing any burden upon the Crown to show at
the trial that no explanation was given prior to trial. If the explanation has
been adduced as aforesaid, being found to be admissible, then, of course, the
issue whether it may reasonably be true must arise and be decided against the
accused if the Crown is to have the support of the inference of guilty
knowledge in meeting its traditional burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
This is what this Court said in Richler v. The King[12].

I do not find it necessary to review all the
facts; they are canvassed in the reasons of my brothers Ritchie and Spence. My
observations on them will be limited to what occurred at the trial with respect
to the pre-trial statements, one oral and the second written, made by the

[Page 219]

accused. The oral statement made almost
immediately by the accused when he was arrested with his co-accused, after the
stolen jewellery was found in the hotel room that they occupied, was admitted
through a Crown witness, but it was not contended that it provided any
explanation of their possession. The written statement, made by the accused
some two hours later at the police station, and which is at the core of this
appeal, was put in evidence at the preliminary hearing, but Crown counsel
decided not to use it at the trial and so advised defence counsel at the
beginning of the trial.

The latter sought to cross-examine the Crown
witness, a police officer, to whom the accused gave the statement in order to
establish that a statement in writing was given and to have its contents
revealed. Before ruling on its admissibility the trial judge asked Crown
counsel whether the prosecution intended to rely upon the doctrine of recent
possession. The reply was in the affirmative. There was then an adjournment to
give counsel for the Crown and for the accused an opportunity to look into the
law. When the hearing resumed Crown counsel returned to the question put by the
trial judge and, as I read the record, sought to have the best of both worlds.
On the one hand, he said that if the evidence was in the record to support the
doctrine it was not for him to tell the jury not to pay any attention to it;
“we can say it’s a minor part of the case”. On the other hand, he told the
trial judge that there was evidence of guilty knowledge in this case and “so
the Crown doesn’t have to rely on [the doctrine of recent possession] but it’s
simply there”.

What is important for me in this matter is that
the trial judge heard argument and then ruled

[Page 220]

that the contents of the written statement could
not be brought out by the defence in cross‑examination. In charging the
jury he told them that the Crown was relying on the doctrine of recent
possession, and no objection was made to this feature of the charge by either
the Crown or the defence. The Court of Appeal of British Columbia treated the
issue of the admissibility of the written statement as governed by the Hodd case.
On my view, as I have put it in these reasons, the issue on the facts herein
was whether the trial judge’s refusal to allow the statement to be brought out
in cross-examination was a proper one.

In the Hodd case, the statement was made
“at the earliest possible moment to the arresting officer”. That is not this
case. Although the matter is a close one, I cannot say that the trial judge was
wrong in the view that he took, having regard to the fact that the accused made
an immediate oral statement and then indicated he might have something further
to say after he saw his lawyer. It follows that since there was no error in the
way the trial judge dealt with the written statement offered by the accused,
and no other fatal defects occurred, the judgment of the British Columbia Court
of Appeal must be set aside and the conviction restored.

SPENCE J.—I have read the reasons for judgment
delivered upon this appeal by my brother Ritchie and I am ready to accept the
statement of facts as set out therein with some additional facts to which I
shall refer later in these reasons.

As did my brother Ritchie, I have come to the
conclusion that the appeal must be allowed and the conviction entered at trial
must be restored. However, I have come to that conclusion upon reasons which
differ markedly from those of my brother Ritchie and I feel it my duty to
outline those reasons. It will be seen that the whole issue in this appeal is
the application of the

[Page 221]

doctrine of recent possession to the charge of
being in possession of stolen goods and particularly whether the Crown is
required to prove as part of its case the explanation for the fact of
possession given by the accused man at the time of his arrest or shortly
thereafter. It is not my intention to be concerned with cases where such
explanation was given a very long time after the arrest of the accused person
and where quite evidently he had an opportunity to concoct a story.

I note here two matters: Firstly, the statement
given by the accused Graham in the particular case was given not later than at
1:15 p.m. following his arrest at about 11:00 a.m., a matter of some two hours
after his arrest, and, at the time of his arrest, he had indicated that if he
had an opportunity to see a certain solicitor then he would be ready to make a
statement. Secondly, the accused, of course, may give evidence at trial and at
trial give any explanation he deems fit as to his reasons for possession of the
stolen goods. That explanation given at trial, although given when there is
full opportunity to cross-examine the accused, is nevertheless given at a time
long after his arrest and when he has had opportunity to concoct a story and
when he has had an opportunity to obtain the aid of others in such concoction.

It is my view the problem must be solved by
considering exactly what is the doctrine of recent possession. As did my
brother Ritchie, I turn to the authoritative statement made by Lord Reading in Schama’s
case[13], where
he said at p. 49:

Where the prisoner is charged with
receiving recently stolen property, when the prosecution has proved the
possession by the prisoner, and that the goods had been recently stolen, the
jury should be told that they may, not that they must, in the absence of any
reasonable explanation, find the prisoner guilty. But if an explanation is
given which may be true, it is for the jury to say on the whole evidence
whether the accused is guilty or not; that is to say, if the jury

[Page 222]

think that the explanation may reasonably
be true, though they are not convinced that it is true, the prisoner is entitled
to an acquittal, because the Crown has not discharged the onus of proof
imposed upon it of satisfying the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the
prisoner’s guilt. That onus never changes, it always rests on the
prosecution. That is the law; the Court is not pronouncing new law, but is
merely restating it, and it is hoped that this re-statement may be of
assistance to those who preside at the trial of such cases.

(The italics are my own.)

That statement was adopted by Chief Justice Duff
for this Court in Richler v. The King[14]
and by Estey J. in Ungaro v. The King[15].

It is my view that Lord Reading in Schama, in
the portion which I have quoted above, put the presumption as being one which
arose on the absence of any reasonable explanation by the accused. There is not
one word in the reasons for judgment to indicate whether or not Schama gave
evidence in his own defence and very plainly the explanation to which Reading
L.C.J. referred was an explanation given to the police upon his arrest. In Richler,
it does not appear from the reasons for judgment whether the accused did or
did not give evidence in his own defence. The report of the Schama case
in vol. 79, J.P. Rep., at p. 184, does set out that the accused gave an
explanation both on arrest and in evidence at trial and a search of the records
in this court reveals that Richler gave evidence in his own defence. I find
considerable significance in the fact that although both accused gave evidence
in their own defence at their trials neither Lord Reading in the Schama case
nor Chief Justice Duff in the Richler case thought it was necessary to
so indicate and spoke only of “explanations” and not of evidence. In Ungaro,
although the accused did give evidence, there was deduced from the police
constable the statement given by the accused to

[Page 223]

the police constable at or shortly after the
time of his arrest.

Again, in Rex v. Booth[16], although Lord Goddard did use the
words, “If, however, the prisoner gives in evidence a story which leaves the
jury in doubt …”, the actual statement which the court quoted was a statement
made by the accused at the time of his arrest when he was asked to account for
possession of the stolen goods. In Lopatinsky v. The King[17], Estey J. said at p. 225:

Throughout the evidence of both Taylor and
Congdon there is no suggestion that any explanation was offered on the part of
the accused as to the circumstances under which he was in possession of these
tires which had been stolen but two or three days prior thereto.

The evidence of guilty knowledge in this as
in so many cases is not directly deposed to. The unexplained fact of recent
possession is evidence thereof.

Rex v. Schama, supra.

Taylor had been an R.C.A.F. investigator and
Congdon was the person in whose possession the goods were found.

In Rex v. Hagan, alias Smith[18], Rowlatt J., speaking for the
court, said at pp. 26-7:

… The prisoner’s explanation in such cases
is required not to rebut a presumption of guilt, but to prevent one arising. If
it is thought reasonable, there is no presumption and no onus on the
prisoner. The result is that the conviction is unsatisfactory, and the appeal
must be allowed.

The matter came to a head in Regina v. Hodd[19]. That was a charge of breaking and
entering and having in possession a certain coloured television set knowing
that it had been

[Page 224]

obtained by the commission in Canada of the
crime of theft. At the trial, the accused Hodd did not give evidence and the
Crown refused to put before the jury the explanation which he had given in
writing at the time of his arrest. Branca J.A., after having quoted from the Hagan
case, as I have quoted above, said:

Here, an account was given by the appellant
in relation to the stolen goods which the Crown alleged were in his possession.
At law, therefore, the presumption could not arise if the explanation was one
that might reasonably be true.

Continuing, Branca J.A. said:

In a case such as this the Crown may, it
appears to me, pursue either one of these courses as follows:

(a) lead evidence to prove that the appellant
was in possession of goods recently stolen and if there was no explanation
accounting for his possession, rely upon the presumption which arises because
of the lack of an account explaining his possession, or

(b) if there is an account given by the defendant
then the Crown may conceivably withhold the tendering of that evidence and
elect to prove each and every allegation of the charge beyond a reasonable
doubt without the aid of the presumption discussed, or

(c) lead evidence of all the facts, including
the account given by the accused, and thus leave it up to the jury to decide
the guilt or innocence of the person charged depending upon whether or not the
account given is one which might reasonably be true, despite the fact that the
jury is not convinced that it is true.

In my judgment the Crown cannot, where it
has knowledge that an accused has accounted for his possession of stolen goods,
refuse to tender the explanation given by the accused in evidence and then ask
the jury to assess the guilt of the accused upon the basis that the presumption
applies. That would not only be unfair, but would be against all fundamental
precepts of justice and contrary to the foundation upon which the presumption
of guilt rests, namely, that the accused has given no explanation or an
explanation which is not reasonably true.

[Page 225]

I concur with this statement of the law
applicable to the doctrine. The whole basis of the doctrine is that the guilt
of the accused may be presumed upon proof of (a) the fact that the goods were
stolen, (b) that the accused was found in possession of them shortly
thereafter, (c) that the accused did not give an explanation of his possession
or that if he did give it that explanation could not reasonably be true. With
respect, I concur with the view expressed by Bull J.A. in the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia in the present case when he said:

To my mind, it invokes strange reasoning to
say that it is proper for the prosecution to rely on presumptions arising from
the “unexplained possession” of recently stolen goods under the doctrine to fix
guilt on an accused, but at the same time refuse to give into evidence the very
explanation for that possession which had been given.

One case may be of some interest and, in my
view, supports my understanding of the effect of the presumption, that is R.
v. Frederick Barnes[20]. There,
the accused Barnes had been charged with being in possession of two different
kinds of stolen goods, one, a large quantity of tinned rhubarb and, two, an
electric drill. The evidence as to the possession of the stolen tins of rhubarb
was first dealt with and there it was proved as part of the Crown’s case that
the accused had made a statement with regard to those tins. At the close of the
case for the prosecution, the deputy chairman had ruled that there was not
sufficient identification of those tins to justify the case proceeding any
further and directed the jury, as a matter of law, to acquit the accused which
they did. Evidently then, the charge as to the possession of the stolen
electric drill was proceeded with and a police constable first gave evidence as
to finding that drill in the accused’s own workshop and that he had said, “A
mate of mine asked me to look after it for him”. As Humphreys J. described it,
much later in the case, it appeared that the appellant had made another
statement after he had been taken to the police station and charged and then
said, “I will tell you the name

[Page 226]

of the mate; it is a man named Clifford. That is
the man I got it from”. It does not appear from the case that the appellant,
the accused, ever gave evidence but Humphreys J., giving the judgment of the
Court, said at p. 147:

All that any man can do if, unfortunately
for himself, he is found, three months after it has been stolen, in possession
of some article, is to say where he got it, and if his story is consistent with
innocence, and is not proved to be untrue, he is entitled to be acquitted. If,
therefore, Clifford had not been called as a witness, it is quite plain that
the jury would have had to be told: “You cannot convict the prisoner; he says
he got it from a man named Clifford, and there is not a shred of evidence to
show that is not true, and if he got it from Clifford, why should not he think
he got it honestly?”

In short, there, the accused’s explanation made
not at the time of the arrest but subsequently in the police station, as in the
present case, was given to the jury as part of the Crown’s case and had the
case stopped there it was the opinion of Humphreys J. that the jury would have
had to have been instructed that they must acquit because the accused’s
explanation could reasonably have been true.

So in the present case, if the Crown is to rely
on the presumption arising from recent possession then I am of the opinion that
under the particular circumstances here it was the duty of the Crown to prove
the statement made only two hours after his arrest by the accused man and leave
it to the jury to find whether that statement could reasonably have been true.
Instead, the Crown chose to exclude the statement and was successful in doing
so before the learned trial judge. Under such circumstances, I am of the
opinion that the presumption due to recent possession did not arise.

I am strengthened in my opinion that if the
Crown is to rely upon the presumption arising from recent possession then it
must as part of

[Page 227]

its case either prove that there was no
explanation given by the accused or give that explanation so that the jury may
determine whether it could reasonably be true by consideration of the effect of
an opposite conclusion. If the Crown may rely upon the presumption by proving
simply the theft and the recent possession by the accused and leave to the
accused the task of giving in evidence himself the explanation which he gave at
or shortly after the time of his arrest then it has the result that the accused
is driven to give testimony in his own defence. I find that result unpalatable
for two reasons: firstly, it is, in my opinion, contra to the firmly
established principle in the administration of criminal law that the accused
need prove nothing and that each essential ingredient of the offence must be
proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt; secondly, it submits the accused
to an examination upon his previous record not in reference to the particular
offence charged but generally ranging over the whole history of his conduct
prior to the circumstances which resulted in his arrest on the present charge.
This course may be adopted by the Crown upon the slim argument that the Crown
is entitled to examine the credibility of the accused. Jurors must be warned
that they are only to consider evidence so adduced upon the question of the
accused’s credibility but the effect is inevitably so prejudicial to the
accused person that counsel for the accused will but rarely adduce the evidence
of his client if that client has a record for previous criminal convictions.

In England, the problem was dealt with long ago
in s. 1(f) of the Criminal Evidence Act of 1898, which reads
as follows:

1. (f) A person charged and called
as a witness in pursuance of this Act shall not be asked, and if asked shall
not be required to answer, any question tending to show that he has committed
or been convicted of or been charged with any offence other than that wherewith
he is then charged, or is of bad character, unless—

(i) the proof that he has committed or been
convicted of such other offence is admissible evidence

[Page 228]

to show that he is guilty of the offence
wherewith he is then charged; or

(ii) he has personally or by his advocate
asked questions of the witnesses for the prosecution with a view to establish
his own good character, or has given evidence of his good character, or the
nature or conduct of the defence is such as to involve imputations on the
character of the prosecutor or the witnesses for the prosecution; or

(iii) he has given evidence against any
other person charged with the same offence.

Unless and until a statutory provision of like
import comes into effect in Canada it would seem that the number of instances
in which an accused person, despite the principle that the accused need prove
nothing, must go into the box to establish a defence should be minimized.

There remains, however, the problem of whether
the Crown was compelled to rely in the present case upon the presumption of
recent possession. It would seem that the best place to determine the course
which the Crown intended to pursue in its prosecution is by consideration of
the testimony of the constable who adduced the evidence upon which the jury
found the two accused, this accused, Graham, and his co-accused, McKenzie, were
in possession of the recently stolen goods. I have read carefully the
examination-in-chief of Detective Lifton, the police officer who gave the
evidence upon which the jury concluded that the two accused were in possession
of the stolen goods. No place in that examination-in-chief did the Crown
counsel make any reference to a statement which had been made at the time of
his arrest or on any other occasion by the accused Graham or infer in any way
that the accused either had or had not made any explanation. Counsel for the
accused McKenzie first cross-examined Detective Lifton and after several short
questions which are not relevant upon this issue asked that the jury be
excluded so that he might submit to the court the question of the admissibility
of other evidence which he hoped to adduce. Counsel for the accused Graham then
sought, in the absence of the jury, permission to obtain from Detective Lifton
evidence as to a statement made by the accused Graham in the

[Page 229]

police headquarters something about two hours
after the arrest. This statement purported to be a complete explanation of the
reason why McKenzie had in her possession the recently stolen goods. The
statement was produced upon the preliminary hearing and it is recited in full
in the reasons of my brother Ritchie so that I need not repeat it here. After a
very extended argument, the court ruled that Detective Lifton could give in
evidence a verbal statement made by the accused when Lifton found the attaché
case hidden behind the chesterfield in which he said, “I have never seen that
before in my life”, and a further statement made by the accused Graham when he
was being conducted from the lobby of the hotel to the Detective’s automobile
to be driven to the police headquarters and which statement was that “If we
could get in contact with Mr. Nick Mussallem he may have something further
to tell us”. The court, however, refused leave to counsel for the accused to
obtain from Detective Lifton the long written statement to which I have made
reference above, although the learned trial judge did permit counsel for the
accused McKenzie to obtain from Detective Lifton in his cross-examination of
the officer in the presence of the jury the evidence that the accused had given
a statement without revealing the contents thereof.

In my view, the learned trial judge perceived
the exact issue for during the argument as to the defence’s right to obtain
from the police constable the evidence as to the contents of this long written
statement the learned trial judge asked counsel for the accused, “May I ask you
this, does the prosecution rely upon the doctrine of recent possession of
stolen goods in this case?”. Although the Crown counsel answered that question,
after some discussion, in the affirmative, some short time later, the Crown
counsel said:

Your Honour asked me whether the Crown
relies upon the doctrine of recent possession with respect to these two accused
and, to clarify our position, I think I should put it this way—this is the
position I take although I have not researched this: whether recent possession
is a fact or not in a case is a matter of law and it is not possible for the Crown
to say we

[Page 230]

do or don’t rely on it. It is there as
evidence and it’s all very well for me to say to Your Honour or perhaps even
say to the jury, it’s not necessary for our case, yet, Your Honour, it is
there, and I submit that the Crown cannot take a piece of the case and say, now
to the jury, don’t pay any attention to that because the Crown is not relying
on it; we can say it’s a minor part of the case. Now, in this particular case,
as far as that goes, I submit that the doctrine of recent possession goes to
the question of knowledge and there is other evidence of knowledge that the
goods were stolen on the part of Graham and McKenzie in this case, and so the
Crown doesn’t have to rely on it but it’s simply there.

I have come to the conclusion that the Crown did
not intend to rely upon any doctrine of recent possession but the Crown was of
the view that it was adducing evidence to prove (a) the theft, (b)
possession by the accused of the recently stolen goods, and (c) that the
accused knew those goods had been obtained by the commission of an offence
within Canada, and that any reliance upon the doctrine of recent possession was
a mere make‑weight in the Crown’s case. It is perhaps significant that
the learned trial judge, in his charge to the jury, did not say that the Crown
did rely on the doctrine of recent possession but rather said

Now, the prosecution is entitled to invoke
what is called in law the doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods.

The learned trial judge said, later in his charge:

If you the jury do not believe the
explanation of the accused, Graham, then the presumption arising from recent
possession of stolen goods is not rebutted and the jury may, not must, convict
the accused, Graham.

It is to be noted, of course, that Graham did
not give evidence at the trial and any explanation of Graham’s as referred to
by the learned trial judge must have been taken from Mussallem’s evidence,
McKenzie’s evidence and from

[Page 231]

the address to the jury given by the accused
Graham who appeared without counsel and who, therefore, on his own behalf,
addressed the jury after the close of the evidence.

From my survey of the course of the trial, I
have come to the conclusion that the Crown, in the particular case, was not
required to rely upon any doctrine of recent possession of stolen goods in
order to prove its case and did not so rely. Under those circumstances,
therefore, the Crown, so far as it was able, excluded from the evidence any
statement or explanation given by the accused for his possession. The Crown did
not, therefore, attempt to adduce the fact of either no explanation or the fact
that the explanation although given could not reasonably be true in order to
establish the basis for the application of the doctrine of recent possession.
Under such circumstances, the attempt to adduce such explanation in the cross‑examination
of the constable was an attempt by the defence to prove a defence without the
production of evidence from the accused. In a case where the Crown does not rely
upon the presumption arising from the unexplained possession of recently stolen
goods, then the Crown is not required to produce any explanation and if there
is to be the production in defence of that explanation then it must be in
accordance with the ordinary rules of evidence. I am, therefore, of the opinion
that the trial judge was, under the particular circumstances in this case,
correct in his ruling that the explanation in this long written statement could
not be produced from the constable in cross-examination and that it had to be
subject to ordinary rules of evidence, that is, it had to be given in sworn
testimony and not in breach of the hearsay rule.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia and restore
the verdict at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Appeal—Powers of Court of
Appeal—Aquittal set aside and conviction entered—Power to impose
sentence—Accused respondent not present in Court—Respondent not given
opportunity to make submissions in respect of sentence—Canadian Bill of Rights,
1960 (Can.), c. 44, ss. 1,2—Criminal Code, ss. 615(4), 613(4), 577(1).

The appellants were aquitted at trial on
charges of unlawful assault upon four peace officers engaged in the execution
of their duty. The Court of Appeal convicted the appellants and, at the same
time, imposed upon each of them a sentence of six months imprisonment. The
sentence was imposed without the appellants being present and having an
opportunity to make submissions in respect of that matter. At the conclusion of
the argument of Counsel for the appellants, this Court ruled that there had
been no error made by the Court of Appeal in setting aside the acquittal of the
appellants. However, there remained the issue as to whether the Court of Appeal
was entitled to impose sentence in this case.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed on the merits and the case remitted to the Court of
Appeal to pass sentence after receiving submissions from the appellants.

The Criminal Code does not require
that the accused must be present when sentence is passed by a Court of appeal
under s. 613(4)(b)(i). In the light of the history of s. 594
(4), it cannot be concluded that the enactment of s. 594 (4) in 1955,
enabling the Court of Appeal to impose sentence notwithstanding that the
appellant is not present, can be interpreted also as leading to the illogical
result that when sentence is imposed after a Crown appeal from an aquittal the
accused must be present.

[Page 196]

However, in the imposition of sentence under
s. 613 (4), the Court of appeal must, by virtue of s. 2 (2) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, give the accused an opportunity to make, or to have made on
his behalf, any submission on this matter. A “fair hearing” of a criminal trial
includes the matter of sentence, and, accordingly, the power to pass sentence
is a power which can only be exercised after a fair hearing on that issue. This
Court has jurisdiction to deal with this matter. The case should therefore be
remitted to the Court of appeal to pass sentence, after the appellants have
been given the opportunity to make submissions to that Court on that matter.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Manitoba[1],
setting aside the acquittal of the appellants and imposing upon them a sentence.
Appeal dismissed on the merits and case remitted to Court of Appeal to pass a
new sentence.

R. Penner, Q.C., and R. Carbert, for the
appellants.

W. Morton, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The appellants appealed to this
Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, which allowed an
appeal by the respondent from the judgment at trial acquitting the appellants
on charges of unlawful assault upon four peace officers while engaged in the
lawful execution of their duty. The Court of Appeal convicted the appellants on
the said charges and, at the same time, imposed upon each of the appellants a
sentence of six months imprisonment on each charge, the sentences to be
concurrent. The appeal to this Court was made pursuant to s. 597 (2) (now
s. 618 (2)) of the Criminal Code, which gave them an appeal as of
right on a question of law.

At the conclusion of the argument of counsel for
the appellants, counsel for the respondent was advised that it was not necessary
for him to submit argument in respect of the decision of the Court of Appeal to
allow the respondent’s

[Page 197]

appeal from the acquittal of the appellants, as
this Court was unanimously of the opinion that there had been no error by the
Court of Appeal on a question of law.

There remains, however, the issue raised by the
appellants that the Court of Appeal was not entitled, upon convicting the
appellants, to impose sentence upon them without their being present and having
the opportunity to make submissions in respect of that matter.

In support of the contention that the Court of
Appeal could not impose sentence in the absence of the appellants, reference
was made to the provisions of s. 594 (4) (now s. 615 (4) of the Criminal
Code, which provides that:

The power of a court of appeal to impose
sentence may be exercised notwithstanding that the appellant is not present.

It was submitted that the maxim “expressio
unius exclusio alterius” was applicable and that, as the present appellants
were not appellants before the Court of Appeal, but were respondents, the power
of that court to impose sentence could not be exercised unless they were
present.

I do not agre with this contention, in the light
of the history of this provision. Prior to 1923, the 1892 Criminal Code provided
for the reservation of questions of law for the opinion of the court of appeal,
and for appeals to the court of appeal against a refusal to reserve such a
question. The Crown enjoyed the same rights as the accused in respect of these
matters. In 1923 these provisions were replaced by what was practically a
verbatim copy of the English Criminal Appeal Act of 1907 (7 Edw. VII, c.
23), save that provision was made for a right of appeal against sentence, by
the Crown, and for directing a new trial when a conviction was quashed.

In s. 1012 (a) “appellant” was
defined as including a person who has been convicted on indictment and who
desires to appeal. Section 1021A (4) provided that:

The power of the court of appeal to pass
any sentence under section 1015 of this Act may be

[Page 198]

exercised notwithstanding that the
appellant is for any reason not present.

The result of the 1923 amendment was to take
away the previously existing right of appeal by the Crown from an acquittal, on
a question of law, apparently through inadvertence, since the provision for
appeals to this Court “by any person whose acquittal has been set aside” was
left intact.

The Crown’s right of appeal on a question of law
was restored in 1930 (20-21 Geo. V, c. 11, s. 28) by enacting new subs.
(4) and (5) in s. 1013, as follows:

(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Act
contained, the Attorney General shall have the right to appeal to the court of
appeal against any judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in respect
of an indictable offence on any ground of appeal which involves a question of
law alone.

(5) The procedure upon such an appeal and
the powers of the court of appeal, including the power to grant a new trial,
shall mutatis mutandis and so far as the same are applicable to appeals
upon a question of law alone, be similar to the procedure prescribed and the
powers given by sections one thousand and twelve to one thousand and
twenty-one of this Act, inclusive, and the Rules of Court passed thereto, and
to section five hundred and seventy-six of this Act.

In the 1955 Criminal Code the 1923 and
1930 amendments were reproduced, without changes in substance. The definition
of “appellant” was omitted. The “mutatis mutandis” provision of
s. 1013 (5) disappeared, appropriate changes being made in some other
sections. But s. 1021A (4) was reproduced as s. 594 (4), previously
cited, leaving the word “appellant” unchanged. It would appear that, through
oversight, modification of this provision, required by the suppression of the “mutatis
muntandis” provision, was overlooked.

In the light of this history, I cannot conclude
that the enactment of s. 594 (4) in 1955, enabling the court of appeal to
impose sentence

[Page 199]

notwithstanding that the appellant is not
present, can be interpreted also as leading to the illogical result that when
sentence is imposed after a Crown appeal from an acquittal the accused must be
present.

The power of the court of appeal on such an
appeal is defined in s. 613 (4), formerly s. 592 (4):

(4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal
the court of appeal may

(a) dismiss the appeal; or

(b) allow the appeal, set aside the
verdict and

(i) enter a verdict of guilty with respect
to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found
guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is warranted in law,
or

(ii) order a new trial.

Referring to this subsection, Martin, in his
1955 Criminal Code, says: “Subsec. (4) is the former s. 1013 (5) and
sets out what is there incorporated by reference.”

Where it is intended by the Criminal Code that
the accused must be present, it specifically so provides. Section 577(1)
(formerly s. 577 (1)) states that, subject to subs. (2) (which covers the
case of interruption of proceedings by the accused, or permitting his absence)
“an accused other than a corporation shall be present in court during the whole
of his trial.”

In my opinion the Code does not require
that the accused must be present when sentence is passed by a court of appeal
under s. 613 (4) (b) (i).

The next question which arises is as to the
power of the Court of Appeal to impose sentence without having given to the
appellants an opportunity to make, or to have made on their behalf, any
submission on this matter. We were advised by counsel for the appellants that
submissions on the matter of sentence had not been made before the Court of
Appeal, apart from his suggestion that, if the appeal were allowed, the matter
of sentence might be referred back to the magistrate. This course

[Page 200]

commended itself to Chief Justice Smith, but the
majority of the Court decided to impose sentence.

In R. v. Lunn[2], the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (in banco),
at p. 362, held that, in a case where the court had allowed an appeal from
an acquittal, the accused “should be given the right to be heard” before
sentence was imposed.

The subsequent enactment of the Bill of
Rights (S.C. 1960, c. 44 ) strengthens this view. Section 1  declares the
right of an individual not to be deprived of his liberty without due process of
law. Section 2  requires the law of Canada to be construed and applied so as not
to abridge or infringe on such right and, in particular, under para, (e)
so as not to “deprive a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance
with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights
and obligations.”

The opinion has been expressed in the judgment
of the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in R. v. Russell[3], that s. 2(e) of the Bill of
Rights does not apply where the issue is guilt or innocence under the
criminal law. The same opinion was expressed by Jessup J.A. in the Ontario
Court of Appeal in R. v. Duke[4].
However, the other two members of the Court in that case preferred to express
no opinion on this point.

In my opinion, the application of s. 2 (e)
should not be restricted in this way. It is clear that paras, (a), (b),
(c), (d), (f) and (g) of s. 2 all have
application in criminal proceedings and, this being so, it is difficult to see
why Parliament should have intended to limit the application of one paragraph
out of this group of provisions to civil cases, particularly when it is
remembered that Parliament cannot legislate in

[Page 201]

the field of civil procedure in provincial
courts. The impact of para. (e), on the interpretation suggested,
would be limited, as indicated in the Russell case, to hearings before
federal administrative boards or tribunals exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions.

The various paragraphs in s. 2
particularize aspects of those human rights and fundamental freedoms defined in
s. 1. Paragraph (a) of s. 1 refers to the right to life,
liberty and security of the person, as well as to enjoyment of property and the
right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law. The right to a
fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the
determination of rights and obligations, provided for in s. 2 (e),
relates back to those rights guaranteed by s. 1. In my opinion it includes
the right to a fair hearing in criminal proceedings.

When s. 613 (4) of the Code is to be
construed, it must be done in a manner which does not abridge or infringe those
rights. In my opinion a fair hearing of a criminal trial includes the matter of
sentence, and, accordingly, the power to pass sentence is a power which can
only be exercised after a fair hearing on that issue. The appellants had the
right to be heard on that issue before sentence was passed.

Counsel for the respondent contended that this
Court was without jurisdiction to deal with this matter, in the light of the
judgment of this Court in Goldhar v. R.[5],
in that the issue involved was as to sentence. That case concerned an
application for leave to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario on an appeal from sentence. The issue before the Court of Appeal was as
to whether the sentence imposed at trial was one which, in law, could legally
be imposed on conviction of the offence charged. Leave to appeal to this Court
was refused on the ground that this Court did not have jurisdiction to
entertain an appeal against a

[Page 202]

sentence imposed for the commission of an
indictable offence.

In the present case the appellants are before
the Court by virtue of their right of appeal under s. 618 (2) (a)
(formerly s. 597 (2) (a)), which provides as follows:

(2) A person

(a) who is acquitted of an
indictable offence other than

(i) an offence punishable by death, or

(ii) by reason of the special verdict of
not guilty on account of insanity, and whose acquittal is set aside by the
court of appeal,

may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
on a question of law.

This provision gives an appeal as of right to a
person whose acquittal at trial has been set aside by a court of appeal, on a
question of law. There has been no question of an appeal on sentence to the
Court of Appeal since there was no sentence passed at trial. The first
imposition of sentence was made by the Court of Appeal.

The basic issue presently under consideration
does not relate to the length of the sentence imposed, nor as to the power of
the Court of Appeal to impose a sentence of that length, but rather relates to
the right of the Court of Appeal to deal with the matter of sentence at all
without first having given to the appellants the opportunity to exercise their
right to be heard.

I am not prepared to interpret the Goldhar case
as authority for the proposition that this Court, in relation to an appeal
properly before it, has no power to interfere where a court of appeal has acted
improperly, under the Criminal Code, solely because the matter in issue
affected the imposition of sentence. This appeal is properly before the Court,
and, that being so, the Court is entitled to make any order which the Court of
Appeal might have made, or any order necessary to give effect to the judgment
of this Court (s. 623).

[Page 203]

In R. v. McKay[6], this Court dealt with a criminal appeal
from the Court of Appeal for Ontario which, with one judge dissenting, had set
aside a conviction on the ground that there was no evidence, implicating the
accused, to go to the jury. The appeal to this Court was allowed. The Court of
Appeal had not determined whether or not, if there were evidence, the verdict
should be set aside as unreasonable. If the Court of Appeal had set aside the
verdict on that ground, there could have been no appeal to this Court, that
question not being one of law. This Court held, however, that it had power to
restore the jury verdict, rather than to remit the case to the Court of Appeal
to consider that issue. This conclusion was reached on the basis that this
Court, once seized of the appeal, has complete authority to direct the remedy
which the court appealed from ought to have granted.

Reference was made in the majority judgment in
that case to the reasons of Sir Lyman Duff in the case of Manchuk v. R.[7]. In that case, the appellant had been
convicted of murder at a second trial, after a conviction of murder at the
first trial had been set aside by the court of appeal. His appeal to the court
of appeal after the second conviction failed, but his appeal to this Court
succeeded. This Court held that it had authority, instead of ordering a new
trial, to substitute a verdict of manslaughter, and also to impose a sentence
of life imprisonment.

The McKay case was followed recently in
this Court in the case of R. v. Borg[8].

[Page 204]

In the present case the Court is seized of the
appeal. An outright dismissal of the appeal would result in the maintenance of
the order of the Court of Appeal imposing sentence which, for the reasons
already given, I do not think it could properly make. In my opinion this Court
has jurisdiction to make an order appropriate to these circumstances.

It is then necessary to consider what is the
appropriate order to be made. Counsel for the appellants asks that the matter
of sentence be remitted to the magistrate, which was the course suggested by
Chief Justice Smith in the Court of Appeal. Counsel points out that such a
course was adopted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Ashcroft v. R.[9]. A similar procedure was followed by the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in the case of Wild v. R.[10], which came to this Court[11], on another issue.

However, the imposition of sentence, under
s. 613 (4), is a duty primarily placed on the court of appeal. In the
present case the majority of the Court of Appeal decided to pass sentence after
allowing the appeal from acquittal. I do not think it would be proper for this
Court to order that the matter of sentence be referred back to the magistrate.
In my opinion the case should be remitted to the Court of Appeal to pass
sentence, after the appellants have been given the opportunity to make
submissions to that Court on that matter.

In the result, I would dismiss this appeal on
the merits, but remit the case to the Court of Appeal to pass sentence, after
receiving any submissions which the appellants wish to make, or to have made on
their behalf, with respect to that matter.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Armed robbery—Person
accidentally injured by police officer—Officer not liable for damages—Criminal
Code, 1970 (Can.), c. C-34, s. 25(4).

Appellant, who is a chartered accountant, was
accidentally injured by a shot fired by respondent, a police officer, during
the perpetration of an armed robbery on certain business premises where he was
engaged in auditing the company’s books. The accident occurred in a corridor
where boxes were stacked along one wall, thus leaving a narrow passage.
Respondent, having got to the entrance of the corridor, saw two of the three
gunmen at the other end turning to the left in order to escape into another
corridor. He then fired three times in their direction hitting the appellant
whom he had not seen and who was immobilized in the corridor after being forced
by one of the gunmen to remain there while he was making his escape. The
decision of the Superior Court ordering respondent to pay damages was reversed
by the Court of Appeal. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The justification created by the provisions
of s. 25(4) of the Criminal Code relieves the police officer of any
civil or criminal liability, not only in respect of the fugitive but also in
respect of any person who accidentally becomes an innocent victim of the force
used by such an officer in the circumstances described in those provisions and
established by the evidence.

With regards to negligence attributed to
respondent in the Superior Court, it might be inferred without doing violence
to the evidence that appellant was partially or totally out of the view of
respondent while he was in the clear space between boxes allowing access to an
office and before he turned around in the direction of the shots fired. Even if
appellant was temporarily within respondent’s range of view, in law this could
not be grounds for holding the latter liable

[Page 176]

and requiring in such circumstances a
standard of care greater than that required of a reasonable man. Respondent was
not engaged merely in performing an act permitted by law, but he was engaged in
the hazardous performance of a grave duty imposed on him by law. And he incurs
no liability for damage caused to another when without negligence he does
precisely what the legislature requires him to do.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal
Side, Province of Quebec, reversing a decision of the Superior Court. Appeal
dismissed.

Jules O. Duchesneau, for the plaintiff,
appellant.

Hervé Bélanger, for the defendant,
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Appellant is appealing against
a decision of the Court of Appeal reversing a judgment of the Superior Court
which ordered respondent, an officer of the Montreal City Police, to pay him
the sum of $39,049.25 in damages. These damages resulted from an injury
accidentally inflicted on appellant by a short fired by respondent in the
course of a police action, during the perpetration of an armed robbery on the
business premises of the Slater Shoe (Canada) Company.

The two lower courts were in substantial
agreement on the facts relevant to a consideration of the questions of law
raised in this appeal. I need only summarize these facts with reference to the
following diagram, produced at the hearing as Exhibit P-6:

The offices of the Slater Shoe (Canada) Company
are on the second floor of a building situated at the corner of de Normanville
Street and Rosemont Boulevard. The entrance on Rosemont Boulevard leads by a
stairway to a waiting room, adjoining which are an information desk and the
office of the Secretary-Treasurer of the company, André Giguère. In the centre
of the premises are the main office and the sample room, which may be reached
either by corridor “A” on one side or corridor “C” on the other. These two
corridors are connected at the rear by corridor “B”, which has three offices
opening onto it, one of which, that in the centre, is the office of
Mr. Gibault, the company president. The accident in question occurred in
corridor “A”, which had on its entire length, against the wall adjacent to the
main office and the sample room, boxes stacked six to seven feet high and two
feet wide, thus leaving a passage of only three feet six inches.

On the day in question, December 21, 1962, at
about three-thirty or three forty-five in the afternoon, there were at least
ten persons on the premises, including appellant Poupart, Jean-Guy Hétu and Richard
Brunet, all three being chartered accountants, who were engaged in auditing the
company’s books. Poupart was talking to Giguère in the latter’s office, when
three gunmen, subsequently identified as Bernier, Bonnin and Périneau, and
armed respectively with a machine gun, a.45 calibre revolver and a

[Page 178]

.22 calibre revolver, suddenly burst in and
spread out through the premises. They assembled all those present, if not
everybody, into the main office at gunpoint, physical violence being used if required,
and made them line up against the wall adjacent to corridor “A”. They
immediately demanded to know where the “payroll money” was. The auditors
Poupart, Hétu and Brunet, to whom their question was mainly directed, replied
that they did not work for the firm and so knew nothing about it. While Bernier
kept the group covered the other two gunmen searched the premises, gun in hand,
but without finding any money. In front of the group gathered in the main
office Bernier singled out Hétu and, pointing the machine gun towards the
latter’s legs, told him he would count to five, by which time someone had
better provide the information required; he counted to five; drew the trigger
of his weapon; a click was heard; but no shot was fired. At this point officers
Lafortune and Picard, alerted by radio to the fact that an armed robbery was in
progress at this location, arrived and rushed into the office. Someone shouted
“Police”. The officers were greeted by shots and subsequently exchanged shots
with the gunmen.

The following, according to the part of
Lafortune’s testimony cited in the judgment at trial, is a summary of what
happened between the arrival of the police officers and the time the accident
took place. As he entered the firm’s offices Lafortune, looking through the
glass partition adjoining the information desk, he saw a group of people in the
main office with their hands up. He crouched down as he went round the counter
of the reception desk, intending to surprise the thieves from behind. When he
got to the end of the counter he saw Bernier and Bonnin, who were rather
standing midway between the second and third columns in corridor “C”. He aimed
his gun at them to hold them at bay, and as he did so Périneau came out of
Giguère’s office and fired in his direction. Lafortune returned the fire and
shouted “Everybody down”. Then, as he turned back towards Bonnin and Bernier,
he saw the latter raise his machine

[Page 179]

gun and try to fire at him. Lafortune fired
again and Bernier and Bonnin ran through the main office towards corridor “A”.
Lafortune was acquainted with the premises, having been there in response to an
earlier call, and knew that corridor “A” could be reached through the waiting
room at the front, without going through the main office. He ran that way to
cut off the retreat of the two gunmen. When he got to the entrance of the
corridor, he saw them at the other end turning to the left in order to escape
into corridor “B”. Lafortune fired three times in their direction. Immediately
after his third shot, he saw in corridor “A” for the first time an individual
clutching his left shoulder: this was appellant, who, as we shall see from his
testimony, had just been hit, and who took refuge in the entrance to the room
where the stationery is kept, at point X on the diagram. As the two gunmen had
disappeared, Bonnin jumping outside through a window and Bernier continuing
along corridor “B”, Lafortune immediately went to lend assistance to his
associate Picard in disarming and capturing Périneau, who was in Giguère’s
office.

Lafortune summarized what occurred on the
premises after the accident as follows. As Périneau had been captured,
Lafortune went into the main office and ordered the employees to stay down,
telling them that a third gunman was still on the premises. Waiting for
developments, he concealed himself behind the third column in corridor “C”. A
few moments later, he at first saw the barrel of Bernier’s machine gun
protruding past the corner of corridors “B” and “C”, then the head of Bernier himself,
who immediately disappeared as Lafortune fired at him. Lafortune remained where
he was while Picard left the premises to take steps for the arrest of Bonnin,
who had escaped. When Picard returned with police reinforcements he proceeded
to join Lafortune in corridor “B”. Picard broke down the door of Gibault’s
office, and the two men found Bernier inside, holding Gibault hostage. Bernier
was then apprehended.

[Page 180]

On his part appellant Poupart testified, in
short, concerning the circumstances immediately preceding the accident, that as
Bernier was backing out of the main office while facing him, Bernier forced
Poupart, using his machine gun, to follow him into corridor “A” and remain
there while he was making his escape towards the rear of the corridor; that
while being then immobilized in the corridor opposite the entrance to the main
office, Poupart heard shots coming from the front end of the corridor behind
him; and as he turned around in this direction he was hit in the left shoulder.
He indicated at point Y on the diagram where he was hit, and point X, the
entrance to the stationery room where he took refuge.

It is hardly necessary, but very relevant
nonetheless, to add to this brief account of the circumstances essential for
consideration of the questions of law that the foregoing events, especially
those which took place between the time the police officers arrived and the
moment the accident occurred, developed swiftly in an atmosphere of collective
tension, which, be it noted, was quite properly regarded by several witnesses
as responsible for the few discrepancies or conflicts of minor importance
contained in the evidence;

In his defence to the damage suit brought
against him respondent pleaded the following provisions of s. 25 of the Criminal
Code:

25. (1) …

(2) …

(3) …

(4) A peace officer who is proceeding
lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, any person for an offence for
which that person may be arrested without warrant, and every one lawfully
assisting the peace officer, is justified, if the person to be arrested takes
flight to avoid arrest, in using as much force as is necessary to prevent the
escape by flight, unless the escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a
less violent manner.

The Superior Court justified as follows its
judgment ordering officer Lafortune to pay compensation for the damage
resulting from this

[Page 181]

unfortunate accident: (i) Relying on the rule
followed by the courts in automobile accident cases, and stated in Swartz v.
Wills[1] as
follows:

Where there is nothing to obstruct the
vision and there is a duty to look, it is negligence not to see what is clearly
visible

and also being of the opinion that, even in
circumstances where the atmosphere is heightened by tension, a police officer
should, by reason of the training he has received, show more “sang-froid” and
control than another person would, it held that the fact that officer Lafortune
did not see appellant in the corridor constituted an act of negligence; (ii) it
then attributed a second element of negligence to the officer, on account of
his so-called lack of skill with shooting firearms, inferred from the fact that
each of the three bullets fired by him in corridor “A” hit a target other than
the gunmen; (iii) finally, after examining the question of whether the gunmen
were in fact fleeing at the time Lafortune fired in their direction, and
whether the officer was in law protected by the aforementioned provisions of
s. 25 against a damage suit by an innocent victim, as he is against an action
by the fugitive whose escape he seeks to prevent, the learned judge stated his
adoption of the position most favourable to respondent, referred to the
decisions of this Court in Prietsman v. Colangelo et al.[2] and Beim v. Goyer[3], and held that in view of the two
elements of negligence previously mentioned, Lafortune could not avail himself
of the protection of these provisions of the Code.

In the Court of Appeal Rivard J.A., in reasons
concurred in by Choquette J.A., after summarizing the facts clarified the
meaning and scope of the decisions of this Court in the Priestman and Beim
cases, as well as the distinctions attaching to the particular
circumstances of each of these cases and the present one, declared that this
was an emergency situation compelling resort to severe measures, that the
firearm was the means Lafortune had to adopt to protect those

[Page 182]

present, and himself, as well as to prevent the
gunmen from escaping and ensure their arrest, and that having regard to the
circumstances he was dealing with, the reproach made against Lafortune by the
Superior Court, of having negligently performed his duty, could not be
justified. Owen J.A., dissenting, only stated that in his opinion no error in
the Superior Court judgment had been shown on behalf of Lafortune.

Hence the appeal by Poupart against that
judgment dismissing his action.

Two observations must be made at once, with the
greatest respect, regarding certain doubts expressed in the reasons for
judgment of the learned trial judge. First, I should say that if only because
of the decision of this Court in the Priestman case supra, there
is no reason to doubt, in my view, that the justification created by the
aforementioned provisions of s. 25 relieves the police officer of any
civil or criminal liability, not only in respect of the fugitive but also in
respect of any person who accidentally becomes an innocent victim of the force
used by such an officer in the circumstances described in those provisions. And
I would add that, if only because of the evidence that Bonnin leapt from a
second-storey window when Lafortune fired at him and Bernier, there seems
little doubt that the two gunmen were really taking flight.

In short, subject to consideration of the
allegation of negligence, I feel that all the circumstances necessary for
Lafortune to be entitled to the justification provided in the aforementioned
provisions of s. 25 are present and fully established by the evidence.

The allegation of negligence: Poupart’s
testimony indicates that he was hit in his left shoulder by a bullet when,
after standing still in the corridor opposite the entrance to the main office,
he turned around in the direction of the first two shots fired at the gunmen.
Before making this movement, was he in the clear

[Page 183]

space left almost at the centre of the row of
boxes to allow access to the main office, and was he therefore, for a moment or
so, out of the view of Lafortune, partially or totally, so that he could not be
said to have been “clearly visible” to the latter, who, running, was arriving
at the end of the corridor to cut off any possible retreat by the gunmen? This
might certainly be inferred without doing violence to the evidence. Lafortune
asserted that he did not see appellant while trying to prevent the escape of
the gunmen by firing in their direction. Indeed, even if Poupart was at that
moment temporarily within Lafortune’s range of vision, I am respectfully of the
opinion that in law this could not be grounds for holding the police officer
liable by relying, moreover, on an analogy which cannot be regarded as valid,
and by requiring in addition, in such circumstances, a standard of care greater
than that required of a reasonable man.

With regard to the analogy drawn by the trial
judge between the case of the driver of an automobile, and the case of a police
officer placed in the circumstances under consideration, I would say that in
contrast with the driver of an automobile, Lafortune was not engaged merely in
performing an act permitted by law, but, which is quite a different matter, as
was pointed out at p. 618 in the Priestman case supra, he
was engaged in the hazardous performance of a grave duty imposed on him by law.
In carrying out such a duty a peace officer must undoubtedly refrain from
making any unjustifiable use of the powers relating to it. This principle was
recognized in Regina v. Waterfield and Another[4], at p. 170 et seq., and
recently recalled in this Court in the as yet unpublished decision of Knowlton
v. The Queen. However, while a police officer is not relieved of a duty to
take reasonable care, that is care the degree of which must be determined in
relation to the particular

[Page 184]

circumstances of the case to be decided, the
actions of Lafortune cannot, in a case like that before the Court, be evaluated
as they would be if it were a case in which the precautions to be taken in
accordance with the duty not to injure others were not conditioned by the
requirements of a public duty. In short, the police officer incurs no liability
for damage caused to another when without negligence he does precisely what the
legislature requires him to do; see Priestman case supra. Interpreted
otherwise the justification provided by s. 25(4) would be reduced to a
nullity.

In all defence, therefore, I would say with
regard to the legal grounds given in support of the judgment of first instance
that the Court of Appeal properly intervened to reverse that judgment, and, for
the reasons given above and in the judgment a quo, I would dismiss the
appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA,
APPELLATE DIVISION

Criminal Law—Non-capital murder—Trial—Crown
counsel’s conduct—Inadmissible and inflammatory poem read by Crown counsel in
presence of jury—Refusal of trial judge to discharge jury.

The appellant was convicted of a non capital
murder which occurred in the course of a violent encounter between two
motorcycle gangs. It was alleged that the appellant struck the victim on the
side of the head with a metal logging chain. The appellant gave evidence and
towards the end of his cross-examination, Crown counsel read to the jury an
inadmissible and inflammatory poem which depicted the gang of which the
appellant was a member as being motivated by violence and contempt of the law.
The trial judge refused to declare a mistrial and gave the jury express
instructions that the poem was not evidence and should not influence them. The
Court of appeal affirmed the conviction. The appellant was granted leave to
appeal to this Court on the question as to whether the trial judge should have
discharged the jury.

Held (Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Abbott,
Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon JJ: The administration of justice in our courts
would be greatly hampered if it were not recognized that a trial judge has a
wide discretion as to the manner in which a trial is to be conducted, and it
has long been accepted that a trial judge’s ruling on the question of whether
or not to discharge the jury is one which a Court of appeal should approach
with great caution. There was nothing in the poem to advocate the kind of
murderous assault to which the appellant himself admitted in his direct
examination. It could not have prejudiced the jury any more than the evidence
of the appellant himself. The clear instructions in the trial judge’s charge
served effectively to erase it from the minds of the jury. In any event, there
was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

[Page 134]

Per Hall,
Spence and Laskin JJ., dissenting: On the facts of this case it would
appear that the appellant was seriously prejudiced in his trial. The not very
careful warning issued by the trial judge could not possibly have allayed the
very serious prejudice caused by the incomprehensible conduct of the Crown counsel
in putting this so-called poem to the accused in the presence of the jury. It
could not be said that the jury, as reasonable men, would have done otherwise
than find the appellant guilty.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court
of Alberta[1],
Appellate Division, affirming the conviction of the appellant for non-capital
murder. Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

L.A.L. Matt, for the appellant.

E.P. Adolphe, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Abbott, Judson, Ritchie and Pigeon
JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
Alberta, dismissing the appellant’s appeal from his conviction for the
non-capital murder of Ronald George Hartley whose death occurred as the result
of injuries which he received when the appellant struck him on the side of the
head with a metal logging chain in the course of a violent encounter between
two motorcycle gangs composed of youths living in and around the City of
Calgary. One of these gangs was referred to as the “Outcasts” and the other, of
which all but two of the accused were members, carried the name of the “Grim
Reapers”.

The appellant, together with twelve other young
men, was convicted at a trial before Primrose. J. sitting with a jury, on a
charge

…that they, at or near Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, Alberta, on or about the 7th day of March, A.D.
1970, did unlawfully murder Ronald George Hartley in that each and everyone of
the

[Page 135]

accused formed an intention in common to
carry out the unlawful purpose of assaulting persons with offensive weapons and
to assist each other therein and that each of them knew or ought to have known
that the commission of the offence of non-capital murder herein alleged against
them would be a probable consequence of the carrying out of the common purpose
and did thereby commit non-capital murder, contrary to the Criminal Code.

All of the accused appealed to the Appellate
Division and by a unanimous judgment of that Court one of them was acquitted
and a new trial was directed in respect of all the others except the present
appellant whose conviction was affirmed.

The circumstances surrounding the attack on
Hartley were that the two gangs had agreed to meet at a place called “Little
Rock” about 15 miles southeast of Calgary at about 8 o’clock on the 7th of
March 1970. There had been bad blood between the two groups and it appears that
at least some of those concerned had hoped that the meeting might result in
sorting out their differences. Some of the “Grim Reapers” came to the meeting
armed with bull whips and logging chains, whereas the “Outcasts” carried no
weapons. The “Grim Reapers”, occupying four cars, were the first to arrive at
the meeting place and finding no one there started back towards Calgary, but
very soon encountered the other group who were occupying a car and a panel
truck and were accompanied by six girls including the wife of Ronald Hartley.

As the first of the “Outcasts” arrived, the
appellant got out onto the highway and according to the wife of the deceased,
he came over to their car and asked who was the president of the “Outcasts”.
Upon Ronald Hartley identifying himself, Mrs. Hartley says that he was
told to get out and when he did so was struck on the side of his head with a
chain wielded by Emkeit whereupon Hartley exclaimed “God man, why?” and
Mrs. Hartley appears to have been able to divert Emkeit who by this time
was surrounded by members of his gang. The ensuing events are described by the
learned Chief Justice in the course of his reasons for judgment

[Page 136]

which he delivered on behalf of the Appellate
Division as follows:

Hartley got in his car to drive but
couldn’t do so. He stiffened up and was becoming paralysed. He was placed on a
mattress in the back of the panel truck and was taken to hospital as quickly as
possible. He was obviously seriously hurt and mouth to mouth resuscitation was
attempted on the way to hospital. He was breathing during the most of the
journey to the hospital but was dead on arrival. Mrs. Hartley described
the chain ‘as a logging chain with 1” links’. When Ronald Emkeit hit Hartley he
said ‘Everything around the panel truck just exploded and there was fighting
and screaming and hollering.’

Of all the accused the appellant alone gave
evidence in the course of which he gave his own version of his conduct towards
Hartley:

So I walked up and as, you know, I seen the
guy was not with us, so, you know, I says, ‘Who are you?’ And he says, ‘I am
president of the Outcasts.’ So I said, ‘Outcasts?’ and I kind of snickered, you
know, because, well, I have a very bad manner with people. And he looks at me
and he says, ‘Who are you?’ I told him, ‘Ron Emkeit,’ and he took a swing at me
but he missed, so I pushed him and he went back against the door, and he
started to come to me. Now, when I pushed him I turned sideways, and that
night, as usual, I had a chrome chain around my neck, it had an iron cross on
it. I always wear this thing. So when I pushed him, you know, and as I turned
sideways and he was coming back on me, I grabbed the chain and I swung it like
that, you know. I hit him with it and he fell back against the car door, and I
moved in, I was going to hit him again, and he threw up his hands and he says,
‘No more.’ so I didn’t hit him.

The following excerpt from the cross-examination
of Emkeit also appears to me to be relevant:

Q. Did you tell the police that you
defended yourself against Hartley or a person at that fight?

A. I didn’t tell them nothing, sir.

Q. You said nothing?

A. Nothing.

Q. Is this the first time you have told
anyone about defending yourself?

[Page 137]

A. Yes, sir.

Q. That’s what you are saying, Hartley took
a swing at you and you used your chain on him?

A. Yes.

Q. Right around his head?

A. Yes. I only hit him once….

Q. Had he a weapon in his hand?

A. No, sir.

Q. And you knew it?

A. That’s right.

Q. He was alone beside his car?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you knew that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were not alone beside him, you had
friends with you?

A. That’s right.

Even if it be accepted that Hartley “took a
swing” at him, Emkeit’s statement nevertheless amounted to an admission that he
beat an unarmed man over the head with a chrome chain and from the other
evidence it appears that the man died as a result of this beating. The plea of
self defence was put to the jury, but under the circumstances I think that any
twelve men properly instructed would necessarily have found that no weight
could be attached to it.

Towards the end of his cross-examination of
Emkeit, the Crown Prosecutor saw fit to ask the following unfortunate
questions:

Q. Yes. I will tell you why I asked you if
George was a poet, that’s George Lowe. It seems to me he had a club poem with
him. Did you ever hear it?

A. I don’t know.

Q. This
is Grim Reapers, I will put it to you.
“A flash of chrome and flying hair,
The Reapers ride with fearless stare,
Citizens scream, daughters beware,
When Reapers ride there is fear in the air.
In the deep of night, with thundering crash,
Deep throated Harleys and Hortons flash.
Out of the night, the wind in their hair,
The Reapers are riding, so citizens take care.

[Page 138]

Bikes
are their life, they don’t give a damn,
They scorn the world and laugh at the man.
Riding choppers from dawn till dawn,
Knowing damn well they are Satan’s spawn,
Their creed is lust, their bible is hate,
They fuck the world and hell is their fate.”

Is that your poem?

A. No, sir.

As the learned trial judge observed, none of the
eight counsel representing the various accused took any objection to the poem
as it was going into evidence, but shortly afterwards a motion was made on
behalf of all the accused that the judge should discharge the jury on the
ground that the evidence was both inadmissible and inflammatory. The learned
trial judge was then faced with being required to exercise his undoubted
discretion in determining whether the fact that this evidence had been heard by
the jury constituted such a fatal defect in the proceedings as to justify him
in declaring a mistrial, after 26 witnesses had testified over a period of 3
days.

The trial judge asked himself the question: “Am
I justified in declaring a mistrial because something which is perhaps not
relevant at all has gone in on cross-examination?” and having heard argument
from counsel he concluded: “I am not going to discharge the jury. Carry on.”
This ruling is the subject of the sole question upon which leave to appeal to
this Court was granted, namely:

Did the learned trial judge err in refusing
the motion of counsel for the appellants to discharge the jury after counsel
during the cross-examination of the appellant read the poem ‘Grim Reapers’?

It was conceded in this Court that the so-called
poem was inadmissible and this was

[Page 139]

clearly recognized by the trial judge, but the
question for him to decide was whether it was so damaging as to require that he
order a mistrial or whether, under all the circumstances, it could be cured in
the course of his charge to the jury. Having decided to let the trial proceed,
the trial judge gave the most express instructions to the jury concerning this
evidence saying:

In the course of his cross-examination
there was reference made to a poem. Crown counsel read it. Now that may be
inflammatory and of a derogative nature. Don’t let it influence you. It is
not evidence. It is not a statement of the aims of the Grim Reapers. It is
a poem, so what?

The italics are my own.

In my opinion the administration of justice in
our courts would be gravely hampered if it were not recognized that a trial
judge has a wide discretion as to the manner in which a trial is to be
conducted, and it has long been accepted that a trial judge’s ruling on the
question of whether or not to discharge the jury is one which a court of appeal
should approach with great caution.

This is made clear in the judgment of Rinfret
J., as he then was, in Paradis v. The King[2], to which reference was made by the Chief
Justice of Alberta in the Court of Appeal. Mr. Justice Rinfret in that
case, in referring to a submission that the jury should have been discharged
because of the wrongful admission of evidence, said, at page 172:

Objection was taken immediately. A long
discussion ensued at the conclusion of which the trial judge ruled that the
reference to Paradis should be struck from the deposition. Notwithstanding the
learned judge’s ruling, the appellant strongly contends that the reference was
so prejudicial to the accused that the jury should have been discharged and the
prisoner tried before a fresh jury.

There may be extreme cases where the
suggested procedure might be adopted, although we apprehend the question whether
such a course ought to be fol-

[Page 140]

lowed is primarily for the trial judge
to decide upon the circumstances of the particular case; and a court of appeal
will always approach with great caution a question as to the propriety of that
decision.

The italics are my own.

It was contended by counsel for the appellant in
the present case that the so-called poem depicted the gang of which the
appellant was a member as being motivated by violence and contempt of the law
and that it might thus predispose the jury to look upon the appellant as one
capable of committing the crime of which he was charged and thus give rise to
prejudice which might affect the jury’s verdict and could not be erased from
their minds notwithstanding the trial judge’s specific direction to disregard
it. In this regard it is to be remembered that the only serious defence put
forward by the appellant was that the attack was justified by way of self
defence because Hartley had taken a swing at the appellant and was coming back
at him after having been pushed away. The violent assault was admitted and it
is difficult for me to see how the introduction of the poem could have affected
the jury in determining whether it was justified by anything suggested in
Hartley’s conduct.

Counsel for the appellant cited the cases of Boucher
v. The Queen[3]; Regina
v. Vallières[4], and Regina
v. Armstrong[5] in
support of his contention, but in my opinion none of these cases can be said to
apply to a trial in which the accused himself has testified that he beat an
unarmed man over the head with a chain in such a way as to result in the death
of his victim. The Boucher case, in which the evidence was entirely
circumstantial, turned in large measure on the impropriety of the opinions
expressed by Crown counsel as to the guilt of the accused. In the Vallières case
a new trial was granted because the publicly expressed terrorist beliefs of the
accused were found to have been presented to the jury in such a manner as to
relate them to a

[Page 141]

specific bombing incident resulting in death to
which the accused was not directly connected by the evidence. In the Armstrong
case evidence had been wrongfully admitted of a statement made by the
accused that he had committed the crime, and Mr. Justice Coffin, speaking
on behalf of the majority of the Appeal Division of Nova Scotia said:

The words ‘and he said what he had done and
how he had confessed and that he had signed a statement’ constituted the
‘blurt’ that was fatal. Again with deference it is my opinion that once these
words were sounded—the ‘mischief was done and no warnings of the learned trial
Judge could effectively erase them from the minds of the members of the jury.

Nothing of this kind happened in the present
case.

In my opinion the so-called poem is descriptive
of fearless motorcyclists riding “in the deep of night” in such fashion as to
disturb the peace, terrify other citizens and generally display their scorn for
the rest of the world, and in the last three lines, in an outburst of bombastic
vulgarity, the author claims for these youths the title of “Satan’s spawn”
whose creed is lust and whose fate is hell. Revolting though all these
sentiments are, there is nothing in that poem to advocate the kind of murderous
assault to which the appellant himself admitted in his direct examination, and
it seems to me that this admission, given against the background of all the
other evidence, would necessarily dominate the minds of the members of the
jury, and that nothing in the so-called poem could paint a blacker picture of
his conduct than the accused himself described.

I do not think that the learned trial judge
erred in refusing the motion of counsel for the appellants to discharge the
jury. The poem did not relate to or substantiate the accused’s guilt of the
crime with which he was charged and could have no bearing on the issue of self
defence, and it could not, in my opinion, have prejudiced the jury any more
than the evidence

[Page 142]

of Emkeit himself. Unlike the evidence of the
confession in the Armstrong case, supra, I do not think that the
poem was evidence which could not be effectively erased from the minds of the
jury in considering the guilt or innocence of the accused, and in my opinion
the clear instructions in the trial judge’s charge served to fulfill this
purpose.

In the case of Pisani v. The Queen[6], which was recently decided in this Court,
a new trial was granted because of serious breaches of duty exhibited by Crown
counsel in the course of his address to the jury, but in my view, that case can
have no bearing on the circumstances here disclosed because, as
Mr. Justice Laskin said in the course of the reasons for judgment which he
delivered on behalf of the Court: “The trial judge did nothing to erase the
effect of Crown counsel’s remarks.”

Like the Chief Justice of Alberta, I am also of
opinion that this is, in any event, a case in which the jury’s verdict would
necessarily have been the same if the offensive poem had not been admitted in
evidence, and this is the test which has been used repeatedly in this Court in
applying the provisions contained in s. 592(1)(b)(iii) by
concluding that “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.”

For all the above reasons I would dismiss the
appeal.

The judgment of Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
by Emkeit from the decision of the Appellate Division of Alberta[7] confirming his conviction after a trial
before Primrose J. and jury upon the

[Page 143]

charge of non-capital murder. By order of this
Court made on June 28, 1971, Emkeit was given leave to appeal in respect of the
following question of law, namely:

Did the learned trial judge err in refusing
the motion of counsel for the appellant to discharge the jury after counsel for
the respondent, during his cross-examination of the appellant, read the poem
“Grim Reapers”?

I have had the opportunity of reading the
reasons for judgment given by my brother Ritchie and I wish to adopt the
statement of facts outlined in those reasons adding thereto only reference to
such additional facts as are required for my consideration.

Although counsel for the Attorney General of
Alberta devoted a considerable portion of his factum to the submission that the
introduction of the so-called poem was admissible, during the argument of the
appeal in this case and with some considerable reluctance, the said counsel
admitted that the production of that alleged evidence was inadmissible and
therefore this court need only consider the question of whether the trial judge
erred in refusing to discharge the jury after such inadmissible evidence had
been before the jury.

In the Appellate Division of Alberta, Smith
C.J.A. relied on Paradis v. The King[8],
and particularly the statement of Rinfret J., as he then was, at p. 172:

There may be extreme cases where the
suggested procedure might be adopted, although we apprehend the question
whether such a course ought to be followed is primarily for the trial judge to
decide upon the circumstances of the particular case; and a court of appeal
will always approach with great caution a question as to the propriety of that
decision. In this instance, at all events, there are clearly no adequate
grounds for holding that the learned judge ought to have acted otherwise than
he did.

[Page 144]

Of course, that statement does reflect the
proper position of an appellate court. It has often been repeated and has been
described as being the modern practice by Sachs L.J. in Regina v. Weaver[9], where the learned Lord Justice spoke for
the Court of Criminal Appeal.

Nevertheless, there have been cases in this
court and in the provincial courts of appeal in which the court has come to the
conclusion that the admission of inadmissible evidence or such faults as
inflammatory addresses to the jury by counsel for the Crown caused such serious
prejudice to the accused that the trial should have been stopped immediately
and that the trial judge exercised his discretion in error when he failed to
assent to an application by the defence that such course be adopted and that
therefore the conviction should be quashed and a new trial directed. Some of
these cases deal with accidents during examination or cross-examination of a
witness where the witness blurts out an answer obviously inadmissible and in
such cases the appellate court, particularly when the trial judge has warned
the jury as to the inadmissible character of the evidence, has, whenever
possible, approved the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge in
refusing to terminate the trial. Even, however, in such a case, if the
appellate court is of the opinion that the prejudice was a serious one and that
it could not be assured that the warning of the trial judge had wiped out that
prejudice, it quashed the conviction and directed a new trial.

In Regina v. Armstrong[10], the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court considered a case where in cross-examination of a Crown witness
counsel for the accused, evidently upon a misunderstanding of the evidence
given by that Crown witness on a preliminary, put to the witness questions
which elicited obviously inadmissible answers. Coffin J.A., at
p. 146, said:

[Page 145]

The words “and he said what he had done and
how he had confessed and that he had signed a statement” constituted the
“blurt” that was fatal. Again with deference it is my opinion that once these
words were sounded—the “mischief” was done and no warnings of the learned trial
Judge could effectively erase them from the minds of the members of the jury.

And Cooper J.A. said at p. 151:

In my view the words of Mrs. Oickle
uttered in the presence of the jury “and he said what he had done and how he
had confessed and that he had signed a statement” may well have influenced the
jury. If they had not been spoken it cannot be said that the jury would not
have come to a different conclusion. With deference it is my opinion that once
these words were said, the mischief was done and warnings of the learned trial
Judge could not effectively erase them from the minds of the jury. Nor can the
fact that defence counsel did not move for dismissal of the jury and a new
trial affect the matter—Stirland v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1944]
2 All E.R. 13—Viscount Simon, L.C., at pp. 18, 19; R. v. Hortopan, [1964]
2 C.C.C. 306, 42 C.R. 191, [1964] 2 O.R. 157—Roach, J.A., at p. 312.

In cases in which the inadmissible material has
been placed before the jury by the Crown either in the adducing of evidence or
in the Crown’s inflammatory address, I am of the opinion that the appellate
court takes a much stricter view and the court would have to be convinced
indeed that the fault was a minor one adequately corrected by the trial judge
in his charge before it would refuse the relief of a new trial.

In this court, the improper addresses by the
Crown counsel have been dealt with particularly in two cases. In Boucher v.
The Queen[11], the
court was concerned with a case in which the accused was charged with a
particularly brutal murder. Counsel for the Crown, first in his address to the
jury, stressed that the Crown had

[Page 146]

only proceeded with the charge after a careful
investigation and that the Crown officers were satisfied that the crime had
been committed by this particular accused, and then ended his address by the
words, and I translate only the sense: and if you return a verdict of guilty,
for once it almost gives me pleasure to ask that the death penalty be assessed
against him. Rand J., at p. 23, used words which have been repeated and
which I think set out the view of this court:

It is difficult to reconstruct in mind and
feeling the court room scene when a human life is at stake; the tensions, the
invisible forces, subtle and unpredictable, the significance that a word may
take on, are sensed at best imperfectly. It is not, then, possible to say that
this reference to the Crown’s action did not have a persuasive influence on the
jury in reaching their verdict. The irregularity touches one of the oldest
principles of our law, the rule that protects the subject from the pressures of
the executive and has its safeguard in the independence of our courts. It goes
to the foundation of the security of the individual under the rule of law.

It cannot be over-emphasized that the
purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay
before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what
is alleged to be a crime. Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal
proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to its
legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly. The role of prosecutor
excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public
duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal
responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of
the dignity, the seriousness and the justness of judicial proceedings.

On December 21, 1970, this court gave judgment
in the appeal of Bruno Pisani v. The

[Page 147]

Queen[12], which I cite
because I believe it is most relevant for the present consideration. There,
counsel for the Crown in his address proceeded in effect to give evidence in
which he explained the reason why, in his view, the accused had acted in the
fashion which the evidence had shown he had acted and did so by referring to
the practice of persons accused of like offences. This court, relying on Boucher
v. The Queen, supra, unanimously granted a new trial.

The Court of Appeal of Quebec in Regina v.
Vallières[13] was
concerned with a charge of manslaughter against a person who was a well-known
advocate of terrorist tactics. During the trial, the Crown used the writings of
the accused person in order to show that he was intimately concerned with all
the affairs of an organization with such aims and that he would, therefore,
have been among those who took part in a decision to plant a bomb the explosion
of which caused the victim’s death. The trial judge told the jury that the fact
that the accused was a terrorist did not necessarily mean that he took part in
placing the bomb at the factory on the date in question but in his address the
Crown counsel quoted from a book containing an appeal to violence and ended his
address by stating, “Gentlemen, free the accused and you know what will
happen”. The Quebec Court of Appeal, in a unanimous decision, directed a new
trial. Hyde J.A. gave the principal judgment and short concurring judgments
were given by the other justices on appeal. Brossard J.A. said at pp. 81-82:

[TRANSLATION] In Canada, the fundamental
right to a defence is enjoyed by all those persons arrested and charged with
offences allegedly committed by them, and this right is based on common law
principles

[Page 148]

implanted in the mores of society by a very
ancient, profoundly humane, and virile judicial tradition.

However serious may be the offences with
which they are charged, whatever nefarious effect these offences may have upon
citizens for whom law and respect for the law constitute the fundamental
elements upon which protection of individuals and the maintenance of order and
peace in society are built, and whatever dangers are created by the brutality
and animalistic characteristics of the violence involved in such crimes, those
charged with them are, in so far as the judicial authorities are concerned,
entitled to the protection afforded by the following great principles of our
criminal law: no one can be presumed to be guilty: no one can be convicted of
an offence unless his guilt is established beyond all reasonable doubt; in a
trial before a jury, no evidence can be presented, and no statement may be made
by counsel for the Crown, which might induce a jury to base a conviction upon
psychological or passionate grounds which might affect the most objective and
just treatment of the accused, in accordance with cold reason; in such a trial,
no direction, erroneous in fact or in law, may be given to a jury, if it is
seriously likely to affect the latter’s decision with respect to the reasonable
doubt, to the benefit of which the accused is entitled.

Essentially it is to ensure the complete
respect for these principles that I, like my colleague, Mr. Justice Hyde,
and for the reasons given by him, would order a new trial.

And Turgeon J.A. said at p. 83:

[TRANSLATION] I concur with
Mr. Justice Hyde, because I cannot convince myself that the jury would
necessarily have reached the same verdict,

…

I need not repeat examples of where an appellate
court has viewed the fault at trial, whether by the admission of inadmissible
evidence or by the inflammatory address of Crown counsel, as causing a breach
so serious that a new trial must be directed. I turn to make some reference to
the facts in this particular appeal. There is no doubt that Ronald Hartley, the
victim, came to his death because the accused struck him across his head
violently with a chrome chain which the accused had worn around his neck for
over two years regarding it in some peculiar fashion as ornamentation. The
defence of the accused

[Page 149]

was that this was an act of self-defence and
testified that the act of self-defence was taken after the deceased had first
aimed a blow at the accused but missed him. The fatal accident occurred during
a fracas between two groups which may be generally described as “motorcycle
gangs” and took place during a road-side meeting when the gang of which the
accused was a prominent member and which was known as the Grim Reapers were
returning from a place where they had attended, they alleged, at the invitation
and suggestion of the second group, the Outcasts. The Grim Reapers having
attended this place found no one there, turned around, and met the Outcasts
driving toward it. The usual senseless fracas occurred with violence on both
sides. Now, under such circumstances, the establishment of the defence of
self-defence called for a very careful analysis of the steps taken by the
deceased, by the accused and his fellow-accused, and by the other members of
the deceased’s group. Inevitably, the credibility of the various witnesses was
much in issue. There is no doubt that the accused struck the fatal blow. Of the
accused, Emkeit alone gave evidence and he admitted it in his evidence,
alleging, however, as I have said, that he acted in self-defence.

The charge upon which the appellant and his
co-accused were arraigned was:

that they, at or near Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, Alberta, on or about the 7th day of March, A.D.
1970, did unlawfully murder Ronald George Hartley in that each and everyone of
the accused formed an intention in common to carry out the unlawful purpose of
assaulting persons with offensive weapons and to assist each other therein and
that each of them knew or ought to have known that the commission of the
offence of non-capital murder herein alleged against them would be a probable
consequence of the carrying out of the common purpose and did thereby commit
non-capital murder, contrary to the Criminal Code.

And it was the aim of the accused Emkeit’s
counsel to adduce evidence tending to show that Emkeit and his co-accused could
not have formed an intention in common to carry out the

[Page 150]

unlawful purpose of assaulting persons with
offensive weapons. Under these circumstances, counsel for the Crown, in the
course of his cross-examination of the accused, without any foundation or
introduction, suddenly asked the accused, “Is George Lowe a poet?” which
question the accused answered with “Pardon me?”. And then counsel repeated, “Is
he a poet?” to which the accused answered, “I have no idea whether he is a poet
or not”; then counsel left the subject and some five pages later returned to
the subject by saying:

Q. Yes, I will tell you why I asked you if
George was a poet, that’s George Lowe. It seems to me he had a club poem with
him. Did you ever hear it? A. I don’t know.

Q. This is Grim Reapers, I will put it to
you:

“A flash of chrome.”

It’s entitled “Grim Reapers”.

“A flash
of chrome and flying hair,
The Reapers ride with fearless stare.
Citizens scream, daughters beware,
When Reapers ride there is fear in the air.
In the deep of night, with thundering crash,
Deep throated Harleys and Hortons flash.
Out of the night, the wind in their hair,
The Reapers are riding, so citizens take care.
Bikes are their life, they don’t give a damn,
They scorn the world and laugh at the man.
Riding choppers from dawn till dawn,
Knowing damn well they are Satan’s spawn,
Their creed is lust, their bible is hate,
They fuck the world and hell is their fate.”

Is that your poem?

A. No, sir.

Q. It is not? You never heard it before?
Are you saying you never heard the thing before?

[Page 151]

A. I might have heard it, I don’t know. Am
I supposed to remember everything that ever happened in my life?

Counsel for the Crown on this appeal, who also
appeared for the Crown as counsel at the trial, never explained how it seemed
to him that Lowe had a club poem with him. There was no evidence whatsoever as
to how the so-called poem was obtained and there was simply no evidentiary
foundation that the poem had the slightest connection with the accused or any
of his co-accused except the words “Grim Reapers” which counsel for the Crown
in his question had stated was the title of the poem. The document never was
produced. As Brossard J.A. remarked in Regina v. Vallières, supra, it is
understandable that during the course of a long trial counsel for the Crown may
have allowed a passionate appeal to the jury to escape from him when his
attitude towards the accused may subconsciously have been affected by reading
vitriolic articles. In that particular case, the accused had admitted, even
boasted, that he was the author of the articles. In the present case, the
accused denied even any knowledge of the so-called poem.

With the confused state of the evidence as to
the fatal fracas and considering the form of the charge laid in the particular
case, I am of the opinion that the submission made by counsel for the accused
in his factum that this comment by the Crown was calculated to do nothing less
than inflame and prejudice the jury against the accused Emkeit, and the poem
was quoted only for the purpose of showing that Emkeit and the others
implicated were bad men possessed of propensities or dispositions to commit the
crime of murder, is a just comment and I am in accord with it. Therefore, it
would appear that the accused was seriously prejudiced in his trial. An
application to stay the trial was made within a few minutes after the Crown
counsel had put the so-called poem to Emkeit in his cross-examination and that
application was refused by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge, in
his charge, referred to the matter in a few lines in these words:

[Page 152]

In the course of his cross-examination
there was reference made to a poem. Crown counsel read it. Now that may be
inflammatory and of a derogative nature. Don’t let it influence you. It is not
evidence. It is not a statement of the aims of the Grim Reapers. It is a poem,
so what?

Smith, C.J.A., in giving reasons for the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, said:

The jury, having been so warned, I would
dismiss this objection on the ground that the decision whether to discharge the
jury and order that the appellants be tried before a fresh jury is “primarily
for the trial judge to decide upon the circumstances of the particular case”,

relying on the judgment of Rinfret J. in this
court in Paradis v. The King, supra.

With respect, I am of the opinion that the not
very careful warning issued by the trial judge could not possibly have allayed
the very serious prejudice caused by the incomprehensible conduct of the Crown
counsel in putting this so-called poem to the accused in the presence of the
jury. To use the words of both Coffin J.A. and Cooper J.A. in Regina v.
Armstrong, supra, “once the words were sounded the mischief was done”.
Here, the accused man and his co‑accused were charged with forming an
intent to assault persons with deadly weapons and with thereby causing the
death of the deceased man. To attribute to the group a diatribe in which lust
and violence were extolled was not only prejudicial it was reprehensible and it
was a denial of the whole basis for the trial of accused persons in accordance
with the Canadian criminal law, which demands absolute fairness on the part of
the Crown. I refer again to the words of Rand J. in Boucher v. The Queen, which
I have quoted.

I turn to the question of whether the fault in
the trial may be excused by the application of s.

[Page 153]

592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. That
section may be applied and the appeal dismissed if the court “is of the
opinion that notwithstanding the error of law no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred”. This court has reviewed, in many cases,
the application of that subsection or its predecessor and those cases were
summarized and considered in Colpitts v. The Queen[14], where, at p. 755, I adopted the
statement from Brooks v. The King[15],
as follows:

The onus is upon the Crown to satisfy the
Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could not, as reasonable
men, have done otherwise than find the appellant guilty.

Applying that principle to the facts in this
case, the onus is on the Crown to satisfy the court that if the jury had heard
only admissible evidence without the insertion into the trial of this so‑called
poem they could not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise than found the
accused guilty. In view of the confused evidence as to the fracas, the
character of all the persons involved in the fracas, and all of the
circumstances which had preceded the accidental meeting on the roadside, I
cannot say that reasonable men with proper evidence only before them could not
have had reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. I, therefore, would
not apply s. 592(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.

I would allow the appeal and direct that this
accused have the same new trial as had been granted already to his co-accused
by the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta.

Appeal dismissed, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL

Extradition—Extradition crimes—Conspiracy to
import cocaine into the United States—Crime against the laws for the suppression of the traffic in
narcotics—Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, s. 423(1)(d).

The Federal Court of Appeal dismissed
applicant’s application for the cancellation of a warrant of committal under
the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, following indictment by
a Federal grand jury in the United States for violation of ss. 173 and 174 of Title 21, United States Code. This Court granted leave to appeal only on the question as to
whether conspiracy to import a narcotic is an extradition crime within the Extradition
Act. Appellant argued that this Court’s jurisdiction under s. 31(3) of
the Federal Court Act did not permit this Court to limit the grounds
upon which an appeal might be argued and was limited to either granting or
refusing such appeal. This Court pointed out that s. 31(3) of the Federal
Court Act was to the same effect as s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court
Act which provides that the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to grant leave
to appeal only on the specific question of law set out in its order, and was
subject to a similar course. Appellant submitted the argument that the charge
of conspiracy to import a narcotic drug was not listed in Schedule I of the Extradition
Act, and that even if he had been charged in Canada, he could have been
charged only under s. 423(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The Supplementary Convention of 1925, which
was added to the Extradition Act was an extradition arrangement;
therefore, if the crime of conspiring to import a narcotic is a crime “against
the laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics”, it is a crime

[Page 220]

within the definition of “extradition crimes”
described in the Convention. This is the case here. It matters not that had the
indictment been laid in Canada,
it would have been laid under the Criminal Code or the Narcotic
Control Act. The test is what is the essence of the crime charged.

Re Brisbois (1962),
133 C.C.C. 188, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Federal Court
of Appeal[1] dismissing
an application for cancellation of a warrant of committal. Appeal dismissed.

Kenneth C. Binks, Q.C., and William J.
Simpson, for the appellant.

L.P. Landry, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

SPENCE J.—This is an appeal from the judgment of
the Federal Court of Appeal pronounced on January 25, 1974. The appellant
applied to this Court for leave to appeal and set out therein several grounds
of appeal which he wished to argue before this Court. This Court did not grant
leave to appeal on any of those grounds but by its order pronounced on April 29, 1974, did grant leave to appeal upon
the following question of law:

Is conspiracy to import a narcotic an
extradition crime within the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21?

At the opening of the argument of the appeal,
counsel for the appellant sought to argue the other grounds set out in his
application for leave to appeal and submitted that this Court’s jurisdiction
under s. 31(3) of the Federal Court Act, 1970 (Can.), c. 1, did
not permit this Court to limit the grounds upon which an appeal might be argued
and that this Court’s jurisdiction upon such an application for leave to appeal
was limited to either granting or refusing such leave. Section 31 (3) of the Federal
Court Act reads:

[Page 221]

An appeal to the Supreme Court lies with
leave of that Court from any final or other judgment or determination of the
Federal Court of Appeal, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
has been refused by the Federal Court of Appeal.

The Court pointed out to counsel for the
appellant that the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, in
s. 41(1) provides:

Subject to subsection (3), an appeal
lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other
judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge
thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be
appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court has been refused by any other court

and that, therefore, the two sections would
seem to be exactly to the same effect and that over the course of many decades
this Court had exercised the jurisdiction in s. 41(1) of the Supreme
Court Act to grant leave to appeal only on the specific question of law set
out in its order. We were all of the opinion that s. 31(3) of the Federal
Court Act was subject to a similar course and we therefore confined the
appellant to argument upon the ground of appeal for which leave to appeal had
been granted and which I have recited above.

The appellant was indicted by a Federal Grand
Jury in the United States District in the State of New
 York on October 9, 1973, and charged that the
appellant had conspired with others to import cocaine, a narcotic drug, into
the United States contrary to
Title 21, United States Code, ss. 173 and 174. The appellant was also indicted
with another charge with which this appeal is not concerned.

The appellant submitted the argument that the
charge of conspiracy to import a narcotic drug was not listed in Schedule I to
the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, although certain other
conspiracies were listed in the said Schedule I, and that the offences with
which the appellant was charged in the United States courts if charged in
Canada could not have been the subject of a charge under

[Page 222]

the provisions of the Narcotic Control Act but
only under the provisions of s. 423(1)(d) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. 34. The said Extradition Act deals with
“extradition crimes” and extradition crimes are defined in s. 2 thereof as
follows:

“extradition crime” may mean any crime
that, if committed in Canada, or within Canadian jurisdiction, would be one of
the crimes described in Schedule I; and, in the application of this Act to the
case of any extradition arrangement, “extradition crime” means any crime
described in such arrangement, whether or not it is comprised in that Schedule.

Although the crime of conspiracy to import a
narcotic is not, as I have pointed out, in Schedule I of the Extradition
Act, in the year 1925 by a Supplementary Convention there was added a
classification described in s. 17 thereof as follows: “Crimes and offences
against the laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics”.

Referring to the definition of extradition
crimes which I have cited above, it will be seen that such crimes are defined
as including two different classes, firstly, those which were listed in
Schedule I and, secondly, those which were described in such an arrangement, i.e.,
an extradition arrangement. The Supplementary Convention of the year 1925
was an extradition arrangement within that subsection and therefore if the
crime of conspiring to import a narcotic is a crime “against the laws for the
suppression of the traffic in narcotics” it is a crime within the definition of
“extradition crimes” and the Honourable Mr. Justice Lamb had jurisdiction
to consider the application for an extradition order made before him.

I am of the opinion that it matters not whether
the particular indictment, had it been laid in Canada, would have been laid under the provisions of the Criminal Code or
the Narcotic Control Act or in fact any other statute. The test is what
is the essence of the crime charged. I am also of the opinion that the essence
of the crime charged in the indictment by the United States Grand Jury

[Page 223]

was and only could be for a crime against the
laws for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics. I am therefore of the
opinion that Mr. Justice Lamb had jurisdiction.

I have been assisted in coming to this
conclusion by referring to the judgment of McRuer C.J.H.C. in Re Brisbois[2], where the learned Chief Justice
considered on an application for habeas corpus the case of an applicant
who had been convicted in the United States on a charge of “wilfully and
knowingly conspiring to defraud the United States of its governmental functions
to have the lawful function of the United States Customs Service administered
free from obstruction, corruption and improper influence, etc., and conspiring to
violate the United States Narcotic Laws. (Title 18, Sec. 371 U.S.C.) as
charged…” It is the last words “and conspiring to violate the United States
Narcotic Laws” with which we are concerned.

The accused had been convicted and was allowed
out on bail pending the hearing of his appeal but he did not surrender to his
bail and after an abortive attempt to obtain his extradition from the Bahamas the applicant was arrested in Canada and held for examination. The
learned Chief Justice of the High Court considered the issue in a very
carefully reasoned judgment, dealt with all the matters which were alleged in
our Court and said at p. 193:

In my view the criminal law of Canada has to be examined as a whole to
find what laws are designed for the suppression of the traffic in narcotics.
Since a conspiracy to commit breaches of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act is
not exempt from the provisions of s. 408, nor was it exempt from the
provisions of the former s. 573, a conspiracy to commit any of the
indictable offences set out in the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act must be
taken to be included in the laws for the suppression of the traffic in
narcotics.

[Page 224]

The learned Chief Justice of the High Court
concluded that the applicant had been convicted of an offence which came within
the terms of the Treaty existing between Canada and the United States of
America and dismissed the application for habeas corpus.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal and affirm
the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

MOTION TO QUASH AND MOTION FOR LEAVE TO
APPEAL

Criminal law—Obscenity—Forfeiture
order—Prevailing community standards of tolerance—Evidence—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 159(8), 160

Proceedings were taken under s. 160 of
the Criminal Code for the seizure and forfeiture of a certain issue of a
magazine on the ground that it was obscene. An order of forfeiture was made and
an appeal therefrom to the Alberta Appellate Division was dismissed by a
majority judgment with Sinclair J.A. dissenting. In his dissent Sinclair J.A.
was of the opinion that the dominant characteristic of the particular issue of
the magazine was the exploitation of sex but he concluded that the evidence did
not satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt that the exploitation was “undue” so
as to meet the statutory test of obscenity under s. 159(8) of the Criminal
Code. In this Court, the Crown moved to quash the appeal by the accused and
the latter applied for leave to appeal in the event that the motion to quash
succeeded.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence J. dissenting): The motion to quash should be granted and the
application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson and Dickson JJ.: Section 160(6) of the Criminal Code provides
that “an appeal lies from an order [of forfeiture] …(a) on any
ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone, (b) on
any ground of appeal that involves a question of fact alone, or (c) on
any ground of appeal that involves a question of mixed law and fact, as if it
were an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal, as the case may be, on a question of law alone under Part XVIII and
sections 601 to 624 apply mutatis mutandis.” The submission of the
appellants that, by virtue of s. 160(6), the appellants are given the same
right of appeal to this Court as if the dissent of Sinclair

[Page 90]

J.A., on a question of fact, had been
converted into a dissent on a question of law, was not accepted. Subsection (6)
provides for a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal, but the wording is not
apt to describe an appeal to this Court.

The appellants’ submission, on the
application for leave to appeal, that the failure of the Crown to adduce
evidence as to prevailing community standards of tolerance should have resulted
in the dismissal of the Crown’s case at its conclusion, also failed. The
appellants’ contention, i.e., that a court cannot, in law, make an order
of forfeiture under s. 160(4) unless the Crown has led evidence as to
prevailing community standards of tolerance, was not supported by any
authority, and in any event the point did not arise in the present case. The
trial judge did have before him evidence from both sides respecting the matter
of community standards to assist in reaching his conclusion.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence J., dissenting: The motion to quash should be dismissed
but, if necessary, leave to appeal should be granted if only to bring to this
Court the question of required proof by the Crown to establish “undue”
exploitation of sex by way of evidence to show contemporary or prevailing
community standards.

Section 618(1)(a) gives an appeal as
of right to this Court from a conviction which has been affirmed on appeal
(offences punishable by death are treated separately), “on any question of law
on which a judge of the Court of Appeal dissents”. Section 160(6) enjoins that
the rights of appeal given thereunder are to be treated “as if” they were
appeals on a question of law alone. Therefore where there is a dissent on any
ground stated in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of
s. 160(6), it is to be treated as if on a question of law alone for the
purposes of an appeal to this Court. In the result, the apppeal taken here on
the basis of the dissent of Sinclair J.A. comes here as of right.

Also, it is s. 160(6) that is the
dominant provision for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction, and, as provided,
ss. 601 to 624 are to be read conformably to give effect to what s. 160(6)
decrees.

and Spence J. dissenting.

A. Golden, contra motion to quash.

L.H. McDonald, Q.C., for motion for leave
to appeal.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence J. was
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting)—The
question on this application to quash is the scope of the appellate
jurisdiction of this Court under s. 160(6) of the Criminal Code. The
facts out of which the application arises may be briefly stated. Proceedings
were taken under s. 160 for the seizure and forfeiture of the February
1973 number of Penthouse magazine on the ground that it was obscene. An order
of forfeiture was made and an appeal therefrom to the Alberta Appellate
Division was dismissed by a majority judgment with Sinclair J.A. dissenting. In
his dissent Sinclair J.A. was of the opinion that the dominant characteristic
of the particular issue of the magazine was the exploitation of sex but he
concluded that the evidence did not satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt that
the exploitation was “undue” so as to meet the statutory test of obscenity
under s. 159(8) of the Criminal Code.

The dissent of Sinclair J.A. was not on a
question of law, and this is underscored by the fact that the formal order of
the Alberta Appellate Division dismissing the appeal does not specify any
dissent

[Page 92]

on a ground of law, which would have been
necessary under s. 606 of the Criminal Code, if there had been a
dissent on that basis. Notwithstanding this, the appellant filed a notice of
appeal, asserting an appeal as of right by virtue of s. 160(6). If
s. 160(6) does not carry beyond this Court’s normal jurisdiction to
entertain an appeal as of right, as specified in s. 618(1)(a) then
the motion to quash must succeed. I may say here that the appellant responded
to the motion to quash by a counter-application for leave to appeal but I leave
this for later consideration. If there is no appeal as of right under
s. 160(6), that is not therefore the end of this matter. I am of the view,
however, that wittingly or not, Parliament has given an appeal as of right to
this Court under s. 160(6) where it would not lie if taken under
s. 618(1)(a) alone.

Section 160(6) reads as follows:

An appeal lies from an order made under
subsection (4) or (5) by any person who appeared in the proceedings

(a) On any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

(b) on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of fact alone, or

(c) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of mixed law and fact,

as if it were an appeal against conviction
or against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be, on a
question of law alone under Part XVIII and sections 601 to 624 apply mutatis
mutandis.

Because proceedings under s. 160 are, so to
speak, proceedings in rem it is understandable that there be some
express mention of appeals, “as if”, to use the words of s. 160(6), they
were appeals against conviction or acquittal. The specification in clauses (a),
(b) and (c) of grounds of appeal is followed by the
declaration that appeal on those grounds is to be treated as if the appeal was
on a question of law alone under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code, the
Part that deals with appeals to the provincial Court of Appeal and to this
Court in respect of

[Page 93]

indictable offences. There is, moreover, the
important reference in the concluding words of s. 160 (6) that
“sections 601 to 624 apply mutatis mutandis”.

If reference is made to Part XVIII respecting
appeals to the provincial Court of Appeal on a question of law alone where
there has been a conviction, it will be seen that under s. 603(1)(a)
an appeal on a question of law alone can be brought as of right but an appeal
on any other ground, whether of fact or mixed law and fact or otherwise,
requires leave. (I leave out of consideration an appeal based on a certificate
of the trial judge.) Section 160(6) says, however, that an appeal on any of the
grounds specified in clauses (a), (b) and (c)
thereof lies as if it were on a question of law alone, and hence it appears quite
clear to me that appeals under those clauses do not require leave because none
is required under s. 603(1)(a)(i) where a question of law
alone is involved.

Moving then to s. 618 which governs appeals
to this Court from conviction or acquittal, s. 618(1)(a) gives
an appeal as of right from a conviction which has been affirmed on appeal
(offences punishable by death are treated separately), “on any question of law
on which a judge of the Court of Appeal dissents”. Section 160(6) enjoins that
the rights of appeal given thereunder are to be treated “as if” they were
appeals on a question of law alone. I cannot therefore escape from the
conclusion that where there is a dissent on any ground stated in clauses (a),
(b) or (c) of s. 160(6), it is to be treated as if on a
question of law alone for purposes of an appeal to this Court. In the result,
the appeal taken here on the basis of the dissent of Sinclair J.A. comes here
as of right.

It is not only the enveloping words “as if” that
compel this conclusion, but as well the direction

[Page 94]

that ss. 601 to 624 of the Criminal Code be
read mutatis mutandis for the purposes of s. 160(6), that is with
the necessary changes in points of detail. It is s. 160(6) that is the
dominant provision for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction, and ss. 601 to
624 are to be read conformably to give effect to what s. 160(6) decrees.

If I am correct in this assessment of the scope
of appellate jurisdiction, I do not think that the appellants require any
further leave to raise other points; it seems to me they are already involved
in the appeal as of right. However, if I am wrong, I would be disposed to give
leave to appeal if only to bring to this Court the question of required proof
by the Crown to establish “undue” exploitation of sex by way of evidence to
show contemporary or prevailing community standards. I take this both from the
judgment of Judson J. in Brodie, Dansky and Rubin v. The Queen[2] and the judgment of Freedman J.A.,
as he then was, in R. v. Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd.[3], adopted unanimously by this Court[4]. In the present case, the Crown led no
evidence at all of community standards. I think it important for this Court to
decide whether on a question of obscenity the trial judge can proceed unaided
by Crown evidence to determine for himself, as if a question of law alone was
involved, whether there was undue exploitation of sex. I refrain from any
further exposition of this matter on an application for leave.

I would dismiss the motion to quash but, if
necessary, I would give leave to appeal.

The judgment of Martland, Judson and Dickson JJ.
was delivered by

MARTLAND J.—The circumstances which led up to
the respondent’s motion to quash and to the appellants’ motion for leave to
appeal are set out in

[Page 95]

the reasons of the Chief Justice. I agree with
him that the dissenting reasons of Sinclair J.A., in the Appellate Division,
did not constitute a dissent on a question of law within the meaning of
s. 618(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

The submission of the appellants in response to
the motion to quash is that, by virtue of s. 160(6) of the Criminal
Code, the appellants are given the same right of appeal to this Court as if
the dissent of Sinclair J.A., on a question of fact, had been converted into a
dissent on a question of law.

The relevant portions of s. 160 provide as
follows:

160. (1) A
judge who is satisfied by information upon oath that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that any publication, copies of which are kept for sale
or distribution in premises within the jurisdiction of the court, is obscene or
a crime comic, shall issue a warrant under his hand authorizing seizure of the
copies.

* *
*

(3) The owner and the author of the matter
seized and alleged to be obscene or a crime comic may appear and be represented
in the proceedings in order to oppose the making of an order for the forfeiture
of the said matter.

(4) If the court is satisfied that the
publication is obscene or a crime comic, it shall make an order declaring the
matter forfeited to Her Majesty in right of the province in which the
proceedings take place, for disposal as the Attorney General may direct.

(5) If the court is not satisfied that the
publication is obscene or a crime comic, it shall order that the matter be
restored to the person from whom it was seized forthwith after the time for
final appeal has expired.

(6) An appeal lies from an order made under
subsection (4) or (5) by any person who appeared in the proceedings

(a) on any ground of appeal
that involves a question of law alone,

(b) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of fact alone, or

(c) on any ground of appeal that
involves a question of mixed law and fact,

[Page 96]

as if it were an appeal against conviction
or against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, as the case may be, on a
question of law alone under Part XVIII and sections 601 to 624 apply mutatis
mutandis.

I do not agree with this submission. Section
160(6) gives the right to “an appeal”, in the singular. The grounds for such an
appeal are defined in paras, (a), (b) and (c); i.e.,
grounds involving: (a) a question of law alone; (b) a question of fact
alone; or (c) a question of mixed law and fact. These are the grounds on which
a person convicted by a trial court in proceedings by indictment may appeal “against
his conviction” to the court of appeal under s. 603(1)(a)(i) or
(ii). The first ground, (a), is one on which the Attorney General may appeal
under s. 605(1)(a) against “a judgment or verdict of
acquittal” of a trial court in proceedings by indictment.

Proceedings under s. 160 do not result in a
conviction or a judgment or verdict of acquittal, and therefore the right of
appeal given by ss. 603(1)(a)(i) and (ii) and 605(1)(a) would not
be available to a party affected by an order made under subs. (4) or subs. (5)
of that section. For this reason, subs. (6) goes on to provide “as if it were
an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or verdict of acquittal, as
the case may be”.

An appeal against conviction by a trial court in
proceedings by indictment, under s. 603(1)(a)(ii), does not lie in
respect of a question of fact alone or in respect of a question of mixed law
and fact unless leave is obtained from the court of appeal or a judge thereof
or upon the certificate of the trial judge that the case is a proper case for
appeal. The Attorney General cannot appeal from a judgment or verdict of
acquittal in proceedings by indictment, pursuant to s. 605(1)(a),
save on a ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone.

[Page 97]

Subsection (6) obviates the need to obtain
leave or a certificate for an appeal on a question of fact alone or on a
question of mixed law and fact and eliminates the limitation on the right of
the Attorney General to appeal only on questions of law by providing that an appeal
under s. 160(6) lies as if it were an appeal “on a question of law alone”.

Because subs. (6) relates to “an appeal” and
because the phraseology used in defining that appeal is taken from those
provisions of the Criminal Code which govern the right of appeal to the
court of appeal in proceedings by indictment, it is my opinion that that
portion of subs. (6) which I have so far discussed provides, and provides only,
for a right of appeal to the court of appeal. The wording is not apt to
describe an appeal to this Court. Subsection (6) uses the words “as if it
were an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or verdict of
acquittal”. An appeal by the accused to the court of appeal under s. 603
is an appeal “against his conviction”. An appeal by the Attorney General to the
court of appeal under s. 605 is an appeal “against a judgment or verdict
of acquittal”. An appeal to this Court by an accused person in respect of an
indictable offence (other than an offence punishable by death) is brought under
s. 618 which provides, in subs. (1), for an appeal by a person convicted
of an indictable offence whose conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal,
and in subs. (2) for an appeal by a person who is acquitted of an indictable
offence whose conviction, is set aside by the court of appeal. An appeal to
this Court by the Attorney General in respect of an indictable offence is
brought under s. 621 “where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a
conviction pursuant to an appeal taken under section 603 or 604 or
dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to paragraph 605(1)(a) or
subsection 605(3)”. An appeal to this Court under s. 618 or
s. 621 is not an appeal against conviction or against a judgment or
verdict of acquittal. It is an appeal from a judgment by a

[Page 98]

court of appeal affirming or setting aside a
conviction or an acquittal.

The concluding words of subs. (6) “and
sections 601 to 624 apply mutatis mutandis”, which
sections include those which provide for appeals to this Court, are not
sufficient to permit an appeal to this Court on a question of fact. In so far
as this Court is concerned they only mean that ss. 618 to 624 are applicable in
respect of an appeal from the court of appeal in forfeiture proceedings under
s. 160. I do not construe them as meaning that those sections are to
be applicable to an appeal to this Court from a court of appeal in forfeiture
proceedings under s. 160 with the added proviso that in such appeal the
words “any question of law” wherever they appear in ss. 618 to 624 shall
include “any question of fact”.

For these reasons it is my opinion that the
motion to quash should be granted.

The appellants applied for leave to appeal to
this Court in the event that the motion to quash succeeded. The appellants’
submission is that the failure of the Crown to adduce evidence as to prevailing
community standards of tolerance should have resulted in the dismissal of the
Crown’s case at its conclusion. In essence, the contention is that a court
cannot, in law, make an order of forfeiture under s. 160 (4) unless the
Crown has led evidence as to prevailing community standards of tolerance.

Counsel for the appellants did not cite any
decided case which has so held. In this Court, in Brodie v. The Queen[5], forfeiture proceedings under
s. 150A of the Criminal Code (now s. 160) were under
consideration and the issue was as to whether the book “Lady Chatterley’s
Lover” was obscene within the meaning of s. 150 (now s. 159). The
Crown rested its case on the mere production of the book. Evidence on behalf of
the defence was

[Page 99]

submitted as to its literary merit. There is no
suggestion in that case that the Crown could not establish a case without
calling supporting evidence. Judson J., whose reasons were supported by three
other members of the majority, held only that the defence evidence was
admissible and had assisted him in reaching the conclusion that the book was
not obscene.

In Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd. v.
The Queen[6], this
Court agreed with the reasons of Freedman J.A. (as he then was) who had
dissented in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[7],
at p. 125. In that case also the Crown had relied upon the contents of the
publications themselves as proof of their obscenity. The defence called one
witness to testify as to community standards of morality. Again there was no
suggestion in the judgments rendered that, in law, the Crown had to adduce
evidence of that kind. Freedman J.A. stated that, in determining the issue of
obscenity, contemporary standards of tolerance should be applied, but in
reaching his conclusion on this issue it appears that he did not base it upon
the defence evidence on this point, but upon his own consideration of the
contents of the publications.

In R. v. Great West News Ltd., Mantell and
Mitchell[8],
the Court of Appeal for Manitoba held that the magazines in question were
obscene. The main point raised by the defence was that the Crown must fail
because it had not led evidence as to prevailing community standards. Dickson
J.A. (as he then was), with whom Smith C.J.M. concurred, held (at p. 314)
that such evidence is admissible but not essential. Freedman J.A., the other
member of the Court, while he wrote separate reasons, which did not deal with
this point, concurred in the dismissal of the defendants’ appeal.

[Page 100]

Apart from the merits of the point raised by the
appellants, I do not think that it arises in the present case. The appellants
raised this issue at the conclusion of the Crown’s case on a motion for
dismissal, but, when that motion was refused, the appellants did not rest their
case upon this point, but, instead, elected to call evidence. The Crown then
called in rebuttal an administrative officer of the Department of Culture,
Youth & Recreation, who was the secretary of the Advisory Board on Objectionable
Publications in Alberta. He gave evidence that such Board had considered the
publication in question along with other issues of the same work and had found
them to be objectionable.

In the result, the trial judge did have before
him evidence from both sides respecting the matter of community standards to
assist in reaching his conclusion.

I would dismiss the application for leave to
appeal.

appeal dismissed, LASKIN C.J. and SPENCE J. dissenting.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Theft—Indictment—Charge
alleging ownership in “Westwood Jewellers Limited”—Evidence establishing owner
as individual carrying on business under name of “Westwood Jewellers”—Whether
ground for acquittal.

The appellants were charged with stealing two
diamond rings, the property of Westwood Jewellers Limited. The evidence
established that the store from which the rings were taken was known as
“Westwood Jewellers”, owned and managed by a Mr. Nuytten. At the
conclusion of the Crown’s case, the defence moved for dismissal of the charge
on the submission that the Crown had failed to lead evidence of ownership of
the rings in Westwood Jewellers Limited, as charged in the indictment.
The judge entered an acquittal on the ground that the Crown had charged
ownership in West-wood Jewellers Limited and proven ownership in
Mr. Nuytten. On appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and
convicted the two accused. Appeals by the accused were then brought to this
Court.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie and de Grandpré JJ.: If the owner of an object allegedly stolen is
mentioned in an indictment and if his ownership is not proven and there are no
other circumstances to indicate to the accused the true nature of the charge,
an acquittal should be entered. However, when, as in the present case, there
cannot be any possibility for the accused to fail to identify the transaction
about which they are charged, there is no reason to discharge the accused for
the sole reason that the owner mentioned in the indictment has not been
mentioned in the evidence.

Per Dickson
and Beetz JJ.: On a charge of theft, save in exceptional circumstances as, for
example, when theft can be inferred from the suspicious circumstances of the

[Page 21]

accused’s possession, an allegation of
ownership is not mere surplusage. If such an allegation is contained in an
indictment and not proven, the charge must be dismissed.

The present case fell within the narrow
compass of whether it was fatal to the position of the Crown to allege
ownership in X Company Limited and prove ownership in X Company. On a charge of
theft the identity of the owner of the property alleged to have been stolen is
sufficiently established, in instances in which the owner is named in the
indictment, when, as in this case, (i) the evidence adduced by the Crown
reasonably identifies the owner with the person named in the indictment as
owner, and (ii) it is clear that failure to prove the identity of the owner
with greater precision has not misled or prejudiced the accused in preparation
or presentation of the defence.

APPEALS from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal for Manitoba[1], allowing the
Crown’s appeal from the acquittal of the accused, by Hewak Co. Ct. J., on a
charge of theft. Appeals dismissed.

P. Schulman, for the appellants.

J. Guy, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRE J.—The appellants were indicted as
follows:

That the said Richard William Wolski, and
Robert Gary Little, on or about the 22nd day of July in the year of our Lord
one thousand nine hundred and seventy-two, at or near the City of Winnipeg in
the Eastern Judicial District in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully

[Page 22]

steal two diamond rings to a total value
exceeding two hundred dollars, the property of Westwood Jewellers Limited
situate at 3298 Portage Avenue
in the aforesaid City of Winnipeg and did thereby commit theft.

At the conclusion of the evidence presented by
the Crown, the accused moved for a dismissal on the ground that there was no
evidence to show that Westwood Jewellers Limited was the owner of the diamond
rings mentioned in the indictment. Hewak Co. Ct. J., after a full review of the
authorities, found himself “compelled to discharge the accused”.

The trial judge had posed the problem in the
following terms:

I am satisfied on the totality of the
evidence before me that Little and Wolski not only knew one another but had
entered the premises of Westwood Jewellers Limited for the purpose of
committing a theft. I am satisfied that the accused Little acted as a decoy
while Wolski made his way to the jewel case and removed the rings from the case
after which time both accused fled the scene.

The only question that must be resolved is
the question of the ownership specified in the indictment.

To resolve the question, he sought guidance in a
principle which he expressed in the following terms:

While it is well-settled law that proof of
ownership can be proven not only by direct evidence but by circumstantial
evidence, the fact remains that there must be evidence proving ownership in the
person alleged to be the owner in the indictment.

In that light, he looked at the evidence which
contains, amongst others, the following:

Q. I understand, Mr. Nuytten, you are
the manager of Westwood Jewellers, located at 3298 Portage Avenue, in the City
of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Were you the owner and manager of
Westwood Jewellers on July 22nd, 1972?

A. Yes, I was. 

and he concluded:

[Page 23]

Here, however, Westwood Jewellers Limited
was specified as the owner in the indictment whereas the evidence established
Nuytten as the owner. Nuytten and West‑wood Jewellers Limited, in law,
are two separate and distinct individuals.

On an appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal
came to the conclusion that a point of law existed enabling a Crown appeal to
be taken, and had this to say on the substance:

No one, throughout the case, referred to
the entity of “Westwood Jewellers Limited” but there is no question that the
premises where the offence was alleged to have taken place were called
“Westwood Jewellers”, that the premises were situate at 3298 Portage Avenue, in
Winnipeg, and that the rings were stolen from those premises.

Matas J., speaking for the Court, re-examined
all the relevant cases and concluded:

In the case at bar, use of the corporate
name in the indictment did not mislead in any way: the accused had sufficient
knowledge, by the indictment, of the circumstances of the offence; they had
reasonable information with respect to the act alleged in the indictment
sufficient to identify the transaction. There was no prejudice to them. This is
not a case of a charge against a company where status and exact terminology
would be an important detail. (cf. R. v. Pelissiers Limited, [1926] 1
W.W.R. 189 (Man. C.A.).)

With respect, acquittal, under the
circumstances of the case, would be in direct contravention of the plain words
of s. 512(g) of the Code and would negate the clear
intention of Parliament.

I agree with this result.

The crime of theft is defined in s. 283 of
the Criminal Code and I quote the relevant paragraph:

283. (1)
Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or
fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of
another person, anything whether animate or inanimate, with intent,

(a) to deprive, temporarily
or absolutely, the owner of it or a person who has a special property or
interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it,

[Page 24]

To be fair to the accused and to bring home to
him the offence with which he is charged, the Code has enacted various
provisions as to counts and indictments of which the following should be quoted
here:

510. (2) The
statement referred to in subsection (1) may be

(a) in popular language
without technical averments or allegations of matters that are not essential to
be proved,

(b) in the words of the
enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an
indictable offence, or

(c) in words that are
sufficient to give to the accused notice of the offence with which he is
charged.

(3) A count shall contain sufficient detail
of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused reasonable
information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against him and to
identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or insuficiency
of details does not vitiate the count.

512. No
count in an indictment is insufficient by reason of the absence of details
where, in the opinion of the court, the count otherwise fulfils the
requirements of section 510 and, without restricting the generality of the
foregoing, no count in an indictment is insufficient by reason only that

(b) it does not name the
person who owns or has a special property or interest in property mentioned in
the count,

(g) it does not name or
describe with precision any person, place or thing, or

The purpose of these provisions is clearly, on
the one hand, to avoid undue technicalities and, on the other hand, to permit
the accused to know exactly the transaction which is the basis of the charge.
On this latter aspect of the matter, Rinfret J., as he was then, speaking for
the Court, had this to say in Brodie v. The King[2], at p. 194:

Those are the very words of the section;
and they were put there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one of its
main objects being that the accused may have a fair trial and consequently that
the indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable precision the act or
acts with which he is charged, in order that he may be advised of

[Page 25]

the particular offence alleged against him
and prepare his defence accordingly.

Once this aspect has been covered and the
accused has been assured of a fair trial because he has been made aware of the
substance of the charge and of the circumstances of the transaction, the other
aspect must be looked at, namely the desire of Parliament not to burden the
administration of justice with a narrow, technical and legalistic approach. On
this point, it is worth comparing the wording of s. 283, para. 1, and
that of s. 512, para. (b); both these sections refer to
the owner of a thing or to a person having a special property or interest
therein.

If, however, the name of the alleged owner is
mentioned in the indictment, is it correct to state that, unless ownership in
that person is proven by the Crown, the charge must be dismissed? I am not
ready to accept that this is a true statement of the law.

All of the relevant cases having been discussed
in the Courts below, it would serve no useful purpose to review them here.
However, it should be noted that many of these cases rely on the Australian
case of Trainer v. The King[3], where
Griffith C.J. expressed the following view:

The Law of England, and it is the same
here, requires the ownership of the property to be laid in the indictment and
proved. There is ample power of amendment, but in the absence of amendment it
must be proved as laid.

In my opinion, this view does not take into
consideration what is now ss. 510 and 512 of the Criminal Code, sections which,
in substance, have been in existence since 1892 and which do create in Canada a situation different from that
summarized by Griffith C.J. above. This situation, of course, brings to mind
the following note of caution to be found at the end of the Brodie case,
supra, at p. 199:

[Page 26]

We do not want to part with this appeal,
however, without saying that our decision is strictly limited to the points in
issue. We would not like to be taken as subscribing to certain generalities
contained in some of the judgments to which we have been referred and which
would tend to convey the idea that, notwithstanding the coming into force of
the Criminal Code, the criminal law in this country should continue to be
administered as though there were no Code.

There is no doubt that, if the owner of the
object allegedly stolen is mentioned in the indictment and if his ownership is
not proven and there are no other circumstances to indicate to the accused the
true nature of the charge, an acquittal should be entered. However, when, as in
the present case, there cannot be any possibility for the accused to fail to
identify the transaction about which they are charged, there is no reason to
discharge the accused for the sole reason that the owner mentioned in the
indictment has not been mentioned in the evidence.

In the present case, the following factors have
to be underlined:

(1) the jewellery store where the offence was
alleged to have taken place was situated in the Westwood Shopping Centre;

(2) this store was known, and proven to be so,
as Westwood Jewellers;

(3) the premises were situated at 3298 on Portage Avenue in Winnipeg;

(4) Little gave a statement to the police,
statement which was accepted in evidence, wherein he admitted having been in
Westwood Jewellers at the time of the alleged theft;

(5) Wolski, on his part, although denying to the
police having been inside Westwood Jewellers, was brought by the police to the
Shopping Centre and had his attention directed to West-wood Jewellers.

In my opinion, on the whole of the evidence, it
is clear that the accused have been given sufficient information about the
circumstances of the alleged offence and were at all times in a position to
identify the transaction referred to in the indictment. Accordingly, it is my
view that they have received a fair trial.

[Page 27]

It is obvious from the foregoing that the appeal
by the Crown to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba raised a point of law so there was jurisdiction in that Court.

On the whole, I would confirm the judgment
appealed from and would dispose of the matter in accordance with the order of
the Court of Appeal.

The judgment of Dickson and Beetz JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—This case raises a short but
interesting point as to proof of ownership on a charge of theft. The appellants
were charged with stealing two diamond rings the property of Westwood Jewellers
Limited, situate at 3298 Portage Avenue in the City of Winnipeg. The evidence
established that the store from which the rings were taken was known as
Westwood Jewellers, that it was situate at 3298 Portage Avenue in the City of
Winnipeg and that the owner and manager of Westwood Jewellers on the day of the
alleged offence was a Mr. Nuytten. At the conclusion of the Crown’s case,
the defence moved for dismissal of the charge on the submission that the Crown
had failed to lead evidence of ownership of the rings in West-wood Jewellers Limited,
as charged. On the specific point of ownership, one finds this evidence of
Mr. Nuytten:

Q. I understand, Mr. Nuytten, you are
the manager of Westwood Jewellers, located at 3298 Portage Avenue, in the City
of Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Were you the owner and manager of
Westwood Jewellers on July 22nd, 1972?

A. Yes, I was.

Mr. Nuytten was not cross-examined on this
point.

The judge, Hewak Co.Ct.J., said:

As previously stated, in this case the
indictment alleges ownership to be in a corporate entity, Westwood Jewellers
Limited. The evidence, however, establishes that the ownership of the goods is
in a person, i.e., Nuytten. The Court cannot and should not bridge this gap by
inferring that since Nuytten described himself as

[Page 28]

manager and owner of Westwood Jewellers
situated at 3298 Portage Avenue and since the indictment specified the owner to
be Westwood Jewellers Limited situated at 3298 Portage Avenue, the stolen
property in question really belonged to Westwood Jewellers Limited and not to
George Nuytten. Such an inference might have been possible had there been some
evidence that Nuytten owned controlling shares in a company known as West-wood
Jewellers Limited and that Westwood Jewellers Limited was carrying on business
under the firm name and style of Westwood Jewellers. In the absence of such
evidence, however, it is as reasonable to infer that Nuytten, in his personal
capacity, was carrying on business under the firm name and style of Westwood
Jewellers at that address rather than the limited company.

The judge entered an acquittal on the ground the
Crown had charged ownership in Westwood Jewellers Limited and proven ownership
in Mr. Nuytten. He applied such cases as R. v. Carswell[4]; R. v. Cassils[5]; and R. v. Scott[6], all decisions of the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which support the proposition that if A is
named as owner of property alleged to have been stolen the Crown cannot succeed
if it is established in evidence that B is in fact the owner. The judge would
seem to have been under the impression that the Crown had alleged ownership in
one person and had proven ownership in another person. With respect, I do not
think that is what occurred in this case. The charge alleged ownership in
Westwood Jewellers Limited; the evidence established that the owner was
Westwood Jewellers, or more precisely, Nuytten carrying on business under the
firm name and style of Westwood Jewellers. The question which emerges,
therefore, is whether failure of the Crown to prove “Limited” results in an
acquittal. The Court of Appeal for Manitoba answered this question in the
negative, I think correctly.

I have had the advantage of reading the reasons
prepared by my brother de Grandpré and I agree with him that these appeals must
fail. I regret, however, I am unable to agree with him that if the

[Page 29]

name of an alleged owner is stated in an
indictment and ownership in that person is not proven by the Crown, the charge
will none the less stand if there is no possibility for the accused to fail to
identify the transaction referred to. In my opinion, save in exceptional
circumstances as, for example, when theft can be inferred from the suspicious
circumstances of the accused’s possession, an allegation of ownership is not
mere surplusage. There are many authorities which support the proposition that
if such an allegation is contained in an indictment and not proven, the charge
must be dismissed. See, for example, R. v. Meloche[7], in which Schroeder J.A., at
p. 189, said:

It is well settled that on a charge of
theft the Crown is required to prove ownership of the thing alleged to have
been stolen in some person other than the accused. In a case such as the
present, where the Crown names a person in the indictment as owner, it must
prove that person’s ownership and no other person’s: R. v. Carswell (1916),
26 C.C.C. 288, 29 D.L.R. 589, 10 Alta. L.R. 76; R. v. Cassils, 57 C.C.C.
366, 26 Alta. L.R. 180, [1932] 1 W.W.R. 572; R. v. Bagshaw (not yet
reported) [since reported [1970] 3 O.R. 3, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 193, 10 C.R.N.S.
245], decided by this Court on February 25, 1970.

Nor can I agree with my brother de Grandpré that
this is a case in which the name of the alleged owner is mentioned in the
indictment and the Crown has failed to mention that owner in the evidence. It
seems to me that the case falls within the narrower compass to which I have
referred, namely whether it is fatal to the position of the Crown to allege
ownership in X Company Limited and prove ownership in X Company. The question
is one of sufficiency of proof, not absence of proof, of, in this case, an
essential ingredient of the charge. It should also be observed that we are not
here concerned with an attack upon the indictment, the sufficiency of which is
conceded by counsel for the appellants.

The first of the authorities to which I would

[Page 30]

refer is R. v. Sheppard[8], decided by the Ontario Court of
Appeal, in which the charge was for alteration of a cheque and named W.J.
Lintell and Sons, whereas in fact the cheque was that of W.J. Lintell & Sons
Ltd. The facts were the converse of the present case. Roach J.A., delivering
the judgment of the Court, made this comment, p. 302:

Even under the old common law a person
might be described by his or her real name or that by which he or she was
usually known.

Here in Toronto if one is heard to speak of
“The T. Eaton Company”, is any doubt left in the mind of the listener as to
what firm is meant? The same applies when people speak of “Simpsons” or
“Ryrie-Birks”.

In R. v. Meloche, supra, the charge was one
of theft from Steinberg’s Miracle Mart. In dismissing the charge, the
Provincial Court judge said there was reasonable doubt in his mind as to
whether Steinberg’s Miracle Mart had capacity to own anything. The Ontario
Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal. Schroeder J.A. said, p. 192:

The Crown having made out a prima facie case
against the accused by establishing de facto possession of the goods in
question in a firm known to the public as Steinberg’s Miracle Mart, that firm’s
ownership of the property was never put in issue and the prima facie proof
stands unassailed. If the issue had been raised, it would then have been
incumbent on the Crown to prove the name of the owner of the goods with
precision—a task of very little difficulty.

Meloche s case
was followed by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Francis (1970),
unreported, in which the respondent was charged with theft of eight canvas mail
bags containing money the property of Modern Music Co. Ltd., and acquitted by a
Provincial Court judge at Sault Ste. Marie. On appeal, Gale C.J.O. for the
Court said:

There was evidence to the effect that some
canvas bags containing money were stolen from “Modern Music Company” or “Modern
Music”. However, no witness actually stated that the bags were owned by

[Page 31]

“Modem Music Co. Ltd.”, and hence the
learned judge decided that the charge should be dismissed. We are all of the
view that he was quite wrong in coming to that conclusion, and need only refer
to the provisions of s. 498 of the Criminal Code, and to a recent
judgment of this Court in R. v. Catherine Anne Meloche delivered on June
10, 1970, as yet unreported.

In R. v. Pelletier[9], decided by the Appeal Division of
the New Brunswick Supreme Court, the charge was one of theft of copper wire
from Fraser Companies Limited. Various witnesses referred to the Company as
“Fraser Company”, “Fraser”, “Fraser’s” and “Fraser Pulpmill”. The Court held
this to be adequate evidence of ownership by Fraser Companies Ltd. There was no
necessity to prove the corporate status of the company or that it was in good
standing. In R. v. Emmons[10], Allen
J.A. of the Appellate Division of the Alberta Supreme Court reviewed many of
the authorities. In this case the owner of the stolen goods was described in
the charge as “Taylor Pearson and Carson Electronics Ltd.” The facts
established by the evidence showed there was no such company. The owner of the
stolen property was Taylor Pearson & Carson Ltd. which carried on business
under three “division” names, including that of Taylor Pearson & Carson
Electronics Division. It was argued on the appeal that the true identity and
existence of the alleged owner of the stolen property was not established at
the trial but the Court dismissed the appeal. Finally, I might refer to R.
v. Schemenaur[11], in
which the British Columbia Court of Appeal held there was sufficient
identification of Kelly Douglas & Co. Ltd., owner of the stolen property,
by references to the Kelly Douglas Company or Kelly Douglas.

One can discern throughout these cases support
for the proposition that on a charge of theft the identity of the owner of
property alleged to have been stolen is sufficiently established, in instances
in which the owner is named in the indictment, when (i) the evidence adduced by
the Crown rea-

[Page 32]

sonably identifies the owner with the person
named in the indictment as owner, and (ii) it is clear that failure to prove
the identity of the owner with greater precision has not misled or prejudiced
the accused in preparation or presentation of his defence. In my view the
evidence in this case reasonably identified the owner of the stolen diamond
rings with the person named in the indictment as owner, and the accused were in
no way misled or prejudiced in their defence by failure to prove identity with
greater precision.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeals.

Appeals dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Habitual criminal—Prolonged
record of offences against property—No crimes of violence involved—Whether
expedient for protection of public to impose sentence of preventive
detention—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 688.

The appellant appealed to this Court from a
majority judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing his
appeal from a sentence of preventive detention, imposed on May 22, 1973,
pursuant to s. 688 of the Criminal Code, in lieu of a sentence of
two years imposed on May 11, 1971, following conviction on a charge of breaking
and entering and theft of automobile keys. The appellant was 44 years of age at
the time the habitual criminal proceedings were taken, and since 1948 he had
been convicted of 28 criminal offences. These involved crimes against property
and did not involve violence. The majority of the convictions related in some
manner to automobiles.

In 1968, on his 24th conviction, habitual
criminal proceedings were commenced against the appellant. The magistrate found
him to be an habitual criminal but did not find that it was expedient for the
protection of the public to sentence him to preventive detention. The magistrate
dismissed the application. Subsequent to those proceedings, the appellant was
convicted of possession of a stolen vehicle and still later of three further
automobile-related offences.

Held (Martland
and Ritchie JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the case remitted
to the Court of Appeal to pass sentence in respect of the substantive offence.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ.: Habitual
criminal legislation and preventive detention are primarily designed for the
persistent dangerous criminal and not for those with a prolonged record of
minor offences against property.

[Page 40]

The dominant purpose is to protect the public
when the past conduct of the criminal demonstrates a propensity for crimes of
violence against the person, and there is a real and present danger to life or
limb. That is not to say that crimes against property can never be cause for
the invocation of preventive detention legislation.

The appellant’s irrational, senseless conduct
was no doubt of annoyance to everyone, incommoding owners and vexing
authorities, but it partook more of the quality of a nuisance than of a menace.
The appellant was a bane rather than a danger to society.

Per Martland
and Ritchie JJ., dissenting: The special feature about this case
was the finding, in 1968, that the appellant was an habitual criminal,
although, at that time, it was not considered expedient to impose preventive
detention. Notwithstanding this warning, the appellant continued to commit
crimes, and his conduct was such as could not be dismissed as being merely a
nuisance.

This was a case of an incorrigible criminal,
whose criminal activities will continue indefinitely if he is not detained. If
s. 688 can be applied so as to protect the public from continued crimes
against property, and there is nothing in the section which says that it
cannot, then, this was clearly a case for its application, as found by the
Courts below.

appellant’s appeal from a sentence of preventive detention pursuant to
s. 688 of the Criminal Code. Appeal allowed, Martland and Ritchie
JJ. dissenting.

respondent.

[Page 41]

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Judson, Spence,
Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—This is an appeal from a majority
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Robertson and Bull JJ.A.)
dismissing an appeal by Robert William Hatchwell from a sentence of preventive
detention imposed by Judge Johnson on May 22, 1973, at the City of Vancouver,
pursuant to s. 688 of the Criminal Code, in lieu of a sentence of
two years imposed by Judge Anderson on May 11, 1971, following conviction of
the appellant on a charge of breaking and entering and theft of automobile
keys. McFarlane J.A., dissenting, would have allowed the appeal and, exercising
the power conferred on the Court by Code s. 695(3), quashed the
sentence of preventive detention and imposed a sentence of six years’
imprisonment consecutive in lieu of the two-year sentence.

From the admissions of facts it appears the
appellant was 44 years of age at the time the habitual criminal proceedings
were taken, and since 1948 he has been convicted of 28 criminal offences, of
which 22 were related in some manner to automobiles, such as theft of a motor
vehicle, possession of a stolen motor vehicle, breaking and entering to steal
automobile keys and driving offences. The five non-automobile-related offences
are: escaping lawful custody (May 1949); dealing with a forged cheque in the
amount of $176.01 (April 1960); theft of a skill saw (December 1965);
possession of a stolen electric razor and stamps (December 1965); possession of
housebreaking instruments, to wit, a flashlight, pair of gloves and screwdriver
(November 1967).

In 1968, on his 24th conviction, habitual criminal
proceedings were commenced against the appellant. On June 11, 1968, Magistrate
Isman found him to be an habitual criminal but did not

[Page 42]

find that it was expedient for the protection of
the public to sentence him to preventive detention. The magistrate dismissed
the application. Subsequent to those proceedings, the appellant was convicted
in July 1969 of possession of a stolen vehicle and in early 1971 of three
further offences committed during “a single spree” while on a three-day work pass
from custody, namely, possession of a stolen vehicle; break, enter and theft of
automobile keys (the substantive offence giving rise to the habitual criminal
proceedings commenced on July 15, 1971); driving a motor vehicle with more
than 80 mgs. per 100 mls. of alcohol in his blood.

Section 688 of the Code has two arms.
Where an accused has been convicted of an indictable offence, the Court may,
upon application, impose a sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any
other sentence that might be imposed for the offence for which he was
convicted, if (a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal and (b) the
Court is of the opinion that because the accused is an habitual criminal, it is
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive
detention. There can be no doubt the appellant satisfies the habitual criminal
criteria (s. 688(2)(a)) in that he, since the age of 18 years, on at
least three separate and independent occasions has been convicted of an
indictable offence for which he was liable to imprisonment for five years or
more and he is leading persistently a criminal life. That leaves, therefore,
for determination only the question whether the Crown has established, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that because the appellant is an habitual criminal it is
expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to preventive
detention.

The broad test to be applied in these cases is
that framed by Cartwright C.J.C., speaking for the majority of the Court, in Mendick
v. The Queen[2], at
p. 872:

[Page 43]

On the whole, I am of opinion that,
although it is impossible to say that the appellant is merely a nuisance, he
does not constitute so grave a menace that the protection of the public
requires that he be deprived of his liberty for the remainder of his life,
subject only to the provisions of s. 666 of the Criminal Code and
the Parole Act.

and adopted in somewhat different phraseology by
Martland J., speaking for the Court, in Bingham v. The Queen[3], at p. 373:

“The object of this section is to
protect the public from people who have shown by their history that they are a
menace, not just a nuisance to society, and when this situation is clear, the
question is not one of punishment since that has proven to be a futile
exercise, but rather it is a matter of putting them away, so to speak, for the
protection of the public. In my opinion it is important that the public be
protected from criminals, not only from crimes involving violence against the
person, but as well from crimes against property, which are in themselves very
serious.”

Is Hatchwell a menace to society or just a
nuisance? Should he be confined to prison for the rest of his life, subject
only to annual review of his case by the Parole Board and release from custody
only in the absolute discretion of that Board? These are not easy matters of
decision for one must balance the legitimate right of society to be protected
from criminal depredations and the right of the man to freedom after serving
the sentence imposed on him for the substantive offence which he committed.
Habitual criminal legislation and preventive detention are primarily designed
for the persistent dangerous criminal and not for those with a prolonged record
of minor offences against property. The dominant purpose is to protect the
public when the past conduct of the criminal demonstrates a propensity for
crimes of violence against the person, and there is a real and present danger
to life or limb. In those cases the way is clear and the word “menace” seems
particularly apt and significant. That is not to say that crimes against
property can never be cause for the invocation of preventive detention
legislation, for the legislation contains no such exclusion and society is
undoubtedly entitled to reasonable protection against crimes involving

[Page 44]

loss of or damage to property. It would seem to
me, however, that when one is dealing with crime of this type, seeking to
distinguish between that which is menace and that which is nuisance, there is
greater opportunity and indeed necessity to assess carefully the true nature
and gravity of the potential threat. For it is manifest that some crimes
affecting property are very serious and others are not.

There are no crimes of violence in the record of
the appellant. This is not conclusive but it is important. There is no evidence
of association with known criminals during periods of freedom from custody.
During these sometimes brief periods, the appellant has been gainfully
employed. One former employer spoke in laudatory terms of his ability and
attitude as a worker and expressed willingness to re-employ him at any time.
The appellant is emotionally unstable and immature. The great majority of
crimes committed by him appear to proceed from an uncontrolled aberration or
fixation about cars. They are not motivated by gain nor by any destructive
urge, for in every case, according to the evidence, the property taken was
recovered undamaged. The appellant simply drives the stolen vehicles, until
such time as he is apprehended. Of late he has shown a preference for large
tractor-trailer units. This sort of irrational, senseless conduct is no doubt
of annoyance to everyone, incommoding owners and vexing authorities, but it
would seem to me that it partakes more of the quality of a nuisance than of a
menace. Hatchwell is a bane rather than a danger to society.

Other cases afford little assistance in making
what is essentially a factual decision, but with that reservation, I would be
of the view that this case is more that of Mendick in which the sentence
of preventive detention was set aside than of Bingham in which the
sentence of preventive detention was upheld. In Mendick, 47 convictions
were set

[Page 45]

out in the notice of application, of which 27
related to the unlawful possession and use of gasoline credit cards. Of the
remaining offences, eight related to the theft or unlawful possession and use
of automobiles. In 1957 Mendick was convicted of armed robbery, in 1965 he was
convicted of theft of money and there were other offences. Upon this record,
which would seem to have been at least as formidable as that of the present
appellant, an appeal to this Court against a sentence of preventive detention
was successful.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the sentence
of preventive detention and remit the case to the Court of Appeal to pass
sentence in respect of the substantive offence, after receiving any submissions
as to sentence by or on behalf of the appellant.

The judgment of Martland and Ritchie JJ. was
delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—This appeal is
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia which, by a
majority, confirmed the judgment at trial imposing sentence of preventive
detention on the appellant. In my opinion, the facts of this case do not justify
this Court in disturbing the conclusion reached by the trial judge and
confirmed by the Court of Appeal that, the appellant being an habitual
criminal, it was expedient for the protection of the public to sentence him to
preventive detention.

The appellant has, since 1948, been convicted of
28 Criminal offences. These involved crimes against property and did not
involve violence. On the other hand, the majority of these crimes did not
involve petty thefts. A number of the convictions were in relation to thefts of
automobiles, which were not limited only to passenger vehicles, but included
thefts of trucks.

In 1968, upon his 24th conviction, proceedings
were taken for preventive detention. At that time, on June 11, the magistrate
found that the appellant was an habitual criminal, but did not go on to

[Page 46]

find that it was expedient for the protection of
the public to sentence him to preventive detention. The reason for this
decision is suggested by Robertson J.A., who delivered the reasons of the
majority in the Court of Appeal, as follows:

His record over some four and a half years
from 1955 to 1960, during which he was married and lived with his wife, was
clear, and during that time he was gainfully employed; he was also gainfully
employed during a number of his short periods of freedom from gaol. The only
substantial one of those periods was one of a year and a half following his
release from the penitentiary in May 1964. In the 1968 proceedings he was found
to be an habitual criminal, but the magistrate was not of the opinion that it
was expedient to sentence him to preventive detention and did not do so. No
doubt the magistrate was impressed by the absence of convictions during the
four-and-a-half year and one-and-a-half year periods mentioned and by the work
record that I have mentioned, and hoped that the shock of being found to be an
habitual criminal would bring the appellant up short and deter him from further
crime.

Robertson J.A. then goes on to add this:

Unfortunately that hope was not realized.
While the appellant was on parole from the December 1967 conviction, lèss than
a year after being found to be an habitual criminal, he had in his possession a
stolen tractor; and he was convicted of this offence in July 1969. In
April 1971 the appellant was out on a three-day pass from the Agassiz
Correctional Work Camp and he used the opportunity to commit three more
offences, of which he was convicted: he broke and entered the premises of a
milling company and stole some automobile keys and money, he was in possession
of a truck belonging to and stolen from the milling company, and he drove the
truck while he had a blood alcohol reading in excess of. 08.

After citing the cases of Mendick v. The
Queen[4], and
Bingham v. The Queen[5], Robertson
J.A. gives reasons for concluding that preventive detention should be imposed:

[Page 47]

Guided by these principles, the question
that I must put to myself in the circumstances of this case is whether the
appellant constitutes so grave a menace to the property of the public as to
require that he be “put away” under s. 688. My answer must be that he
does, for it is clear on the evidence that the appellant has an uncontrollable
urge to commit crimes which, among other things, involve the deprivation of
others of valuable property, often of a vulnerable nature. Further, while he
has so far committed no crimes involving violence against the persons of
others, the types of crimes he has committed often do result in violence or
injury to the persons of others. The appellant’s history makes it all too clear
that he cannot be at liberty for any substantial time without committing
another crime; his capability to work gainfully is exercised only until his
compulsion to revert to crime asserts itself.

In 1968, the medical testimony held but
little hope, and what has transpired since has confirmed that prognosis. He is
far from being merely a nuisance. A personable thief, with periods of gainful
work, who unerringly and surely reverts to crime against property is, in my
view, a grave menace to the public and one from whom the public is entitled to
protection. Years in gaol have failed to stop his depredations when free, and I
consider he should be put away permanently, subject only to release into
society under parole procedures and safeguards.

I have little difficulty in concluding
beyond a reasonable doubt that it was expedient for the protection of the
public that this habitual criminal be subjected to preventive detention. On the
facts of this case, in my opinion, the learned provincial court judge was
warranted in having that opinion and imposing that sentence.

What I shall next mention has weighed
heavily with me in reaching that conclusion. On the hearing in the current
proceedings in May 1973 the appellant had read in the evidence given on the
hearing in 1968 by a psychiatrist (whose evidence was not too helpful to the
appellant and held out no particular hope for a change in conduct) and by a
Mr. Dickey, his friend and employer. The appellant called no evidence and
did not himself give evidence and there is no record of any work since 1968.
All we know is that the appellant was released on parole about a year after the
1968 hearing and within three months was convicted of the possession of stolen
property and sentenced to a consecutive term of two years; and that then, when
released on a three-day pass

[Page 48]

less than two years later, he committed the
several offences that I have already described.

I agree with Robertson J.A. that the special
feature about the present case is the finding, in 1968, that the appellant was
an habitual criminal, although, at that time, it was not considered expedient
to impose preventive detention. Notwithstanding this warning, the appellant
continued to commit crimes, thereby showing that the opinion of
Dr. Lipinski, given at the 1968 hearing, that it was unlikely that the
appellant’s criminal pattern would change, was correct. One of the crimes
committed after that hearing was breaking and entering to obtain the keys of a
three-ton Ford van which he then operated in New
 Westminster while he had a blood alcohol reading well
in excess of. 08. In my opinion, conduct such as this cannot be dismissed as
being merely a nuisance.

In the present case we have an incorrigible
criminal, whose criminal activities will continue indefinitely if he is not
detained. If s. 688 can be applied so as to protect the public from
continued crimes against property, and I find nothing in the section which
says that it cannot, then, in my opinion, this is clearly a case for its
application, as found by the Courts below. I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal Law—Plea of guilty at trial—Duty of
trial judge—Legal aid duty counsel—Discretion of trial judge to hear evidence.

The appellant pleaded guilty to several
charges of false pretences, a charge of fraud, and a charge of break, enter and
theft. He was represented by legal aid counsel. After plea had been entered,
the facts giving rise to each charge were related by a police officer and the
appellant was afforded an opportunity to explain. The appellant was convicted.
No request for the change of plea was made during the hearing. The appellant
appealed to the Court of Appeal which allowed the appeal as to one of the
charges and dismissed the appeal as to all other charges. The issue is whether,
having heard the explanation, the judge erred in failing to strike the guilty
pleas and direct trial on the charges.

Held (Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Judson,
Ritchie and Dickson JJ.: There are two stages in the proceedings in which a
trial judge has a discretion so far as accepting a plea of guilty is concerned,
first, when the charge is read and the plea is entered and, second, following
the hearing of evidence, if the judge chooses to hear evidence. A trial judge
is not bound, as a matter of law, in all cases to conduct an inquiry after a
guilty plea has been entered. If however evidence is heard it may indicate that
the accused never intended to admit to a fact which is an essential ingredient
of the offence with which he is charged or that he may have misapprehended the
effect of the guilty plea or never intended to plead guilty at all, in any of
which events the judge may in his discretion direct that a plea of not guilty
be entered or permit the accused to change his plea to not guilty. This
discretion if exercised judicially will not lightly be interfered with. An
appel-

[Page 427]

lant can however later change his plea if he
can satisfy the Appeal Court
that there are valid grounds for his being permitted to do so.

On reviewing the charges to which the
appellant pleaded guilty neither the facts admitted nor the statements made
following the guilty pleas justify disturbing the exercise of discretion by the
trial judge.

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ., dissenting: The issue here and the foundation of the appeal
to the Court of Appeal was whether the trial judge erred in law in permitting
the guilty pleas to stand. The accused did not have counsel until, on his third
appearance in Court and on his trial at that time, duty counsel stood with him.
The Legal Aid Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 239, as amended does not deal in any
detail with duty counsel but the effect of s. 21(b) which
provides for duty counsel is quite different from the central provisions of the
Act which entitle persons charged with indictable offences to apply for legal
aid certificates and to obtain full representation by counsel. The trial Court
was aware that it was a duty counsel who appeared for the accused. The fact
that the trial judge did not inquire if duty counsel had had an opportunity to
consult with the accused and to ascertain the factual bases of the charges and
whether the accused was willing to be represented by him should there be a plea
of guilty was sufficient to require that the convictions be set aside and a new
trial ordered. The duty of a trial judge respecting an inquiry into the facts
on a plea of guilty is to satisfy himself that the accused understands the
nature of the charge and its consequences and is unequivocal in his plea of
guilty but this must be complemented by the duty of the Crown to adduce facts
which, taken to be true, support the charge and conviction. In the present case
on the facts narrated by the Crown there was sufficient doubt on the elements
of the offence to warrant striking the plea.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an
appeal from conviction on several charges of fraud and of breaking, entering
and theft, appeal dismissed, Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

E.L. Schofield, for the appellant.

R.M. McLeod, for the respondent.

The judgment of Judson, Ritchie and Dickson JJ.
was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellant pleaded guilty before a
Provincial Court Judge to several charges of false pretences, a charge of
fraud, and a charge of break, enter and theft. The appellant was represented by
legal aid counsel. After plea had been entered, the facts giving rise to each
of the charges were related by a police officer and the appellant was afforded
an opportunity to explain. The issue in this appeal is whether, having heard
the explanation, the judge erred in failing to strike the guilty pleas and
direct trial upon the charges. No request for a change of plea was made during
the hearing.

The judge accepted the guilty pleas on all
charges and sentenced the appellant to three months on the charge of break,
enter and theft. On all of the other charges, the appellant was sentenced to
one year probation with suspended sentence and ordered to make restitution. The
appellant appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal as to one of the charges and dismissed the appeal as to all other
charges.

There are two stages in the proceedings in
which, so far as accepting a plea of guilty is concerned, the discretion of the
trial judge comes into play: first, when the charge is read to the accused and
a plea of guilty is entered, and, second, following the hearing of evidence, if
the judge chooses to hear evidence. When a

[Page 429]

plea of guilty is entered by the accused or
someone on his behalf, the trial judge may or may not accept that plea. This
Court has decided in Brosseau v. The Queen[1], that a trial judge is not bound, as
a matter of law, in all cases to conduct an inquiry after a guilty plea has
been entered. In that case the accused was an Indian with a Grade II education.
He was charged with capital murder to which he originally pleaded not guilty.
Later, after several interviews with counsel, he pleaded guilty to non-capital
murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He later appealed on the ground
that he did not understand that a conviction for non-capital murder entailed a
sentence of life imprisonment and that he had agreed to plead guilty to the
reduced charge because of his fear of hanging. Cartwright C.J. stated (pp.
188-9):

No doubt when a plea of guilty is offered
and there is any reason to doubt that the accused understands what he is doing,
the judge or magistrate will make inquiry to ascertain whether he does so and
the extent of the inquiry will vary with the seriousness of the charge to which
the accused is pleading.

Cartwright C.J. approved the statement of Sidney
Smith J.A. in Rex v. Milina[2],
and concluded at p. 190:

Failure to make due inquiry may well be a
ground on which the Court of Appeal will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the
plea of guilty to be withdrawn if it is made to appear that the accused did not
fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of his plea or if the
matter is left in doubt; but in my opinion, it cannot be said that where, as in
the case at bar, an accused is represented by counsel and tenders a plea of
guilty to non‑capital murder, the trial Judge before accepting it is
bound, as a matter of law, to interrogate the accused.

[Page 430]

If the trial judge chooses to hear evidence, for
the purpose of satisfying himself that the charges are well founded or in order
to have a factual background prior to imposing sentence, the evidence may
indicate the accused never intended to admit to a fact which is an essential
ingredient of the offence with which he is charged or he may have
misapprehended the effect of the guilty plea or never intended to plead guilty
at all, in any of which events the judge may, in his discretion, direct that a
plea of not guilty be entered or permit the accused to withdraw his original
plea and enter a new one.

The discretion exercised by the trial judge is
one which “if exercised judicially, will not be lightly interfered with.” per
Cartwright J. (as he then was) in Thibodeau v. The Queen[3], at p. 654.

Counsel for the Crown submitted that the test to
be applied was that formulated by Avory J. in R. v. Forde[4].

A plea of guilty having been recorded, this
Court can only entertain an appeal against conviction if it appears (1) That
the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charge, or did not intend to
admit that he was guilty of it; or (2) That upon the admitted facts he could
not in law have been convicted of the offence charged.

With respect, in my view this defines the rule
too narrowly. I see no reason why the Court’s right to permit a withdrawal of a
plea of guilty should be necessarily limited to the “admitted” facts.
Statements made in the course of the inquiry following a guilty plea may,
although not admitted by the Crown, justify the Court in rejecting the guilty
plea and proceeding to trial.

[Page 431]

This Court in The Queen v. Bamsey[5], at p. 298, held that an accused may
change his plea if he can satisfy the Appeal Court “that there are valid grounds for his being permitted to do so.” It
would be unwise to attempt to define all that which might be embraced within
the phrase “valid grounds”. I have indicated above some of the circumstances
which might justify the Court in permitting a change of plea. The examples
given are not intended to be exhaustive.

Turning now to the charges to which the
appellant pleaded guilty; those relating to false pretences may be disposed of
without difficulty. They relate to a ring obtained from Henry Birks & Sons
Limited in Oshawa for $150 by
means of a worthless cheque. The ring was subsequently returned to Birks. The
appellant gave no explanation with respect to this charge. Two charges
concerned obtaining merchandise by false pretences from S.S. Kresge Company.
The officer testified that the merchandise had been obtained by N.S.F. cheques.
The appellant explained he knew when he wrote the cheques he did not have
enough money in the bank to cover them. He intended to obtain money from his
aunt and deposit it the next day to cover the cheques. Two other charges
related also to obtaining merchandise by false pretences by N.S.F. cheques. No
explanation was given by the appellant. So far as this group of charges is
concerned, therefore, the position is that the accused pleaded guilty and
either offered no explanation or the explanation that he intended to get money
from his aunt. It was within the discretion of the trial judge to accept or
reject that explanation in deciding whether to strike the pleas of guilty. I
would not disturb the exercise of his discretion.

Another charge which, in my view, can also
readily be disposed of is that the appellant defrauded Texaco Oil Ltd. and
Peter Farano of

[Page 432]

merchandise to the value of $674.30. The officer
testified that the appellant, in about April 1970, was in partnership with one
Rene Cornu. The partnership was dissolved about the end of April and
Mr. Cornu permitted appellant to use Cornu’s vehicle. He furnished the
appellant with a Texaco credit card to provide gas for the car. The period of
the loan was to be for two days only. The car was returned after two days but
Cornu’s attempts to recover the card were unsuccessful. The appellant used the
card to have extensive repairs made to his own motor vehicle. The appellant
said he did not understand the loan of the card to be only for a two day
period, but did not deny the purpose of the loan was limited to the purchase of
gas for the car which Cornu had loaned to him. In my view the judge was correct
in accepting the appellant’s plea of guilty to the charge.

Finally, the appellant was charged with
unlawfully breaking and entering the cottage of Rene Cornu and committing theft
therein. The officer testified that the Ontario Provincial Police found the
appellant and a young woman in Cornu’s cottage and that the appellant had consumed
a quantity of Cornu’s liquor. Mr. Cornu had returned from Cornell University unexpectedly. The
appellant explained to the Court that he and Cornu had previously been business
associates. It had been intended that the cottage would be rented for the summer,
but about seven days before Cornu left for Cornell he and the appellant had an
argument and, in the words of the appellant, “I found out he wasn’t my friend
any more”. Notwithstanding, the appellant, according to his explanation,
went to the cottage for some unexplained reason, found the grass to be waist
high, told Cornu’s girl friend that he was going to cut the grass and make the
cottage liveable. He was at the cottage from a Tuesday morning until Friday
when Cornu returned unexpectedly, accompanied by a police officer. Cornu asked
the appellant what he was doing there, and in the words of the appellant, “I
didn’t know what to say”. In

[Page 433]

explaining how he entered the appellant stated
that the door of the cottage was locked but the lock did not catch. He had had
a key but Cornu had apparently taken it from him.

In considering whether the judge erred in not
striking the plea entered by the appellant, the significance and effect of a
guilty plea must be acknowledged. In pleading guilty an accused admits having
done that with which he is charged. By his plea in the instant case, the
appellant admitted he broke and entered the cottage owned by Cornu and
committed theft therein. His explanation served to confirm the breaking and the
entry; he did not deny the theft. The highest footing upon which the appellant
can put his case is that he thought he had some colour of right to do what he
did. The cottage, however, belonged to Cornu. The earlier business relations
and friendship had ended. Cornu had relieved the appellant of the key to the
cottage. When the appellant was asked to explain his presence to Cornu and the
police officer, he did not know what to say. In these circumstances it is
difficult to discern any foundation upon which a claim to colour of right could
properly rest: see The Queen v. Shymkowich[6].

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—This appeal,
brought here by leave of this Court, raises the questions whether pleas of guilty,
offered by the accused to a number of charges on which he elected to be tried
by a provincial judge, should not have been entered without previous inquiry or
should have been struck out and pleas of not guilty entered. When he appeared
before the provincial judge on February 10, 1971, the accused faced ten
charges, one of fraud, one of break, enter and theft, five of obtaining by
false pre-

[Page 434]

tences, one of theft under $50, one of unlawful
possession and one of careless driving. The theft charge and the possession
charge were related, and the former was dropped as a result of what the accused
said when his plea was taken. He was convicted on all the other charges. On
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, his conviction on the possession charge
was set aside and an acquittal entered, but the appeal was otherwise dismissed.

In this Court, issue was taken with the
convictions on the charge of break, enter and theft, the charge of fraud and
the five charges of obtaining by false pretences. The accused, who was
twenty-one years of age at the time and had no previous criminal record, was
represented by duty counsel present in the Court on February 10, 1971. Counsel for the Crown
very fairly conceded that the trial judge did not deal with the charges seriatim
and ask accused what he had to say as to each, and also that the entire
proceedings were somewhat imperious. After the pleas of guilty, a police
inspector was called by the Crown to give an account of the investigations into
the various matters out of which the charges arose. When he concluded his
narration, Crown counsel appeared to take over, asking the accused whether he
disputed any of those matters, and after receiving the answer “no” asked him
“All right. What’s your version?”. Accused began to speak and was then told by
the trial judge “Come on up here if you wish to say anything”. The record then
states that the accused was called and sworn, and gave testimony which is
reproduced in the transcript. He was questioned by the trial judge only. Crown
counsel then said that he had no questions, and the Court asked duty counsel if
he wished to question the accused and he answered that he had no questions but
wished to make some submissions, and he directed them to sentence.

[Page 435]

This is not a case where the accused sought to
withdraw his pleas of guilty and his request was denied, nor is it a case where
the trial judge gave consideration to a change of plea and in his discretion
refused to allow it. What is alleged here, and what was the foundation of the
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, is that the trial judge erred in law in
permitting the guilty pleas to stand.

The accused did not have counsel until, on his
third appearance in Court and on his trial at that time, duty counsel stood with
him. The record does not show when the duty counsel first spoke to the accused
or what opportunity he had to confer with the accused or with Crown counsel on
his behalf. On the careless driving charge, which is not before this Court, it
was duty counsel who answered, when the accused was asked to plead, that the
accused pleads guilty. Two charges of false pretences were then read, and when
asked to plead to them the accused said “I don’t know about one of them.
Guilty, I guess”. To which duty counsel said, “Don’t guess. Don’t do me a
favour”. Accused then said “Guilty”, but after an intervention by Crown
counsel, he said “I want to explain that. There’s an explanation for that”. The
trial judge made a remark and the accused said “Can I say what happened?”. To
which the Court replied “You can have all morning to say what happened”. This
was followed by the Crown counsel asking the accused how he pleads to the two
charges and the accused said “Guilty”.

[Page 436]

During the course of the narration by the police
officer of the facts as he had them respecting the charge of break, enter and
theft, he spoke of a voluntary statement made by the accused whereupon Crown
counsel interrupted to say “We won’t bother going into that. We are agreed that
he did not have anyone’s permission to be there. Go ahead”. There is nothing to
show who was meant by “we”, but if taken literally to refer to an agreement,
rather than being an observation about the conclusion of the prosecuting
authorities from their inquiries, it must be a reference to an agreement with
duty counsel. Not only did the latter remain mute, but the accused, when sworn,
gave an account of the circumstances under which he entered the premises in
question (a cottage owned by a former business partner) and these indicated a
possible defence of colour of right. It is difficult in these circumstances to
hold that the accused was foreclosed by any agreement with his duty counsel, if
indeed he agreed on the accused’s behalf to what Crown counsel said.

I have gone into these matters because, in my
opinion, where an accused is asked, as here, to plead to a succession of
charges, the fact that he is or is not represented by counsel is material to
the duty that lies upon a trial judge in relation to pleas of guilty. On the
record of proceedings in this case, I am of the opinion that even if the
accused had been represented by retained counsel, the trial judge would have
erred in law in failing to enter pleas of not guilty in respect of any charge
where the accused had indicated at the time of plea that he wished to challenge
the charge, or where it later appeared that the facts did not support the
charge and the plea of guilty thereto. This is entirely apart from the prior
obligation that rests upon a trial judge to seek assurance, especially from an
unrepresented accused, that any plea of guilty is voluntary and based on an
appreciation of the nature of the charges and of the consequences of such a
plea. On the foregoing view of the law (and I propose to examine the authorities)
the two questions

[Page 437]

that arise are whether the accused should have
been treated here as if he was represented by retained counsel when it was duty
counsel who appeared with him and, if so, whether the course of proceedings
obliged the trial judge not to enter or to re-open the pleas.

The Legal Aid Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 239, as amended does not deal in any detail with
duty counsel. Section 21(b) provides for the establishment of a
panel of lawyers to act as duty counsel. This is something quite different from
the central provisions of the Act which entitle persons charged with indictable
offences to apply for legal aid certificates and to obtain full representation
by counsel. It is the Regulations under the Act that spell out the functions of
duty counsel. Section 69 of the Regulations (R.R.O. 1970, Reg. 557)
provides:

Where a person has been taken into custody
or summoned and charged with an offence, he may obtain before appearance to the
charge the assistance of duty counsel who shall,

(a) advise him of his rights
and take such steps as the circumstances require to protect his rights,
including representing him on an application for remand or adjournment or for
bail or on the entering of a plea of guilty and making representation with
respect to sentence where a plea of guilty is entered…

I have already stated that the record in the
present case does not show when duty counsel became involved with the accused.
It does, however, indicate that the Court was aware that it was a duty counsel
who appeared for and with the accused. In such a case, I think it mandatory for
the trial judge to inquire if duty counsel has had an opportunity to consult
with the accused and to ascertain the factual bases of the charges, and whether
the accused is willing to

[Page 438]

be represented by him and to have him speak on
his behalf if there should be pleas of guilty on duty counsel’s advice. The
record discloses no such inquiry in the present case.

This, in my view, is itself sufficient to abort
the proceedings and to require that the convictions be set aside and a new
trial ordered. But even on the assumption that the accused was as fully
represented as if he had retained counsel, I am of the opinion, on the second
question posed above, that in the circumstances of the present case the pleas
of guilty should not have been entered. It is convenient to begin my canvass of
the authorities with the well-known statement of Avory J. in R. v. Forde[7]. We are here in the field of
judge-made law alone because the Canadian Criminal Code says nothing
about any procedure to be followed by a trial judge either before accepting or
on accepting or after accepting a plea of guilty. By contrast, Rule 11 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in the United
 States is as follows:

A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty
or, with the consent of the court, nolo contendere. The court may refuse
to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such plea or a plea of nolo
contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining
that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the
charge and the consequences of the plea. If a defendant refuses to plead or if
the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant fails to appear,
the court shall enter a plea of not guilty. The court shall not enter a
judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual
basis for the plea.

And in Australia, s.600 of the Criminal Code of Queensland (there is a similar provision in Western Australia) provides:

If he pleads that he is not guilty, the
Court, upon being satisfied that he duly admitted before the justices that he
was guilty of the offence charged in the

[Page 439]

indictment, is to direct a plea of guilty
to be entered, notwithstanding his plea of not guilty. A plea so entered has
the same effect as if it had been actually pleaded.

If the Court is not so satisfied, or if,
notwithstanding that the accused person pleads that he is guilty, it appears to
the Court upon examination of the depositions of the witnesses that he has not
in fact committed the offence charged in the indictment or any other offence of
which he might have been convicted upon the indictment, the plea of not guilty
is to be entered, and the trial is to proceed as in other cases when that plea
is pleaded.

Under the foregoing respective provisions, the
trial judge is put under a duty to inquire into the propriety of a guilty plea;
the nature of the inquiry is, in the language of the respective provisions,
different under each of them.

R. v. Forde involved
an appeal against conviction on a plea of guilty to a charge of indecent
assault of a girl under age sixteen in an indictment which also charged carnal
knowledge of the same girl. The prosecution elected not to proceed further on
the indictment, and the question on appeal was whether the conviction could
stand if the accused had a complete defence in law and in fact to carnal
knowledge. Addressing himself to the question whether the Court of Criminal
Appeal could entertain the appeal in view of the plea of guilty, Avory J.
stated two propositions (which are in fact three) as follows:

A plea of Guilty having been recorded, this
Court can only entertain an appeal against conviction if it appears (1.) that
the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charge or did not intend to
admit he was guilty of it, or (2.) that upon the admitted facts he could not in
law have been convicted of the offence charged.

Under these propositions, an appellate Court
should interfere to set aside a conviction made

[Page 440]

upon a plea of guilty if it be the case that (1)
the accused did not understand the nature of the charge before pleading; or (2)
the accused did not unequivocally plead guilty to the charge as properly
understood; or (3) the accused, on the facts offered in support of the charge,
could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged.

The first two propositions above-noted point to
a duty of the trial judge prior to entering any plea to satisfy himself that
the accused understands the nature of the charge or charges against him and is
unequivocal in offering a plea of guilty to them. The third proposition
involves a different aspect of the matter, relating as it does not to the
nature of the charge or to the unmistakable character of the plea, but rather
to the facts necessary to support a conviction; in short, it relates to the
factual accuracy of the plea and not to its voluntariness and its appreciation.
Moreoever, this third proposition depends on facts being put before the trial
judge following the plea.

A plea of guilty carries an admission that the
accused so pleading has committed the crime charged and a consent to a
conviction being entered without any trial. The accused by such a plea relieves
the Crown of the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, abandons his
non-compellability as a witness and his right to remain silent and surrenders
his right to offer full answer and defence to a charge. It is important,
therefore, that the plea be made voluntarily and upon a full understanding of
the nature of the charge and its consequences and that it be unequivocal. In
these respects, representation by counsel is an important consideration; but
since the plea is that of the accused and not of his counsel, a trial judge
should still satisfy himself of the matters above-mentioned. These do not
immediately engage any factual issues which might, however, arise if the
accused seeks to qualify his guilty plea by explanatory

[Page 441]

comments either at the time it is entered or
later before termination of the proceedings.

The foregoing duty of the trial judge, more or
less in the terms stated, was considered in a series of cases in the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, culminating in R. v. Milina[8] which distinguished, properly in my
view, between the duty as I have put it and the factual underpinning of the
guilty plea. As to the latter, it was the view of the Court (in the words of
Sidney Smith J.A. for the majority, at p. 381) that “when an accused person
pleads guilty it is not the law that the magistrate must go into the facts in
order to satisfy himself that the accused is in fact guilty”. In short, the
view taken in Milina is that although there is an affirmative duty of
the trial judge to satisfy himself that the accused understands the nature of
the charge and its consequences and is unequivocal in his plea of guilty, there
is no such duty to be satisfied of the accuracy of the plea, that is of its
factual support. Since, ordinarily, facts are presented by the Crown with
respect to sentence and there may be a narration as well by the accused, the
question arises whether the trial judge should at that stage be required to
assess conflicting versions in order to decide whether there is a factual basis
for the plea.

If the trial judge has such a duty, as expressed
in Milina, to be satisfied of the accused’s understanding and
appreciation of a plea of guilty, how is it discharged? In Milina itself
the Court said that “the cases will be rare indeed in which a magistrate will
feel himself obliged to make any special inquiry when the accused, as here, is
represented by counsel” (at p. 381 of 86 C.C.C.). I confess to some difficulty
in understanding what is meant by “special inquiry”, but I assume that the
Court did not

[Page 442]

mean dispensation with any inquiry where the
accused has counsel. Whatever the Court in Milina may have meant, this
Court in Brosseau v. The Queen[9],
appears to have said exactly that. In Brosseau, the question of law
upon which leave to appeal was given was as follows:

Did the trial judge err in law in accepting
the appellant’s plea of guilty to non-capital murder without making inquiry to
satisfy himself that the appellant understood the nature of the charge and the
effect of such a plea?

That was a case where the accused, a Cree
Indian, was illiterate (he had a grade 2 education) and was described by his
counsel as a “primitive”. He had been charged with murder but at the opening of
trial the indictment was amended to read “non-capital murder”, and to this the
accused pleaded guilty. In his appeal to the provincial appellate Court he
alleged that he was told by his lawyer that if he did not plead guilty to the
charge he would be sentenced to hang, that he was scared and pleaded guilty
although he was drunk at the time of the offence and drunk when he gave a
statement to the police.

This Court, with Spence J. dissenting, dealt
with the question of law before it in these terms:

Failure to make due inquiry may well be a
ground on which the Court of Appeal will exercise its jurisdiction to allow the
plea of guilty to be withdrawn if it is made to appear that the accused did not
fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of his plea or if the
matter is left in doubt; but in my opinion, it cannot be said that where, as in
the case at bar, an accused is represented by counsel and tenders a plea of
guilty to non‑capital murder, the trial Judge before accepting it is
bound, as a matter of law, to interrogate the accused.

In his dissenting reasons, Spence J. adverted to
what was said in Milina that an inquiry may be

[Page 443]

proper where “the accused may be a foreigner, or
illiterate, or the charge is one of unusual complexity or of an unusually grave
nature”; and he concluded that in the case before him the trial judge could not
rely merely on the fact that the accused was represented by counsel as making
any inquiry unnecessary before recording the guilty plea.

If in the Brosseau case no inquiry at all
was required because the accused was represented by counsel, I can think of no
case in which an inquiry would be necessary when there is counsel, unless the
inquiry is precipitated by some remonstrance by the accused at the time he
pleads guilty or later in the proceedings, as, for example, when the Crown
narrates facts relevant to sentence. If the sentence is mandatory, the
narration becomes unnecessary although it was given in Brosseau; and if
there is no narration, then, according to Brosseau, matters so grave as
whether an accused understands the charge against him, and appreciates the
consequences and voluntarily accepts them without trial, require no initiative
of inquiry by the trial judge but are satisfied by the mere presence of counsel
when the accused pleads guilty. This is a situation which, in its generality, I
find unacceptable.

A trial judge cannot, of course, be faulted if
he makes some inquiry, but it is conceivable that he may as a result wrongly
conclude that a plea of guilty should be recorded. If he makes no inquiry at
all, in reliance on the presence of counsel of whatever experience, Brosseau
indicates that an appeal based on facts which might have moved the trial
judge to refuse a plea of guilty, or at least to seek some assurance about the
plea, will fail. What is left then, as a basis for contesting a plea of guilty
by a represented accused, is any remonstrance by the accused or any obvious
factual defect in the Crown’s case in respect of the charge, revealed in the
post-

[Page 444]

plea or post-conviction proceedings before the
trial judge. If a proper inquiry is made, any subsequent remonstrance would
lose its force unless sufficiently weighty to require the trial judge to
reconsider the recorded plea of guilty.

No doubt, a trial judge must have regard to the
factual accuracy of a plea of guilty if facts to underpin it are offered. If
those advanced by the Crown do not sustain the charge and conviction, then the
plea of guilty must be struck out, and there is nothing in Brosseau that
is at odds with this conclusion. I readily agree, moreover, that if the accused
gives a version of the facts, after a narration by the Crown, which is
different from that of the Crown, the trial judge would in effect be holding a
trial after a plea of guilty if he was bound to assess the respective versions
as to their credibility and weight. However, either the narration by the Crown
or by the accused or by both may raise a question not only as to the factual
accuracy of the plea but as well as to the propriety of the plea of guilty in
terms of the accused’s understanding and appreciation of it and its unequivocal
character. This is not a point that was involved in Brosseau. Nor is it
likely to arise very frequently if there is the prior inquiry, to which I have
already referred, when the accused is arraigned.

The duty of the Court respecting an inquiry as
to the “legality” (if I may make such a compendious reference) of the plea of
guilty, must, it seems to me, be complemented by a duty of the Crown to adduce
facts which, taken to be true,

[Page 445]

support the charge and conviction in that aspect
of the matter. It would, in my view, be unsatisfactory to leave to the
discretion of the Crown whether or not to adduce facts supportive of the charge
and conviction. The trial judge could undoubtedly call for them, but the issue
at that stage ought not to involve him in anything more than being satisfied
that what is alleged, taking it to be true, completes the elements of a
conviction on a plea of guilty; and this would be so even where the facts could
have no bearing on sentence because, in the particular case, it is mandatory.

In the present case, I am of the view that on
the facts narrated by the Crown, if believed, there is sufficient doubt on the
elements of the offence of break, enter and theft to warrant the striking of
the plea. The offence requires proof that what was done was knowingly done
without consent of the owner, and I hold that the Crown’s narration does not
carry that element. The situation is different with respect to the other offences
that are involved in this appeal. As to them, if the success of the appeal
depended on alleged shortcomings in the factual accuracy of the plea, they are
not made out.

The overriding concern is, however, the failure
of the trial judge to make any inquiry at all of the accused or his counsel as
to whether he understood the charges, whether he appreciated the consequences
of a plea of guilty to them and whether he was unequivocal in admitting guilt.
On the footing that he was represented by retained counsel, the inquiry could
be short. I see no denigration of the reputation of counsel if such an inquiry
is made. The trial judge should have no difficulty in making the inquiry in a
manner that does not give the impression that counsel is either being bypassed or
that his qualification is challenged. The matter is one of the trial judge, who
is called upon to enter a conviction without a trial, being certain that the

[Page 446]

accused is fully aware of what is involved in,
and is content to stand by, his plea of guilty.

In McCarthy v. United States[10], the Supreme Court of the United States considered Rule 11 of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, quoted above, in a nonconstitutional
context (as contrasted with the later case of Boykin v. Alabama[11] and emphasized its provision that
the accused must be addressed personally, although in that case he was
represented by retained counsel. I do not see this as an invariable requirement
under the procedure that I would envisage here, but it does indicate that the
Rule is not regarded as demeaning counsel’s position. I cannot conceive that
any counsel recognizing the gravity to an accused of a plea of guilty, would be
affronted simply because reassurance is sought by the trial judge.

There is data in the United
 States that shows that “guilty pleas and not trial
serve as the major mechanism for disposition of criminal defendants”: see Note,
The Trial Judge’s Satisfaction as to Voluntariness and Understanding of Guilty
Pleas, [1970] Wash.U.L.Q. 289. We are short of such data here. Statistics Canada does not, or rather does not yet,
keep statistics on the subject. Some attempts on a modest scale have been made
in this country to provide data on guilty pleas. Professor M.L. Friedland in
his book, Detention Before Trial (1965), includes a study of the work of
the Toronto Magistrates’ Courts (as they were then) for the six month period
September 1, 1961 to the end of February, 1962 and this shows that 70 per cent
of the cases involving indictable offences were disposed of on guilty pleas.
Professor John Hogarth in a recent book, Sentencing as a Human Process (1971),
includes a study of seven indictable offences reflected in 2396

[Page 447]

cases, and in these nearly four out of five
offenders pleaded guilty (see p. 270). These are very small samples, and I
refer to them as the merest indicators of a situation which has been more fully
documented in the United States.
I note that in the McCarthy case, the Supreme Court of the United States
stated that in 1968 eighty-six per cent of all convictions in federal district
courts were the result of pleas of guilty or nolo contendere: see 394
U.S. 459, at p. 463, n. 7.

In my opinion, the reasons for having
confirmation of the voluntariness, understanding and appreciation of
consequences where guilty pleas are offered stand above any need of statistical
support that such pleas are the means by which most charges of indictable
offences are disposed of. In the present case, which is one where the trial
judge made no inquiry at all and hence did not record the guilty pleas in the
exercise of any discretion (indeed, there was even no indication of any
discretion on whether there should be an inquiry), I would allow the appeal and
direct a new trial on the charges which were the subjects of the appeal to this
Court. I do not think that this is a case for the application of s. 613(l)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code.

ON APPEAL FROM THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL

Extradition—Judicial review by Federal
Court—Extradition judge, persona designata—“Federal board, commission or other
tribunal”—“Decision or order”—Standing of demanding State to seek review of
refusal of extradition—Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 10—Extradition Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21, ss. 18, 23—Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23,
s. 11.

On an information sworn by an R.C.M.P.
officer, that the respondent had, while on bail on a charge of murder, left the
jurisdiction of Puerto Rico and was in Canada, a warrant was issued for his
apprehension. After an extradition hearing the judge discharged the respondent
holding that there was no probable cause to believe him guilty of the crime
charged, with the added finding that the offence was not of a political
character. Application was made to the Federal Court under s. 28 of the Federal
Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 10 for a review of the order of the extradition
judge. This application was dismissed for want of jurisdiction on the view that
the matter was determined by a decision of this Court on its own jurisdiction.

Held (Abbott,
Judson, Spence and Laskin JJ., dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Fauteux
C.J., Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon and Dickson JJ.: A decision on the construction
of the Supreme Court Act is not determinative of the construction of the
Federal Court Act. The two statutes are not similarly framed and worded
and s. 28 of the Federal Court Act contemplates a general right of
review of the decisions of a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”.
This right of review is applicable to “a decision or order, other than a
decision or order of an administrative nature not required by law to be made on
a judicial or quasi judicial basis”.

[Page 229]

The scope of the new remedy given by the Federal
Court Act must be ascertained by consideration of the language of the act
which established a new jurisdiction in federal matters while continuing the
jurisdiction formerly exercised by the Exchequer Court of Canada. The Federal
Court is a “superior court” in the sense of a court having supervisory
jurisdiction. This is not limited to civil matters.

An extradition judge should not be considered
as excluded from the definition of “federal board, commission or other
tribunal”. The Federal Court Act is a self contained code. When the
powers of an extradition commissioner are exercised by a county court judge he
is not acting as a judge appointed under s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act, but
as a persona designata deriving his authority from a special act of
Parliament. This is especially clear since the same powers may be exercised by
commissioners who are not judges.

The refusal to commit by the learned Judge
was a “decision or order”; those words in s. 28(1) of the Federal Court
Act have to be given their plain ordinary meaning and s. 18(2) of the Extradition
Act provides that “…the judge shall order him to be discharged”.

The demanding state is a “party directly
affected by the decision or order” within the meaning of s. 28(2) of the Federal
Court Act.

Section 11 of the Interpretation Act is
especially applicable to an enactment establishing a new jurisdiction and a new
remedy.

Per Abbott,
Judson and Laskin JJ., dissenting: Prior to the passing of the Federal
Court Act, 1970, (Can.), c.
1, there was no appeal from or any other review of the discharge of a person in
extradition proceedings. Where an order of committal for extradition was made
against a person, his only remedy was habeas corpus. There is support
for the rejection of the submission that this long standing position has been
abruptly reversed by general words in s. 28(1) in the scheme of the Federal
Court Act. Undifferentiated references to federal boards, commissions or
other tribunals ought not to be read as capturing extradition matters when such
matters are not expressly mentioned.

[Page 230]

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The position taken by the respondent that the foreign state
has no status to appear on an application for review, if such review were
possible, is soundly taken.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Federal Court
of Appeal[1],
holding that that Court had no jurisdiction. Appeal allowed, Abbott, Judson,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

Gordon P. Killeen, Q.C., and Gerald R.
Morin, for the appellant.

Clayton C. Ruby, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

[Page 231]

PIGEON J.—Under date October 22, 1971, an
officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police swore an information stating that
the respondent had committed a murder in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, one
of the territories of the United States of America, that he had been arrested, charged
and released on bail, that he had fled the jurisdiction and that he was
presently in Canada. It was added that the United
 States of America would make a request to the
Government of Canada for the extradition of the fugitive. A warrant of
apprehension was issued by Judge Honeywell, a county court judge acting under
The Extradition Act. After a hearing, the same judge discharged the
respondent, holding that there was not probable cause to believe he was guilty
of the crime charged. In his written reasons he added a finding “that the
offence of murder in this case was not an offence of a political character”.

Subsequently, an application was made to the
Federal Court of Appeal under s. 28 of the Federal Court Act by
counsel for the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico who had been acting at the hearing under The Extradition Act. On
August 2, 1972, the Federal
Court of Appeal dismissed this application holding that it had no jurisdiction.
This is the judgment under appeal by special leave of this Court.

The reasons for judgment in the Court below rest
exclusively on the view that “the matter is determined by the decision of this
Court in The United States of America v. W.H. Link and H.H. Green[2]. In that case, an application for special
leave to appeal under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act was dismissed
from the bench, the Chief Justice stating:

…that the Members of the Court were
unanimously of the opinion that there was no jurisdiction, as the refusal of
Chief Justice Scott was not a judgment, as defined by s. 2(d)
within the meaning of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act.

[Page 232]

With respect, I fail to see on what basis a
decision on the construction of the Supreme Court Act could be
determinative of the construction of the Federal Court Act. The two
statutes are not similarly framed and worded. The Supreme Court Act has
always been concerned only with appeals from courts, although appeals from some
boards were exceptionally provided for under the special statute governing each
of those boards. On the contrary, s. 28 of the Federal Court Act contemplates
a general right of review of the decisions of a “federal board, commission or
other tribunal”, a classification excluding courts (s. 2). This right of review
is applicable to “a decision or order, other than a decision or order of an
administrative nature not required by law to be made on a judicial or
quasi-judicial basis”.

The proper scope of the new remedy must
therefore be ascertained by a consideration of the language used by Parliament
in the context of a statute enacted in 1970 which established a new
jurisdiction in federal matters, while continuing the jurisdiction formerly
exercised by the Exchequer Court of Canada. Prior to that time, it is clear
that supervisory jurisdiction over federal boards was, as a rule, vested in the
superior courts of the provinces (Three Rivers Boatman Ltd. v. Conseil
canadien des Relations ouvrières[3]).

I do not suggest that the concluding words of
s. 3 of the Federal Court Act: “shall continue to be a superior
court of record having civil and criminal jurisdiction” are to be read as
making, in federal matters, the Federal Court a “superior court” within the
same meaning of that expression as applied to the superior courts of the
provinces, that is courts having jurisdiction in all cases not excluded from
their authority or, as Ritchie C J. put it in Valin v. Langlois[4] at p. 19, “Courts, bound to take
cognizance of and execute all laws…”. The Exchequer
 Court was not a “superior court” in that sense. Section
3

[Page 233]

of the Exchequer Court Act , c. 98,
described it as a “court of record” only. Its inclusion in the definition of
“superior court” in the Judges Act, R.S.C. c. 159, s. 2 would
certainly have no effect on its jurisdiction. The word “continue” in s. 3
negates any intention to turn it, under its new constitution, into a court of
general jurisdiction in all federal matters. The provisions of s. 26(1) of
the Federal Court Act also imply that the Federal Court has jurisdiction
only where provided by the Act or by another federal act, whether referring to
the Court “by its new name or its former name”. In view of all this, it appears
to me that the Federal Court is a “superior court” in the sense of a court
having supervisory jurisdiction. This is a meaning often used, as appears from
the numerous authorities reviewed in Re Macdonald[5] and it is significant that such
jurisdiction is conferred by the Act.

Provisions dealing with jurisdiction are found
under two headings: “JURISDICTION OF TRIAL DIVISION” and “JURISDICTION OF
FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL”. Under the first heading, s. 18 confers to the
Trial Division of the Federal Court supervisory jurisdiction over “any federal
board, commission or other tribunal”. The language used is clearly intended to
transfer this jurisdiction entirely from the superior courts of the provinces
to the Federal Court. Paragraph (a) mentions declaratory relief in
addition to four prerogative writs, and paragraph (b) covers “any
application or other proceeding for relief in the nature of relief contemplated
by paragraph (a), including any proceeding brought against the Attorney
General of Canada…”

[Page 234]

However, under the second heading, s. 28 in
effect provides that the supervisory jurisdiction of the Federal Court is
generally to be exercised, not by the Trial Division through the modes of
relief heretofore available, but by means of a new remedy that is newly created
and defined. This new remedy is an application to the Court of Appeal to
“review and set aside a decision or order, other than a decision or order of an
administrative nature not required by law to be made on a judicial or
quasi-judicial basis”, when the federal board, commission or tribunal

(a) failed to observe a principle of
natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its
jurisdiction;

(b) erred in law in making its
decision or order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record;
or

(c) based its decision or order on
an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or
without regard for the material before it.

I see no reason for reading those provisions as
applicable only in civil matters. They are framed in the most general terms and
they apply to a “superior court of record having civil and criminal
jurisdiction” (s. 3). Of course, criminal jurisdiction is generally
exercised by courts, not by “boards, commissions or other tribunals” and,
therefore, relief must still be sought in most cases before superior courts of
criminal jurisdiction in accordance with the principles laid down in Re
Storgoff[6].
However, when the decision to be reviewed in criminal matters was made, not by
a court but by a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”, then, it seems
to me, the clear meaning is that the jurisdiction shall be exercised by the Federal
Court, not by the other superior courts. In fact, the Federal Court has
exercised jurisdiction in criminal matters, not only under s. 28 in the
matter of the request for extradition of Karleton Lewis

[Page 235]

Armstrong[7], but also under
s. 18 in Sedore v. Commissioner of Penitentiaries[8], Lingley v. Hickman[9] and In re Frank David Ellis[10], citing only reported cases that have come
to my attention.

The writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus
mentioned in s. 18 of the Federal Court Act have always been
available in civil and criminal matters without distinction. They are
enumerated with habeas corpus under the heading “Extraordinary Remedies”
in s. 708 of the Criminal Code which is in the following terms:

708. This
Part applies to proceedings in criminal matters by way of certiorari, habeas
corpus, mandamus and prohibition.

This wording restricting the application of Part
XXIII to “proceedings in criminal matters” is to be contrasted with
s. 18 of the Federal Court Act which provides that “The Trial
Division has exclusive original jurisdiction (a) to issue an injunction, writ
of certiorari, writ of prohibition, writ of mandamus or writ of quo
warranto, or grant declaratory relief, against any federal board,
commission or other tribunal;…” The scope of this enactment is limited by
reference to the persons or bodies amenable to it, not as in the Criminal
Code by reference to the nature of the proceedings before them. To the
extent that those matters are criminal, this involves a transfer to the Federal
Court of the jurisdiction of the superior courts of criminal jurisdiction as
against federal boards, commissions or other tribunals. In civil matters, the
effect of the provision is also to take away the jurisdiction of the superior
courts of the Provinces (Pringle v. Fraser[11]).

[Page 236]

I cannot agree that prior to the enactment of
the Federal Court Act there was no possible form of review of the
discharge of a person in extradition proceedings. There does not appear to be
any reported case in which such review was sought but, on principle, I fail to
see why a mandamus would not have been available in a situation similar
to that in which this remedy was held available against the judge who had
erroneously quashed the indictment in Kipp v. Attorney General for Ontario[12]. I am not suggesting that this is a
similar case, but Parliament did not only transfer to the Trial Division of the
Federal Court all available remedies against federal boards, commissions and
other tribunals, it also created an extended remedy by way of a general right
of review to be exercised by the Federal Court of Appeal in broadly defined
cases.

It does not appear to me that an extradition
commissioner or judge sitting under the Extradition Act should be
considered as excluded from the definition of “federal board, commission or
other tribunal” because the Act is a self contained code. Supervisory
jurisdiction is a common law remedy which can only be excluded by explicit
enactment. It is unnecessary to review the cases dealing with privative clauses
which have always held them ineffective as against jurisdictional defects. I
fail to see how this Act could be considered different in that respect from the
other acts governing other federal agencies coming within the definition.

I also fail to see why the fact that habeas
corpus is not mentioned in the Exchequer Court Act  and therefore
remains within the jurisdiction of superior courts of criminal jurisdiction,
would make the new remedy unavailable to the person sought to be extradited. As
Rinfret C.J.

[Page 237]

said In re Brown[13], “habeas corpus is not available to
review the judgment…” It always was subject to special rules. It remains quite
independent of the remedy by certiorari although the two may sometimes
be joined, but not when there exists a right of appeal excluding certiorari.

It is quite true that the superior courts never
had the jurisdiction contemplated in s. 28 of the Federal Court Act, but
this is a new remedy. While, to a certain extent, it is a substitute for
previously existing remedies before other courts, it is obviously much broader
in scope. I can see no reason for restricting the language used because this
alters a situation that has remained unchanged for a long period of time. In Gaynor
and Green v. U.S.A.[14]
Sedgewick J. said (at p. 249):

…It would appear from the perusal of the
criminal law of Canada and of
cognate legislation that the whole policy of Parliament has been to prevent
prolonged litigation particularly in matters of a criminal nature.

Clearly, this cannot be said of present day
legislative policy. There is no necessity to review all the enactments that
have enlarged and extended the right of appeal in criminal cases including the
right of appeal by the Crown and retrials contrary to the common law rule. For
centuries, when a man was discharged on habeas corpus, this was final.
There is now a right of appeal under s. 719.5 of the Criminal Code enacted
in 1965 (13-14 El. II ch. 53 s. 1).

It seems clear that an extradition commissioner
is a “federal board, commission or other tribunal” because he is a person
exercising jurisdiction or powers “under an Act of the Parliament of Canada”
and is not “appointed under or in accordance with the law of a province or
under s. 96 of the British North America

[Page 238]

Act 1867”.
However, the judge who acted on the information in this case is a county court
judge, which means that he was appointed under s. 96 of the B.N.A. Act.
Does this mean that he is excluded from the definition? In my view, the
exclusion applies to such appointees when they are acting as such, that is when
exercising the jurisdiction of a county court judge. This is not the case under
the Extradition Act. When the powers of an extradition commissioner are
exercised by a county court judge, he is acting as persona designata, that
is a person deriving his authority, not from his appointment, but from a
special act of Parliament.

The criteria defining the situation of a judge
acting as persona designata were considered in numerous cases including C.P.R.
v. Little Seminary of Ste. Thérèse[15];
Gordon v. The City of Toronto[16]; St. Hilaire
v. Lambert[17]; Canadian
Northern Ontario Railway v. Smith[18]; Plante
v. Forest[19]; Heinz
v. Swartz[20]. It is
a well established distinction and under the Extradition Act it is
especially clear that a judge acts as persona designata because the same
powers may be exercised by commissioners who are not judges.

Respondent contended that the appellant was not
a “party directly affected by the decision or order” relying on the following
words of Lord Coleridge C.H. in R. v. Justices of the County of London[21] at p. 361:

…Is a person who cannot succeed in getting
a conviction against another a person “aggrieved”? He may be annoyed at finding
that what he thought was a breach of law is not a breach of law; but is he
“aggrieved” because some one is held not to have done wrong?…

[Page 239]

I would point out that s. 749 of the old Criminal
Code read:

749. Unless it is otherwise provided in any
Act under which a conviction takes place or an order is made by a justice for
the payment of money or dismissing an information or complaint, any person who
thinks himself aggrieved by any such conviction or order or dismissal, the
prosecutor or complainant, as well as the defendant, may appeal.

There was a similar wording in s. 761
concerning appeals by way of stated case and in Scullion v. Canadian
Breweries Transport Ltd.[22], this
Court held that the further right of appeal to the Court of Appeal against any
decision given by s. 769A (enacted by 1948 ch. 39 s. 34) availed
to the complainant. Subsection (1) of s. 769A was as follows:

769A. (1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal,
as defined in section one thousand and twelve, against any decision of the
court under the provisions of section seven hundred and fifty-two or section seven
hundred and sixty-five with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof may
be taken on any ground which involves a question of law alone.

After quoting it, Kellock J. said:

As the right of appeal thus given is
against any decision made under s. 752 or s. 765, such right
is plainly conferred upon the person who was unsuccessful below, whether he was
a person convicted or the complainant.

In the present case, the result of the decision
reached under the Extradition Act was to make it impossible for the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to make, through the United States of America, a
demand for the surrender of the respondent so that he could be tried in
accordance with the laws of the State. Throughout the proceedings counsel for
the State has enjoyed the status of counsel for a party in accordance with
established practice and I can see no

[Page 240]

reason for which a foreign state would not have
status for instituting proceedings under s. 28 of the Federal Court Act
as well as under any other law. Foreign states may not as a rule be
summoned before our courts against their will (La République démocratique du
Congo v. Venne[23]), but
nothing prevents them from appearing as parties before our courts if they so
desire. I can see no basis for the application in such cases of the rule that
criminal prosecutions are instituted in the name of the Crown. This rule
applies to prosecutions for crimes against our laws. In respect of crimes
committed abroad, the proper prosecuting authority is the authority of the
state in which the crime was committed. Of course, the Attorney-general of Canada could act in the present case by
virtue of the express terms of s. 28(2) of the Federal Court Act, but
this certainly does not exclude the right of each party to make the
application.

it was strenuously contended that the refusal to
commit the respondent was not a decision or order. In this respect, it should
be noted that the learned judge acted under a provision of the Extradition
Act reading as follows:

18. (2) If
such evidence is not produced, the judge shall order him to be
discharged. (Emphasis added).

No reason was advanced for reading the words
“decision or order” in s. 28(1) of the Federal Court Act otherwise
than in their plain ordinary meaning. As previously pointed out, decisions of
this Court in the interpretation of the Supreme Court Act are of no
assistance in that respect. In my view, the rule of s. 11 of the Interpretation
Act is especially applicable to an enactment establishing a new
jurisdiction and a new remedy.

11. Every
enactment shall be deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and
liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its
objects.

[Page 241]

I would allow the appeal and return the case to
the Federal Court of Appeal for hearing on the merits.

The judgment of Abbott, Judson and Laskin J.J.
was delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—It is common
ground in this appeal that prior to the passing of the Federal Court Act, 1970
(Can.), c. 1, effective June 1, 1971, there was no appeal from, or any other
form of review of the discharge of a person in extradition proceedings; he was
only at the risk of a renewal of such proceedings. Again, where an order of
committal for extradition was made against a person, his only remedy was habeas
corpus. This has been the law in Canada for over one hundred years, from
the first enactment of an extradition statute by 1868 (Can.), c. 94, governing
extradition between Canada and the United States, and for the ninety-five year
period since the enactment of the first general extradition statute by 1877
(Can.), c. 25. What falls to be decided here, leave to appeal having been
given, is whether the law has been changed by s. 28(1) of the Federal
Court Act, at least where the extradition judge has refused to direct that
the subject of the proceedings be held for extradition and has discharged him.

Section 28(1) reads as follows:

Notwithstanding section 18 or the
provisions of any other Act, the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine
an application to review and set aside a decision or order, other than a
decision or order of an administrative nature not required by law to be made on
a judicial or quasi-judicial basis, made by or in the course of proceedings
before a federal board, commission or other tribunal, upon the ground that the
board, commission or tribunal

(a) failed to observe a principle of
natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise its
jurisdiction;

[Page 242]

(b) erred in law in making its decision
or order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record; or

(c) based its decision or order on
an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or
without regard for the material before it.

Section 2(g) of the Federal Court Act defines
“federal board, commission or other tribunal” in these terms:

“federal board, commission or other
tribunal” means any body or any person or persons having, exercising or
purporting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of
the Parliament of Canada, other than any such body constituted or established
by or under a law of a province or any such person or persons appointed under
or in accordance with a law of a province or under section 96 of The
British North America Act, 1867.

In the present case, the respondent was the
subject of a request by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for extradition on a
charge of murder. Puerto Rico was entitled to make that request to the Minister
of Justice under the extradition treaty in force between Canada and the United
States. An information was sworn against the respondent by a member of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and a hearing was held before Judge Honeywell
pursuant to the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21. That judge found
the evidence insufficient to warrant holding the respondent for extradition and
he discharged him. On an application by Puerto Rico for review under
s. 28(1), the Federal Court of Appeal held unanimously[24] relying on a judgment of this Court in U.S.A.
v. Link and Green[25], that
there was no “decision or order” involved in the discharge within the meaning
of those words in s. 28(1), and it declined jurisdiction. The Federal
Court of Appeal held in a subsequent case, Re State of Wisconsin and

[Page 243]

Armstrong[26], where committal
for extradition was directed, that it did have jurisdiction to entertain an
application for review at the suit of the detainee, and it subsequently
dismissed his application on the merits in a judgment delivered on January 5,
1973. This Court refused leave to appeal on March 5, 1973, but, of course, no
interference can be drawn that the refusal implied approval of the taking of
jurisdiction by the Federal Court of Appeal.

I do not think that U.S.A. v. Link and Green,
supra was determinative for the Federal Court of Appeal of the issue of its
jurisdiction. It was concerned with the jurisdiction of this Court under
s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259 to grant leave
to appeal, and the fact that it arose out of an extradition matter was, in my
view, merely a factor for the Court to consider. Whether U.S.A. v. Link and
Green depended, as counsel for the appellant urged, on the fact that what
was sought to be appealed was not a “judgment of the highest court of final
resort in the Province… in which judgment can be had in the particular case”,
or whether it depended, as counsel for the respondent urged, on the definition
of “judgment” in s. 2(d) of the Supreme Court Act, in either
case I see nothing that bound the Federal Court of Appeal in respect of the
application of s. 28(1) of its constituent Act. I am, however, of the
opinion that a reason going beyond any definition of terms supports the
conclusion of the Federal Court of Appeal in the present case and, further,
that Re State of Wisconsin and Armstrong, supra was wrongly decided by
that Court on the point of jurisdiction.

I take the holding of this Court in Gaynor
and Green v. U.S.A.[27] to be
that extradition proceedings are proceedings of a criminal character,

[Page 244]

arising as they do out of a criminal charge, and
hence no appeal lay, under the relevant appeal provisions then in force, from
the affirmation of a refusal of prohibition to an extradition commissioner.
This characterization of extradition proceedings is quite plain under the terms
of the Extradition Act which then, as now, preserved the right to habeas
corpus of a fugitive who had been committed for surrender. Section 23 of
the present Extradition Act is almost word for word with s. 17 of
the original Act of 1877 and reads as follows:

A fugitive shall not be surrendered until
after the expiration of fifteen days from the date of his committal for
surrender, or, if a writ of habeas corpus is issued, until after the decision
of the court remanding him.

Extradition proceedings involve an intimate
relation between the executive and extradition judges arising out of a treaty
with a foreign country which commits the executive to provide an opportunity to
the foreign state to seek the return of a fugitive to answer there a charge of
a crime covered by the treaty or the return of a fugitive convicted there of an
extradition crime. If a fugitive is committed for extradition the Minister of
Justice must be so notified by the extradition judge (see s. 19 of the
Act) and it is nessary for the foreign state to make a requisition to the
Minister of Justice for the surrender of the fugitive. It is for the Minister
to determine if there should be a surrender, and I doubt whether mandamus would
lie to compel him to that act, even in a situation not falling within ss. 21
and 22 of the Extradition Act, which forbids surrender in the case of a
crime of a political character, or entitles the Minister on that ground to
refuse it upon his determination either that the offence is of that character
or that is what lies behind the proceedings. Indeed, the Minister, acting under
s. 22, may discharge the fugitive from custody.

[Page 245]

I have referred to the scheme of the Act (and it
is the same scheme that we have had for some one hundred years) in order to
emphasize the special character of extradition proceedings and the concern
shown for the liberty of persons in Canada as against foreign claims for their
surrender, supported by provisions for habeas corpus in favour of the fugitive
and without rights of appeal or review otherwise. This policy, if I may so call
it, was the subject of comment in Gaynor and Green v. U.S.A. supra where
reference was made to the present s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. S-19 which excludes any appeal to this Court under ss. 36, 38 or 39 in
respect of, inter alia, judgments in a criminal cause or proceedings
arising out of habeas corpus in an extradition matter.

I cannot accept the submission of the appellant
that the policy to which I have referred has been abruptly reversed by general
words in s. 28(1) when such words have ample subject matter without
construing them to embrace extradition proceedings. There is support for this
opinion in the scheme of the Federal Court Act and, particularly in the
specification of jurisdiction of the Trial Division and of the Federal Court of
Appeal, and in the interaction of the jurisdiction of each under ss. 18 and
28(1) to review decisions of a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”.

None of the specified classes of jurisdiction
reposed in the Trial Division under the Federal Court Act deal with
jurisdiction in criminal matters. True enough, the Federal Court (consisting of
two divisions, trial and appeal) is, by s. 3, declared to be a continuation
of the Exchequer Court of Canada and to continue to be a supe-

[Page 246]

rior court of record having civil and criminal
jurisdiction. This, however, represents merely a capacity to exercise criminal
jurisdiction when conferred. The Exchequer Court of Canada originated as a
statutory court respecting claims by or against the Crown in right of Canada
(see 1875 (Can.), c. 38, and 1887 (Can.), c. 16) with no general common law
jurisdiction and no criminal jurisdiction. It first acquired criminal jurisdiction
in 1960 under amendments to the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952,
c. 314, made by 1960 (Can.), c. 45, ss. 17 and 19. The conferring of the
particular criminal jurisdiction was accompanied by a provision (which became
s. 46(1) of R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23) that “for the purposes of such
prosecution or other proceedings the Exchequer Court of Canada has all the
powers and jurisdiction of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction under the Criminal
Code and under this Act”. I refer to the judgment of this Court in The
Queen v. Hemlock Park Co-Operative Farm Ltd.[28], where there is a discussion by Pigeon J.
of certain aspects of this new jurisdiction.

The foregoing provision in the 1960 amendments
to the Combines Investigation Act appears to be the source of the
reference in s. 3 of the Federal Court Act that the Federal Court
shall continue to be a superior court of record having civil and criminal
jurisdiction. It has, indeed, a very limited character as a court of criminal
jurisdiction. The jurisdiction originally reposed in the Exchequer Court, as
carried into s. 46 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-23, was transferred to the Trial Division of the Federal Court by
R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10, s. 65, item 9, and there was added a provision
for an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal, with a further appeal to this
Court. I know of no other jurisdiction of a criminal

[Page 247]

character that has been reposed in the Federal
Court in either of its divisions. Accordingly, I would find it strange that
jurisdiction in extradition matters can be comprehended, by a sidewind so to
speak, within s. 28(1).

If there is such jurisdiction that has been
conferred in such an exceptional manner, I cannot see any basis for the
distinction that the Federal Court of Appeal has made between review where
there has been a committal and no review where there has been a discharge. If
the whole matter is not there, I would find it difficult to accept a situation
where the half that is there is in respect of a person who has been committed
for extradition. He is already protected by a right to resort to habeas
corpus under s. 23 of the Extradition Act; and if it cannot be
said (as I think it cannot) that this right is implicitly displaced by
s. 28(1) of the Federal Court Act I see no merit in a view that
seeks to provide a somewhat parallel remedy by invocation of very general words
while denying any remedy at all under the same words where there has been a
discharge.

Section 27 of the Federal Court Act confers
a straight right of appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal from final and
interlocutory judgments of the Trial Division. Applications for review under
s. 28(1), having regard to the wide grounds of review do not differ
materially from appeals; but the scope of review distinguishes the jurisdiction
of the Federal Court of Appeal over decisions of judicial or quasi-judicial
federal boards, commissions or other tribunals from the prerogative writ
jurisdiction conferred upon the Trial Division by s. 18. There is, even
apart from the difference in scope of review, the displacing phrase with which
s. 28(1) begins, namely, “Notwithstanding section 18 or the
provisions of any other Act”, and the displacement of the Trial Division is
emphasized by s.

[Page 248]

28(3). I do not read s. 18 as conferring
jurisdiction upon the Trial Division to interfere by any of the prerogative
writs with decisions in criminal matters; it is aimed at federal administrative
agencies, although without limitation to agencies of a judicial or quasi-judicial
nature. Similarly, having regard to the interaction of ss. 18 and 28(1), I do
not view s. 28(1) as involving review of decisions or orders in criminal
matters.

Although issue was taken by counsel for the
respondent with the right of Puerto Rico to apply for review, the contention
being that it was not a “party directly affected” within s. 28(3), I do
not think that a ruling in favour of Puerto Rico’s standing to invoke
s. 28(1) carries the appellant over the main hurdle to which I have alluded.
Similarly with a holding that an extradition judge comes within the definition
of a “federal board, commission or other tribunal”. It is one thing to do what
ss. 18 and 28(1) have done, that is to transfer out of the provincial superior
courts the jurisdiction that they theretofore had to review decisions of
federal administrative agencies. It is quite another thing to read the
transferring words, merely because of their generality, as endowing the Federal
Court of Appeal with a jurisdiction that the provincial superior courts never
had.

The Extradition Act has been since its
enactment a self-contained code. There is no common law of extradition as there
is a common law of judicial review of the decisions of administrative agencies.
Hence, undifferentiated references, as in ss. 18 and 28(1), to federal boards,
commissions or other tribunals ought not to be read as capturing extradition

[Page 249]

matters when there is no express mention thereof
in the definition of such agencies.

For the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion
that the Federal Court of Appeal is without jurisdiction to entertain an
application to review either the discharge or the committal of a person in
extradition proceedings taken against him. I would, accordingly, dismiss the
appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—I have had the
opportunity to read the reasons for judgment of my brother Laskin and I agree
with him that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons which he has
given. However, I do not wish to be understood to be of the opinion that the
decision of this Court in Gaynor and Green v. U.S.A.[29] was not, at any rate, a very persuasive
authority to the Federal Court of Appeal that a refusal of a commissioner under
the Extradition Act to hold an accused for extradition was not a matter
subject to review under the provisions of 28(1) of the Federal Court Act. On
the other hand, I am of the opinion that the decision of this court in the Gaynor
and Green case might well be sound authority for the view that such a
refusal was no more a decision under the provisions of the Federal Court Act
than it was a judgment under the provisions of s. 41 of the Supreme
Court Act.

I am also of the view that the position taken by
the respondent in the present case in this Court that the foreign state has no
status to appear on an application for review, if such review were possible, is
soundly taken and that the applicant for such review should have been either
the informant or more probably the Attorney General for Canada. It is
unnecessary in the present case to base the decision of this Court on that
point and I merely mention it at the present time.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Conviction on charge of
non-capital murder—Appeal—Application of s. 613(1) (a) (i) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.

The appellant was found guitly of non-capital
murder. The essential witness for the Crown was the wife of the murdered man.
She identified the accused at a line-up three days after her husband was
killed, but there were some discrepancies between her statement of the facts
and some relevant physical facts observed by other witnesses shortly after the
crime. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal, and the only difference of
opinion there was as to the application of s. 613 (1) (a) (i) of
the Criminal Code which provides that a Court of Appeal may allow an
appeal where it is of the opinion that the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

Held (Spence
and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Abbott,
Martland, Judson, Pigeon and Dickson JJ.: If the judges of the majority in the
Court of Appeal had held that their function under s. 613(1)(a)(i)
was only to decide whether there was evidence, this would be reversible error.
The Court of Appeal must satisfy itself not only that there was evidence
requiring the case to be submitted to the jury, but also that the weight of
such evidence is not so weak that a verdict of guilty is unreasonable. This
cannot be taken to mean that the Court of Appeal is to substitute its opinion
for that of the jury. The word of the enactment is “unreasonable”, not
“unjustified”. The jurors are the triers of the facts and their finding is not
to be set aside because the judges in appeal do not think they would have made
the same finding if sitting as jurors. This is only to be done if they come to
the conclusion that the verdict is such that no twelve reasonable men could
possibly have reached it acting judicially.

[Page 276]

Section 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, which
provides that the failure of a person charged, to testify, “shall not be made
the subject of comment by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution”, does
not prevent the jury from taking the fact into account without being told. No
one can reasonably think that a jury will fail, in reaching a verdict, to take
into account the failure of the accused to testify. This being so, it is a fact
properly to be considered by the Court of Appeal when dealing with the
question: “Is this a reasonable verdict?”

Per Spence and
Laskin JJ., dissenting: The difference between the question
whether there is any evidence upon which a jury may convict and the
question whether “the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”
is not only the difference between s. 613(1)(a) (ii) and
s. 613(1)(a)(i) but is the central matter that must engage the
provincial appellate Court when its jurisdiction is invoked on an appeal from
conviction on the grounds stated in s. 613(1)(a)(i). The majority
of the Court of Appeal rested their dismissal of the accused’s appeal on the
ground that there was evidence upon which the jury could convict.

The jury must have treated the wife of the
victim as a credible witness. But the credibility of a witness to a jury cannot
alone invalidate the contention that their verdict is unreasonable or cannot be
supported on the evidence as a whole. This was the mistake that the majority of
the Court of Appeal made in their approach to s. 613(1)(a)(i). The
members of a provincial appellate Court must weigh the evidence in bringing
their own judgment to bear on the issue whether the jury’s verdict is
unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence and they are entitled to
substitute their opinion for that of the jury on that issue.

Failure to testify, if it can have any
significance at all on an appeal by an accused, can go only to the dismissal of
the appeal on the ground that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice, a matter that is related not to s. 613(1)(a)(i) but to
s. 613(1)(a)(ii) relating to a wrong decision on a question of law.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for British Columbia[1], dismissing an
appeal from a conviction on a charge of noncapital murder. Appeal dismissed,
Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

T.A. Dohm, Q.C., for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson, Pigeon
and Dickson JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—Appellant was found guilty of
non-capital murder after a trial before Aikins J. and a jury at Prince George, B.C., on November 9, 1971.
The essential witness for the Crown was the wife of the murdered man, one
Mac-Donald. She was herself hit by three bullets fired at her by the murderer
immediately after shooting her husband. She identified the accused at a line-up
three days later, but there were some discrepancies between her statement of
the facts and some relevant physical facts observed by other witnesses shortly
after the crime.

In the Court of Appeal, there was unanimity as
to the fairness of the address to the jury and the only question on which a
difference of opinion arose was the application of subparagraph (a)(i)
of s. 613.1 of the Criminal Code. This subparagraph provides that
the Court of Appeal

(a) may allow the appeal where it is of the
opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

The conclusion of the formal judgment of the
Court of Appeal was:

THIS COURT DOTH ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the
Motion for Leave to Appeal conviction aforesaid be and the same is hereby
granted, the appeal from conviction aforesaid be and the same is hereby
dismissed, the Honourable Mr. Justice Robertson who would have allowed the
appeal dissenting

[Page 278]

with respect to the function of the Court
under subparagraph 613 (1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code.

The appeal to this Court was taken under
s. 618.1(a) whereby a person convicted may appeal “on any question
of law on which a judge of the court of appeal dissents”.

In my view, the reasons for judgment delivered
by Branca and Taggart JJ.A. for the majority, and by Robertson J.A. dissenting,
clearly show that the dissent is not on a question of law but solely on the
application of the law. This is why it was found impossible to specify the
grounds of law for the dissent, as required by s. 606.

Counsel for the accused, in his thorough
argument, was equally unable to formulate any question of law arising out of
the dissent. Here is how he stated the issue in the memorandum summarizing his
submissions:

The error in law alleged is that the
majority of the Court of Appeal were wrong in their approach to their function
under Section 613.

It is submitted that the majority did not
reach their own conclusions on the weight of the evidence as they must do in an
appeal under Section 613 (1)(a)(i).

The Appellant urges that he is by law
entitled to have the Provincial Appellate Court arrive at its own opinion
judicially under this Section after a review of all the evidence in the case.

It is not sufficient for the Judges of the Provincial Appeal Court to consider only
whether there is any evidence to support the conviction.

Of course, if the judges of the majority had
held that their function was only to decide whether there was evidence, this
would be reversible error. The Code expressly provides that the appeal may be
allowed, not only when the verdict cannot be supported by the evidence but also
when it is unreasonable. In other words, the Court of Appeal must satisfy
itself not only that there was evidence requiring the case to be submitted to
the jury, but also that

[Page 279]

the weight of such evidence is not so weak that
a verdict of guilty is unreasonable. This cannot be taken to mean that the
Court of Appeal is to substitute its opinion for that of the jury. The word of
the enactment is “unreasonable”, not “unjustified”. The jurors are the triers
of the facts and their finding is not to be set aside because the judges in
appeal do not think they would have made the same finding if sitting as jurors.
This is only to be done if they come to the conclusion that the verdict is such
that no twelve reasonable men could possibly have reached it acting judicially.

I cannot read the reasons of the majority judges
as implying that they did not apply the proper test and solely considered
whether there was evidence. The two grounds of appeal dealing with this point
were stated as follows in the notice of appeal:

3. The verdict of the jury should be set
aside on the ground that it is unreasonable and perverse and such that no
twelve men, properly directed, should reasonably have found.

4. The verdict of the jury should be set
aside on the ground that it cannot be supported by the evidence.

On these, Branca J.A. said:

This Court cannot retry this case or
substitute itself for the jury and find facts. That was the particular task of
the jury. The function of this Court is purely to review the evidence and the
directions of the learned trial Judge to the jury and to see whether or not the
evidence reasonably supported the finding of the jury and to satisfy itself
that the charge of the learned trial Judge was free of misdirection or
non-direction and fairly related the evidence to the issues to be solved by the
jury.

Can it be said that the verdict of the jury
in this case is perverse, that is, that the verdict is so patently unreasonable
and unjust as to satisfy this Court that

[Page 280]

no reasonable jury of twelve men,
considering the evidence as a whole and acting judicially in accordance with
judicial instructions, would reach the verdict in question? It is only on this
basis that a verdict given by a jury may be considered as perverse. However, a
verdict cannot be said to be perverse where there is evidence to support the
conclusion arrived at by the jury particularly where the instructions from the
learned trial Judge are as full and as fair and as lucid as they were in the
instant case.

In my view, there is nothing from which it might
be deduced that the learned judge only considered whether there was evidence.
If there had been no evidence, it would have been the duty of the trial
judge to withhold the case from the jury. This is not what was considered. The
point dealt with assumed that the case was properly before the jury. It was
asked in effect whether they could reasonably answer “Guilty” and, in my
opinion, that was the proper test before the Court of Appeal.

At the end of his reasons, Branca J.A.
added:

….The accused did not testify. He was under
no duty to do so and was entitled to rely upon the presumption of innocence and
the fact that the Crown had to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The
fact that he did not testify did not relieve the Crown of the duty of
proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but where as here there was
evidence of a direct nature which inculpated him and which the jury accepted as
truthful then this Court may well consider his failure to testify as a
factor in disposing of this appeal.

Assuming that the correctness of that statement
is a question of law that may be considered on this appeal, I can find no
reason for disagreeing with it. Section 4.5 of the Canada Evidence Act provides
that the failure of a person charged “shall not be made the subject of comment
by the judge, or by counsel for the prosecution”, it does not prevent the jury
from taking the fact into account without being told. No one can reasonably
think that a jury will fail,

[Page 281]

in reaching a verdict, to take into account the
failure of the accused to testify, specially in a case like this. This being
so, it is a fact properly to be considered by the Court of Appeal when dealing
with the question: “Is this a reasonable verdict?”

The other opinion for the majority was given by
Taggart J.A. With respect to the reasonableness of the verdict, he said:

Undoubtedly there was evidence tending to
weaken Mrs. MacDonald’s evidence of identification but in the final
analysis it was for the jury, after directions from the presiding Judge which I
can only describe as being scrupulously fair to the appellant, to decide whether
to accept or reject the evidence of identification. In these circumstances I
cannot say that the jury were perverse in accepting evidence of identification
nor is this a case where this Court should apply the provisions of Code
s. 613(1)(a)(i).

From this it is abundantly clear that the
learned judge did not confuse the function of the Court in considering the
reasonableness of a verdict with its function in deciding whether there was any
evidence at all. Therefore, neither he nor Branca J.A. differed in law from the
view expressed by the dissenting judge, Robertson J.A., who said:

It being the duty of the court to reach a
conclusion whether the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence, the court must consider the weight of the evidence. Here undoubtedly
the court can properly be influenced by the weight that the jury must have
given to it (particularly where there is conflict between the evidence of
different witnesses but this does not relieve the court of the duty to reach
its own conclusion. For the court to say, “Yes, it is our conclusion that
the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, but the
jury is the finder of facts and obviously thought that the verdict was
reasonable and could be so supported, and so we shall not interfere” is, in
my opinion, to exercise the Court’s function in something less than a judicial
fashion. In the final analysis, it is an abdica-

[Page 282]

tion by the Court in favour of the jury, an
abnegation by the Court of its judicial duty. By such an attitude the Court is
declining to give effect to conclusion and opinion that the appellant was
entitled to have it arrive at.

I do not read the above as meaning that the duty
of the Court of Appeal is to reach its opinion on the basis of what its members
think they would have decided if sitting as the jury so that, if they are not
convinced that they would have rendered the same verdict, they are to find it
unreasonable. If that is what the learned judge meant, then I must disagree
with him because that is not the proper test. As previously noted, the question
is whether the verdict is unreasonable, not whether it is unjustified. The
function of the court is not to substitute itself for the jury, but to decide
whether the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially,
could reasonably have rendered.

I do not find it necessary to review the
authorities cited by Robertson J.A. because none of them appears to me to
differ from what I have stated to be the proper view of the law and it does not
appear to me that the learned judge intended to depart. In my view, his dissent
was solely based on a different view of the facts, which he expressed in the
closing paragraph of his reasons in the following words:

Summing up my view, the testimony put
forward in support of the Crown’s case was too unsafe, its nature was too
dubious, to rest a conviction on it, and the verdict was, therefore,
unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Spence and Laskin JJ. was
delivered by

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—There are two
issues in this appeal by the accused from the affirmation by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal (Branca and Taggart JJ.A., Robertson J.A. dissenting)
of his conviction of non-capital murder.

[Page 283]

The first issue is a jurisdictional one,
involving the authority of this Court to entertain the appeal under
s. 618(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The second issue, which
arises only if there is jurisdiction, is whether this Court should properly
dispose of the appeal on the merits of the substantive contentions or whether,
if there be error in law in the position taken and the disposition made by the
majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, the case should be remitted
to that Court or there should be a new trial. Counsel for the accused and for
the Crown in this Court were at one in stating that if there was such error in
the provincial appellate Court as to give this Court authority to intervene,
the case should go back to the provincial appellate Court to be dealt with on a
proper application of s. 613(1)(a) (i) of the Criminal Code. It
is in respect of this provision that the question of jurisdiction of this Court
to entertain the appeal under s. 618(1)(a) arises.

Section 618(1)(a) reads as
follows:

A person who is convicted of an indictable
offence other than an offence punishable by death and whose conviction is
affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents, …

Whether there has been a dissent by Robertson
J.A. on a question of law may be gleaned both from the formal judgment of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal and from the reasons for judgment of the three
members of that Court who sat on the accused’s appeal from his conviction.

The formal judgment, so far as relevant, is in
these words:

This Court Doth Order and Adjudge that …
the appeal from conviction aforesaid be and the same is hereby dismissed, the
Honourable Mr. Justice Robertson who would have allowed the appeal
dissenting

[Page 284]

with respect to the function of the Court
under subparagraph 613(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code.

Section 613(1)(a)(i) is as follows:

On the hearing of an appeal against a
conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on account of
insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty on
account of insanity, the court of appeal

(a) may allow the appeal where it is
of the opinion that

(i) the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,

What is said by counsel for the appellant to be
the question of law upon which Robertson J.A. dissented is the
misinterpretation of s. 613(1)(a)(i) in the exercise by the
majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal of its function thereunder. In
considering this issue, it is necessary to avoid blurring it by reliance on the
unobjectionable (and in this case, indeed, exemplary) charge of the trial judge
to the jury. Whether the trial judge has properly discharged his function is
one thing, and is not disputable here; whether the Court of Appeal has done so
is quite a different thing.

There is a similar need, on the question under
consideration, of distinguishing the function of the jury and the function of
the Court of Appeal in examining the jury’s verdict under the prescriptions of
s. 613(1)(a)(i). If there is no evidence upon which a
properly-instructed jury could convict, that would raise a question of law
under s. 613(1)(a)(ii); and, moreover, if at the close of the
Crown’s case the trial judge concludes that there is no case to go to the jury
he would direct that a verdict of acquittal be entered. However, if the case
goes to the jury, either after election by the accused not to offer evidence
(as in this case) or after evidence is also given by the defence, the fact that
the jury convicts on the evidence is not, ipso facto, determinative of
the inapplicability of s.

[Page 285]

613(1)(a)(i). The difference between the
question whether there is any evidence upon which a jury may convict and
the question whether “the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence” (and I emphasize the words “any” and “the”) is not only the
difference between s. 613(1)(a)(ii) and s. 613(1)(a)(i)
but is the central matter that must engage the provincial appellate Court when
its jurisdiction is invoked on an appeal from conviction on the grounds stated
in s. 613(1)(a)(i). Otherwise, the invocation of the provincial
appellate Court’s power under s. 613(1)(a)(i) becomes an exercise
in futility and obliges an appellant to limit himself or herself to resort to
s. 613(1)(a)(ii) on a question of law.

The distinction that I have noted in the powers
vested in the provincial appellate Court under s. 613(1)(a)(i) and
(ii) has been part of the Criminal Code since the introduction of those
provisions, in substantially the same wording, by 1923 (Can.), c. 41,
s. 9. The fact that it would generally be a narrow jurisdiction that a
provincial appellate Court would exercise under s. 613(1)(a)(i)
does not permit it to abdicate judgment, however tempting or comforting it
would be to rest on a jury’s verdict simpliciter. Certainly, it could
become a nice question of judgment whether the evidence, although sufficient to
permit the case to go to a jury, is yet not enough to support the verdict, or
whether, on the evidence as a whole the verdict is unreasonable.

The dissent of Robertson J.A. is on this very
point, namely, that his brethren of the majority rested their dismissal of the
accused’s appeal on the ground that there was evidence upon which

[Page 286]

the jury could convict. I read their reasons to
say exactly that, whether they meant it or not.

The matter before this Court does not arise in a
trivial case, although I hasten to say that it should make no difference
whether an accused is here, on the point under discussion, in a matter as grave
as non-capital murder or in one infinitely lighter. It arises, moreover, not
upon a verdict based upon a conflict of oral testimony as to whether what the
accused did amounted to non-capital murder but, rather, upon the identification
of the accused by the wife of the victim, uncorroborated in any particular save
by her reiteration, and with her evidence of the occurrence completely shaken
by the evidence of various physical facts which simply do not square with her
narrative. The trial judge said in the course of his charge that “the Crown’s
case is difficult and seems to me a bit puzzling”. There was no motive for the
accused to kill the victim; and the trial judge rightly added in this
connection that “where there is no motive proved the effect is to make it that
much less likely that the man is the man who killed”.

Of course, to convict, the jury must have
accepted the identification evidence; it must have treated the wife of the
victim as a credible witness in that respect. But the credibility of a witness
to a jury cannot alone invalidate the contention that their verdict is
unreasonable or cannot be supported on the evidence as a whole. It is my view
that this is the mistake that the majority of the Court of Appeal made in their
approach to s. 613(1)(a)(i).

[Page 287]

The reasons of both Branca J.A. and of Taggart
J.A. explicitly recognize the incompatibility of the physical evidence, as, for
example, where in the room the victim was found after the fatal shooting and
where blood was found, with the testimony of the victim’s wife as to what
happened after she admitted the person, said by her to be the accused, to the
motel unit occupied by her and her husband. Branca J.A. dealt with
s. 613(1)(a)(i) as follows:

Can it be said that the verdict of the jury
in this case is perverse, that is, that the verdict is so patently unreasonable
and unjust as to satisfy this Court that no reasonable jury of twelve men,
considering the evidence as a whole and acting judicially in accordance with
judicial instructions, would reach the verdict in question? It is only on this
basis that a verdict given by a jury may be considered as perverse. However, a
verdict cannot be said to be perverse where there is evidence to support the
conclusion arrived at by the jury particularly where the instructions from the
learned trial Judge are as full and as fair and as lucid as they were in the
instant case.

This, in my view, is patent error which is
underlined in the following portion of the dissenting reasons of Robertson
J.A.:

It being the duty of the court to reach a
conclusion whether the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence, the court must consider the weight of the evidence. Here undoubtedly
the court can properly be influenced by the weight that the jury must have
given to it (particularly where there is conflict between the evidence of
different witnesses), but this does not relieve the court of the duty to reach
its own conclusion. For the court to say, “Yes, it is our conclusion that the
verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, but the jury is
the finder of facts and obviously thought that the verdict was reasonable and
could be so supported, and so we shall not interfere” is, in my opinion, to
exercise the Court’s function in something less than a judicial fashion. In the
final analysis, it is an abdication by the Court in favour of the jury, an
abnegation by the Court of its judicial duty. By such an attitude the Court is
declining to give effect to

[Page 288]

conclusion and opinion that the appellant
was entitled to have it arrive at.

The error of Branca J.A. is compounded by the
concluding sentence of his reasons when he said:

The fact that he did not testify did not
relieve the Crown of the duty of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,
but where as here there was evidence of a direct nature which inculpated him
and which the jury accepted as truthful, then this Court may well consider his
failure to testify as a factor in disposing of this appeal.

The reference to failure to testify, if it can
have any significance at all on an appeal by an accused, can go only to the dismissal
of the appeal on the ground that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice, a matter that is related not to s. 613(1)(a)(i) but to
s. 613(1)(a)(ii) relating to a wrong decision on a question of law.
Indeed, in his concluding sentence Branca J.A. reaffirms what I have said is a
mistaken view of the function of an appellate Court under s. 613(1)(a)(i);
to say, as he does, that the appeal fails because there is evidence inculpating
the accused which was accepted by the jury is to disregard the duty fixed by
s. 613(1)(a)(i).

Even if the reasons of Taggart J.A. did not
disclose the error which is evident in those of Branca J.A., that would not
affect the conclusion that the appeal is properly before this Court under
s. 618(1)(a). In my opinion, however, they do disclose the same
erroneous approach. This is what he said:

Undoubtedly there was evidence tending to
weaken Mrs. MacDonald’s evidence of identification but in the final
analysis it was for the jury, after directions from the presiding Judge which I
can only describe as being scrupulously fair to the appellant, to decide
whether to accept or reject the evidence of identifica-

[Page 289]

tion. In these circumstances I cannot say
that the jury were perverse in accepting evidence of identification nor is this
a case where this Court should apply the provisions of Code s. 613(1)(a)(i).

This is simply a rejection of the contentions of
the appellant under s. 613(1)(a)(i) on the ground that the jury was
entitled to accept the identification evidence, and that acceptance accordingly
excluded perverseness or any interference with their verdict on the ground that
the verdict, on the whole of the evidence, was unreasonable. It is not an
assessment by Taggart J.A. of the weight of the evidence, which is included in
the duty laid upon the provincial appellate Court by s. 613(1)(a)(i).
The members of that Court must surely weigh the evidence in bringing their own
judgment to bear on the issue whether the jury’s verdict is unreasonable or
cannot be supported by the evidence. They are quite entitled to substitute
their opinion for that of the jury on that issue.

I have already adverted to the fact that an
appellate Court may be reluctant to upset a jury verdict on simply a scrutiny
of a lifeless record. Such reluctance must not, however, be translated into a
principle of non-reviewability, and this, in my opinion, is what has happened
in the present case. I readily agree that it is oversimplification to make the
test of interference whether the appellate Court would have given the same
verdict. That cannot be known until there has been full reconsideration of the
record of evidence upon which the verdict was based. Such reconsideration may
very well dispose the appellate Court to say that, although we might not have
arrived at the same verdict, we do not think it is unreasonable, nor do we
think that it is unsupported by the whole of the evidence. On the other hand,
the reconsideration might lead to the conclusion that the verdict should be
upset on one or other of the stated grounds.

[Page 290]

The difficulty that s. 613(1)(a)(i)
presents is in its invitation to verbal formulas which are rationalizations of
conclusions reached otherwise. Section 613(1)(a)(i) is a source of power
which a provincial appellate Court can use liberally or restrictively. The
Supreme Court of Canada cannot monitor that use when the provincial appellate
Court has shown that it is its independent assessment that governs, albeit
there is understandable acknowledgment of the advantages possessed by the jury.
That, however, is not this case.

The majority of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in the present case failed to be responsive to their function under
s. 613(1)(a)(i) which was stated by that Court, differently
constituted, in R. v. Inglehart[2], where
Bull J.A., speaking for the Court, said this (at p. 215):

It is not the function of the Court to
retry an appellant or decide his innocence or guilt. That is for the jury.
However, it is the duty of the Court to decide whether a verdict of the jury is
reasonable, whether it can be supported, having regard to the evidence. It
should set aside a verdict of a jury, even if there is some evidence upon which
the latter could find guilt, if it is determined that the charge is not proved
with a certainty necessary to support a verdict of guilty and on the facts a
conviction would be unsafe and the verdict on the whole unsatisfactory.

Branca J.A. took this approach in the later case
of R. v. Mohinder Singh Dhillon[3], as
did Robertson J.A. who participated in that appeal. In the present case,
Robertson J.A. followed it again but Branca J.A. did not. In following it,
Robertson J.A. concluded upon an extensive review of the evidence, both
testimonial and physical, that

[Page 291]

“the testimony put forward in support of the
Crown’s case was too unsafe, its nature was too dubious, to rest a conviction
on it, and the verdict was, therefore, unreasonable and not supported by the
evidence”. In the result, he would have allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction
and directed an acquittal.

In my opinion, the same result should have been
reached by the majority, had they exercised their reviewing function under a
proper appreciation of the duty demanded of them by s. 613(1)(a)(i).
Their error in this respect was on a question of law upon which there was a
dissent, and this Court thus has jurisdiction in this appeal. Having that
jurisdiction, this Court is empowered by s. 623(1) of the Criminal Code
to make the order which the provincial appellate Court might have made upon
a proper appreciation of the law. In this respect, I can add nothing to what
Robertson J.A. has said in his careful judgment, and I would, accordingly,
allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and enter a verdict of acquittal.
Although counsel for the accused and for the Crown were content to have the
case remitted to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration under the view of
s. 613(1)(a)(i) which that Court ought to have taken, I see no advantage
in doing so in this case.

As a postscript to these reasons, I refer to the
recent judgment of the House of Lords in Stafford v. Director of Public
Prosecutions[4], in
which I find support for my view of the independent function of an appellate
Court under s. 613(1)(a)(i). The House of Lords was concerned with
s. 2(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968 (U.K.), c. 19 which, inter
alia, directs

[Page 292]

the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal from
conviction “if they think that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on
the ground that under all the circumstances of the case it is unsafe or
unsatisfactory”. This provision replaced s. 4(1) of the Criminal Appeal
Act, 1907 (U.K.), c. 23, which was the source of our s. 613(1)(a).
Although there is a reference in the reasons of Lord Kilbrandon (reasons were also
delivered by Viscount Dilhorne, by Lord Diplock and by Lord Cross of Chelsea)
to the view that the 1968 provision may have enlarged the authority of the
Court of Appeal beyond that given by the 1907 Act, the reasons of all the Law
Lords make it clear that the Court of Appeal in exercising its appellate
function is to do so according to what “they think”.

The Stafford case was one in which fresh
evidence was adduced on appeal, and it was in the light of that evidence as
well as of the record at trial that the Court of Appeal considered whether the
conviction should be set aside as unsafe or unsatisfactory. It declined to do
so, and the issue on further appeal was whether it ought to have asked itself
whether the jury might have had a reasonable doubt even if the Court of Appeal
itself did not. The House of Lords made it quite clear that it was for the
Court of Appeal, or for the House of Lords on further appeal as in this case,
to make their independent determination.

Lord Kilbrandon did say that, under the 1907
Act, emphasis was laid not so much on unreasonableness of the verdict but on
whether it was unsupported by the evidence; and he stated that verdicts which
were supported by evidence which in law the jury could accept were held to be
unassailable. I do not, as these reasons show, take so narrow a view of the
appellate Court’s function; and Lord Kilbrandon noted that it would have been
possible for the Courts, alter

[Page 293]

1907, to have said that if a verdict was unsafe
or unsatisfactory it was not reasonable. That is my view, and it is illustrated
in the following passage in Lord Kilbrandon’s reasons (at p. 769):

A conviction depending solely on the
fleeting identification by a single stranger could, for example, have been
upheld, though on a different view of the 1907 Act it would have been possible
to condemn it as unreasonable, just as today it would very probably be thought
unsafe or unsatisfactory, and be set aside on those grounds.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—False statement in
extrajudicial proceedings—Answers to questions subsequently recorded in
document—Document signed and certified by affidavit—Affidavit not qualifying as
one permitted, authorized or required by law—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c.
51, s. 114.

At the request of a police officer, the
respondent, against whom no charge had been laid, went to the offices of the
police and answered questions put to him about a news item published in a daily
newspaper, to the effect that a witness in a criminal trial had stated that he
wished to change a false testimony he was incited by the respondent to give at
the preliminary hearing. The respondent denied having taken any part in the matter,
and then signed a document in which his answers had been recorded, and
certified its accuracy by affidavit taken by an officer who held a commission
of justice of the peace solely for the purpose of administering oaths. The
respondent was charged under s. 114 of the Criminal Code with
making a false statement. He was convicted at trial but was acquitted by the
Court of Appeal. The Crown was granted leave to appeal to this Court. The
appellant contends that as the law does not prohibit certifying such a statement
by affidavit, we must conclude that it permits it, since whatever is not
prohibited by law is permitted. Furthermore, the provisions of s. 37 of
the Canada Evidence Act and of s. 35(21) of the Interpretation
Act, necessarily imply such permission.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

In the circumstances of this case, the
statement made by the respondent was not within the meaning of and having
regard to the true purpose of s. 114 of the Code, a statement which the
person making it was “permitted, authorized or required by law” to make, by
affidavit or orally under oath. In the definition of this indictable offence,
the legislator

[Page 43]

does not have in mind any extrajudicial
statement whatever, made for any and every purpose, by affidavit or orally
under oath. The legislator does not recognize as an ingredient of the
indictable offence mentioned in s. 114, affidavits which he has not
permitted, authorized or required, in short, affidavits which have no legal
meaning or scope.

Section 37 of the Canada Evidence Act and
s. 35(21) of the Interpretation Act do not support the Crown’s
claims.

APPEAL by the Crown from a judgment of the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, province of Quebec[1], setting aside the respondent’s conviction
on a charge of making a false statement. Appeal dismissed.

M. Bourassa, Q.C., for the appellant.

Claude Armand Sheppard, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Appellant, having been granted
leave to do so, appeals against a unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal of
the. Province of Quebec1. This judgment acquits respondent of the
indictable offence described in s. 114 of the Criminal Code, with which
he was charged at trial, and of which he was convicted.

114. Every one who, not being a witness in
a judicial proceeding but being permitted, authorised or required by law to
make a statement by affidavit, by solemn declaration or orally under oath,
makes in such a statement, before a person who is authorised by law to permit
it to be made before him, an assertion with respect to a matter of fact,
opinion, belief or knowledge, knowing that the assertion is false, is guilty of
an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

The circumstances leading to the foregoing
charge are not in question. Following a news item published in a Montreal
daily, to the effect that a witness in a criminal trial had stated that he
wished to change a false testimony he was incited by Boisjoly to give at the
preliminary inquiry, an officer of the Quebec Provincial Police, Inspector
Armand Houle, contacted Boisjoly and asked him if he had any objection to
coming to

[Page 44]

the offices of the Police to answer questions
about the news item. Boisjoly, against whom no charge had been laid, went to
the offices of the Police and answered questions put to him by officers
Thibault and Lawton. He denied having taken any part in the matter, then,
having been invited to do so by the officers, he signed a document (Exhibit
P-3) in which his answers had been recorded, and certified its accuracy by
affidavit taken by Inspector Houle. The latter, incidentally, then held a
commission of justice of the peace solely for the purpose of administering
oaths.

Eventually the authorities came to the opinion that,
in the circumstances, Boisjoly had knowingly made false statements, and brought
the aforementioned charge against him. He was found guilty at his trial but was
acquitted by the Court of Appeal, for the following reasons, given on behalf of
the Court by Casey J.:

As Appellant points out C.C. 114 does not
contemplate any affidavit; it contemplates only those that are “permitted,
authorised or required by law.” This means statements that are required for one
purpose or another and that the relevant provision of the law allows the person
involved to make in this manner. These are affidavits that have legal
significance and as examples I suggest the provisions relating to Bulk Sales
(C.C. 1569), to the nomination of candidates for office in the City of
Montreal (Charter sec. 256) and to the sworn declaration that must
accompany certain applications under the Highway Code (sec. 64).

In this case Appellant was asked for
certain information. He could have refused. Instead he complied and gave
answers that do not, by any stretch of the imagination, qualify as statements
that are permitted, authorized or required by law.

The only importance that I attach to the
facts of this case, particularly those relating to the manner in which P-3 was
prepared and signed and to the manner in which Houle appeared at the last
minute is that they give us an example of the informality that is so often
present in matters of this sort. They may also explain why in so many cases
affidavits are treated with little if any respect.

[Page 45]

Thus, the question of law forming the basis of
this appeal is whether the statement made by Boisjoly, in the circumstances
mentioned above, is or is not, within the meaning of and having regard to the
true purpose of s. 114 of the Criminal Code, a statement which the
person making it is “permitted, authorised or required by law” to make, by
affidavit or orally under oath.

In support of the affirmative, appellant relies
on the word “permission” in the French version, or “permitted” in the English
version. It contends that as the law does not prohibit certifying such a
statement by affidavit, we must conclude that it permits it, since, it is said,
whatever is not prohibited by law is permitted. Furthermore, contends the
appellant, the provisions of s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, and
of s. 35(21) of the Interpretation Act, necessarily imply such
permission.

I do not think appellant’s claims can be
accepted as valid, in the light of the historical and legal context of the
question to be determined.

We must at this point observe that if it may be
generally correct to assert that all that is not prohibited by law is
permitted, it follows that it is also equally correct to say that any
permission given by the legislator implies a measure of exception to a rule or
principle in effect. Otherwise, we would have to conclude that the legislator
had acted to no purpose in permitting what was already permitted. This is
certainly not the case with respect to the right to use the oral oath, the
affidavit or the solemn declaration to attest the truth of a statement of fact.

We must first remember that originally,
understanding and acceptance of the religious obligation resulting from the
oath was a condition of the competence of any witness; and that with time the
rigidity of this rule was relaxed to allow, first of all, different religious
forms of attestation, and eventually, on certain conditions or in certain
specified cases, the solemn affirmation. In Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal
Law, 19th ed., page 511, at number 584, the matter is stated thus:

584. The value added to testimony by its
being given under supernatural sanctions is frequently so

[Page 46]

great that the law formerly made it
essential to the competency of every witness that he should know and accept the
religious obligation of an oath. Increased intercourse with the East led in the
seventeenth century to the recognition of Mohammedans, and in the eighteenth to
that of Hindus, as satisfying this condition, and being entitled to be sworn
with their own sacred ceremonies. But now, even in the case of adult witnesses,
the requirement of an oath is no longer universal; for, by the Oaths Act, 1888,
‘every person objecting to be sworn, on the ground either that he has no
religious belief or that the taking of an oath is contrary to his religious
belief, shall be permitted to make his solemn affirmation in all places and for
all purposes where an oath shall be required by law’.…

The provisions of the Imperial and Canadian
statutes noted below, which have dealt with the point, indicate, among other
things, one of the historical reasons, and one of the quite affirmative
meanings, of the word “permitted” or “permis”, which is not used by the
legislator in the negative sense ascribed to it by appellant. Thus, in these or
similar terms, it is provided that a witness “shall be permitted to make a
solemn affirmation instead of an oath,” or, as we see in the French version,
“qu’une affirmation solennelle est permise au lieu d’un serment.”

Canada Evidence Act—(1952)

It is not inappropriate to note that under ss.
22 and 24 of The Canada Evidence Act (1893), 56 Vict., c. 31 and ss. 14
and 15 of the Canada Evidence Act, the option or permission granted to a
witness or deponent to attest the truth of a statement of fact by a solemn
affirmation, rather than on oath, is not absolute, but subject to certain
conditions which qualify it and limit its extent.

Thus we see that the word “permis” and the word
“permitted” imply the existence of an exception to a general principle whereby,
legally, the oath is the rule and the solemn affirmation the exception.

Though pertinent to consideration of the
principal premise on which appellant’s case is founded, these observations on
the right to elect between the oath and the solemn affirmation do not reach to
the heart of matter: this is whether, in s. 114, in the definition of this
indictable offence, related to that of perjury and, like the latter, punishable
by imprisonment for fourteen years, the legislator has in mind any
extrajudicial statement whatever, made for any and every purpose, by affidavit
or orally under oath, or whether he is considering merely those which he
permits, authorizes or requires to be so attested.

[Page 48]

In 1769, in the 4th volume of his Commentaries
on the Laws of England (cf. p. 137 of the reprint made in 1966 of the
first edition), Sir William Blackstone writes:

The law takes no notice of any perjury but
such as is committed in some court of justice having power to administer an
oath; or before some magistrate or proper officer invested with a similar
authority, in some proceedings relative to a civil suit or a criminal
prosecution; for it esteems all other oaths unnecessary, at least, and
therefore will not punish the breach of them. For which reason, it is much to
be questioned how far any magistrate is justifiable in taking a
voluntary affidavit in any extrajudicial matter, as is now too frequent
upon every petty occasion; since it is more than possible that by such idle
oaths a man may frequently, in foro conscientiae, incur the guilt, and
at the same time evade the temporal penalties, of perjury.

Subsequently, in 1835 in England, and in 1874 in
Canada, the legislator took action against the custom which had emerged of
administering and receiving oaths and affidavits voluntarily taken and made in
proceedings which are not the object of a judicial inquiry, or in any way
required or authorized by any statute. Legislation was introduced to put an end
to the practice: see the Imperial statute, (1835) 5-6 William IV, c. 62,
s. XIII, and the Canadian statute (1874) 37 Victoria, c. 37, ss. 1
and 2. It is worth setting out here the text of s. XIII of the Imperial
statute:

XIII. And whereas a practice has prevailed
of administering and receiving oaths and affidavits voluntarily taken and made
in matters not the subject of any judicial inquiry, nor in anywise pending or
at issue before the justice of the peace or other person by whom such oaths or
affidavits have been administered or received: And whereas doubts have arisen
whether or not such proceeding is illegal: For the more effectual suppression
of such practice and removing such doubts, be it enacted, that from and after
the commencement of this Act it shall not be lawful for any justice of the
peace or other person to administer or cause to allow to be administered, or to
receive or cause or allow to be received, any oath, affidavit, or solemn
affirmation touching any matter or thing whereof such justice or other person
hath not jurisdiction or cognizance by some statute

[Page 49]

in force at the time being: Provided always,
that nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to any oath,
affidavit, or solemn affirmation before any justice in any matter or thing
touching the preservation of the peace, or the prosecution, trial, or
punishment of offences, or touching any proceedings before either of the Houses
of Parliament or any committee thereof respectively, nor to any oath,
affidavit, or affirmation which may be required by the laws of any foreign
country to give validity to instruments in writing designed to be used in such
foreign countries respectively.

In the English version, our 1874 Canadian
statute has the heading Unnecessary Oaths Suppression. We can see there
the language of Backstone in the above quotation. The statute reproduces, with
some variations, the preamble, the main provision and the reservation of
s. XIII of the 1835 Imperial statute. When our criminal law was codified
in 1892, these provisions of the 1874 statute were quite substantially
reproduced in s. 153 of the Criminal Code to become eventually and
again with a few variations, subs. 1 of s. 179 of the Code prior to that
currently in force. It is appropriate to reproduce the English version of
s. 179(1):

179. Every justice or other person is
guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a fine not exceeding fifty
dollars, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months, who
administers or causes or allows to be administered, or receives, or causes or
allows to be received, any oath or affirmation touching any matter or thing whereof
such justice or other person has not jurisdiction or cognizance by some law in
force at the time being, or not authorized or required by any such law; but
nothing in this section contained shall be construed to extend to any oath
or affirmation before any justice in any matter or thing touching the
preservation of the peace, or the prosecution, trial or punishment of any
offence, or to any oath or affirmation required or authorized by any law of
Canada or by any law of the province wherein such oath or affirmation is
received or administered, or is to be used, or to any oath or affirmation,
which is required or authorized by the laws of any foreign country to give
validity to an instrument in writing or to evidence designed or intended to be
used in such foreign country.

[Page 50]

2….

In short, this section among other things
makes the justice of the peace who administers an oath touching a matter over
which he has no jurisdiction, and of which he cannot have cognizance under a
statute requiring an oath, guilty of an indictable offence. To the provision of
s. 179(1) is added a reservation to prevent its being interpreted so as to
paralyze the taking of proceedings necessary to keeping the peace—which does
not include the attestation by affidavit of a statement like that which
Boisjoly made in the aforementioned circumstances—or the prosecution, trial or
punishment of an offence, or so as to affect cases where oaths or affirmations
are required or authorized by any law of Canada, or by any law of the province
wherein such oaths or affirmations are received, administered or made, or are
to be used, or oaths or affirmations required or authorized by the law of a
foreign country, for the purposes mentioned in the section.

We thus find in these provisions of s. 179(1),
as in those from which they are derived, that it is always in the same spirit
that the legislator considers the oaths which are not permitted, authorized or
required, in short, unnecessary or useless oaths or oaths which have no legal
meaning or scope.

In the last revision of the Code s. 179
became s. 118 of the present Code; the provisions of s. 179(1) were
dropped. While it may be correct to assert that by doing so Parliament wished
to relieve individuals affected by these provisions of the implied obligation
to verify in every case where they are called on to administer an oath or
solemn affirmation, whether they may validly do so, this does not mean that by
dropping the penal sanction laid down in s. 179(1), Parliament was thereby
seeking to validate a practice hitherto condemned over the centuries. The
legislator is not presumed to substantially alter the law beyond what he states
explicitly in precise words or by necessary implication. This is all the more
since, in the present case, the provisions of s. 114 are explicit. They
refer to everyone who “being permitted, authorised or required by law to make a
statement by affidavit…”. The words “by law” qualify equally the words
“permitted, authorised

[Page 51]

or required”. The spirit of the law has not
changed. The legislator does not recognize as an ingredient of the indictable
offence mentioned in s. 114, affidavits which he has not permitted,
authorized or required, in short, affidavits which have no legal meaning or
scope.

Finally we must consider the provisions of
s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, and those of s. 35(21) of
the Interpretation Act, which in appellant’s view allow the oaths.
Section 37 reads as follows:

37. Any judge, notary public, justice of
the peace, police or stipendiary magistrate, recorder, mayor or commissioner
authorized to take affidavits to be used either in the provincial or Dominion
courts, or any other functionary authorized by law to administer an oath in any
matter, may receive the solemn declaration of any person voluntarily making the
same before him, in the form following, in attestation of the execution of any
writing, deed or instrument, or of the truth of any fact, or of any account
rendered in writing:

I, A.B. solemnly declare…

In my opinion the purpose of these provisions is
not to authorize the individuals mentioned to take affidavits or administer
oaths, but to authorize such persons, who are already vested with the power to
administer oaths or take affidavits, to also receive solemn declarations for
the purposes, and in the form, prescribed. We cannot find in these provisions
an intention of the legislator to recognize as being contemplated by
s. 114—an offence carrying a penalty of fourteen years’
imprisonment—affidavits that are not permitted, authorized or required, and
have no legal meaning or scope in themselves.

Section 35(21) of the Interpretation Act provides
that:

35. (21) “oath” includes a solemn
affirmation or declaration, whenever the context applies to any person and case
by whom and in which a solemn affirmation or declaration may be made instead of
an oath; and in like cases the expression “sworn” includes the expression
“affirmed” or “declared”;

[Page 52]

These provisions in fact have no other purpose
than to extend the normal meaning of the expression “oath” and the expression
“sworn”, so as to include the words “affirmation” or “solemn declaration” and
the words “affirmed” or “declared”, respectively. It is also to be noted that
these provisions do not operate inversely, and that moreover they remain
subject to those of s. 2(1) (a) of the same Act, which makes them
inapplicable in so far as they are inconsistent with the intent or object of
the Act to which it is sought to apply them.

In my opinion, ss. 37 and 35(21) do not support
appellant’s claims.

In short, for the foregoing reasons and
conclusions, the effect of which I feel it is advisable to limit to the
circumstances of this case, I would, with respect, find that the Court of
Appeal correctly quashed as being unfounded in law the conviction against
respondent. I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Theft—Owner of goods named in
charge—Proof of ownership—Circumstantial evidence—De facto possession.

Appeal—Criminal law—Dissent—Question of
law—Conjectural possibility or rational conclusion—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 598(1) (a).

The respondent was employed as a truck driver
for C.P. Ltd. A police officer observed the respondent and another man standing
in the foyer of a restaurant. He then saw them walk to the company’s truck. The
respondent opened the rear doors and the other person removed three cans of
peanut cooking oil from the truck and carried them into the restaurant where he
was handed something which the police officer believed to be money. That other
person then left the restaurant and entered the truck which was driven away by
the respondent. The latter denied taking any peanut oil to the restaurant and
also that anyone else had been in his truck. He was charged with theft of three
cans of peanut cooking oil, the property of C.P. Ltd. The loading sheet showed
that only two cans of oil had been placed in the truck. These were consigned
and delivered to another restaurant. The evidence established also that the
company was the only wholesale outlet for the produce and that no cans of
peanut cooking oil of the size in question had been sold to any employee on the
previous day. The respondent’s conviction was set aside by a majority judgment
of the Court of Appeal, which took the view that there was a rational conclusion
to be drawn from the evidence which was consistent with the goods having been
obtained from a source other than the company. The Crown appealed to this
Court.

Held (Spence
J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the conviction restored.

Per Abbott,
Martland, Judson and Ritchie JJ.: The Court of Appeal did not distinguish
between a con-

[Page 3]

jectural possibility, arising from the facts,
and a rational conclusion arising from the whole of the evidence. This was an
error on a question of law on which there was a dissent within the meaning of
s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.

There is a prima facie presumption of
law that the person who has de facto possession has the property. There
was evidence that the three cans of peanut cooking oil here in question were
the property of C.P. Ltd. The facts were inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion.

Per Spence J.,
dissenting: The only difference between the majority of the Court of
Appeal and the dissenting judge, was whether or not the other possible
conclusion, i.e., that the cans of oil were not the property of C.P.
Ltd., was a rational conclusion or merely a speculative one. That difference is
a difference upon a question of fact and not in any way a question of law.
There was therefore no dissent in the Court of Appeal upon a question of law
alone and, consequently, no appeal lay to this Court under s. 598(1) (a)
of the Code.

However, if this Court had jurisdiction, that
other conclusion suggested in the judgment of the majority of the Court of
Appeal was not a conjectural one but was based on a careful consideration of
all the evidence and was, therefore, a rational conclusion but not consistent
with the guilt of the respondent charged with stealing the property of C.P.
Ltd. Although it was quite conclusive that the cans had been produced by C.P.
Ltd. they might well have been sold by it to one of those innumerable concerns
which bought oil from C.P. Ltd. and stolen by the friend of the respondent from
one of such concerns. At is was not proved that these cans were in the
possession of C.P. Ltd. the doctrine of possession could not be applied to
prove property in C.P. Ltd.

APPEAL from a majority judgment of the Court
of Appeal for Ontario[1], setting aside the
respondent’s conviction for theft of goods, the property of Canada Packers Ltd.
Appeal allowed, Spence J. dissenting.

Archie Campbell, for the appellant.

Robert S. Hart, for the respondent.

[Page 4]

The judgment of Abbott, Martland, Judson and
Ritchie JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario[2] setting
aside a conviction entered against the respondent on the charge that he “did
steal three cans of peanut cooking oil of a value not exceeding $50.00, the
property of Canada Packers Limited.” The judgment of the majority of the Court
of Appeal was rendered by Aylesworth J.A., but a dissenting opinion was
filed by Schroeder J.A. and it is in relation to the question of law on which
Mr. Justice Schroeder dissented that the present appeal is brought
pursuant to s. 598 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code.

The respondent was employed as a truck driver by
Canada Packers Limited and on June 9, 1969, was driving one of that company’s
delivery trucks which had been loaded with merchandise during the previous
night. A loading sheet was prepared upon which was entered a list of goods, and
a copy of this sheet was handed to the respondent before he started on his
delivery route. The loaded truck was sealed and the seal broken by the driver
on making his first delivery.

The Division Superintendent of Canada Packers
Limited testified that the records of the company showed that on the day in
question only two 45-pound cans of peanut cooking oil were placed in the truck
driven by the respondent. They were consigned to the Happy Palace Company
restaurant, 108 Dundas Street West, Toronto, and were duly delivered.

At about 1:55 p.m. on the day in question
Detective Greer, who was then off duty, was walking east on Dundas Street when
he observed the respondent and a man named Terry Graham standing in the foyer
of the Golden City restaurant at 175 Dundas Street. Graham was holding the
restaurant door open and talking to a Chinese standing behind the cash register
when the police officer heard him say: “Will $25 be okay”? or words to that
effect, to which the Chinese replied “yes, it would be all right”, whereupon
the respondent and Graham walked to the Canada

[Page 5]

Packers truck, the respondent opened the rear
doors and Graham removed three cans of peanut cooking oil from the truck and
carried them into the restaurant where he had a further conversation with the
Chinese who handed him something which the police officer believed to be money.
Graham then left the restaurant and entered the truck which was driven away by
the respondent.

The Division Superintendent of Canada Packers
was shown the cans identified by the police officer who had seized them from
the Chinese restaurant and he stated that Canada Packers Limited refined the
peanut cooking oil in question and that it was the only wholesale outlet for
the produce which had a retail value of approximately $15.30 per can. The
Division Superintendent also testified that no cans of peanut cooking oil of
the size in question had been sold to any employee on the previous day but that
it was possible that the respondent could have got it elsewhere although his
company was the only wholesale source.

By the time that the respondent returned to the
Canada Packers Limited plant, the police officer had alerted his superiors, and
Inspector Cole was on hand to interview the respondent who there and then
denied taking any peanut oil to the Golden City restaurant and denied also that
anyone else had been in his truck. At that time he had a $20 bill folded up
small in the bottom of his wallet which he explained that he always carried in
case he had to pay for out-of-town repairs to his truck.

In commenting on the conduct of the respondent,
Mr. Justice Aylesworth, in the course of his reasons which were delivered
on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal, said:

While the whole conduct of the appellant,
in particular his denial of the presence upon the truck of the 3 cans of peanut
oil seized by the police and of the removal of those cans and delivery thereof
to the Golden City Restaurant (see Mawaz Khan v. Reginam, (1967) 1
A.E.R. 80), loudly proclaims his guilt of theft or illegal possession, that
conduct in no way aids in establishment of the title of Canada Packers Limited
in the stolen goods;…

As I have indicated, the evidence that the
cooking oil was the property of Canada Packers

[Page 6]

Limited was that the three containers were on a
Canada Packers truck which was in charge of its servant or agent, the
respondent, until the moment when they were delivered to the Golden City restaurant.
Mr. Justice Aylesworth observed that this evidence was purely
circumstantial and he took the view that there was a rational conclusion to be
drawn from the evidence which was consistent with the goods having been
obtained from a source other than the company, and that the evidence,
accordingly, did not satisfy the requirements of the rule in Hodge’s case[3].

The rule in Hodge’s case was recently
restated by Mr. Justice Spence, speaking on behalf of the majority of this
Court, in The Queen v. Mitchell[4], where
he said:

To answer this question it is desirable to
recall just what were the circumstances of Hodge’s case. The report
states that the prisoner was charged with murder, the case was one of
circumstantial evidence altogether, and contained no one fact which, taken
alone, amounted to a presumption of guilt.

Baron Alderson told the jury that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, “not only that those circumstances
were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be
satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person”.

It is quite clear that this direction was
concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person who
had committed the crime…

The Court of Appeal’s finding that there was a
rational conclusion inconsistent with ownership in the company appears to be
based entirely upon the following excerpt from the evidence of the Divisional
Superintendent of Canada Packers Limited, who gave the following evidence in
the course of his cross‑examination:

Q. Then it’s possible Mr. Bagshaw
could have got it elsewhere, your company is not the only source from which he
could obtain this peanut oil?

[Page 7]

A. No, that’s quite true. The only source
he could buy it wholesale would be from our company, Maple Leaf cooking oil.

Q. But he could buy it at a distress sale
somewhere else?

A. Correct.

There is no evidence whatever to suggest that
the respondent did buy the peanut oil either from Canada Packers Limited or
from anybody else.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in The
Queen v. Mitchell, supra, Mr. Justice Spence made the further comment
at p. 479:

The direction in Hodge’s case did
not add to or subtract from the requirement that proof of guilt in a criminal
case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. It provided a formula to assist in
applying the accepted standard of proof in relation to the first only of the
two essential elements in a crime; i.e., the commission of the act as distinct
from the intent which accompanied that act.

Reference may also be made to the reasons for
judgment of Evans J.A. in the Court of Appeal of Ontario in Regina v. Torrie[5]. The
following passage from that judgment, which appears at p. 303, was recently
adopted in this Court in Wild v. Her Majesty the Queen[6]:

With the greatest respect, I am of the
opinion that the learned trial judge misapplied the rule in Hodge’s Case (1838),
2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, as to circumstantial evidence in that he
based his finding of reasonable doubt on non-existent evidence. In Regina v.
McIver, [1965] 1 O.R. 306 at 309, [1965] 1 C.C.C. 210, McRuer C.J.H.C.
said:

‘The rule (in Hodge’s Case) makes it
clear that the case is to be decided on the facts, that is, the facts proved in
evidence and the conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be
rational conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts. No conclusion
can be a rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence. Such a conclusion
would be a speculative, imaginative conclusion, not a rational one.’

[Page 8]

This statement was approved on appeal to this
Court, [1965] 2 O.R. 475, 45 C.R. 401, [1965] 4 C.C.C. 182 and an appeal
therefrom to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed [1966] S.C.R. 254, 48
C.R. 4, [1966] 2 C.C.C. 289.

I recognize that the onus of proof must
rest with the Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable
doubt, but I do not understand this proposition to mean that the Crown must
negative every possible conjecture, no matter how irrational or fanciful, which
might be consistent with the innocence of the accused.

In the course of his reasons for judgment in the
Wild case, Mr. Justice Martland, who spoke for the majority of this
Court, had occasion to say at page 611:

In the Lemire case, to which
reference was made in the reasons of the Appellate Division, quoted above, it
was stated, in this Court, that on an appeal from a conviction, if an appellate
court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence creates a
reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, when, on a proper view of the
law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his guilt, there
is an error of law. In my opinion, that proposition applies equally in a case
in which a trial judge, in his reasons, finds that certain specified evidence
creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, when, on a proper
view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his
guilt.

In the penultimate paragraph of his reasons for
judgment in the Wild case, Mr. Justice Martland said, at page 616:

In the present case, the learned trial
judge, in considering the facts to which he referred, failed to appreciate
their proper effect, in law, in that he did not distinguish between a
conjectural possibility, arising from those facts, and a rational conclusion
arising from the whole of the evidence.

In my opinion, the same error is to be found in
the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Aylesworth in the present case and
this was a question of law on which Mr. Justice Schroeder dissented within
the meaning of s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.

[Page 9]

In the course of his reasons in the dissenting
judgment in the Court of Appeal in the present case, Mr. Justice Schroeder
expressed the further view that the evidence constituted prima facie evidence
of the company’s ownership of the property, and in this regard he cited the
statement made in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 29, para. 731, at
p. 369, where it is said:

731. Possession prima facie title. The
prima facie presumption of law is that the person who has de facto possession
has the property, and accordingly such possession is protected, whatever its
origin, against all who cannot prove a superior title. This rule applies
equally in criminal and civil matters. Thus a person in actual or apparent
possession, but without the right to possession, has, as against a stranger or
a wrongdoer, all the rights and remedies of a person entitled to and able to
prove a present right to possession.

Reference is also made to Wigmore on Evidence,
vol. 9, 3rd ed., para. 2515, and to Pollock and Maitland’s History of English
Law, p. 100.

I agree with Mr. Justice Schroeder that the
paragraph which he quoted from Halsbury’s Laws of England contains an accurate
statement of the law.

I am accordingly of the opinion that there was
evidence that the three cans of peanut cooking oil here in question were the
property of Canada Packers Limited and that the facts are inconsistent with any
other rational conclusion.

For all these reasons I would allow this appeal.

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[7] pronounced on February 25, 1970, whereby
that court allowed an appeal from the conviction of this appellant by
Provincial Judge Taylor upon the charge:

Albert Charles Wilson Bagshaw, you are
charged that on or about the 9th day of June in the year 1969, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the
County of York, unlawfully did steal three

[Page 10]

cans of peanut cooking oil of a value not
exceeding $50.00, the property of Canada Packers Limited, contrary to the
Criminal Code.

The appelant was arraigned on that charge
and pleaded not guilty. At the same time, he was arraigned on a charge:

You’re further charged that on or about the
9th day of June in the year 1969, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the County of York, unlawfully did have in your
possession three cans of peanut cooking oil of a value not exceeding $50.00,
the property of Canada Packers Limited, contrary to the Criminal Code.

and also pleaded not guilty.

The trial proceeded without any statement by the
Crown or by the Provincial Judge as to which charge was being considered. The
Provincial Judge, at the close of the trial, pronounced reasons very briefly as
follows:

Stand up Mr. Bagshaw. I’m finding that
there is a prima facie case made out against you and I can draw an inference
from all the evidence that I have heard that you in fact did steal these three
cans of peanut oil.

The only information as to the disposition of
the second charge upon which the accused was arraigned may be found in the
return on the reverse side of the information where it is indicated over the
signature of the Provincial Judge that Count No. 2, i.e., that for possession
of stolen goods, was dismissed.

The appeal by the Crown to this Court purports
to be based upon s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code, i.e., an
appeal from the judgment of a court of appeal setting aside a conviction, such
appeal being permitted “on any question of law on which a judge of the Court of
Appeal dissents”.

The Notice of Appeal served and filed by the
Crown specified that question in these words:

…upon the following question of law upon
which the Honourable Schroeder, J.A. dissented from the judgment of the
majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario:

Did the majority of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario err in law in holding
that the removal

[Page 11]

of the goods from the Canada Packers
Limited truck in no way aids in establishing the title of Canada Packers
Limited in the goods?

As the argument developed in this Court, it
seemed to cover a much broader field than the question as was stated and dealt
with an analysis of all the evidence adduced at trial not merely that as to the
removal of certain goods from a truck owned by Canada Packers Limited.

I have had the opportunity of perusing the
reasons given by my brother Ritchie and I shall adopt the very complete
statement of facts set out in those reasons making only additional reference to
the evidence required for the purpose of my consideration.

Both the majority of the Court of Appeal for
Ontario, for whom Aylesworth J.A. gave reasons for judgment, and Schroeder
J.A., dissenting, agreed that on the information as charged the Crown has the
burden of proving that the three cans of peanut cooking oil were the property
of Canada Packers Limited and all three judges agreed that that proof could be
made by the Crown either by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence
applying to the latter the well known rule in Hodge’s case[8], i.e., that to be probative such
circumstances must not only be consistent with the accused having committed the
act but the trier must also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be
inconsistent with any other conclusion than that the accused was the guilty
person. One must note that in applying that test to the present case, the trier
must be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other
rational conclusion than that these cans were the property of Canada Packers
Limited and not consistent with any other rational conclusion.

Both the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and Schroeder J.A., dissenting,
rec-

[Page 12]

ognized that in order to find other rational
conclusions such conclusions must not be merely speculative. Aylesworth J.A.
said:

(3) While bearing in mind the application
of the rule in Hodges case, it must also be borne in mind that
conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be rational
conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts and that no conclusion
can be a rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence, being in the
absence of evidence a speculative imaginative conclusion not a rational one. McIver’s
case, [1965] 1 O.R. 306; [1965] 2 O.R. 475; [1966] S.C.R. 254, and Regina
v. Torrie, [1967] 3 C.C.C. 303.

Therefore, I am of the opinion that the only
difference between the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario composed of
Aylesworth J.A. and Laskin J.A., as he then was, and the dissenting opinion of
Schroeder J.A., was whether or not the other possible conclusion, i.e., that
the cans of peanut cooking oil were not the property of Canada Packers Limited,
was a rational conclusion or merely a speculative one. Surely, that difference
is a difference upon a question of fact and a difference arrived at by
considering and weighing the evidence and not in any way a question of law. I
express this view despite the decisions of this court in Regina v. Lemire[9] and Wild v. The Queen[10].

As my brother Martland points out in his reasons
in Wild v. The Queen, it was held in Regina v. Lemire that if an
appellate court allows an appeal on grounds that certain specific evidence
creates a reasonable doubt as to guilt when on a proper view of the law that
evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his guilt then the decision
of the appellate court is in error on law and an appeal lies to this Court
under the provisions of s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.

In the Wild case, the majority of this
Court, of which I was not one, held that the Crown had

[Page 13]

a right, under the provisions of s. 584(1) of
the Criminal Code, to appeal to the appellate court from the acquittal
at trial, such appeal being limited to one which involves a question of law
alone because the trial judge, in considering the facts to which he referred in
finding any rational conclusion, did not distinguish between a conjectural
possibility arising from those facts and a rational conclusion arising from the
whole of the evidence. In the present case, Aylesworth J.A., giving the reasons
for the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, did consider all of the evidence and, in my view, did not base his
decision on any conjecture having, as I pointed out above, expressly ruled out
any conclusion based on such conjecture. It would seem, from reading the
reasons of Schroeder J.A. that he was of the opinion that the other conclusion
which the majority of the court found to be a rational one and which,
therefore, would cause the rule in Hodge’s case to operate so as to
prevent a conviction, was that the cans of peanut cooking oil had been
purchased by the accused from some other source such as at a distress sale and
the learned justice in appeal pointed out that the inference could only arise
from a question put by Crown counsel to the employee of Canada Packers Limited
and that there was no evidence at all of any such sale. Schroeder J.A.
characterizes such a conclusion as being only “by a resort to the most highly
imaginative and unrealistic speculation which has no basis in the evidence,
whether derived therefrom directly or indirectly”. I am of the opinion that this
was not the other conclusion which the majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario found was a rational one.
Aylesworth J.A., giving judgment for the majority, said:

As an equally rational conclusion from the
evidence in the case, these cans of peanut oil, with or without the connivance
of appellant, might have been stolen by Graham from any one of innumerable
concerns which had bought the oil from Canada Packers Limited; certainly
Graham, an individual identified by the police, played a prominent, indeed a
leading, part in the disposal of the cans of peanut oil to the Golden City
Restaurant; his presence and his conduct according to the only evidence ad-

[Page 14]

duced, are as consistent with theft from a
person or persons unknown or even theft by Graham alone, appellant being guilty
of illegal possession only, as they are with theft by appellant from Canada
Packers.

It should be noted that the Provincial Court
Judge dismissed the charge of illegal possession against this accused and there
was no appeal therefrom.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that
there was no dissent in the Court of Appeal for Ontario upon a question of law alone and that, therefore, no appeal lay to
this Court under the provisions of s. 598(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code.

However, lest I be in error in that view, it is
my intention to examine the other conclusion suggested in the judgment of the
majority of the Court of Appeal for Ontario and to express my view as to
whether that conclusion was a rational one or was based on mere conjecture and,
therefore, excluded by the authorities in Ontario cited by Aylesworth J.A.,
i.e., the McIver case[11],
confirmed in this Court[12], and Regina
v. Torrie[13] and by
the Lemire and Wild decisions in this Court.

As I have pointed out, that other conclusion
which Aylesworth J.A. termed “equally rational” was that the peanut oil might
have been stolen by Graham, the other rider in the Canada Packers truck and not
an employee of the company, from any one of the innumerable concerns which had
purchased the said peanut oil from time to time from the said Canada Packers
Limited and that such theft from another might have been either with or without
the connivance of the present appellant.

Employees of Canada Packers Limited gave
evidence for the Crown. Their evidence proved that the system utilized by that
company was that during the night prior to the day the driver, the appellant,
made the deliveries, the night staff loaded the truck which was to be operated
by

[Page 15]

this appellant and then locked the truck and
sealed it. In the morning, when the appellant came on duty he was given the
key, a complete set of invoices covering each shipment of goods which had been
loaded on the truck and another document called a Driver’s Loading Sheet. The
latter document listed all of the invoices covering all the goods on the truck
and indicated which of the shipments were to be delivered only on payment by
the customer. The evidence showed that there was only one shipment of peanut
cooking oil placed, on the previous night, in the truck to be driven by the
appellant and that shipment was two 45-pound cans which were to be delivered to
the Happy Palace Company at 108 Dundas Street West. The driver’s load sheet showed that the shipment which included
those two cans of peanut oil was delivered to the said Happy Palace Company and
was paid for by a cheque and such cheque was handed over by the appellant to
Canada Packers Limited. In my view, this evidence proves conclusively that when
the appellant took possession of his truck so loaded with the goods in the
locked compartment and the invoices covering the goods locked therein on the
morning of the offence, the three cans of peanut oil in the truck were not
there.

Now let us consider the possibility that on that
morning the appellant made a detour or side trip to some store room and there
obtained the three extra cans of peanut oil. These are no little containers
which could be stuffed into a jacket pocket or hidden in a coat, they are three
45-pound containers of peanut oil. Had the appellant stolen three such cans of
peanut oil from the storage that day such an action would have been most
visible and we can be sure that evidence would have been given on that topic at
the trial. Moreover, it is impossible to conceive of the three 45-pound drums
being already in the truck when the night staff started to load it. Such a
circumstance would defeat the whole procedure set up by Canada Packers to
control the deliveries and could not have failed to have been the subject of a
report to the officials supervising the loading of the trucks. No evidence
whatsoever was offered in reference to any unexplained shortage of stock and
yet Canada Packers Limited is one of the

[Page 16]

very largest packing houses in Canada and must have had an accurate
inventory control.

What I have been going on above is not evidence
but the lack of evidence. Under the circumstances, however, it is not
conjecture. As Aylesworth J.A. said, the evidence shows that Graham was the
person who actually drove the bargain with the alleged receiver in the premises
of the Golden City Restaurant and he was already known to the police. No
evidence was given and no evidence could be given as to the actions of the
appellant after he left the premises of the Canada Packers Limited and prior to
arriving at the premises of the Golden City Restaurant at 175 Dundas Street
West, Toronto, and therefore there is no evidence whatsoever as to when these
three cans of cooking oil were loaded onto the truck driven by the appellant.
It would appear that the back door of that truck had been opened at some time
after it left the premises of Canada Packers Limited because the detective who
observed Graham delivering these three cans of peanut oil to the Golden City
Restaurant described the appellant opening the back doors but made no reference
to his breaking any seal. Upon leaving the restaurant after having carried out
the deal described by my brother Ritchie in his reasons, the appellant drove
only a short distance along Dundas Street and then south on Chestnut Street, and there Graham left the truck while the appellant proceeded on
his way.

The evidence also showed that Canada Packers
Limited sold a considerable number of these large cans of peanut cooking oil to
restaurants and other large volume users.

Now those are the circumstances upon which
Aylesworth J.A. determined that another rational conclusion was that the three
cans of peanut oil were not, on the day they had been delivered to the premises
of the Golden City Restaurant, the property of Canada Packers Limited, although
it was quite conclusive that they had been produced by Canada Packers Limited
but might well have been sold by it to one of those whom Aylesworth J.A.
rightly describes as “innumerable concerns” which bought oil from Canada
Packers Limited

[Page 17]

and from one of such concerns stolen by Graham.
I must point out that even if the theft from such other unidentified firm had
been perpetrated by this appellant he could not have been convicted on the
offence as charged as the cans would not have been the property of Canada
Packers Limited: Reg. v. Scott[14].
(Alta. App. Div.).

With respect, I am in agreement with Aylesworth
J.A. that such a conclusion is not a conjectural one but is based on a careful
consideration of all of the evidence and is, therefore, a rational conclusion
but not consistent with the guilt of the accused charged with stealing the
property of Canada Packers Limited.

I should point out that Schroeder J.A., in his
dissenting reasons, relied on the doctrine of possession giving a prima
facie status of proprietorship to hold that it had been proved that the
three cans of peanut cooking oil were the property of Canada Packers. I am, of
course, in agreement that if it had been proved that these cans were in the
possession of Canada Packers Limited then it could be taken as established that
they were the property of that company for the purpose of founding a charge of
the theft of the property of that company. I am, however, of the opinion that
it has not been proved that the cans of peanut oil were in the possession of
Canada Packers Limited. It is true that they were being carried in the truck
owned by Canada Packers Limited and operated by the appellant in the course of
his duty as an employee of that company but on the evidence recited by my
brother Ritchie, to which I have referred, it has also been shown conclusively
that they were not delivered to that employee by Canada Packers Limited for the
purpose of his acting in reference thereto as an employee and that when he was
in possession of the cans of cooking oil he was not in possession as the agent
of Canada Packers Limited but against the interest of Canada Packers Limited.
In my opinion, the doctrine of possession cannot be applied here to prove
property in Canada

[Page 18]

Packers Limited any more than if the appellant
had borrowed or stolen a raincoat and his use for it having been temporary he
had thrown the raincoat into the locked compartment of the truck.

For both of the reasons which I have outlined I
would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Fire set to a
building—Admissibility and protective force of admissions of judicial
nature—Criminal Code, ss. 374, 375 and 376.

The appeal by the Crown of a judgment of the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace acquitting the respondents on charges of
having wilfully set fire to a building and of having conspired together for
this purpose was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. Hence the appeal to this Court.
The appellant contends (1) that the trial judge repudiated in his judgment of
acquittal the judgment given by him on the admissibility of the admissions made
by the respondents before the Fire Commissioner and (2) that the presumption
established by s. 376 of the Criminal Code should have applied in
this instance.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The question of the admissibility of
evidence, and the question whether, once admitted in the record, such evidence
has probative force, are two different matters, the first being a question of
law left for the judge to decide and the second being a question of fact for
the jury or the trier of facts, as the case may be. The statement complained of
relates to the probative force of those admissions, i.e. to a question
of fact which does not give this Court jurisdiction.

With regard to the presumption enacted by
s. 376 of the Criminal Code, it does not apply here since the
respondents held a fire insurance policy not relating to the building in
respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed but relating to
certain personal property located in this building.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of

[Page 748]

Queen’s Bench, Appeal Side, Province of
Quebec[1],
affirming a judgment of acquittal of the Court of the Sessions of the Peace.
Appeal dismissed.

F. Tremblay, for the plaintiff,
appellant.

René Letarte and Louise Simard, for the
defendants, respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—At the conclusion of their
separate trials in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace the two Drouin
brothers were acquitted on charges of having wilfully set fire to a building,
the property of Laurent Veilleux, and of having conspired together for this
purpose.

The Crown appealed in each case. In both cases,
the appeal was dismissed by a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal[2].

Hence the appeal to this Court.

It is appellant’s contention that the Court of
Appeal erred in law (i) when it failed to hold that the trial judge had
erroneously discarded the statements made by the Drouin brothers under oath at
the hearing held before the Fire Commissioner, and (ii) in holding that the
presumption established by s. 376 of the Criminal Code did not
apply in this instance.

Regarding the first ground of appeal, the trial
judge in the course of the hearing, without proceeding to hold a voir dire, and
over the defence’s objections, admitted in evidence the stenographic report of
the admissions made by the Drouin brothers under oath before the Fire Commissioner.
On the other hand, in the judgment of acquittal the judge stated:

[TRANSLATION] I must therefore disregard
all admissions made by the accused before the Fire Commissioner, because
they do not meet the requirements of a free, conscious and voluntary statement.

[Page 749]

According to the interpretation placed on it by
the Crown, this statement means that the judge repudiated the judgment given by
him on the admissibility of the admissions made before the Fire Commissioner,
and that in so disregarding these admissions, which are judicial in
nature, he applied criteria appropriate to the admissibility of confessions.
Accordingly, it is said, the trial judge apparently failed to observe the
principle invariably applied since the decision of the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council in The Queen v. Coote[3],
to the effect that statements made by a person under compulsion of law are
not, merely by virtue of such compulsion, inadmissible in a criminal proceeding
implicating that person. Cf. Walker v. The King[4]; Tass v. The King[5]; The King v. Mazerall[6]. The Court of Appeal correctly
refused to accept this interpretation. The question of the admissibility of
evidence, and the question whether, once admitted in the record, such evidence
has probative force, are two different matters; the first is a question of law
left for the judge to decide, and the second is a question of fact for the jury
or the trier of facts, as the case may be. In my view it cannot be contended
that the principle laid down in The Queen v. Coote (supra)—in
which, precisely, the validity of the admission of the statements made before
the Fire Commissioner was challenged—was misunderstood by the judge. The fact
that he admitted the statements over the defence’s objections, without
conducting a voir dire, is sufficient proof of this. Further, it is
clear that, placed in the context of the judgment, the statement complained of
relates not to the admissibility, but to the probative force of those
admissions, and this is not a question of law giving us jurisdiction, but a
pure question of fact. I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal as
unfounded.

With regard to the second ground of appeal,
s. 376 of the Criminal Code, which is in substantially the same
form at the present time as it was when the offence was committed, provides:

[Page 750]

376. Where a person is charged with an
offence under section 374 or 375, evidence that he is the holder of or is
named as the beneficiary under a policy of fire insurance relating to the
property in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed is,
in the absence of any evidence to the contrary and where intent to defraud is
material, proof of intent to defraud.

In the case at bar the respondents were charged
with an offence covered by s. 374(1)(a), namely, of having wilfully set
fire to a building, and not to personal property as described in
subsection (2) of that section. In dismissing the second ground of appeal,
therefore, it is sufficient to note that, although they held a fire insurance
policy relating to certain personal property located in the building, the
accused were neither holders nor beneficiaries under such a policy relating to
the building in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed.
The Court of Appeal therefore correctly found that the legal presumption
enacted by s. 376 of the Criminal Code does not apply here.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Criminal law—Conspiracy to
burglarize—Murder—Weapon jointly owned by the parties to this crime—Guilty
knowledge of the accused that his accomplice was armed—Dissent in the Court of
Appeal on a question of law or of fact—Absence or insufficiency of the evidence
supporting a conviction—Power of the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal from
conviction—Jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Canada on a question of
Law—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 21, 202, 592 and 598.

Respondent was charged and convicted of
murder in having unlawfully caused the death of B after having conspired with D
and L to burglarize the residence of G who operated a grocery store and brought
with her to her residence the money she had taken in during the day. The murder
was committed when D broke into B’s residence which he thought was G’s house,
armed with a weapon which he jointly owned with the respondent, while the
latter was waiting with L in a stolen car. The three accomplices were arrested.

The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction
and acquitted the respondent. The Crown entered an appeal de plano to
this Court based on the dissent in the Court of Appeal and subsequently
obtained leave to appeal on any question of law. It was the respondent’s
contention that this Court was without jurisdiction to review the judgment a
quo since there was no question of law on which a judge of the Court of
Appeal dissented.

Held (Martland,
Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the
conviction at trial restored.

Per Fauteux
C.J. and Abbott, Judson and Pigeon JJ.: The respondent’s case is governed by
the provisions of ss. 21 and 202 of the Criminal Code. It can be

[Page 860]

reasonably deduced from the proven facts,
which moreover were not disputed or explained by him or anyone else, that the
respondent knew or ought to have known, not only that D would have with him and
would use if needed the weapon owned jointly by them, while or at the time he
would be committing or attempting to commit the theft, or during or at the time
of his flight after committing or attempting to commit such theft, but also
that the respondent knew or ought to have known that if the need arose D would
cause bodily harm by whatever means he could in order to facilitate the
commission of the theft or his flight.

The views expressed by the judges of the
Court of Appeal on the question of the absence of the evidence, on which they
were devided, are in clear language. There is no necessity to interpret these
words, which must be given the ordinary meaning and purport conveyed by them.
The absence of evidence is a question of law. There is, therefore, a dissent
giving this Court jurisdiction under the provisions of s. 598(1)(a)
of the Criminal Code as well as s. 598(1)(b) since leave to
appeal on any question of law was granted by the Supreme Court of Canada to the
appellant. Furthermore there was a failure to consider whether the evidence
permitted the jurors to find that the respondent knew or ought to have known
that his accomplice would resort to violence and cause bodily harm in order to
facilitate the execution of their common purpose, and this failure impairs in
law the legal basis of the operative part of the judgment a quo.

Per Ritchie
J.: It appears that there is some evidence to implicate the respondent so as to
make him a party to the crime of murder within the meaning of ss. 21 and 202 of
the Criminal Code.

Per Hall and Spence
JJ., dissenting: The Court of Appeal did not consider that the appeal
fell to be determined upon the question of whether there was any evidence
to support the conviction but rather whether there was sufficient evidence
to support the conviction. The right of the Crown to appeal to this Court under
s. 598(1)(a) or under s. 598(1)(b) is upon a question
of law, and the sufficiency of the evidence upon which it is sought to
support the verdict is a question of fact or at the least a question of mixed
law and fact on which this Court is without jurisdiction.

Per Martland
J., dissenting: This Court cannot, by giving leave to appeal, acquire
jurisdiction to deal with the sufficiency of the evidence in a case in which
the Court of Appeal has itself reached the

[Page 861]

conclusion that the evidence was not
sufficient to support the conviction.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: The dissent on a question of law need not be a dissent on
which there was a difference of opinion between the dissenting judge or judges
and those in the majority. It is enough if the dissent is on a question of law
that goes to the merits of the case and consequently to the decision therein.
There is nothing in either set of dissenting reasons that raises a question of
law alone that would go to the correctness of the acquittal.

Counsel for the Crown alleges that the judges
of the Court of Appeal erred in law in the application of the cases in their
judgment. Only one issue, that of guilty knowledge, was the focus of all the
opinions in the Court of Appeal. What Montgomery J. said about knowledge or
attributed knowledge of murder does not raise any error of law which goes to
the validity of the acquittal. The adverse conclusion on this issue by the
judges in the majority made any consequential issue touched upon in their
reasons immaterial.

As to the error of law alleged about the
question relating to the change of intention on the part of the respondent and
his accomplice to break and enter a house that they found was then occupied
instead of one that was not, there is no basis for saying that the Court of
Appeal made any determination on this question adverse to the contention of the
Crown.

Finally the Crown contends that the judges of
the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that there was no evidence to go to
the jury. The Criminal Code empowered that Court to allow an appeal from
conviction when it was of opinion that “the verdict should be set aside on the
ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”. The
relevant inquiry here is whether the reasons of the Appellate Court disclose a
question of law upon which this Court may entertain the appeal thereto. The
fact that an appellate judge decides that there was no evidence from the mouth
of a particular witness on an issue in the case does not alone raise a question
of law. It is nowhere said that the Crown had failed to make out a case to go
to the jury. The members of the majority in the Court of Appeal dealt with the
same determining issue and with the evidence thereon as representing a
continuum. Where one of the grounds of decision of the Provincial

[Page 862]

Appellate Court is founded on the
insufficiency of the evidence, thus excluding any appellate jurisdiction in the
Court, the giving of another reason upon which jurisdiction could otherwise be
founded will not support its exercise.

Side, Province of Quebec, quashing a conviction of the respondent on a charge
of non-capital murder. Appeal allowed and conviction upon the verdict of the
jury restored, Martland, Hall, Spence and Laskin JJ. dissenting.

François Tremblay, for the plaintiff,
appellant.

Jacques Bouchard, for the defendant,
respondent.

The judgment of Fauteux C.J. and Abbott, Judson
and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—Respondent was charged and
convicted in a jury trial presided over by Mr. Justice Antoine Lacoursière
of having, on or about Nóvember 9, 1968, in the City and District of Quebec,
unlawfully caused the death of Albert Burran, thereby committing murder.

He appealed from this conviction. By a majority
judgment, the Court of Appeal, then composed of Tremblay C.J., and Casey,
Taschereau, Montgomery and Rivard JJ.A., allowed the appeal, quashed the
conviction and acquitted the accused.

From that decision appellant entered an appeal de
plano to this Court based on the dissenting opinion of Casey and Taschereau
JJ.A., and subsequently obtained leave to appeal on any question of law.

The underlying facts established by the evidence
introduced by the prosecution are as follows. On November 8, 1968, respondent
Jean Caouette, Denis Daigle and Diane Lessard all met in a room of a motel
situated in a suburb of Quebec City. The room had been taken by

[Page 863]

Caouette, who registered under a false name and
gave a fictitious registration number for the automobile used. Caouette had
known Daigle for several years and was also acquainted with Diane Lessard. At
the time in question the three were engaged in conspiring to burglarize the residence
of one Thérèse Grondin, who was known to Caouette and Diane Lessard. Caouette
and Diane Lessard both knew that when Thérèse Grondin left the grocery she
operated on rue d’Aiguillon at between 10:30 and 11:30 P.M., she brought with
her to the rue de Repentigny the money she had taken in during the day. On
Friday, November 8, Caouette and Daigle, intending to commit the proposed crime
that evening and using a stolen car for the purpose, followed Miss Grondin from
her place of business to her residence. However, the plan was not carried out
that evening because Daigle did not have sufficient information to penetrate
into the house. The next day, Saturday, November 9, at about 7:30 P.M., the
three accomplices, using a different car this time, headed for Miss Grondin’s
house to put their plan into execution. It had been agreed that Daigle would be
the one to break into the house. When they arrived at the house which they
thought was that of Miss Grondin, but in reality was the adjoining house
occupied by Albert Burran, Daigle got out of the car and rang at the front
door. According to his testimony, this is what happened:

[TRANSLATION] Q. Then, when you got there,
what did you do when you got there?

A. To make sure, we… I got out of the car,
then I rang to make sure there was no one in the house, inside.

Q. And then?

A. Then, a man spoke to me, answered
me, in the house.

Q. And?

A. So we couldn’t know if it was her
parents…

According to the evidence the man in question
was Burran. The testimony goes on:

[Page 864]

[TRANSLATION]…

Q. And while you were ringing at the door,
where was Jean Caouette?

A. In the front, at the door, in the
front, near the sidewalk.

(The italics are mine.)

To explain his visit to the house Daigle then
asked Burran for someone whose name he made up. When the latter told him there
was no person there by that name, he left and rejoined his companions. Caouette
and Daigle were thus able to see that the house was not empty. After driving
round the neighborhood in the car for about three-quarters of an hour, the
three conspirators came back to the same house. Daigle got out of the car and
entered by forcing a window on the upper floor. While this was going on the two
others acted as lookouts, driving around the block and preparing to pick up
their confederate at the proper moment. Having searched the upper floor of the
house and found no money, Daigle decided to go downstairs. At this point he
took out of his belt a sawed-off 22-calibre rifle, which was loaded, and went
down the stairs carrying the weapon. As he reached the lower landing a tile
creaked under his foot; he stopped for a moment, moved along a little adjoining
passage, and suddenly found himself face to face with the occupant,
Mr. Burran, who tried to defend himself. Daigle wounded him several times,
hit him several times on the head with his rifle butt, and Burran, who received
a 22-calibre bullet in his abdomen, died a few days later. Having managed to
get away, Daigle fled to rejoin Caouette. Daigle described the conversation he
had with the latter once he was in the car as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Q. And then, did you speak to
Caouette, was anything said between Caouette and yourself?

A. I think that, a bit later, I told him the
man had been wounded.

(The italics are mine.)

[Page 865]

The man referred to by Daigle was obviously
Burran, whom he and Caouette had just seen when he rang at the door.

Caouette, Daigle and Diane Lessard returned to
the motel. The following Monday, November 11, officers of the Quebec Provincial
Police went to the motel, where they arrested the three accomplices and found
among Caouette’s effects a box of 22-calibre bullets—the same calibre as the
weapon used in the crime, which Daigle had abandoned at the victim’s residence.
This weapon was jointly owned by Caouette and Daigle.

These are the underlying facts established by
the evidence. Caouette did not testify and called no witnesses in his defence.

In law:—

The following provisions of s. 202 apply
here:

202.
Culpable homocide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being
while committing or attempting to commit… robbery, burglary… whether or not the
person means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that
death is likely to be caused to any human being, if

(a) he means to cause bodily harm
for the purpose of

(i) facilitating the commission of the
offence, or

(ii) facilitating his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

…

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon
his person

(i) during or at the time he commits or
attempts to commit the offence, or

(ii) during or at the time of his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

It is not disputed that Daigle committed the
offence of murder. This is proved by his own testimony. He had a loaded,
sawed-off weapon on his person. He took it out and had it in his hand as he
went down the stairs. He inflicted bodily harm on Burran and used this weapon
to rid himself of the obstacle which the latter pre-

[Page 866]

sented to committing theft or to his flight. So,
according to his own testimony, he committed murder as defined in paragraph (a)
of s. 202, and also as defined in paragraph (d) of the said
section.

Caouette’s case is governed by the provisions of
s. 202 and of the second subsection of s. 21, which enacts that:

21. (1) …

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the
commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying
out the common purpose is a party to that offence.

(The italics are mine.)

In The Queen v. Trinneer[2] this Court ruled on the meaning of
s. 21(2) in the case of a murder charge based on s. 202. Speaking for
all members of this Court, Cartwright C.J. said, at pp. 644 and 645:

If the respondent ought to have known that
it was probable that bodily harm would be inflicted on the deceased to
facilitate the carrying out of the robbery, then it was unnecessary for the
Crown to establish that he ought to have foreseen that her death was likely to
result. The offence contemplated by s. 21(2) (that is murder as defined in
s. 202(a) and/or (d)) was committed when Frank inflicted the
bodily harm on the deceased for the purpose of facilitating the robbery or
flight. Its character was determined when her death ensued.

In the case at bar the jury, therefore, had to
decide whether they could reasonably deduce from the proven facts, which
moreover were not disputed or explained by him or anyone else, that Caouette
knew or ought to have known, not only that Daigle would have with him and would
use if needed the weapon owned jointly by them, while or at the time he would
be committing or attempting to commit the theft, or during or at the time of
his flight after committing or attempting to commit such theft,

[Page 867]

but also that Caouette knew or ought to have
known that if the need arose Daigle would cause bodily harm by whatever means
he could in order to facilitate the commission of this theft or his flight.

It surely is realistic for a jury to invest the
association of Daigle and Caouette with the incriminating quality which is
implied by their joint ownership of this sawed-off weapon in the circumstances,
and to conclude that it was not without the knowledge of his accomplice but
with the latter’s consent that Daigle had carried on his person for the execution
of their common purpose the said weapon, loaded with bullets of the same
calibre as those found among Caouette’s personal effects, and that the latter
in any case knew or ought to have known that if the need arose Daigle would
resort to violence to facilitate his flight.

So I would say, with all respect for the
contrary opinion, that an affirmative reply to the above questions is not only
reasonable but necessary, and that the verdict reached by the jury is fully
justified.

Further, in my opinion the contention by
respondent that there is no question of law on which a judge of the Court of
Appeal dissents, and that this Court is accordingly without jurisdiction to
review the judgment a quo, cannot be entertained.

I would observe, first, that the question on
which the judges of the Court of Appeal were divided was the absence, not the
sufficiency, of the evidence concerning whether Caouette knew that Daigle was
armed. The judges of the majority clearly stated that there was no evidence to
indicate such knowledge, while the minority judges expressed the contrary view,
and would have dismissed the appeal and affirmed the jury verdict. This can be
seen from the following passages in the reasons of Mr. Justice
Rivard—concurred in by Chief Justice Tremblay—and from the reasons of
Mr. Justice Montgomery, who stated his own views. Referring to Daigle’s
testimony, Mr. Justice Rivard said:

[Page 868]

[TRANSLATION] I have read his testimony
several times, and the learned defence counsel is correct in stating that
nothing in his replies can lead to the conclusion that Caouette knew Daigle was
armed.

…

But nothing in the evidence indicates that
Caouette knew that Daigle had loaded the weapon in question, or had brought
bullets with him.

Mr. Justice Montgomery, after saying at the
beginning of his reasons that “I agree with my colleague Mr. Justice
Rivard that we should maintain this appeal”—referring by this to the
conclusion, and not the reasons, put forward by his colleague—concludes by
saying:

In my opinion, there was no evidence of
knowledge to go before the jury. I therefore agree that we should maintain
the appeal and acquit Appellant.

(The italics are mine.)

These views expressed by Mr. Justice
Rivard, and certainly those expressed by Mr. Justice Montgomery, are in
clear language. There is no necessity to interpret these words, which must be
given the ordinary meaning and purport conveyed by them. It is not necessary to
cite authorities in order to reiterate that the absence of evidence is a
question of law. There is, therefore, a dissent giving this Court jurisdiction
under the provisions of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code:

598. (1)
Where a judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an
appeal taken under section 583 or 583A or dismisses an appeal taken
pursuant to paragraph (a) of subsection (1) or subsection (3)
of section 584, the Attorney General may appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

To the foregoing it must be added that this
Court also has jurisdiction by virtue of the following provisions of
s. 598(1)(b) of the Criminal Code:

(b) on any question of law, if leave
to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada…

[Page 869]

As already indicated, appellant was granted
leave to appeal on any question of law. The evidence in the record required
that the Court of Appeal consider the application of the provisions of
para. (a) of s. 202, which describe another mode whereby the
offence in question may be committed, as well as the application of the
provisions of para. (d) of the same section. Accordingly, even if
the opinion of the Court was that there was an absence or insufficiency of
evidence as to whether Caouette knew that Daigle was armed, it could not set
aside the jury verdict and acquit the respondent before considering whether the
evidence permitted the jurors to find—as their verdict implied—that Caouette
knew or ought to have known that his accomplice would resort to violence if the
need arose and cause bodily harm, by whatever means he could, in order to
facilitate the execution of their common purpose, or at least to facilitate his
flight after committing or attempting to commit this robbery. There was a
failure to consider such a question, and this failure impairs in law the legal
basis of the operative part of the judgment a quo.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and
set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and, concluding that the grounds
raised by respondent in the Court of Appeal, which were virtually not pleaded
by him in this Court, are unfounded, in accord with Casey and Taschereau JJ.A.,
I would restore the verdict of the jury, just as our authority to do so was
especially recognized in Her Majesty the Queen v. McKay[3]; Her Majesty the Queen v. Borg[4].

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—I am in
agreement with the reasons of my brother Spence, and wish only to add the
following additional comments.

In order that the respondent should be convicted
of non-capital murder by virtue of the provisions of s. 21(2) of the Criminal
Code it was necessary for the Crown to establish,

[Page 870]

beyond reasonable doubt, that the respondent
knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence of murder would
be a probable consequence of Daigle’s carrying out the common purpose of
burglary. The offence of murder was committed by Daigle by reason of the
application, to the facts of this case, of s. 202 (now s. 213) (a)
and (d) of the Criminal Code, which provides:

213.
Culpable homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being
while committing or attempting to commit treason or an offence mentioned in
section 52, piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody,
resisting lawful arrest, rape, indecent assault, forcible abduction, robbery,
burglary or arson, whether or not the person means to cause death to any human
being and whether or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any
human being, if

(a) he means to cause bodily harm
for the purpose of

(i) facilitating the commission of the
offence, or

(ii) facilitating his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

…

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon
his person

(i) during or at the time he commits or
attempts to commit the offence, or

(ii) during or at the time of his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

On the facts of this case the bodily harm, which
caused death, resulted from the use, by Daigle, of the weapon which he had upon
his person. In determining the criminal responsibility of the respondent under
s. 21(1) of the Criminal Code, the learned trial judge was of the
view that the vital issue was as to whether he knew, or should have known, that
Daigle was armed with the weapon when he entered the house so as to commit the
offence of burglary. In his address to the jury he said:

[TRANSLATION] And to that end, of course,
there is one question to ask yourselves, the very important question, which is,
from my point of view, the most

[Page 871]

important question in order to be able to
render your verdict: did Caouette know, or ought he to have known, that Daigle
had a weapon when he entered the house? Because it is evident that if he had
not known that Daigle had a weapon, we cannot say that he ought to have found
it probable that the death of a person could ensue.

Again, after dealing with the matter of direct
and circumstantial evidence, he said:

[TRANSLATION] Is it reasonable to believe
that he did not know that Daigle was armed when he entered the Burran house?
That is the question, and you must be able to answer it, in order to find the
accused guilty, be able to answer it, beyond any reasonable doubt. This leads
me to speak to you about reasonable doubt.

In the light of this charge it is clear that, in
finding the respondent guilty of non-capital murder, the jury felt satisfied,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the respondent knew, or should have known, that
Daigle was armed when he broke into the house.

The Court of Appeal had the power, under
s. 592 (now s. 613), on the respondent’s appeal from his conviction,
to allow the appeal if it was of the opinion that the verdict should be set
aside on the ground that it could not be supported by the evidence. The Court
addressed itself to the issue which had been put to the jury and considered
whether a finding that the respondent knew, or should have known, that Daigle
was armed when he entered the house could be supported by the evidence. The
majority held that it could not be supported.

Rivard J.A. considered the direct evidence of
Daigle and of the police, and said:

[TRANSLATION] I have read and reread his
testimony, and the learned defence counsel is correct in stating that nothing
in the answers which he has given can permit the conclusion that Caouette knew
Daigle was armed.

…

It is true to say that the police officers’
testimony stated that they found one or two boxes of bullets in motel No. 15,
among Caouette’s effects (J.R. p. 129). But nothing in the evidence
indicates that Caouette

[Page 872]

knew that Daigle had loaded the weapon in
question, or had brought the bullets with him.

He then went on to deal with the circumstantial
evidence, and said this:

[TRANSLATION] In order to establish the essential
element in Caouette’s guilt we have, in all, only circumstantial evidence
which, in accordance with the well-known rules, can only result in a verdict of
guilty if no other conclusion than that of appellant’s guilt is possible.

I do not think that the Crown’s evidence
meets these requirements. In order to find a person guilty of a crime committed
by another, it is essential that all conditions prescribed by law be met.

His conclusion is as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The association of Daigle,
Diane Lessard and Caouette establishes beyond any doubt their intent to commit
the crime of breaking and entering with intent to commit theft. Their behavior
before the crime and in the days that followed can be explained without the
necessity of finding that Caouette knew, or ought to have known, that in
breaking into Miss Grondin’s residence in her absence it was probable that
violence would be used and someone killed or wounded.

For this reason I would allow the appeal
and acquit the appellant.

Montgomery J.A. reached a like conclusion and
said this:

To find Appellant guilty of murder, the
Crown had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew or ought to have
known that the commission of the offense of murder would be a probable
consequence of carrying out the common purpose of breaking and entering
(subsec. (2) of sec. 21. Crim. Code). I see no reason to
suppose that he ought to have known this to be a probable consequence unless he
knew that Daigle was armed. Of this, there is no direct evidence. The Crown had
in Daigle a witness who appears to have been frank and cooperative, yet no
questions were put to him to establish knowledge on Appellant’s part that
Daigle was carrying a firearm. All that we have is Daigle’s testimony that the
weapon was their joint property and evidence that the bullets, which Daigle had
procured, were found two days later among Appellant’s effects in the motel room
occupied by both of them. These circumstances

[Page 873]

may give rise to suspicion, but I do not
find that they amount to proof.

In my opinion, there was no evidence of
knowledge to go before the jury. I therefore agree that we should maintain the
appeal and acquit Appellant.

Chief Justice Tremblay agreed with Rivard J.A.
Casey J.A. and Taschereau J.A. dealt with exactly the same issue and reached
the opposite conclusion; i.e., that there was sufficient evidence to find that
the respondent knew, or should have known, that Daigle was armed when he
entered the house.

In these circumstances it is my opinion that the
Court of Appeal has reached a decision which is not subject to appeal to this
Court. Admittedly, Montgomery J.A. made the statement that “there was no
evidence of knowledge to go before the jury”, but, in my opinion, a decision by
a judge of the Court of Appeal, on an appeal by the accused from a conviction,
that there is no evidence to go to the jury must, of necessity, mean also that
he has concluded that the verdict of the jury cannot be supported by the
evidence. It is true that a finding of no evidence is a finding on a question
of law, which might be a basis for an appeal, but a finding as to sufficiency
of evidence is a finding of fact, or of mixed law and fact, which cannot be
appealed to this Court.

The case of The Queen v. Warner[5], decided that a finding as to insufficiency
of evidence by a Court of Appeal, on an appeal from conviction, is a finding of
fact, or of mixed law and fact, and is not subject to appeal to this Court. It
was also decided that, where such a finding had been made, it was of no consequence
that other

[Page 874]

grounds on which the Court of Appeal has
proceeded did raise questions of law.

If it is to be held that, because one of the
judges forming the majority stated that there was no evidence to go before the
jury, a question of law is raised which may be brought before this Court, the
situation which results is anomalous. The question of law is: “Was there
evidence to go to the jury?” The answer to this issue is that either there was
evidence, or there was not. If the former conclusion is reached, it is then
necessary, before restoring the conviction, to find that there was sufficient
evidence to support it. But the question of sufficiency of evidence is, by
virtue of s. 613 of the Code, a matter for the determination of the
Court of Appeal.

That was the very issue which was considered by
the Court of Appeal in this case. The two dissenting judges disagreed with the
majority on that specific issue. For that reason, this case differs from The
Queen v. McKay[6]. In
that case the Crown had an appeal as of right, because the dissenting judge in
the Court of Appeal had dissented on a question of law from the majority, which
had held that there was no evidence implicating the accused to go to the jury.
It was held, in this Court, that the dissenting judge was right, and that this
Court, being seized of the appeal, could direct the remedy which the Court of
Appeal should have granted; namely, to restore the conviction.

In the present case, in my opinion, there was no
appeal as of right, because there was no dissent on a question of law. Leave to
appeal was given, but, in my view, this Court cannot, by giving leave to
appeal, acquire jurisdiction to deal with the sufficiency of the evidence in a
case in which the Court of Appeal has itself reached the conclusion that the
evidence was not sufficient to support the conviction. That

[Page 875]

was the situation in the Warner case.
Leave to appeal had been given, but this Court later held, on hearing the
appeal, that the finding of the Appellate Division that the evidence was not
sufficient to support the conviction was not subject to any appeal to this
Court, and the appeal was dismissed.

In my opinion, following the Warner case,
the Court of Appeal having reached a conclusion on a question of fact, or of mixed
law and fact, there is no appeal to this Court, unless it could be shown that,
in reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeal had done so because of an error
as to the law. In the present case, in my opinion, Montgomery J.A. correctly
defined what, in law, had to be established to find the respondent guilty of
non‑capital murder in the light of the decision of this Court in The
Queen v. Trinneer[7]. Rivard
J.A. expressly referred to that case and, in my opinion, correctly stated its
application.

I would dismiss the appeal.

RITCHIE J.—Accepting as I do the interpretation
which the Chief Justice of this Court has placed upon the language used by
Mr. Justice Rivard in the Court of Appeal with which Chief Justice
Tremblay concurred, and having regard to the opinion expressed by Montgomery
J.A., I feel bound to conclude that the majority of the Court of Appeal allowed
the appeal of the respondent on the ground that there was no evidence to so
implicate Caouette as to make him a party to the crime of murder within the
meaning of ss. 21 and 202 of the Criminal Code as those
sections have been interpreted in this Court in The Queen v. Trinneer[8].

As it appears to me that there is at least some
such evidence, I would dispose of the matter in the manner proposed by the
Chief Justice.

[Page 876]

The judgment of Hall and Spence JJ. was
delivered by

SPENCE J. (dissenting)—This is an appeal
by the Crown from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Quebec pronounced on
January 14, 1971, in which that Court by a majority judgment allowed an appeal
by the respondent from his conviction in the Court of Queen’s Bench on May 26,
1969, upon a charge of non-capital murder. The respondent had filed an appeal
to that Court as of right and had in the same document applied for leave to
appeal upon questions of fact. Paragraph 8 of that document which, as I have
said, was both a notice of appeal and application for leave to appeal, read as
follows:

[TRANSLATION]—The proof of prosecution is
insufficient to justify the verdict of guilty and the gaps which are present
therein are such that the said judgment is unreasonable in fact as in law.

The Crown alleged that the respondent had
conspired with one Denis Daigle and Diane Lessard to break into the home of a
Miss Thérèse Grondin and steal therefrom the receipts from a grocery store
business which they believed she had brought to her home the previous evening.
The respondent drove Daigle to the residence in which the conspirators resided
and Daigle broke into that residence through a second storey window, searched
for the money and, not finding it, started to descend a stairway. There Daigle
met Colonel Burran, into whose home he had broken in error, a tussle ensued and
Daigle withdrew a sawed-off 22 rifle from his belt and shot Colonel Burran
inflicting wounds from which the latter died. Therefore it became vital in
applying s. 202 and s. 21(2) to determine whether the respondent knew
or ought to have known that the commission of the offence of non-capital murder
would be a probable consequence of the carrying out of the burglary. This the
Court of Appeal for Quebec found hinged on whether the respondent knew that
Daigle was armed when the latter broke into this home. Mr. Justice Casey
and Mr. Justice Taschereau gave reasons to dismiss the appeal of the now

[Page 877]

respondent Caouette. Mr. Justice Rivard,
with whom the Chief Justice concurred, gave reasons for allowing the appeal.
Mr. Justice Montgomery concurred in this latter view and added further
reasons to allow the appeal.

Although the dissent upon a question of law,
upon which the Crown’s right to appeal to this Court without leave rests, under
the provisions of s. 598(1)(a), now R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 621(1)(a), of the Criminal Code, must be found in the
dissenting reasons of either Casey or Taschereau JJ. A. I turn first to
consider the reasons given on behalf of the majority as the Crown obtained
leave to appeal to this Court “de bene esse”.

Rivard J.A. in his reasons said:

[TRANSLATION] The first ground of appeal
relied on by appellant against this verdict is that the evidence submitted by
the Crown cannot reasonably justify or support the verdict of guilty pronounced
against appellant.

And thereafter in his reasons he said:

[TRANSLATION] Appellant submits that there
is no evidence on record from which it could reasonably be deduced that, in
carrying out the unlawful purpose of their mutual assistance for breaking into
and stealing, Caouette knew or ought to have known that the result of carrying
out the common intent, i.e. breaking and entering with theft, in Miss Grondin’s
uninhabited house, would be the use of violence against some person.

The evidence as to the commission of the
offence is based almost exclusively on the testimony of Denis Daigle,
Caouette’s accomplice for committing the offence of breaking and entering with
theft. He claims that the weapon used was owned by Caouette and himself; but
nowhere does he say that Caouette knew that he was carrying this weapon when
the crime was committed, or when it was being planned.

I have read his testimony several times,
and the learned defence counsel is correct in stating that nothing in his
replies can lead to the conclusion that Caouette knew Daigle was armed.

The weapon, which was discovered broken in
the Burran residence, is not very large. In fact, Daigle carried it in his belt
to shoot Burran.

[Page 878]

It is true to say that the police officers’
testimony stated that they found one or two boxes of bullets in motel No. 15,
among Caouette’s effects (J.R. p. 129). But nothing in the evidence
indicates that Caouette knew that Daigle had loaded the weapon in question, or
had brought bullets with him.

In order to establish the essential element
in Caouette’s guilt we have, in short, only circumstantial evidence which, in
accordance with well-known rules, can only result in a verdict of guilty if no
other conclusion than that of appellant’s guilt is possible.

I do not think the Crown’s evidence meets
these requirements. In finding a person guilty of a crime committed by another,
it is essential that all conditions prescribed by law be met.

He concluded:

[TRANSLATION] The association of Daigle,
Diane Lessard and Caouette establishes beyond any doubt their intent to commit
the crime of breaking and entering with theft. Their behaviour before the crime
and in the days that followed can be explained without the necessity of finding
that Caouette knew, or ought to have known, that by breaking into Miss
Grondin’s residence in her absence it was probable that violence would be used
and someone killed or wounded.

For this reason I would allow the appeal
and acquit the appellant.

In none of these excerpts does Rivard J. advance
the proposition that there was no evidence to support the conviction. On the
other hand, in all of them the learned justice of appeal is discussing the
sufficiency of the evidence.

Montgomery J.A. in his brief concurring reasons
refers to evidence which had been advanced as indicating that the respondent
knew Daigle was armed and concludes:

These circumstances may give rise to
suspicion, but I do not find that they amount to proof.

Despite Montgomery J.A.’s concluding words,

In my opinion, there was no evidence
of knowledge to go before the jury.

[Page 879]

(The emphasis is my own.)

I am of the opinion that in those reasons he, as
did Rivard J., engaged in the task of determining whether the evidence was
sufficient to support the verdict.

Casey J.A., again in brief reasons, also
referred to the facts advanced by the Crown to support the submission that the
respondent knew Daigle was armed and accepted them as having such probative
force. In my view, this is plainly a weighing of the sufficiency of the
evidence. Taschereau J.A. followed a course almost exactly the same as that
followed by Casey J.

I, therefore, have come to the conclusion that
all five of the learned justices of appeal did not consider that the appeal
fell to be determined upon the question of whether there was any evidence
to support the conviction but rather whether was sufficient evidence to
support the conviction, a course which lay open to them under the provisions of
s. 592(1)(a)(i), (now R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 613(1)(a)(i))
of the Criminal Code.

As I have pointed out, the right of the Crown to
appeal to this Court under s. 598(1)(a) without leave upon a
dissent or under s.598(1)(b) with leave is upon a question of law. The
presence or absence of any evidence upon which a verdict may be supported is
such a question of law. The sufficiency of the evidence upon which it is sought
to support a verdict is not a question of law but one of fact or at the best a
question of mixed law and fact. In The Queen v. Warner[9], this Court considered a case where the
Chief Justice of the Court appealed from had said:

I am strongly of the opinion that the
verdict of murder cannot be supported by the evidence. But I feel I must go
further and set out other reasons for setting aside the verdict.

Kerwin C.J. said at p. 147:

[Page 880]

I read the first sentence as meaning that
the Chief Justice considered that the evidence was not sufficient to support a
conviction,—which is a question of fact…

While it was announced that we had
jurisdiction, further consideration has persuaded the majority of the Court
that such is not the case.

Cartwright J., as he then was, sait at pp.
149-150:

So far as the judgment of the Appellate
Division is based on the first ground mentioned, this Court is powerless to
interfere with it. The question whether the Appellate Division was right in
proceeding on this ground is not a question of law in the strict sense. It is a
question of fact or, at the best from the point of view of the appellant, a
mixed question of fact and law.

…

On reading the reasons as a whole, I am
satisfied that the Appellate Division was exercising its jurisdiction under
s. 592(1)(a)(i) and was setting the verdict aside on the ground
that, in its opinion, it could not be supported by the evidence.

Taschereau and Abbott JJ. agreed with both
Kerwin C.J. and Cartwright J. Ritchie J., in giving concurring reasons, said at
p. 162-3:

If the Appellate Division erred in finding
that such a doubt existed, then this was an error of fact from which other
errors necessarily flowed, including the finding that s. 202 was the only
one under which the jury could have found the accused guilty of murder. The
latter conclusion follows directly from the former, and, accordingly, in my
view the error, if error it was, raises a mixed question of fact and law, and
as such is not a competent ground of appeal to this Court (see The King v.
Décary, [1942] S.C.R. 80 at 83, 2 D.L.R. 401.)

Therefore, I am of the opinion that in this
appeal, as in The King v. Warner, the Crown seeks to appeal on a ground
of fact or mixed law and fact.

I, therefore, would dismiss the appeal on
the ground that this Court is without jurisdiction to consider it.

[Page 881]

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—The threshold
question in this appeal by the Crown against the acquittal of the accused by
the Quebec Court of Appeal of non-capital murder is the jurisdiction of this
Court to entertain the appeal. The Quebec Court of Appeal, by a bare majority,
set aside the conviction entered upon the verdict of a jury.

The Crown has asserted an appeal as of right
under s.621(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, taking the position that
the dissenting opinions of Casey and Taschereau JJ.A. raise questions of law
within the meaning of that provision. Leave to appeal was also obtained under
s.621(1)(b) “de bene esse on any question of law”. This leave,
given so far as it may be required, must, in my understanding, be taken to
relate to any question of law that goes to the validity of the verdict of
acquittal; it cannot be construed to refer to a question of law whose correct
resolution would not affect the result reached by the majority of the Quebec
Court of Appeal. The unlimited character of the leave makes it necessary to
determine what were the grounds upon which the Quebec Court of Appeal set aside
the conviction herein and to consider the grounds urged in this Court against
the acquittal; in this latter respect there is no restriction to the grounds
upon which the Quebec Court of Appeal proceeded.

I deal first with the Crown’s assertion of an
appeal as of right. I am prepared on this point to take the view of s.621(1)(a),
expressed by Cartwright J., as he then was, in Rozon v. The King[10], that the dissent on a question of law
need not be a dissent on which there was a difference of opinion between the
dissenting judge or judges and those in the majority: see

[Page 882]

also Brown v. The Queen[11]. Taking this view, here in favour of the
Crown, it is enough if the dissent is on a question of law that goes to the
merits of the case and consequently to the decision therein. I am well aware of
the line of cases in this Court, of which Pearson v. The Queen[12], illustrative, that support the position
that the appeal as of right depends upon the dissent being upon a question of
law which has been differently determined by the majority in the provincial
appellate Court. They do not call for re-examination here because, on the more
generous construction of s. 621(1)(a) which I would take, the
dissents of Casey and Taschereau JJ.A. do not raise any determining question of
law.

The appeal by the accused to the Quebec Court of
Appeal was taken both as of right on questions of law and by leave on questions
of mixed law and fact and on questions of fact alone. The issue that chiefly
concerned all five members of that Court was whether there was evidence to
support the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew that his
confederate Daigle was armed when the latter broke into the deceased’s home
while the accused remained outside. Casey J.A. concluded (in his words) that
“the known facts were compatible only with the conclusion that the appellant
had guilty knowledge, that is, that he knew that Daigle was armed and that what
happened would be a probable consequence of what they proposed to do”. This, to
me, is simply a conclusion on the sufficiency of the evidence to meet the
burden of proof resting upon the Crown, and suggesting in this connection
reliance upon the circumstantial evidence formula of Hodge’s case. (I
may say, parenthetically, that this intimation of reliance on Hodge’s case
does not engage the propositions of this

[Page 883]

Court in Wild v. The Queen[13], which were addressed to oral reasons of a
trial judge sitting without a jury.) It is a determination on the effect of the
facts adduced in evidence or, at the most, one of mixed law and fact, which it
was open to the Quebec Court of Appeal to make. A determination on these
grounds is not, however, open to this Court.

Taschereau J.A. in his longer dissent, dwelling
at greater length on the evidence, expressed his concurrence with Casey J.A. on
the question whether the accused knew that Daigle was armed when he broke and entered
the victim’s house. As clearly, if not more so than his colleague in dissent,
Taschereau J.A. proceeded upon the sufficiency of the evidence. Since all the
evidence which the two dissenting judges considered was before the jury, their
dissents merely affirmed the jury’s appreciation thereof on the issue of guilty
knowledge. Even on the hypothesis that the majority were wrong in setting aside
the conviction, there is nothing in either set of dissenting reasons that
raises a question of law alone that would go to the correctness of the
acquittal.

This evaluation is amply supported by a
consideration of the reasons of Rivard J.A. in whose opinion, as a member of
the majority, Tremblay C.J.Q. concurred. What Rivard J.A. said, after a lengthy
review of the evidence, was that on the key issue of guilty knowledge it did
not go far enough to establish that the only reasonable conclusion therefrom
was that the accused knew that Daigle was armed. Like his dissenting
colleagues, Rivard J.A. did not find it necessary to consider any other grounds
of appeal.

[Page 884]

In view of my conclusion that there was no
dissent on a question of law alone, it remains to consider whether any relevant
questions of law arise in the case under the grant of leave to appeal. It is in
this connection that the reasons of Montgomery J.A., as a member of the
majority favouring acquittal, become material. He also limited his reasons to
the crucial issue of guilty knowledge that Daigle was armed, and ended his
brief reference to the evidence with the following two sentences:

These circumstances may give rise to
suspicion, but I do not find that they amount to proof.

In my opinion, there was no evidence of
knowledge to go before the jury.

These sentences are capable of being understood
to say that Montgomery J.A. was satisfied not only that the evidence of
knowledge was deficient to establish it, but that there was none upon which it
could be established. Accepting that a conclusion of no evidence raises a
question of law, an error in that conclusion becomes immaterial if the judgment
of Montgomery J.A. also supports the position of his colleagues of the majority
that the evidence was insufficient to establish the fact to which it was
addressed.

A clearer illustration of this result would be
afforded if the “no evidence” position was taken in a case where there was a
clear majority that proceeded upon the basis that there was evidence of the
fact in issue but that it fell short of satisfying the burden of proof upon the
Crown. To find, in such circumstances, that a judge was wrong in deciding that
there was no evidence would be of no consequence when there was a majority
finding on insufficiency of the evidence.

If the proper view of Montgomery J.A.’s reasons
be that they admit of no other construction than that there was no evidence of
guilty knowledge to go to the jury, that would raise a question of law alone;
and if he is wrong in his

[Page 885]

assessment this becomes critical to the whole
case in view of the equal division of the other four members of the Quebec
Court of Appeal on whether the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction.

Counsel for the Crown in his submissions to this
Court founded himself in part on such a reading of the reasons of Montgomery
J.A. He alleged three errors of law as follows:

[TRANSLATION] 1. Did Tremblay, Montgomery
and Rivard JJ.A. err in law in the interpretation and application of the
provisions of sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (a) of section 592 of
the Criminal Code of Canada, in deciding as they did to assume the functions of
the jury by considering facts which constituted the circumstantial evidence for
the Crown? They held in consequence that the jury had returned a verdict which
was “unreasonable and not supported by the evidence”.

2. Did Tremblay, Montgomery and Rivard
JJ.A., in assuming the functions of the jury and interpreting the evidence as
they did, err in law in the legal interpretation of sections 202 and 21(2)
of the Criminal Code of Canada?

(a) By erroneously interpreting
joint possession under section 3, subsection 4(b);

(b) By failing to interpret the
change of intent by the accused Caouette, as indicated by the evidence, at the
time when his accomplice Denis Daigle rang at the door to ascertain whether
there was anyone in the victim’s house.

3. Did Tremblay, Montgomery and Rivard
JJ.A. err in law in the application of the cases cited in their judgment?

I propose to deal with these matters in reverse
order.

The third alleged error of law needs little
comment. It is a contention of misapplying the authorities cited in the
majority opinions. The only citations were in the reasons of Rivard J.A.; and
the two cases he cited, namely, Regina v. Simmons and Lotharp[14], from which a passage on p. 130 was
quoted, and The Queen v. 

[Page 886]

Trinneer[15], were used to
support his conclusion, previously reached, that before a person may be found
guilty of a crime actually committed by another, all the elements of culpable
complicity must be established by evidence reaching the required standard of
proof. The cases were not cited in connection with any consideration of the
elements of constructive murder. As already noted, only one issue, that of
guilty knowledge, was the focus of all the opinions in the Quebec Court of
Appeal. I cannot find in this third contention any error of law within
s.621(1)(b).

Crown counsel expanded his attack on the alleged
misapplication of cited cases by drawing attention to an alleged error of law
in the following passage of the reasons of Montgomery J.A., as being a
departure from the rule of law laid down by this Court in The Queen v.
Trinneer, supra (which Montgomery J.A. did not cite):

To find appellant guilty of murder, the
Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew or ought to have
known that the commission of the offence of murder would be a probable
consequence of carrying out the common purpose of breaking and entering… I see
no reason to suppose that he ought to have known this to be a probable
consequence unless he knew that Daigle was armed.

What Montgomery J.A. said about knowledge or
attributed knowledge of murder as a probable consequence of the breaking and
entering does not raise any error of law which goes to the validity of the
acquittal. The point at issue in the reasons of the Quebec Court of Appeal was
whether the accused knew that Daigle was armed. It is only after this issue was
properly determined that the further question mentioned

[Page 887]

by Montgomery J.A. would become material. Since,
in the view of all judges in the Quebec Court of Appeal the central question
was guilty knowledge that Daigle was armed, the adverse conclusion on this
issue by the majority made any consequential issue touched upon in their
reasons immaterial.

The second alleged error of law is in part a
return to the question of evidence or no evidence that the accused knew that
Daigle was armed and in part a submission of a change of intention on the part
of the accused and Daigle to break and enter a house that they found was then
occupied instead of one that was not. In this latter respect, the contention
appeared to be that the infliction of bodily harm would probably result and
hence the accused, as a confederate of Daigle, would be guilty of murder under
the principle laid down in The Queen v. Trinneer. For reasons already
given, this latter point does not go to the validity of the acquittal. There
is, indeed, no basis for saying that the Quebec Court of Appeal made any
determination on the question of change of intention adverse to the contention
of the Crown.

The question of evidence or no evidence is
raised again in the first error of law alleged by the Crown and I shall
consider it in what follows in these reasons.

The first question of law raised by the Crown is
based on the contention that the majority judges erred in law in their
interpretation and application of what is now s.613(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal
Code in substituting their opinion for that of the jury in the appreciation
of the facts founded upon the circumstantial evidence adduced by the Crown. The
specified enactment empowered the Quebec Court of Appeal to allow an appeal
from conviction where it was of opinion that “the verdict should be set aside
on

[Page 888]

the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence”. What emerged from the submissions on this question,
in reiteration of what was said thereon in the Crown’s factum, was that the
majority judges erred in law in holding that there was no evidence to go to the
jury.

I do not regard an attack upon a provincial
appellate Court’s resort to s.613(1)(a)(i) as necessarily raising a
question of law for the purposes of an appeal to this Court. Section 613(1),
specifying when an appellate Court may allow an appeal from conviction, must be
read against the provisions of s. 603(1) which set out the conditions
governing an accused’s right of appeal. Where, as here, the appeal to the
provincial appellate Court has been at large (by reason of the grant of leave),
it must be a rare case where the jurisdiction of this Court, limited to a question
of law, can be invoked on the basis of the misconstruction of the powers of the
appellate Court under s. 613(1). The relevant inquiry, in my view, is
whether the reasons of the appellate Court disclose a question of law upon
which this Court may entertain the appeal thereto. Hence, it is enough to say,
without reference to s. 613(1)(a)(i), that in so far as the Crown’s
contention here is that the majority in the Quebec Court of Appeal proceeded
erroneously on the basis that there was no evidence to go to the jury on the
issue of guilty knowledge, a question of law is raised which is cognizable here
if the contention is made out.

In seeking to support this contention, by
reference to the reasons of Rivard J.A., two extracts from his reasons were
relied upon. I find it unnecessary to reproduce them because as set out in the
Crown’s factum they were torn from their context where they related to certain
testimony of Daigle himself and of some police officers touching the guilty
knowledge of the accused. In finding that the evidence as a whole did not
support a determination of guilty knowledge, Rivard J.A., as I have already
pointed out,

[Page 889]

was concerned with the sufficiency of the
evidence. The fact, as was the case here, that an appellate judge decides that
there was no evidence from the mouth of a particular witness on an issue in the
case does not alone raise a question of law. Rivard J.A. nowhere said that the
Crown had failed to make out a case to go to the jury.

There is, however, the statement to that effect,
already quoted, by Montgomery J.A. relating to the issue of guilty knowledge
(and not simply to the testimony of a witness thereon), and Crown counsel
relied on it as well in putting forward his first-mentioned error of law. If
the statement of Montgomery J.A. concerned a critical issue on which his
brethren of the majority and, indeed, those of the minority, did not pronounce
and he was wrong in asserting that there was no evidence on that issue, I would
have to conclude that the acquittal could not stand; but, even so, it would not
necessarily follow that the conviction would have to be restored. The
restoration by this Court of the conviction in The Queen v. Taylor[16], over the lone dissent of Cartwright J.,
as he then was, resulted from the fact that all the opinions delivered in the
provincial appellate Court were construed as based upon an erroneous
determination that there was no evidence to go to the jury. The provincial
appellate Court was not divided in its views in that case; and since the jury
there had passed on the evidence the conviction was necessarily reinstated.

What distinguishes the present case from the
postulated situation that I introduced above is that here the members of the
majority in the provincial appellate Court dealt with the same determining
issue and with the evidence thereon as representing a continuum. The fact that
Montgomery J.A. went the farthest in favour of

[Page 890]

the accused along the line cannot erase the fact
of his journey to the point at which his colleagues of the majority stopped.
His reasons support this appraisal. Conversely, if it be said that he stopped
short of the point that his brethren of the majority reached, his reasons may
be read as none the less finding the evidence deficient to discharge the burden
of proof upon the Crown. In my view, this is a case for the analogical
application of what was said by this Court in its majority opinion in The
Queen v. Warner[17]. As
pointed out by Cartwright J., as he then was (at p. 151), where one of the
grounds of decision of the provincial appellate Court is founded on the
insufficiency of the evidence (thus excluding any appellate jurisdiction in
this Court) the giving of another reason upon which jurisdiction could
otherwise be founded will not support its exercise.

In the result, I would quash the Crown’s appeal
on the ground that there is no question of law arising in the opinions of the
Quebec Court of Appeal upon which it can proceed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Indecent assault—Conviction by
magistrate—Jurisdiction of judge of Supreme Court to declare accused a
dangerous sexual offender—Jurisdiction of Court of Appeal to order new
hearing—Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 2(10), 468, 659, 661, 662,
667.

The appellant was convicted of indecent
assault by a magistrate without a jury and was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment of ten years. An application to have him declared to be a
dangerous sexual offender was filed in the Supreme Court and was

[Page 166]

heard by a judge of the Supreme Court. The
declaration was made and a sentence of preventive detention was imposed. The
Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered a new hearing. The appellant was
granted leave to appeal to this Court and contended that the finding at trial
and the judgment of the Court of Appeal were both nullities because the judge
who entertained the application, not being “any other judge or magistrate who
might have held or sat in the same Court”, was without jurisdiction to do so,
and, alternatively, that the Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction to order
a new hearing.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The trial judge was without jurisdiction to
hear the application. The phrase “the same Court” in s. 662(4) of the Code
must refer to “the judge or magistrate who sentenced the accused”, and as the
accused elected in this case to be tried by a magistrate, the application to
have him declared to be a dangerous sexual offender must be heard by another
magistrate to accord with the meaning of Part XVI of the Code.

The Court of Appeal was without jurisdiction
to order a new hearing. The 1969 amendment to s. 667 (2a) of the Code,
which empowers the Court of Appeal to order a new hearing, could not act
retrospectively to affect the appellant’s rights which were fixed by his notice
of motion for leave to appeal as of a date prior to the amendment. Accordingly,
the Court of Appeal could only have quashed the sentence of preventive detention
and restored the sentence for a definite term.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia1, allowing an appeal from a finding that the appellant was a dangerous
sexual offender and ordering a new hearing. Appeal allowed.

C.R. Kennedy, for the appellant.

W.G. Burke-Robertson, Q.C., for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1]
which allowed an appeal by the accused from a finding that he was a dangerous
sexual offender,

[Page 167]

and ordered a new hearing. On this appeal, the
accused contends that the finding at trial and the judgment of the Court of
Appeal are both nullities because the judge who entertained the application was
without jurisdiction to do so, and, alternatively, that the Court of Appeal was
without jurisdiction to order a new hearing, being only empowered to quash the
finding and sentence at trial.

The appellant was charged with indecent assault
under s. 148 of the Criminal Code. Pursuant to his right under
s. 468 in Part XVI, he elected to be tried by a magistrate without a jury.
He was convicted on December 23, 1968, before Magistrate Denroche, and on
January 9, 1969, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years. A Notice
of Application to have Loos declared to be a dangerous sexual offender was then
filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on February 27, 1969, and on
being heard on June 4, Mr. Justice Dohm of the Supreme Court made the declaration
and imposed a sentence of preventive detention upon him in lieu of the sentence
imposed on January 9, 1969.

A Notice of Motion for Leave to Appeal dated
July 3, 1969, was filed in the Court of Appeal on July 7, 1969. After several
adjournments sine die for the purpose of amending the notice, the matter
came on for hearing on April 23, 1970, and the Court of Appeal allowed the
appeal and ordered a new hearing in judgment rendered May 8, 1970. The accused
now appeals from that judgment.

The first ground of appeal involves the
interpretation of s. 662(4) of the Code:

s. 662(4) Where an application under
subsection (1) of section 660 or subsection (1) of
section 661 has not been heard before the accused is sentenced for the
offence for which he has been convicted, the application shall not be heard by
the Judge or Magistrate who sentenced the accused but may be heard by any other
Judge or Magistrate who might have held or sat in the same Court.

The appellant contends that Dohm J. was without
jurisdiction to hear the application because he was not “any other Judge or
Magistrate who might have held or sat in the same Court.”

[Page 168]

Section 659 defined “court” for the purposes of
s. 662, and it states:

659. In this Part,

(a) “court” means

(i) a superior court of criminal
jurisdiction, or

(ii) a court of criminal jurisdiction.

Section 2(10) defines the latter term:

2.(10) “court of criminal jurisdiction”
means (a) a court of general or quarter sessions of the peace, when presided
over by a superior court judge …

(b) a magistrate or judge acting under Part
XVI, and …

The relevant provision, 10(b), refers to Part
XVI within which s. 468 gives to an accused the right to elect trial on an
indictable offence before a magistrate without a jury, a judge without a jury, or
a court composed of a judge with jury.

The appellant elected to be tried by a
magistrate and was convicted and sentenced. Section 661 allows for an
application to be made to have the accused declared a dangerous sexual
offender, and as to sentence, subsection (3) provides:

661. (3) Where the Court finds that the
accused is a dangerous sexual offender it shall … impose upon the accused a
sentence of preventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that might be
imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or that was imposed for such
offence, or in addition to any sentence that was imposed for such offence if
the sentence has expired.

In my opinion this section reinforces the
view that an application thereunder is essentially a continuation of proceedings
which led to the conviction. The majority of this Court have expressed this
opinion in Sanders v. Regina.[2] That
case involved an application made before the accused was sentenced, but it is
no less applicable for that reason.

[Page 169]

Section 662(4) provides that if the accused has
already been sentenced, the application is to be heard “by any other judge or
magistrate who might have held or sat in the same court.” The phrase “the same
Court” must refer to “the judge or magistrate who sentenced the accused”, and
as the accused elected to be tried by a magistrate, the application must be
heard by another magistrate to accord with the meaning of this Part. The
accused has no further right to elect once the application is made, and there
is no reason to grant such a right to the Crown.

On this point, I am in agreement with the
dissenting opinion of Taggart J.A. in the Court below, and accordingly both the
judgments of the trial judge and the Court of Appeal are null and void, as the
trial judge was without jurisdiction to hear the application.

The majority of the Court of Appeal were of the
opinion that the trial judge had jurisdiction, but allowed the appeal on the
ground that two psychiatrists who gave evidence at the hearing took into
account prior convictions of the accused. As a result, the Court of Appeal
ordered a new hearing. The appellant contends that they were without
jurisdiction to so order, being only entitled to quash the sentence of
preventive detention and to impose one in respect of the offence committed. The
Court of Appeal were acting pursuant to s. 667 (2a) of the Code as
enacted by 1969 (Can.), c. 38, s. 80, which reads:

667. (2a) On appeal against a sentence of
preventive detention the court of appeal may

(a) quash such sentence and impose
any sentence that might have been imposed in respect of the offence for which
the appellant was convicted, or order a new hearing; or

(b) dismiss the appeal.

The part I have emphasized was added to the
section by this amendment, which was proclaimed on July 30, 1969, to be
effective on August 26, 1969. The appellant had filed his Notice of Motion for
Leave to Appeal on July 7, 1969, and thereby fixed his substantive rights on
appeal as of that date, at which time the Court of Appeal had no

[Page 170]

jurisdiction to order a new hearing. The
amendment could not act retrospectively to affect the appellant as his rights
are preserved by s. 19 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c.
158. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal could only have quashed the sentence of
preventive detention and restored the sentence for a definite term.

The appellant succeeds on both grounds of
appeal, either of which results in the restoration of the sentence of ten years
imprisonment imposed upon him by the magistrate.

I would, therefore, allow the appeal.

Appeal allowed.

                   In
1981, appellant pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and committing robbery,
and he was later charged with attempted murder. The second offence took place
during the breaking and entering incident. The victim was brutally beaten and
suffered severe injuries. She would likely have died without treatment. The
trial judge charged the jury that appellant could be convicted of attempted
murder if he had an intention to kill or an intention to cause bodily harm
knowing that death may result and being reckless whether death ensues or not.
This charge was in accordance with Lajoie v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R.
399. Appellant was convicted. On appeal from his conviction, appellant invoked
the rule against multiple convictions enunciated in the Kienapple case,
[1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, and alleged that having pleaded guilty to breaking and
entering and robbery, he should not have been tried again for attempted murder
arising out of the same set of circumstances. The Court of Appeal held that the
Kienapple principle did not apply and dismissed the appeal. The
appellant was then granted leave to appeal at large to this Court. At the
hearing, he indicated that he intended to rely also on the Ancio case,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 225. The Ancio decision, which was rendered after
appellant obtained leave to appeal to this Court, overruled Lajoie and
held that the mens rea for attempted murder was the specific intent to
kill. The Court adjourned the hearing to permit both parties to file factums on
the new issue. At the new hearing, both the Kienapple issue and the Ancio
issue were argued. The Crown conceded that the trial judge's charge was an
error of law if Ancio were to be applied, but it contended that (1) to
entertain the Ancio issue would be to hear an appeal on an issue in
respect of which no leave has been granted; (2) if leave should be granted, the
proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  should in any
event be applied in so far as it may be grounded in an attack on the judge's
charge to the jury; and (3) should this Court not apply the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Code to this appeal, it should substitute conviction for an
offence under s. 228 of the Code.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed but the conviction at trial for the offence of
attempted murder should be substituted by a conviction for the included offence
of causing bodily harm with intent to endanger life. 

 

                                                  (1)
The Kienapple Issue

 

                   The
Kienapple principle has no application in this case. For the Kienapple
rule to apply, there must be both a factual and legal nexus between the
charges. Multiple convictions are only precluded under the Kien­apple
principle if they arise from the same ""cause"", ""matter"", or
""delict"", and if there is sufficient proximity between the offences
charged. This requirement of sufficient proximity between offences will only be
satisfied if there is no additional and distinguishing element contained in the
offence for which a conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple
principle. In the case at bar, the offence of attempted murder involved the
appellant's striking the victim with intent to kill or, at that time, with
intent to cause bodily harm, knowing it to be likely to cause death and being
reckless whether death ensued or not. The elements of the offence of breaking
and entering and committing robbery involved breaking and entering the
apartment, taking jewellery and money, and using violence. There is no
overlapping of the essential elements of the two offences, the only common
element is violence, and the required specific intents are clearly different.

 

                                                      (2)
The Ancio Issue

 

                   Provided
that he is still in the judicial system, an accused charged with an offence is
entitled to have his culpability determined on the basis of what is held to be
the proper and accurate interpretation of the Criminal Code . This test
affords a means of striking a balance between the impractical dream of
providing perfect justice to all those convicted under the overruled authority
and the practical necessity of having some finality in the criminal process.
Finality in criminal proceedings is of the utmost importance, but it is
adequately served by the normal operation of res judicata. Thus a person
convicted under Lajoie will not be able to reopen his or her case,
unless the conviction is not final.

 

                   The
fact that appellant's factum filed in support of his motion for leave and the
oral argument at the hearing of the motion related solely to the Kienapple
issue does not preclude him from invoking Ancio. Leave to appeal to this
Court was not limited to the Kienapple issue but was granted without any
restriction. The appellant became entitled to bring into question the validity
of his conviction on any question of law at a time when this Court had just reversed
its own interpretation of attempted murder. The appellant is thus entitled to
invoke the new question of law raised by reason of Ancio in accordance
with s. 618(1)(b) of the Code. He has established that he was
""in the system"" since he still had an appeal pending before this
Court when Ancio was released.

 

                   It
is common ground that the charge to the jury did not conform to Ancio.
The curative provision of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code cannot be
used to save the attempted murder conviction since it is not clear that the
jury would have convicted the appellant of this offence if instructed that the
necessary intent was the intent to kill. The appeal should be dismissed but a
conviction for the included offence of causing bodily harm with intent to endanger
life, contrary to s. 228(b) of the Code, should be substituted
pursuant to s. 613(1)(b)(i) and s. 613(3) of the Code. This
included offence was put to the jury but no verdict was rendered on it as the
jury found the appellant guilty of attempted murder. Since the jurors convicted
on the basis of one of the two mental elements put to them in the trial judge's
charge, it follows that they would also have convicted the appellant of the
offence under s. 228(b).

 

                   Finally,
the analysis of the Kienapple issue is equally applicable in respect of
the s. 228(b) offence. The intent required under s. 228(b) is an
aggravated intent distinct and additional to that which would suffice for a
conviction of breaking and entering and robbery.

from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d)

murder should be substituted by a conviction for the included offence of
causing bodily harm with intent to endanger life.

                   The
following is the judgment delivered by 

 

1.                The Court‑‑In
1974, in Lajoie v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 399, this Court, speaking
through Martland J., held that when s. 24(1)  of the Criminal Code 
referred to ""an intent to commit an offence"" in relation to murder,
it meant an intention to commit that offence in any of the ways provided for
under s. 212 or s. 213 of the Code. The effect of the decision was that
on an attempted murder charge the Crown could succeed, insofar as the mental
element of the crime was concerned, on proving beyond reasonable doubt that the
accused either (i) meant to cause death or (ii) meant to cause bodily harm that
the accused knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death
ensued or not.

 

2.                Some
ten years later in R. v. Ancio, [1984] l S.C.R. 225, the majority of the
Court, speaking through McIntyre J., held that Lajoie should no longer
be followed, that the mens rea for attempted murder was the specific
intent to kill. A mental element falling short of that level might well lead to
conviction for another offence, for example, one of the aggravated forms of
assault, but not conviction for an attempted murder.

 

3.                In
1981, during the period between the 1974 judgment in Lajoie and the 1984
judgment in Ancio, the appellant Gerald Michael Wigman was tried and
convicted before a judge and jury of attempting to murder one Margaret Hill by
beating her. The judge charged that the accused could be convicted if the jury
found he had either of the two intents mentioned. That was the law according to
Lajoie. It was an error of law however if Ancio is applied, as
the Crown concedes. The appellant, whose conviction is now under review in this
Court, says he is entitled to the benefit of Ancio. The Crown says he is
not. That is the first and primary issue in this appeal. A second point arises
as to the possible application of the so‑called Kien‑ apple
principle, found in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] l S.C.R. 729.

 

                                                                     I

 

The
Facts and the Trial

 

4.                Mr.
Wigman was charged with three counts of breaking and entering and robbery in an
indictment dated October 26, 1981. Count #2 related to an apartment in the City
of Vancouver in which Mrs. Margaret Hill resided. Mr. Wigman pleaded guilty to
all three charges before Toy J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court.

 

5.                On
October 30, 1981, Mr. Wigman was charged with an attempted murder that took
place during the break and enter incident cited in Count #2. Mrs. Hill, a 69
year old woman, lived alone in a ground floor apartment. She went to bed at
8:30 p.m. on May 16, 1981. A neighbour found her lying on the floor of her
bedroom the next day at 4:00 p.m. and it was evident that she had suffered very
severe injuries. The apartment was ""an awful mess"". A number of items
had been taken. The telephone cord had been cut. Medical evidence indicated
that she had been struck on the head at least six times and had enormous
bruises on other parts of her body. She would likely have died without
treatment. The fingerprints of the accused were found in the apartment.

 

6.                The
charge was heard by Toy J. and a jury. At the opening of the trial the accused,
by his counsel, admitted that he, the accused, gained entry to Mrs. Hill's
apartment by removing a sliding door from the apartment balcony, and that he
stole various items of jewellery and a sum of money. There was no reference
during the trial to Mr. Wigman's prior guilty plea to the break and enter
charge. Nor was reference made to the Kienapple argument that the
accused could not be convicted of both the robbery charge and the attempted
murder charge, the violence being common to both.

 

7.                Mr.
Wigman's defence to the attempted murder charge was that he had been
accompanied by a person called ""Dave"" who had assaulted and severely
beaten Mrs. Hill.

 

8.                The
judge charged the jury as to the requisite intent for attempted murder as
follows:

 

. . . you can go either route, an intention to
kill or an intention to cause bodily harm knowing that death may result and
being reckless whether death ensues or not.

 

Words
giving the jury the choice of two intents were repeated many times in the
charge of the jury. This charge was in accordance with Lajoie, but it
now conflicts with Ancio.

 

9.                Toy
J. left with the jury two included offences to the attempted murder charge: (1)
causing bodily harm with intent to endanger life; and (2) assault causing
bodily harm. The jury retired to deliberate at 5:12 p.m. on November 6, 1981
and returned at 5:28 p.m. on November 7, 1981 with a verdict of guilty of
attempted murder. 

 

10.              The
judge noted upon sentencing that the testimony of the accused that a ""Dave
X"" had administered the beatings without the knowledge or agreement of the
accused was rejected by the jury in whole or in part, although it could not be
said whether the jury found Mr. Wigman guilty as a principal, or as a party to
a common purpose pursuant to s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . We would add
that it cannot be said with certainty whether the jury found that Mr. Wigman
meant to cause death or that he had the lesser and now irrelevant intent,
namely, that of meaning to cause bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause
death or was reckless whether death ensued or not.

 

11.              On
December 4, 1981, Toy J. sentenced the appellant to ten years in prison with
respect to the charge of breaking and entering and committing robbery, and to
life imprisonment with respect to the conviction on the charge of attempted
murder.

 

                                                                    II

 

The
Court of Appeal of British Columbia

 

12.              Mr.
Wigman, having obtained new counsel, appealed to the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia against his conviction for attempted murder. His counsel took as his
main point that the accused, having pleaded guilty to breaking and entering,
and robbery, should not have been tried again for attempted murder arising out
of the same set of circumstances. This is the Kienapple issue. The Court
was of the opinion that the principle did not have any application to the facts
in this case. In a decision reported at (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 289, Hutcheon
J.A. reviewed a number of the authorities canvassed in Sheppe v. The Queen,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 22, and the statement of Laskin C.J., at p. 27:

 

                   In Kienapple v. The Queen, supra,
this Court was concerned with a single act which gave rise to two different
offences, and it held that multiple convictions could not be supported for the
same delict or for the same cause or matter or where the same or substantially
the same elements entered into two different offences.

 

Hutcheon
J.A. concluded at p. 292 that the correct view of the matter was set out in the
Crown's argument:

 

The breaking and entering and robbery involved the
accused entering the victims [sic] apartment, taking the woman's
jewellery and money and using violence. The offence of attempted murder
involved the accused striking the woman with one of the two intents set out in
s. 212 (a) of the Criminal Code , or at the very least, involved the accused in
that he was a party to such an offence, pursuant to section 21(2)  and section
212 (a).

 

Hutcheon
J.A. held that on the facts in the case there were two offences involving the
same violence, but he had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that different
factual and legal elements underlay the two offences.

 

                                                                   III

 

The
Supreme Court of Canada

 

13.              Mr.
Wigman applied to this Court for leave to appeal which was granted on December
15, 1983 by a panel consisting of Laskin C.J. and Dickson and Estey JJ., [1983]
2 S.C.R. xv. Leave was granted at large, that is to say the leave was not
confined to any specified point or points. The order granting leave to appeal
reads:

 

                   UPON APPLICATION by counsel on behalf
of the Applicant for an Order granting leave to appeal from the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for British Columbia dated the 28th day of June, 1983, and upon
hearing what was alleged by counsel on behalf of the Applicant as well as the
Respondent on the 5th day of December, 1983;

 

                   IT IS ORDERED that leave to appeal be
granted.

 

14.              In
a factum filed on June 25, 1984, the appellant set out the issues proposed to
be argued:

 

THAT the Appellant having pleaded guilty to Breaking and
Entering and Robbery should not have been tried again for Attempted Murder,
arising out of the same set of circumstances;

 

THAT the Trial Judge erred in not determining and/or in
failing to permit the jury to determine whether the Attempted Murder went
beyond the facts disclosed by the Breaking and Entering and Robbery;

 

THAT the Appellant having been sentenced to imprisonment
for 10 years for Breaking and Entering and Robbery should not have been
sentenced again for Attempted Murder;

 

THAT the Court of Appeal erred in finding that the two
convictions arising from the same violence should stand and that Kienapple
v. The Queen (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2nd) 524 had no application to the facts of
this case.

 

15.              The
appeal was scheduled to be heard on the morning of November 6, 1985. Shortly
before the Court convened that morning, counsel for the appellant told counsel
for the Crown that he intended to raise the R. v. Ancio issue. When the
Court opened, counsel made this known to the Court. Crown counsel objected on
the ground that he had had no warning of opposing counsel's intention to argue Ancio
and that the Crown was not in a position to respond to any such argument. The
Court accordingly adjourned the hearing to permit counsel for the appellant to
prepare a written submission on the Ancio issue and to afford Crown
counsel an opportunity to respond. Supplementary factums were filed.

 

16.              On
the renewed hearing of the appeal, both the Kienapple issue and the Ancio
issue were argued. The Crown makes three submissions. It contends that to
entertain the Ancio issue would be to hear an appeal on an issue in
respect of which no leave has been granted. It contends further that if leave
should be granted, the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  should in any event be applied in so far as it may be grounded in an
attack on the judge's charge to the jury. Finally, it is contended that, should
this Court not apply the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code
to this appeal, it should substitute conviction for an offence under s. 228 of
the Code as it stood on the date of the offence. 

 

                                                                   IV

 

The Kienapple
Issue

 

17.              We
agree with the conclusion of the British Columbia Court of Appeal that the Kienapple
principle has no application and that Mr. Wigman could be convicted of the two
offences in question. In view of the extensive review undertaken in R. v.
Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, it is sufficient to simply reiterate that a
two‑part test must be met for the Kienapple rule to apply: there
must be both a factual and legal nexus between the charges. Multiple convictions
are only precluded under the Kienapple principle if they arise from the
same ""cause"", ""matter"", or ""delict"", and if there
is sufficient proximity between the offences charged. This requirement of
sufficient proximity between offences will only be satisfied if there is no
additional and distinguishing element contained in the offence for which a
conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple principle.

 

18.              In
the case at bar, the offence of attempted murder involved the appellant
striking Mrs. Hill with intent to kill or, at that time, with intent to cause
bodily harm, knowing it to be likely to cause death and being reckless whether
death ensued or not. The elements of the offence of breaking and entering and
committing robbery involved breaking and entering the apartment, taking
jewellery and money, and using violence. There is no overlapping of the
essential elements of the two offences, the only common element is violence,
and the required specific intents are clearly different. The Kienapple
principle does not apply and the appellant must fail on this point.

 

                                                                    V

 

The Ancio
Issue

 

19.              As
already indicated, the Ancio decision had not yet been released at the
time the appellant sought and obtained leave to appeal.

 

20.              The
appellant, however, submits that the charge of the trial judge to the jury
conflicts with the new interpretation of the Criminal Code  given in Ancio.
The inadequacy of the charge in this respect is not in doubt, as is conceded by
the Crown. The main point in issue is whether the appellant can invoke what is
now considered to be the correct interpretation of the Code.

 

21.              The
appropriate test is whether or not the accused is still in the judicial system.
As expressed in the Crown's factum, this test affords a means of striking a
balance between the ""wholly impractical dream of providing perfect justice
to all those convicted under the overruled authority and the practical
necessity of having some finality in the criminal process"". Finality in
criminal proceedings is of the utmost importance but the need for finality is
adequately served by the normal operation of res judicata: a matter once
finally judicially decided cannot be relitigated. Thus a person convicted under
Lajoie will not be able to reopen his or her case, unless, of course,
the conviction is not final. In the Reference re Manitoba Language Rights,
[1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, at p. 757, the Court observed that res judicata
would even preclude the reopening of cases decided by the courts on the basis
of constitutionally invalid laws. The res judicata principle would apply
with at least as much force to cases decided on the basis of subsequently
overruled case law.

 

22.              The
Crown, however, argues that Mr. Wigman ought not to be able to benefit from Ancio.
Counsel for the Crown contends that the appellant was granted leave exclusively
on the Kienapple rule since the factum filed in support of his motion
for leave and the oral argument at the hearing of the motion were all related
solely to this argument.

 

23.              The
flaw in the Crown's proposition is that it does not make any distinction
between the leave to appeal being limited to certain issues and the same leave
being granted at large. It is clear that the Court is empowered to restrict an
appeal to certain specific issues: Lizotte v. The King, [1951] S.C.R.
115, at pp. 117‑18; R. v. Warner, [1961] S.C.R. 144, at pp. 147‑48;
Kienapple, supra, at p. 732; and Canadian Dredge & Dock Co. v.
The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 662, at p. 669; (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 576 (sub
nom. R. v. McNamara). In such cases, the Supreme Court is without
jurisdiction to hear arguments dealing with issues other than the ones
enumerated on the order granting leave to appeal: Lizotte, supra, at p.
133; Warner, supra, at p. 151; Kienapple, supra, at p.
732; and Canadian Dredge & Dock Co., supra, at p. 671.
However, the situation is different when the right of appeal has not been
restricted to a specific question of law. The appellant is then entitled to
raise additional questions of law, subject to the discretion of the Court for
instance, not to decide a case on the basis of an issue tardily raised.

 

24.              In
this regard, s. 618(1)(b) of the Code, which governs the right to
appeal in this case, should be quoted in the context of the whole section:

 

                   618. (1) A person
who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is affirmed by
the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a
judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

 

(b) on any question of law, if leave
to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty‑one
days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended
time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons,
allow. [Emphasis added.]

 

25.              The
difference in the wording between s. 618(1)(a) and (b) is
significant. The respondent's argument would require this Court to construe s.
618(1)(b) as if it read:

 

                   618. (1) A person
who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is affirmed by
the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a judge
of the court of appeal dissents, or

 

(b) on any question of law on which
leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty‑one
days after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended
time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special
reasons, allow. [Emphasis added.] 

 

26.              That
this cannot be the correct interpretation when leave to appeal has been granted
at large is well illustrated in R. v. Caouette, [1973] S.C.R. 859, which
involved the scope of s. 621(1)(b), the counterpart of s. 618(1)(b)
for the Crown:

 

                   621. (1) Where a
judgment of a court of appeal sets aside a conviction pursuant to an appeal
taken under section 603 or 604 or dismisses an appeal taken pursuant to
paragraph 605(1)(a) or subsection 605(3), the Attorney General may
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

 

(a) on any question of law on which a judge
of the court of appeal dissents, or

 

(b) on any question of law, if leave to
appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada within twenty‑one days
after the judgment appealed from is pronounced or within such extended time as
the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof may, for special reasons, allow.

 

(As it
then read.)

 

27.              In
that case, the Crown asserted an appeal as of right, based on the questions of
law on which there had been a dissent, against the acquittal of Caouette by the
Court of Appeal. The Crown however also obtained leave to appeal under s.
621(1)(b) ""on any question of law"". After having stated that
the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was the threshold question in the appeal,
Laskin J., as he then was, dissenting on another point, expressed the following
comments at p. 881 on the Crown's right of appeal after leave has been granted
at large:

 

This leave ... must, in my understanding, be taken to
relate to any question of law that goes to the validity of the verdict of
acquittal; it cannot be construed to refer to a question of law whose
correct resolution would not affect the result reached by the majority of the
Quebec Court of Appeal. The unlimited character of the leave makes it necessary
to determine what were the grounds upon which the Quebec Court of Appeal set
aside the conviction herein and to consider the grounds urged in this Court
against the acquittal; in this latter respect there is no restriction to
the grounds upon which the Quebec Court of Appeal proceeded. [Emphasis added.]

 

(See
also the comments of the majority at pp. 868‑69.)

 

28.              For
reasons of fairness, the Court is reluctant to decide a case on a basis which
was not argued by the parties and upon which the provincial courts have not
spoken. This is a far cry, however, from suggesting that any issue not
contained in the leave application which may tend to support acquittal or
conviction is beyond the reach of the Court. For example, let us suppose that Ancio
had never been heard or decided by the Court and Wigman had proceeded to
be argued solely on the Kienapple issue. It would have been open to the
Court to ask for additional argument on the correctness of the Court's decision
in Lajoie. The Court can, and not infrequently does, raise issues which
did not attract the interest of the parties at the time of the leave
application. In short, this case arose while avenues of redress from the
judgment were still open to the accused ‑‑ it was still ""in
the system"" so to speak. The possibility for an appellant to raise a new
question of law should, however, be subject to counsel for the opposing party
being given notice that the point will be raised and sufficient opportunity to
respond, which was assured in the present case by granting the adjournment
requested.

 

29.              Provided
that he is still in the system, an accused charged with an offence is entitled
to have his or her culpability determined on the basis of what is held to be
the proper and accurate interpretation of the Code. The same reasoning
was inevitably though implicitly adopted in Ancio. Obviously, the
respondent Ancio was still in the system; once it is established in the case at
bar that the appellant is still in the system, then the rationale for applying
to him the ruling in Ancio is the same as the one which was taken for
granted in Ancio with respect to the respondent Ancio.

 

30.              This
rationale is grounded in the principle that an accused should not be convicted
on the basis of the interpretation of a statute which, at the appropriate time,
is known to be wrong. An apt expression of this principle can be found in the
following passage written by Lord Goddard C.J. on behalf of the full Court of
Criminal Appeal in R. v. Taylor, [1950] 2 K.B. 368, at p. 371:

 

                   This court ... has to deal with
questions involving the liberty of the subject, and if it finds, on
reconsideration, that, in the opinion of a full court assembled for that
purpose, the law has been either misapplied or misunderstood in a decision
which it has previously given, and that, on the strength of that decision, an
accused person has been sentenced and imprisoned it is the bounden duty of the
court to reconsider the earlier decision with a view to seeing whether that
person had been properly convicted. 

 

31.              Taylor
was a bigamy case where the Court of Criminal Appeal reconsidered its previous
interpretation of the statutory defence of seven years absence available to a
""Person Marrying a Second Time"", given in the R. v. Treanor
case (1939), 27 Cr. App. Rep. 35. The above‑quoted passage is directed at
the limits of the doctrine of stare decisis but it also explains why the
new and presumably correct interpretation of an offence‑creating statute
should be applied to the accused who is still before the court when the correct
interpretation is rendered.

 

32.              This
rationale was recently followed in R. v. Hotte (1984), 13 W.C.B. 224, in
a decision almost identical to the case at bar. On October 21, 1982, Hotte was
convicted at trial of attempted murder. The trial judge had charged himself
that the intent required to be proven by the Crown was that specified in either
s. 212(a)(i) or s. 212(a)(ii) of the Code. Prior to the
appeal against conviction being heard before the Court of Appeal of Alberta,
this Court released its judgment in Ancio. Laycraft J.A., speaking for
the Court of Appeal, came to the conclusion that, as a consequence of the
interpretation given in Ancio, the appellant had been wrongly convicted
of attempted murder, and he set aside the conviction on this charge. On the
evidence of the case and on the findings made by the trial judge, however,
Laycraft J.A., pursuant to s. 613 of the Code, substituted a conviction
for the included offence of causing bodily harm with intent to wound, maim or
disfigure, under s. 228 of the Code, as it then stood. Hotte is
only one of several decisions wherein different courts of appeal have
consistently applied Ancio to convictions entered prior to the ruling of
this Court: see R. v. Braun (1984), 12 W.C.B. 281 (Alta. C.A.); R. v.
Beaver (1984), 64 N.S.R. 158 (C.A.); R. v. Bains and Grewal (1985),
7 O.A.C. 67, leave to appeal refused, [1985] l S.C.R. v; R. v. Singh
(Inderjit) (1985), 8 O.A.C. 100, and Czubak c. La Reine, R.J.P.Q.,
86‑180 (C.A.)

 

33.              We
should finally add that the possibility for the appellant to raise the new
interpretation given in Ancio is consistent with the power of this
Court, in s. 48 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S‑19, to
resort to its general discretion to order a new trial when ""the ends of
justice seem to require it"".

 

                                                                   VI

 

Conclusion

 

34.              The
determinative factor in the case at bar is that the appellant became entitled
to bring into question the validity of his conviction on any question of law at
a time when this Court had just reversed its own interpretation of attempted
murder. The appellant is thus entitled to invoke the new question of law raised
by reason of Ancio in accordance with s. 618(1)(b) of the Code.
He has established that he was ""in the system"" since he still had an
appeal pending before this Court when Ancio was released.

 

35.              It
is common ground that the charge to the jury did not conform to Ancio.
The curative provision of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) cannot be used since it is
not clear that the jury would have convicted Mr. Wigman of attempted murder if
instructed that the necessary intent was the intent to kill. Firstly, it cannot
be determined with any degree of certainty that the jury completely rejected
Mr. Wigman's story that ""Dave"" was the person who administered the
beating. The jury may have found that Mr. Wigman was a party to the offence
committed by ""Dave"". Secondly, in spite of the savagery of the
attack, it cannot be concluded that the jury found or ought to have found that
the attacker had the intent to kill rather than the intent to inflict bodily
harm which he knew was likely to cause death.

 

36.              Nonetheless,
the Crown has indicated that it would be satisfied with the substitution of a
conviction for the included offence of causing bodily harm with intent to
endanger life, contrary to s. 228 of the Code as it read at the material
time:

 

                   228. Every one
who, with intent

 

(a) to wound, maim or disfigure any person,

 

(b) to endanger the life of any person, or

 

(c) to prevent the arrest or detention of
any          person,

 

discharges a firearm, air gun or air pistol at or causes
bodily harm in any way to any person, whether or not that person is the one
mentioned in paragraph (a), (b) or (c), is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.

 

37.              This
included offence was put to the jury, but of course no verdict was rendered on
it since the jury found Mr. Wigman guilty of attempted murder. The two mental elements
put to the jury in the trial judge's charge on attempted murder were (i) the
intent to kill, and (ii) the intent to cause bodily harm that he knows is
likely to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not. Since the
jurors convicted on the basis of one of these two mental elements, it follows
that they would also have convicted Mr. Wigman of the offence under s. 228. The
previous comments on the Kienapple rule are equally applicable in
respect of the s. 228(b) offence. The intent required under s. 228(b)
is an aggravated intent distinct and additional to that which would suffice for
a conviction of breaking and entering and robbery.

 

38.              Accordingly,
we would, pursuant to s. 613(1) (b)(i) and s. 613(3), dismiss the appeal
but substitute a conviction for the included offence of causing bodily harm
with intent to endanger life (s. 228  of the Criminal Code ); see R. v.
Nantais, [1966] 4 C.C.C. 108 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Fyfe, [1968] 1
C.C.C. 295 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Ruggiero (1972), 9 C.C.C. (2d) 546 (Ont.
C.A.); R. v. Hotte, supra, and R. v. Singh (Inderjit), supra.

case should be remitted to the Supreme Court of British Columbia for
sentencing.

Defence of honest belief not open on the facts of this case ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 323(b).

 

                   The
Municipal Court of Montréal convicted appellant of fortune telling, contrary to
s. 323 (b) of the Criminal Code  which provides that ""Every
one who fraudulently...undertakes, for a consideration, to tell fortunes... is
guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction"". She testified at
trial that she enjoyed special powers to predict the future, but the judge did
not believe her. On a trial de novo, the Superior Court judge quashed
the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Court of Appeal restored the
conviction.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per
McIntyre, Lamer and La Forest JJ.: Given the trial judge's finding that the
accused knew full well that she had no basis for her claim to be able to
predict people's futures, the defence of honest belief was not open on the
facts of this case.

 

                   Per Beetz
J.: I agree with the conclusion of McIntyre, Lamer and La Forest JJ. that the
appeal should be dismissed.

judgment of McIntyre, Lamer and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                McIntyre, Lamer and La Forest
JJ.‑‑The appellant was charged with having fraudulently
undertaken, for a consideration, to tell fortunes, an offence punishable on
summary conviction under s. 323 (b) of the Criminal Code .

 

2.                Section
323 (b) states:

 

                   323. Every one who

(b) undertakes, for a consideration, to tell

                                                                    ...

 

is guilty of an offence punishable on summary
conviction.

 

3.                The
appellant was tried before Judge Tourangeau of the Montréal Municipal Court.
The evidence established that she had told the fortune of a police officer for
$15, and that she regularly told fortunes for a small fee, usually $15. She
testified to the fact that she had enjoyed, since her childhood, special powers
to predict the future. The trial judge found that what she believed was
irrelevant, and in any event he disbelieved her. He read down the meaning
usually given to the word ""fraudulently"" in a charging section and
said that it was there to ensure that people who do not purport to enjoy
special powers and who do it for amusement, as one often sees in tombolas or
amusement parks, not be convicted.

 

4.                In
appeal, de novo, the conviction was quashed and an acquittal entered.
The Superior Court judge merely stated that there was no evidence that she had
said anything fraudulent.

 

5.                The
Court of Appeal restored the conviction.

 

6.                The
issue involves the meaning to be given to the word ""fraudulently"" and
its effect in the section, and in particular whether an accused should be
convicted of fraudulently undertaking for a consideration to tell fortunes if
he honestly believed that he had the power to tell fortunes. However, given the
finding of fact by the trial judge that [TRANSLATION]  ""The accused knows
full well that she has no basis for her claim to be able to predict what will
happen in people's futures"", we are agreed that the defence of honest
belief is not open on the facts of this case.

Whether trial judge failed to instruct the jurors that they must be unanimous
in the way in which the offence was committed ‑‑ Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 21 .

 

            Appellant
was arrested and charged with causing the death of his ex‑wife. Following
their separation in 1979 after seventeen years of marriage, the relation
between the estranged spouses became increasingly bitter and acrimonious as
they fought a long, hotly contested series of custody, access and matrimonial
property battles. On January 21, 1983, appellant's ex‑wife was
ferociously beaten and then shot to death. At trial, the Crown led direct and
circumstantial evidence to prove that the appellant had personally murdered his
ex‑wife or, alternatively, that he aided or abetted the killer and was
therefore guilty as a party to the offence pursuant to s. 21  of the Criminal
Code . The bulk of the evidence tendered by the Crown was consistent with
either theory.

 

            In
defence, appellant adduced alibi evidence and denied any involvement in the
killing. Several witnesses corroborated appellant's whereabouts at the time of
the crime.

 

            In
his charge, the trial judge instructed the jurors that the appellant could be
found guilty of murder if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he
was the principal offender or a party to the offence under s. 21 of the Code.
He explained briefly the position of the defence and spent considerable time
summarizing the Crown's evidence. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of
first degree murder contrary to s. 218 of the Code. The majority of the
Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.

 

            On
appeal to this Court, appellant contended that: (1) there was no evidentiary
basis for a direction pursuant to s. 21 of the Code; (2) the trial judge
failed to direct the jury on the application of the legal principles of parties
to an offence to the evidence of the case; (3) the trial judge erred in
directing the jury to weigh the appellant's evidence against the evidence of
other witnesses and to choose which they accepted, thereby reducing the burden
of proof; (4) the trial judge failed to summarize fairly and adequately the
evidence and the theory of the defence; and (5) the trial judge failed to
instruct the jury that a verdict of guilty must be unanimous in relation to one
or other of the alternative means of committing the offence of murder.

 

            Held:
The appeal should be dismissed.

 

            There
was an evidentiary foundation to justify putting to the jury the Crown's
alternative theory that appellant was a party to the offence under s. 21 ,
rather than a principal. Where an accused is being tried alone and there is
evidence that more than one person was involved in the commission of the
offence, it is also appropriate for the trial judge to direct the jury with
respect to the provisions of s. 21 of the Code, even though the identity
of the other participant or participants is unknown and even though the precise
part played by each participant may be uncertain. Here, there was very strong
evidence connecting appellant with the crime. There was also some evidence
which, if believed, indicated that he did not commit the crime personally. The
facts were for the jury, and the trial judge was correct not to preclude the
jury from considering all the alternatives.

 

            The
trial judge adequately instructed the jury on the application of the legal
principles of s. 21  to the evidence in the case. He accurately stated the law
as to s. 21(1) and went through the evidence of each witness in turn. The fact
that he did not carve his jury charge into discrete sections in which he
reviewed the evidence consistent with appellant having personally committed the
murder, appellant having committed the murder by means of s. 21(1), and,
finally, appellant not having committed the murder at all, was not wrong. Much
of the Crown's evidence was consistent with either Crown theory, and much of
the defence evidence was consistent with either appellant's innocence or his
guilt under s. 21(1).

 

            The
contention that the trial judge erred in putting the jurors to a choice between
accepting the evidence of some witnesses or accepting appellant's evidence,
thereby reducing the burden of proof, must fail. Although one passage of the
trial judge's charge, if it stood alone, would be wrong in law, the charge,
read as a whole, made it clear that the jury was not obliged to take a binary
view of the evidence (accept or reject it) but had to give effect to reasonable
doubt.

 

            The
trial judge adequately summarized the evidence or the theory of the defence. A
trial judge is not required in his charge to paint in the details or to comment
on every argument which has been used or to remind them of the whole of the
evidence. Here, the gist of the appellant's complaint is that the trial judge
revealed to the jurors his own perception of the accused's guilt, through undue
emphasis on the Crown's evidence and inadequate summary of the defence. The
defence evidence was simple and the Crown's case was complex, relying on
circumstantial evidence from a large number of witnesses. It is simply
inappropriate to try to measure the fairness of the charge by reference to
quantity. 

 

            Per
Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Estey, Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: The trial judge did
not err in failing to instruct the jurors that they must be unanimous in the
way in which the murder was committed. Section 21(1)  of the Criminal Code 
is designed to make the difference between aiding and abetting and personally
committing an offence legally irrelevant. It provides that either mode of
committing an offence is equally culpable and, indeed, that whether a person
personally commits or only aids and abets, he is guilty of that offence‑‑in
this case, murder‑‑and not some separate distinct offence. There is
no need for the Crown to specify in the charge the nature of an accused's
participation in the offence. Where there is evidence before a jury that points
to an accused either committing a crime personally or, alternatively, aiding
and abetting another to commit the offence, provided the jury is satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did one or the other, it is a matter
of indifference which alternative actually occurred. It follows that s. 21 
precludes a requirement of jury unanimity as to the particular nature of the accused's
participation in the offence.

 

            Per
Lamer J.: The Crown presented two factually inconsistent theories: that the
appellant actually killed the deceased or that he aided and abetted the killer.
The overwhelming mass of the evidence against the appellant, however, was
consistent with both theories and pointed only to his participation in the
murder. The jury could not have been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of one
theory to the exclusion of the other, but must have been convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant participated in the murder, either as
principal or aider and abettor. Since s. 21(1) of the Criminal Code 
makes the distinction between participation as a principal and participation as
aider and abettor legally irrelevant, it was not necessary for the jury to
decide on the form of his participation and the jury was correct in convicting.
But s. 21 does not always preclude a requirement of jury unanimity as to the
particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. Depending on
the nature of the evidence presented by the Crown, the jury unanimity issue may
arise in any case where the Crown alleges factually inconsistent theories, even
if those theories relate to the particular nature of the accused's
participation in the offence. If the Crown presents evidence which tends to
inculpate the accused under one theory and exculpate him under the other, then
the trial judge must instruct the jury that if they wish to rely on such
evidence, then they must be unanimous as to the theory they adopt. Otherwise,
the jury would be adding against the accused the inculpatory elements of
evidence which cannot stand together because they are inconsistent.

 

            Per
La Forest J.: Although alternative theories of culpability were advanced by the
Crown, there were ample grounds for the jury to find appellant guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt while remaining unsure whether he had committed the murder
himself or through another person. But there may be cases where the
interrelationship between competing Crown theories and the evidence adduced in
relation thereto will not justify a verdict of guilt. In each case, therefore,
it will be for the trial judge, having regard to the nature of the offence, the
theories of the parties, and the totality of the evidence, to realistically
assess the possibility that the evidence will be used improperly, and to direct
the jury accordingly. The present, however, is not such a case.

 

            Section
21  of the Criminal Code  is merely one example of a situation where the
Crown is relying on alternative theories of culpability to found an accused's
guilt. The fact that s. 21  makes the particular nature of the accused's
involvement in an offence legally irrelevant does not in and of itself justify
conviction on the basis of mutually exclusive or alternative theories of
culpability.

judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Estey, Wilson and Le Dain JJ. was delivered
by

 

1                 The Chief Justice‑‑On
May 7, 1984, Colin Thatcher was arrested and charged with causing the death of
his ex‑wife, JoAnn Kay Wilson. After a fourteen‑day trial before
judge and jury, he was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life
imprisonment without eligibility for parole for twenty‑five years. An
appeal to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was dismissed (Vancise J.A.
dissenting) (1986), 46 Sask. R. 241, 24 C.C.C. (3d) 449, [1986] 2 W.W.R. 97.
Colin Thatcher now appears before this Court requesting that the jury's guilty
verdict be set aside.

 

2                 The
position of the Crown throughout the trial was that Mr. Thatcher had murdered
Mrs. Wilson or alternatively that he caused someone else to do so and was
therefore guilty as a party to the offence pursuant to s. 21  of the Criminal
Code . Mr. Gerald N. Allbright, counsel for Mr. Thatcher, advances a number
of grounds of appeal in his factum: (i) that there existed no evidentiary basis
for a direction pursuant to s. 21 of the Code; (ii) that the trial judge
erred in failing to direct the jury on the application of the legal principles
of parties to an offence to the evidence of the case; (iii) that the trial
judge failed to summarize fairly and adequately the evidence and the theory of
the defence; (iv) that the trial judge erred in directing the jury to weigh the
evidence of Mr. Thatcher against the evidence of other witnesses and to choose
which they accepted, thereby reducing the burden of proof; and (v) that the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal erred in ruling that the curative provision found
in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code could be resorted to in the
circumstances of the case. These were all grounds in respect of which there was
dissent in the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, thereby giving rise to an
appeal to this Court as of right, pursuant to s. 618(1)(a) of the Code.

 

3                 Another
ground of appeal, in my view of more substance than those just described, was
also argued by counsel for Mr. Thatcher. It was not the subject of a dissent in
the Court of Appeal and was unanimously dismissed by that Court. Leave to argue
this ground was sought from this Court, and was granted. Counsel contended that
the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that a verdict of guilty
must be unanimous in relation to one or other of the alternative means of
committing the offence of murder. The effect of the argument, in the
circumstances of this case, was that in order to find Mr. Thatcher guilty of
murder, the jury had to be unanimous that he intentionally killed his former
wife or, alternatively, that he aided or abetted another person or persons in
her killing; it was simply not sufficient that some members of the jury would
hold to one theory and other members would hold to the other theory. That, as I
see it, is the principal issue in this appeal.

The
Facts

 

(i) Introductory

 

4                 Having
met as students at the University of Iowa, Colin Thatcher and his former wife
JoAnn were married on August 12, 1962. After their marriage, they returned to
Saskatchewan. They took up residence in Moose Jaw. Mr. Thatcher, the son of a
one‑time member of Parliament and Premier of Saskatchewan, developed over
the years an active and successful career as rancher, farmer and politician,
serving for a time as Minister of Energy and Mines in a Progressive
Conservative Government of Saskatchewan. Three children, Greg, Regan and
Stephanie, were born of the marriage. Thatcher admitted to infidelity during
the course of the marriage. The couple separated in August 1979. JoAnn, taking
the two youngest children with her, left Moose Jaw with Mr. Thatcher's best
friend, Ron Graham. Relations between the estranged spouses became increasingly
bitter and acrimonious as they fought a long, hotly contested series of
custody, access and matrimonial property battles. Colin Thatcher became
obsessed. At one juncture he spirited Regan out of the country, and was found
in contempt and ordered to pay a substantial fine. JoAnn's matrimonial property
entitlement was initially held to amount to $820,000 but the judgment was
immediately appealed. In 1980, the Thatchers were divorced. In January 1981,
JoAnn married Mr. Tony Wilson and moved into a house located across the street
from the Legislative Buildings in Regina.

 

(ii) The Spring of 1981

 

5                 On
the evening of Sunday, May 17, 1981 JoAnn Wilson was shot and wounded while in
the kitchen of her home. A bullet fired from a high‑powered rifle passed
through a triple glaze glass window and struck her in the shoulder. She was
hospitalized for about three weeks. The evidence was that JoAnn Wilson was
terrified by this attempt on her life. After the shooting, she gave up her
right to custody of Regan and, a year later, agreed to accept approximately one
half of the original court award, spread over five years. No one was charged
with the May 17, 1981 

incident.       

 

                   (iii) January
21, 1983

 

6                 At
about 6 o'clock in the evening of January 21, 1983, JoAnn Wilson came home,
drove into the garage of her home and was ferociously beaten and then shot to
death. Twenty‑seven wounds were inflicted on her head, neck, hands and
lower legs. The injuries included a broken arm, a fracture of the wrist and a
severed little left finger. A single bullet entered her skull causing death.

 

7                 Mr.
Craig Dotson testified as to the finding of the body. He stated that he left
work at the Legislative Buildings shortly before 6:00 p.m. on January 21, 1983,
and was walking home when he noted a green car with a female driver turn into
the garage at the Wilson residence. He continued walking for about a block. He
heard loud shrill screams behind him. He turned back to investigate. He heard a
single loud sharp noise and then silence. As he approached a lane near the
Wilson garage he saw a man emerge from the garage. He did not pay any
particular attention. It was dark. He was 30 to 40 feet from the individual. He
walked a little further and saw a body in a pool of blood on the floor of the
garage.

 

8                 Mr.
Dotson told the police he thought the man he momentarily observed had a beard,
was about thirty years old, five foot nine to five foot eleven in height, and
of medium build. A composite sketch prepared by the police with Mr. Dotson's
aid did not fit Colin Thatcher, whom Mr. Dotson knew as a member of the
Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly.

 

                                                                             II

 

The
Pre‑trial Proceedings

 

9                 As
stated, Mr. Thatcher was arrested on May 7, 1984 and was charged that he did
unlawfully cause the death of JoAnn Wilson contrary to s. 218  of the Criminal
Code . Section 218(1) of the Code provides:

 

                   218. (1) Every
one who commits first degree murder or second degree murder is guilty of an
indictable offence and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.

 

Sections
205(5)(a) and 212(a)(i) of the Code define culpable
homicide and murder, respectively. Section 205(5)(a) states:

 

                   205. ...

 

                   (5) A
person commits culpable homicide when he causes the death of a human being,

 

(a) by
means of an unlawful act.

 

Section
212(a)(i) provides:

 

                   212. Culpable
homicide is murder

 

(a) where
the person who causes the death of a human being

 

(i) means
to cause his death

 

Section
214 classifies murder into two types:

 

                   214. (1) Murder
is first degree murder or second degree murder.

 

                   (2) Murder
is first degree murder when it is planned and deliberate.

 

                   (3) Without
limiting the generality of subsection (2), murder is planned and deliberate
when it is committed pursuant to an arrangement under which money or anything
of value passes or is intended to pass from one person to another, or is
promised by one person to another, as consideration for that other's causing or
assisting in causing the death of anyone or counselling or procuring another
person to do any act causing or assisting in causing that death.

 

10               A
preliminary inquiry was held in Regina, Saskatchewan, from the 25th to the 28th
of June, 1984, following which Mr. Thatcher was committed to stand trial as
charged. An indictment was ultimately preferred in the Court of Queen's Bench
for the province of Saskatchewan. In August 1984, an application was taken to
the Court of Queen's Bench requesting a change of venue and the Court directed
that the trial be held at the City of Saskatoon. 

 

11               In
September 1984, prior to the commencement of trial, defence counsel launched a
motion to the trial judge seeking an order directing the Crown to furnish
particulars to the accused ""to further describe the means by which the
accused is alleged to have caused the death of JoAnn Kay Wilson"". This
order was sought pursuant to s. 516(1)(f) of the Code. The
defence also sought an order ""directing disclosure by the prosecutor of
all intercepted private communications to which the accused is in any way a
party, or which relate in any way to the telephone or telephones of any residence
or other buildings used or frequented by the accused, or which relate directly
or indirectly to the charge facing the accused."" The judge, dismissing the
first application (reported at (1984), 42 C.R. (3d) 259), relied upon the
judgment of Martin J.A. in R. v. Govedarov, Popovic and Askov (1974), 16
C.C.C. (2d) 238 (Ont. C.A.), and adopted the following passages from that
judgment, at pp. 269‑70, as a correct statement of the law:

 

                   The
indictment had been preceded by a preliminary hearing lasting several days.
Clearly, the purpose of the application for particulars was not to require the
prosecution to provide the accused with additional details with respect to
matters referred to in the indictment in order that the accused might be more
fully informed of the act or omission charged against them but was to restrict
the prosecution to reliance on a part only of the definition of murder
contained in the Criminal Code .

 

He
concluded at p. 265:

 

                   From
the foregoing authorities I am satisfied that the accused is not entitled to an
order for the particulars he seeks. If there is evidence upon which a properly
instructed jury could find that the accused committed the offence or that he
was a party to the commission of an offence by a person or persons unknown, it
must be left to the jury to make either of such findings and their right to do
so may not be restricted by an order for particulars. The application for
particulars is accordingly dismissed.

 

The
trial judge, on the second application, for disclosure of intercepted private
communications, granted such disclosure in part.

 

                                                                            III

 

The
Case for the Crown

 

12               At
trial, the case for the Crown rested upon an evidential base of both direct and
circumstantial evidence, which I will now seek to summarize:

 

(i)                The Apparent Surveillance
Prior to the Killing

 

13               Margaret
Johannsson testified that she observed a car parked almost directly opposite
the Wilson garage on the day before the killing. The motor was not running. The
lights were out. A male individual was seated behind the wheel. The car was
blue in colour and had what appeared to be a government safety sticker on the
back bumper.

 

14               Joan
Hasz testified that she observed a blue car parked opposite the house in which
she was employed (a block west of the Wilson residence) on the three afternoons
preceding the killing. The car was placed so that it could command an
unobstructed view of the Wilson garage. It was occupied by a single male. The
motor was not running. This upset Mrs. Hasz and she informed her employer, Mr.
Adams, who watched the car for fifteen minutes. As Mrs. Hasz left for home she
decided to look at the license but could only read the numbers as the letters
were covered with mud. She memorized the numbers 292 and repeated them as she
drove home. When she arrived, she wrote them down. The occupant of the vehicle
was described as a relatively young male of medium build with a beard, wearing
a toque and what appeared to be rubber or surgical gloves. A police composite
of the person Mrs. Hasz and Mr. Adams described did not fit Mr. Thatcher. One
of the admissions of fact made on behalf of the accused was this: a 1980 Olds
Delta 88 automobile bearing Saskatchewan license plate KDW 292 and owned by the
Government of Saskatchewan was on January 10, 1983 checked out from the Central
Vehicle Agency, Regina, to W. Colin Thatcher and remained checked out to him
until it was picked up by the Regina City Police on January 27, 1983.

 

15               The
witness Charles Guillaum testified that, at a much earlier date, on the
appellant's instructions he returned a government car to the government garage.
Under the front seat of that car he found a holster for a handgun which he
turned over to the Regina City Police.

 

(ii) The Credit Card

 

16               During
their investigation immediately following the killing the police found a Shell
Oil credit card receipt lying on top of the snow some eight feet from the
southeast door of the garage. The receipt bore what appeared to be the
signature of Colin Thatcher. The owner of the service station confirmed the
purchase by Mr. Thatcher of gasoline from J. & M. Shell Service in Caron,
Saskatchewan on January 18, 1983. 

 

(iii) The Gun and the Bullet

 

17               According
to expert police testimony, JoAnn Wilson was probably struck in the head with a
.38 Special Plus P, aluminum‑jacketed, 95 grain bullet manufactured by
Winchester. The bullet was probably fired from a .38 Special or .357 Magnum
Ruger revolver. The murder weapon was never found. The proprietor of a gun shop
in Palm Springs, California, Ronald Williams, testified that on January 29,
1982 he sold Colin Thatcher a .357 calibre Ruger revolver. Thatcher picked up
the gun along with a holster and ammunition on February 20, 1982. The
ammunition consisted of two boxes of Winchester western .38 calibre Special
Plus P silver tip hollow point shells and two bags of reloaded ammunition. The
Winchester ammunition had a bullet with an aluminum jacket and a lead core. The
witness also identified the holster found by the witness, Guillaum, as being
consistent with the holster he sold to Colin Thatcher.

 

(iv) The Evidence of Lynn Mendell

 

18               The
Crown also called Lynn Mendell, of Palm Springs, California, a former
girlfriend of Colin Thatcher. Ms. Mendell described the bitterness Thatcher
constantly expressed about JoAnn Wilson, and how he maintained many times that
he wanted to kill her or arrange with someone to do it for him. She testified
that this was on his mind all the time. According to Ms. Mendell, Thatcher told
her he had met with someone in Saskatchewan whom he wanted to hire to kill
JoAnn Wilson. He eventually told her the plan fell through but that he would
have to go about it one way or another. These conversations took place in late
1980 and early 1981.

 

19               Lynn
Mendell also told the Court that in May of 1981 Thatcher phoned and told her
his ex‑wife had been shot and wounded. She testified that when he came
down to Palm Springs a few days later, he told her someone had rented a car for
him; that he, Thatcher, wore a disguise; and that he had staked out an area
that was visually accessible but, because he did not gauge the thickness of the
glass, the bullet deflected and struck JoAnn Wilson on the shoulder. According
to Ms. Mendell, he told her:

 

Gee,
I didn't gauge the thickness of the glass so the bullet obviously deflected
because I only got her in the shoulder.

 

She
also stated that Thatcher told her he left Regina and ran into roadblocks; that
he went out into the fields where he got rid of the gun, the wig, and the
overalls and then made his way back to Moose Jaw. According to Ms. Mendell, the
only thing that saved him was the fact that the police did not go to his home
to see if he were there.

 

20               Lynn
Mendell also testified she knew Thatcher had a handgun in Palm Springs. She saw
him pack that gun into a Barbie Doll shower box with newspaper, and place the
box in his suitcase prior to his leaving for Canada. A box matching that
description, with a label which showed it had been purchased in Palm Springs,
and containing old copies of the Los Angeles Times, was found by Regina
City police in a small cupboard adjoining the master bedroom of Thatcher's home
in Moose Jaw.

 

21               On
the day of the killing, Ms. Mendell said she received two calls from Thatcher,
one early and another later in the evening. During the first call Colin
Thatcher told her:

 

Well,
I'm going out now. This might be the night, stick around.

 

During
the later call he said:

 

Oh,
my God, I've just been called...Apparently JoAnn has been shot in her home and
has been killed.

 

Thatcher,
according to Ms. Mendell, came to Palm Springs a few days after the fatal
shooting. She said to him:

 

Well,
you really did it, didn't you.

 

She
said he scowled, nodded, pointed to the walls, and told her not to talk there.
Later, when they were outside the condominium, he was alleged to have said:

 

I
have to admit it is a strange feeling to have blown your wife away.

 

When
press reports of the shooting and beating appeared in the Desert Sun he
allegedly said:

 

I
don't know why they said she was beaten. I didn't beat her.

 

22               Ms.
Mendell acknowledged that she did not contact the authorities immediately after
these incidents. 

 

(v) The Evidence of Gary Anderson

 

23               Gary
Anderson testified under an agreement of immunity from prosecution. Anderson is
a farmer from the Caron district and a rural neighbour of Colin Thatcher. He
testified he had met Thatcher in the fall of 1980 and Thatcher had asked him if
he was interested in killing JoAnn Wilson for a fee of $50,000 or, if not,
whether he could find someone to do it for him. Anderson stated he knew another
person named Charlie Wilde who might be interested. Wilde suggested a third
person, Cody Crutcher, who would be willing to take on the job. Anderson stated
that Thatcher gave him $15,000 to pass on to Crutcher, and that Anderson paid
some $14,500 to Crutcher, together with a picture of JoAnn Wilson and a set of
her car keys. Nothing came of this and Anderson then arranged for a meeting
with Charlie Wilde at a farm north of Caron, Saskatchewan in the spring of
1981. At that meeting Charlie Wilde told Thatcher he would do the job himself
while visiting the United States. Before doing anything, however, Charlie Wilde
was arrested in Winnipeg on an unrelated matter.

 

24               Anderson
testified that Thatcher got him to purchase a .303 Lee Enfield rifle and some
ammunition. On May 16 or 17, 1981, prior to the wounding of Mrs. Wilson,
Anderson, at Thatcher's request, rented a car for Thatcher and turned it over
to him by dropping it off at a prearranged location. On instructions given by
Thatcher, An­derson waited to hear of the wounding of JoAnn Wilson before he
went back to get the car. Once he had heard she had been shot he returned to
the place where he had left the car, retrieved the vehicle, cleaned it and
returned it to the rental dealer. He noted that the car was dusty and that the
licence plates were smeared with mud. Anderson testified that in the fall of
1982 he again met with Thatcher and asked him how he could have missed, to
which the appellant answered that he did not know.

 

25               Anderson
further stated that when he again met Thatcher in late 1982, Thatcher turned
over a handgun to him with a request that he find a silencer for it. The gun
was a .357 calibre Magnum Security Special. Anderson was unsuccessful in
getting a workable silencer made and on January 20, 1983 he saw Thatcher and
reported that to him. At that time Thatcher told him he had been stalking his
ex‑wife for a week and that he wanted the gun back. The gun was turned
over to Thatcher on the afternoon of January 21, 1983. Earlier that morning Thatcher
asked Anderson to get him a car. Anderson turned that over to Thatcher on that
day on directions given him by Thatcher. Anderson then read in the newspaper
that JoAnn Wilson had been killed. That was his signal to retrieve the car from
where he had left it for Thatcher. He got the car back, cleaned it out, cleaned
the licence plates off, and burned the items he removed from the vehicle. In
cleaning out the car the witness testified that he removed clothing he had seen
Thatcher wearing when Anderson turned the car over to him, plus a tuft of hair
he thought came from a wig.

 

26               Finally,
Anderson testified that on May 1, 1984 he again met Thatcher at a deserted farm
near Caron. He had been provided with a body pack tape recorder to record the
conversation between himself and Thatcher. A brief extract from the
conversation follows:

 

 

 

Anderson: 
Umm, I got rid of the ah stuff outta' the car.

 

Thatcher: 
Good.

 

Anderson: 
You kinda' give me a scare there with, I found             the stuff laying and
then I wondered what the              hell, I didn't know where the hell you,
what the             hell you'd done with the gun. (Sighs).

 

Thatcher: 
Listen, don't even talk...

 

Anderson: 
Hm.

 

Thatcher: 
...like that. Don't. Don't, don't even...Walk              out this way a
little (unintelligible).

 

Anderson: 
(Grunts)

 

Thatcher: 
No. There are, there are no loose ends at all.             And ah...

 

(Muffled
noises.)

 

Thatcher: 
...y'know, they've gone at every which                     direction. Umm, is
there any way a loose end               from a couple years ago can ever
resurface?

 

Anderson: 
Ahhh.

 

Thatcher: 
From some of ahh, some of the guys tha, th, that             ah, discussing
some business with. Is there any             way can ever be a problem surface
from them?

 

Anderson: 
Mmm, y'mean the, from Vancouver and Winnipeg?              Ahh. I ah located
one of 'em.

 

Thatcher: 
The one that I met or the other one?

 

Anderson: 
Ahh, the other one.

 

Thatcher: 
Son‑of‑a‑bitch.

 

Anderson: 
Well. It's up to you.

 

Thatcher: 
Is he in, or, he's not in jail now is he, or in             any trouble?

 

Anderson: 
Not to my knowledge.

 

                   Again:

 

Thatcher: 
Okay an' just remember there are no er, no                 problems an' there
won't be unless they trip               over something an' I got no intention
of giving             them anything to trip on.

 

Anderson: 
'Kay.

 

Thatcher: 
There's no loose ends like, y'know, there's                nothin' for them t'
find. Y'know.

 

Anderson: 
It's all been...

 

Thatcher: 
All...

 

Anderson: 
...taken care of.

 

Thatcher: 
Sure. Heavens yes. Heavens yes. I'm ahh, but I             still don't trust
the bastards for bugs. Mean,             I don't know whether there's any
possibility               that that, 'ts why when we talk ah, just
assume             the bastards are listening. 

 

(vi) The Evidence of Charles Wilde

 

27               Charles
Wilde testified that in the summer of 1980 he met Gary Anderson while they were
fellow inmates in a Regina jail. Anderson later asked him if he was interested
in doing a killing. At that time Wilde told Anderson he was not interested.
Wilde later talked to his friend Cody Crutcher and they decided that, while
they would not do the killing, they would be happy to take the money offered
for it. In December 1980, Anderson, Wilde and Crutcher met in Regina. Anderson
gave Crutcher $7,500 which Crutcher split with Wilde. Shortly after that Wilde
again met with Anderson and got another $7,000 plus a picture of the intended
victim, JoAnn Wilson, and her car keys. In March 1981, Wilde met with Anderson
and Thatcher. At that time Thatcher pressed him to do the job and offered him
50 to 60 thousand dollars if he would complete the killing. He told Wilde that
his ex‑wife, her husband, and Stephanie were going to Ames, Iowa, to
visit her parents during the Easter week of 1981. He indicated that Ames would
be a good place to ""hit"" her, gave the Iowa address to Wilde, and
suggested that he, Wilde, could phone him in a few days at the Legislature, by
which time he would probably have some money available. While Wilde said he had
no intention of killing anyone, he agreed to do what was asked in order to see
if he could get some money. At a subsequent meeting with Thatcher, Thatcher
gave Wilde $4,500 to assist him in travelling to the United States where JoAnn
was visiting her parents. Shortly after, Wilde was arrested in Winnipeg for
breaking into a drugstore. Wilde acknowledged having a lengthy criminal record,
mainly for drug offences.

 

(vii) The Evidence of Richard Collver

 

28               Mr.
Collver and Mr. Thatcher both sat as members of the Saskatchewan Legislature,
the latter being then a member of the Liberal Party while Mr. Collver led the
Provincial Progressive Conservative Party. In time Mr. Collver persuaded
Thatcher to join the Conservative caucus, and the two became close personal
friends. Their friendship continued after Mr. Collver resigned as Leader of his
Party and sat as an independent Member.

 

29               Collver
testified that during the 1979 fall session of the Legislature Thatcher
repeatedly talked to him, Collver, about his marital problems, so much so that
Mr. Collver thought him obsessed‑‑he couldn't think about politics
or anything else. Collver invited Thatcher and several members of his family to
visit over Christmas at his dude ranch near Phoenix, Arizona. The following
extract from the charge of the trial judge will indicate the nature of
Collver's further evidence.

 

                   Collver
testified that the morning following their arrival he and Thatcher were talking
about Thatcher's problems over coffee. He said that Thatcher told him he had to
find someone to kill her. According to Collver he and Thatcher had previously
talked about some horrible people two lawyer friends of Collver knew in Calgary
and Edmonton. And he testified that Thatcher wanted him to phone one and get
somebody to assist him in killing his wife. Collver says he told Thatcher he
was suffering from an obsession and that he should get rid of it. When Thatcher
renewed the request at least three more times the same day, Collver asked him
to leave the ranch and he and the family departed the following morning.

 

                   The
following spring, 1980, when the Legislature was in session, Collver testified
that Thatcher again approached him about negotiating a settlement. He told
Thatcher he would be bled to death if he kept on with lawyers, but that if he
would give him a bottom line, that he, Collver, would try to negotiate a
settlement. Thatcher told him his bottom line was $400,000.00 and custody of
the two boys. Collver said he met with JoAnn and she asked him if she could bring
in a friend to assist her, who it turned out was Tony Wilson. The upshot of the
meeting was that JoAnn would accept $230,000.00 and custody of Stephanie, with
Thatcher to have custody of the two boys. Collver said he was ecstatic. He
immediately telephoned Thatcher and told him what he had achieved. According to
Collver Thatcher's reply was, ""The bitch isn't going to get
anything."" This ended the attempt by Collver to assist his friend
Thatcher.

 

30               Collver
indicated that he had not conveyed this information in any fashion to the
authorities until shortly before his testimony at the trial. He had withheld
such information after receiving legal advice to the effect that he was under
no legal duty of disclosure.

 

                                                                            IV

 

The
Defence

 

31               Seven
witnesses were called by the defence. As well, the accused testified on his own
behalf. One witness, Mr. Wayne Mantyka, a Regina newscaster, was called to
support the claim that ammunition allegedly used to commit the crime could be
obtained not only in the United States but also in Canada. The other six
witnesses were called in support of Thatcher's version of his whereabouts on
the night of the killing, as well as on the night of the first shooting.

 

32               The
credibility of these witnesses was critical to meeting the Crown's primary
submission. Regina, where Mrs. Wilson was killed, is over forty miles east of
Moose Jaw. Moose Jaw is about eighteen miles east of Thatcher's ranch in Caron.
Mr. Dotson's testimony was that he discovered the body at approximately 6:00
p.m. A test conducted by the police determined that it was possible to travel
from the victim's house in Regina to the appellant's residence in Moose Jaw in
roughly twenty‑eight minutes. Testimony indicating that Mr. Thatcher was
elsewhere would, if believed, go to rebut the allegation that he personally
murdered his ex‑wife. It would not, however, be relevant to the Crown's
alternative submission that he caused someone else to commit the act. 

 

(i) The Evidence of Mrs. Barbara Wright

 

33               Mrs.
Barbara Wright, the wife of Thatcher's farm manager, testified that she had
seen Mr. Thatcher drive into his ranch between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. on the day of
the murder. She estimated this time partly by reference to her belief that she
left work shortly after 4:00 p.m. that afternoon. She said she was in the
kitchen when Thatcher drove into the yard in his truck shortly after 5:00 p.m.
She said she did not speak to him and only observed his movements through the
window. He left after about twenty minutes. She testified that at about 7:00
p.m., Thatcher telephoned to say that Mrs. Wilson had been murdered.

 

34               In
cross‑examination, she acknowledged that her work records showed that she
was not working on the day of the murder, but she explained this discrepancy by
stating that she had exchanged shifts with a fellow employee and that this
exchange did not show up in the records. Also in cross‑examination, she
admitted that she did not give this information to the police when she was
interviewed several days after the murder. She stated that, at that time, she
did not think of Thatcher as a suspect. She also admitted to speaking with Mr.
Thatcher the night before swearing an affidavit in which similar statements
about his whereabouts were made. She denied, however, that suggestions were
made to her as to what she may have seen on the day of the murder.

 

(ii) The Evidence of Mr. Patrick Hammond

 

35               Mr.
Patrick Hammond, a railroad employee who had done a ""substantial
amount"" of work on Mr. Thatcher's vehicles, testified that he saw Mr.
Thatcher, on the day in question, driving in Moose Jaw at approximately 5:30
p.m. In cross‑examination, he acknowledged that, when he was interviewed
by the police a few days after the murder, he did not inform the police that he
saw Mr. Thatcher. He stated that he did not think this information was
important until after Mr. Thatcher was arrested and charged. Similar evidence
as to Mr. Thatcher's whereabouts was given by Mr. Hammond in support of
Thatcher's bail application.

 

(iii)               The Evidence of Mrs. Sandra
Silversides

 

36               The
defence also called Mrs. Sandra Silversides, a government employee in Moose
Jaw, as well as the appellant's constituency secretary and part‑time
housekeeper. Mrs. Silversides is the sister of Patrick Hammond. Mrs.
Silversides testified that she had arrived at the Thatcher residence in Moose
Jaw at 5 o'clock and that, while Mr. Thatcher was not at home when she arrived,
he came into the kitchen at approximately 6 o'clock to eat the Hamburger Helper
she had prepared for dinner. She further stated that she left the Thatcher
residence at 6:15 p.m. and that Gregory, Thatcher's son, called her at 7:30
that evening and asked her to come over because something had happened to his
mother. She stated that when she arrived Mr. Thatcher was sitting in the
kitchen staring at the wall.

 

37               On
cross‑examination, Mrs. Silversides admitted that she gave a statement
similar to her evidence at trial in an affidavit in support of Mr. Thatcher's
bail application and that she ""could have talked [with Thatcher] about
what happened that night"". She also stated in cross‑examination that
she was suing the police for false arrest.

 

(iv) The Thatcher Sons

 

38               Regan
Thatcher testified that he was at home with his father at the time of the
earlier shooting and also when his mother was murdered. He stated that, on the
day of the murder, he came home from school between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m., that
his father came in about 5:30 p.m. and that he, his brother, his father and
Mrs. Silversides ate dinner at about 6 o'clock.

 

39               Gregory
Thatcher testified that he arrived home from school earlier than his brother,
at about 3:45 p.m., and saw his father, who left shortly thereafter to go to
the ranch. At about 5:15 or 5:30 p.m., his father returned. His evidence as to
what occurred subsequently was similar to that given by his brother and Mrs.
Silversides.

 

(v) The Evidence of Mr. Anthony Merchant

 

40               Mr.
Merchant, a lawyer and a one‑time member of the Legislative Assembly,
testified that he became acquainted with Colin Thatcher in the early 1970's. He
subsequently became Thatcher's counsel in relation to the appellant's
matrimonial disputes.

 

41               In
addition to testifying as to Mr. Thatcher's whereabouts the night Mrs. Wilson
was wounded, Mr. Merchant testified that, on the night she was killed, one of
his partners called to tell him that there appeared to have been a shooting at
the Wilson residence. He stated that he immediately called Thatcher at his
home, at ""about 6:15 p.m."" and passed on this information. Shortly
thereafter, a reporter came to his house who told him that perhaps Mrs. Wilson
had been killed. He stated that he ""waited a bit of time"" and then
called the appellant again, ""shortly after seven o'clock"", with that
information, informed him that he was going out, and gave Thatcher a number at
which he could be reached should the police arrive. Merchant then went to the
Wilson residence and spoke to a police officer who confirmed that Mrs. Wilson
indeed had been killed. He testified that he then telephoned Thatcher again
with the news, at approximately 7:20 p.m. The next morning, he advised Thatcher
that he had a legal right to take custody of his daughter Stephanie. He
testified that he, Thatcher, and Thatcher's son Gregory, thereafter personally
attended the Kohli home, where Stephanie was staying, and that some physical
force was used to take custody of Stephanie. 

 

42               Mr.
Merchant also testified as to Mr. Thatcher's whereabouts on the night Mrs.
Wilson was wounded on May 17, 1981. He testified that he retained the original
telephone record of a call he had made to Thatcher that evening, as well as the
original record of two of the three calls to Thatcher the night Mrs. Wilson was
killed. He described three mysterious break‑ins of his office, which
resulted in the disappearance of these records, and stressed that these break‑ins
occurred after Thatcher had been arrested and after Mr. Merchant had disclosed
the existence of the records in an affidavit supporting Thatcher's bail
application. Mr. Merchant implied that they were stolen because they were
otherwise protected by the solicitor and client relationship. Mr. Merchant's
testimony proved to be incorrect. On the day following his testimony, defence counsel
addressed the court as follows:

 

Thank
you, My Lord. My Lord, just prior to calling my next witness, I wonder, there
is a matter I would like to address you as an officer of the court, and I just
mentioned it briefly to my Learned Friend and I think it should be done by way,
in my view as an officer of the court, as a brief submission so that the
evidence is clear before the Jury and there is no misconception. I received a
telephone call this morning at nine thirty from Mr. Merchant, who of course was
here yesterday, who advised me that he had checked with his partners in Regina
and that the break‑in occurred before, and I think this is very
important, and I want to clarify it, the break‑ins occurred before Mr.
Thatcher was arrested and of course that certainly wasn't what he indicated to
us in his cross‑examination to us yesterday. And as an officer of the
court I want that raised and clarified now, My Lord. Mr. Kujawa was kind enough
to agree that it would be appropriate for me to rise and address you on it at
this time. Mr. Merchant advised me of that at nine‑thirty this morning
when I was in the barrister's lounge by telephone. I wish to bring it to your
attention and the attention of the Jury.

 

(vi) The Evidence of Colin Thatcher

 

43               Colin
Thatcher testified for more than two days. With respect to the earlier
unsuccessful attempt on his ex‑wife's life, he testified that on the
evening in question he was with his son Regan at home, and that they were
opening up the swimming pool for the summer. As to the day his ex‑wife
was killed, Mr. Thatcher testified that he spent the morning of January 21 at
his ranch in Caron, that he went to his residence in Moose Jaw over the noon
hour to do some paper work and odds and ends, and that he returned between 4:00
and 4:30 in the afternoon to his ranch. He stated that he checked his cattle
for approximately half an hour and then returned home to Moose Jaw. On his way
home, in Moose Jaw, Thatcher stated that he exchanged waves with Mr. Hammond. His
testimony as to his subsequent whereabouts on that evening parallelled that
given by Mrs. Silversides, his sons and Mr. Merchant.

 

44               Thatcher
also testified as to his relationship with Lynn Mendell. He said he met her in
October, 1980 in Palm Springs, California, and that they got along well but
that she ""had a misconception...that there was some remote possibility
that we might be getting married"". He denied several aspects of her
testimony. First, he denied that he went down to Palm Springs a few days after
the first shooting, saying it was more like four or five weeks after the event.
Second, he denied telling her in relation to that shooting that he donned a
disguise, staked out a visibly accessible area and only wounded Mrs. Wilson
because he did not gauge the thickness of the kitchen window. Third, though he
testified that six or seven days after his ex‑wife was killed he went to
Palm Springs and spent some time with Ms. Mendell, he denied telling her that
it was ""a strange feeling to blow your wife away"". He testified
instead that Ms. Mendell asked him whether he killed her and he stated, ""I
cannot imagine what a strange feeling that that would be. No, of course
not."" Fourth, he denied packaging a revolver in a toy shower box and
bringing it to Canada. He described this allegation as a ""pretty good
trick"", concocted by Ms. Mendell.

 

45               With
respect to the gun and bullets, he acknowledged that he had bought a .357
Magnum Ruger revolver plus a holster and ammunition but, as stated, he denied
bringing it back to Canada. He stated that it was stolen from his condominium
in Palm Springs and he suspected a cleaning woman took it. He also admitted
using Hollow Point bullets, but only to practice shooting in the desert. He
stated he knew nothing about the holster found in his car by Mr. Guillaum; he
testified that his holster was of a different type and had his name on it.

 

46               In
his examination‑in‑chief, Thatcher stated further that he had no
explanation as to why a credit card invoice would be present eight feet from
the Wilson's garage door on the night of the murder. In cross‑examination,
he suggested that it may have been planted by someone.

 

47               With
respect to the evidence given by Gary Anderson about being asked by Thatcher to
obtain a silencer for a weapon, and as to picking up and cleaning the car and
burning items contained in it a few days after the murder, Thatcher stated that
these stories too were concocted. He said his initial contact with Mr. Anderson
grew out of an attempt in November 1980 to purchase or rent land from the
Andersons. No arrangement was concluded and the matter was left open so that
Mr. Anderson would have a chance to discuss the proposition with his mother.
Anderson contacted him a few months later to inform him that the land would be
rented to someone else. During that meeting, the conversation shifted to the
subject of Ron Graham. Thatcher testified that Anderson told him that Graham
may have been ""cutting corners"" in his construction work, and that
he, Thatcher, agreed to give Anderson some money to cover expenses while
checking out this possibility. That spring, Thatcher stated that he met Anderson
on a country road and the latter told him that two men from Calgary were coming
into town. Thatcher told Anderson where he would be the following day, and
Anderson thereafter showed up with a man Thatcher subsequently knew to be
Charlie Wilde, though he did not know Wilde ""from a bale of hay""
until the preliminary hearing. At that meeting, they told him that they could
""lay a good licking on [Ron Graham] or ...go even further than that"".
Thatcher told them that he wasn't interested in the idea, though he agreed to
pay Anderson $500 expenses in connection with the trip from Calgary. 

 

48               After
the murder, Thatcher testified that he saw Anderson in Regina in late 1982.
After exchanging a few remarks, they went to the appellant's parking space
behind the Legislature. There An­derson complained that his car had been
towed away from the Legislative grounds. Thatcher testified that he arranged
for its return, and later talked to Anderson in the car‑‑a Dodge‑‑where
inadvertently he left his top coat, scarf and gloves. He said he did not
realize this until some time later, and did not see Anderson again until May 1,
1984, the day their conversation was recorded by body‑pack.

 

49               Thatcher
also testified about this recorded conversation, and said he was speaking in
""Caron slang"". He explained various parts of the conversation to the
jury. For example, he said he believed Anderson was referring to the top coat,
scarf, and gloves, when he said: ""Umm, I got rid of the ah stuff outta'
the car."" And he, Thatcher, was referring to a Tansy Mustard Plant he
spotted in the field when he said ""son‑of‑a‑bitch""
after Anderson said ""Ahh, the other one."" Thatcher said he talked to
Anderson on this occasion because he was interested in knowing what the police
were doing and saying to Anderson. Moreover, he stated that An­derson felt
he had $500 coming to him, and that he, Thatcher, did not want a person of
Anderson's temperament on his back. Anderson, he suggested, was capable of burning
granaries or haystacks if annoyed. He wanted to keep on reasonably good terms
with him. Accordingly, on Thursday evening, just before dark, he left the sum
of $550 for Mr. Anderson at the spot where it was located by the police.

 

50               Thatcher
also denied meeting with Charlie Wilde to give him money or information about
Mrs. Wilson's travel plans so that she could be killed in the United States. He
also denied using Anderson as a go‑between to arrange to have his wife
murdered, and said he did not advance $15,000 for disbursement by Anderson.

 

51               With
respect to the evidence given by Mr. Coll­ver, Mr. Thatcher also told a
different story. Thatcher testified that on New Year's Eve his and Collver's
families went out to dinner, consumed a great deal of alcohol, and returned to
Collver's dude ranch for a New Year's Eve party. He testified that ""Dick
is the cheapest drunk in the world"" and that, the next morning, when he
went down to the kitchen, Collver was sitting there in ""that never never
land when you are still half drunk and hung over"". Thatcher stated that at
that time he sought advice from Collver on the legal options available to him
in relation to his marital problems, and that Collver told him that he could go
to court, settle, or kill his wife. Thatcher testified that Collver was not
serious about the third option, that Collver was hung over and used the third
option as a rhetorical way of attempting to persuade Thatcher to settle with
his wife.

 

52               In
his charge to the jury, the trial judge explained the position of the defence
briefly as follows: (i) that the evidence did not satisfy the duty on the Crown
to establish that Thatcher either killed JoAnn Wilson or that she was killed at
his direction; (ii) that the composite drawings were obviously not likenesses
of Thatcher; (iii) that the credit card receipt was planted on the scene by
someone who wanted to attach blame to Thatcher; (iv) that the tape recorded the
statement of Thatcher that he was at home with four people the night of the
murder; (v) that Thatcher was seen in Caron when he was supposed to be stalking
JoAnn Wilson; (vi) that ammunition of the type used to kill JoAnn was readily
available in Canada contrary to police evidence; (vii) that Lynn Mendell was
seeking money and power if she could not get Thatcher by marriage she would get
him another way; (viii) that Wilde would do anything for a dollar; (ix) that
Anderson failed on the tape because he did not dare attempt to get an admission
of guilt from Thatcher; and finally, (x) that witnesses testified that Colin
Thatcher had been in Moose Jaw and at his ranch the evening of January 21,
1983, the day of the murder.

 

                                                                             V

 

The
Charge and the Verdict

 

53               In
his charge to the jury, despite objection from counsel for the defence, the
trial judge indicated to the jury the following direction on potential
culpability:

 

At
the outset I should explain to you that there are two ways in which the offence
of murder could have been committed by this accused. If you find on the
evidence and are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Colin Thatcher did
that act or actions himself that caused the death of JoAnn Wilson, it is open
to you to find him guilty of murder. Alternatively, if you find that acts done
or performed by the accused resulted in the death of JoAnn Wilson and were done
with the intent that they cause her death, even though the actual killing was
done by another or others, it is open to you to find this accused guilty of
murder.

 

54               The
trial judge also referred the jury to s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code  and
further commented:

 

Colin
Thatcher is charged with committing the offence of murder. If you do not find
that he did the act of murder himself, he is equally guilty if you find and are
satisfied that he either aided or abetted another or others in its commission. 

 

During
the charge, the trial judge alluded to the argument of defence counsel that if
the jury accepted the evidence of even one of the witnesses who said he was in
Moose Jaw at the time of the murder, Thatcher could not have committed the
murder. Counsel also told the jury that as the Crown had not produced any
evidence that anyone else killed JoAnn Wilson it was the duty of the jury to
find him not guilty. The trial judge said:

 

With
respect, I am unable to agree with this argument. I tell you as a matter of law
that the fact that the Crown cannot adduce evidence that another individual or
individuals actually did the act, does not preclude you from finding that the
killing was done on behalf of Colin Thatcher and it is still open to you to
return a finding of guilty of murder if you so find.

 

The
judge left the jury with three possible verdicts: not guilty, guilty of first
degree murder, or guilty of second degree murder. The jury deliberated from
Friday, November 2, 1984 through until Tuesday, November 6, 1984 before
returning the verdict of guilty of the offence of first degree murder contrary
to s. 218  of the Criminal Code .

 

                                                                            VI

 

The
Court of Appeal

 

55               The
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, [1986] 2 W.W.R. 97. Hall
J.A. was of the opinion that no error of law had been shown that would justify
the Court of Appeal setting aside the conviction. The charge to the jury, when
read as a whole, was fair and correct. Hall J.A., at p. 105, held that:

 

The
direction of the trial judge to the jury, when reduced to its essence, was that
if they found beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant either killed the
deceased himself or caused someone else to kill her, they should find him
guilty as charged. Against the background of the evidence adduced that was all
that was necessary to properly place the issue before the jury.

 

and:

 

                   In
my opinion, it would have been most unreasonable for the jury to have reached
any verdict other than it did. It is not a case where it is necessary to
consider the curative provisions of Criminal Code  contained in s. 613 .

 

56               Tallis
J.A. delivered a more lengthy judgment dismissing the appeal, in which Bayda
C.J.S. and Brownridge J.A. concurred. He found the situation in this case
somewhat analogous to R. v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 124, where this
Court stated, at p. 139:

 

Murder,
like other offences in the Criminal Code , such as theft, may be
committed in one of several ways. Culpable homicide may be murder under either
s. 212  or s. 213 . Both sections begin with the words ""Culpable homicide is
murder where"". Farrant was charged with murder. He might fall foul of
either section. There was evidence upon which the jury could find a forcible
confinement, and the trial judge was correct in stating that, as a matter of
law, he was obliged to put both s. 212  and 213  to the jury.

 

Tallis
J.A. also adopted the reasoning of Martin J.A. in R. v. Sparrow (1979),
51 C.C.C. (2d) 443 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 458, quoted with favour by McIntyre J. in
R. v. Isaac, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 74, at p. 81:

 

I
am of the view that it is also appropriate, where an accused is being tried
alone and there is evidence that more than one person was involved in the
commission of the offence, to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of
s. 21 of the Code, even though the identity of the other participant or
participants is unknown, and even though the precise part played by each
participant may be uncertain.

 

Tallis
J.A., at p. 167, held there was evidence on which the alternative theory of
criminal liability could have been placed before the jury for their
consideration:

 

If
the jury concluded, in the light of the description of the person at the scene,
that the appellant was not the actual killer, it was still open to them to find
that he was a party to the killing. A brief reference to some of the direct and
circumstantial evidence shows that a basis did exist for a juror to have
concluded that the actual killing was committed by someone else while the
appellant was at his home in Moose Jaw, but that the appellant had been
instrumental in the killing. 

 

With
respect to the argument that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury that they must be unanimous in the way in which the murder was committed,
Tallis J.A. observed, as a starting point, that this Court found no error in
the charge in R. v. Farrant. In that case, although the trial judge
directed the jury on alternate ways or means by which the Crown could prove
murder beyond a reasonable doubt, he did not direct the jury that they must be
unanimous as to the ways or means by which the murder was committed.

 

57               Tallis
J.A. concluded that the jury members were entitled to reach a unanimous verdict
by separate paths of reasoning and that the trial judge was not obliged to
direct the jury on unanimity in the manner contended for by counsel for Mr.
Thatcher. Tallis J.A. referred to passages from ""Alternative Elements and
Included Offences"" by Glanville Williams, [1984] C.L.J. 290, at pp.
291‑92; R. v. Tuckey (1985), 46 C.R. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
Bouvier (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 264‑65. On the
contention that the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported by the
evidence, Tallis J.A., at p. 183, said:

 

It
may fairly be inferred that the jury accepted the Crown evidence that the
appellant was involved either directly or indirectly in the killing of his
former wife. In so doing, it is clear they rejected the appellant's contention
that he was not criminally involved in the killing, and were satisfied the
Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. There was overwhelming
evidence before the jury to support their verdict. Accordingly this ground of
appeal must fail.

 

58               Vancise
J.A. wrote in dissent. He would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial
but, at p. 197, having reviewed the evidence in detail, he concluded:

 

There
is evidence which if believed, would indicate that the appellant killed or
caused the death of JoAnn Wilson.

 

He
went on, at p. 197, to say:

 

                   The
appellant denied killing his wife or causing her death. He testified at great
length and explained the comments made by Lynn Mendell with respect to
statements allegedly attributed to him, as well as the comments made by
Anderson. If those comments were believed by the jury, there was doubt,
reasonable doubt which would have resulted in his acquittal.

 

Vancise
J.A. was of the opinion the trial judge was wrong in putting s. 21  to the jury
and even if not in error in putting s. 21  to the jury, he erred in the manner
in which he instructed them on its application. He said, at p. 205:

 

                   In
my opinion, it was essential for the trial judge to instruct the jury on the
application of s. 21  to the facts in this case by dealing with the following
matters: the identity of the person seen leaving the Wilson garage; the
identity of the person in the car observed in the vicinity of the Wilson
residence; the fact that the car was assigned to the appellant; the import of
the credit card receipt; any evidence which connected the appellant to an
unknown killer; and, more importantly, the defence witnesses who placed the
appellant at home at the time of the murder. By failing to deal with the
evidence in that manner, the charge was confusing, particularly in light of the
Crown's emphasis on the appellant's guilt as principal and not as an aider and
abetter. When one couples that with the statement of the trial judge, that the
failure of the Crown to adduce evidence that another individual actually did
the act would not preclude the jury from finding that the killing was done on
behalf of the appellant was, an invitation to the jury to find, in the absence
of evidence that there was another person acting together with the appellant,
that the appellant could be an aider and abetter to the offence. Such
nondirection, in my opinion, amounts to misdirection.

 

With
respect to the contention that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury that they were required to be unanimous with respect to the guilt of
Thatcher as principal simpliciter or as an aider or abettor of the
offence, Vancise J.A., at p. 207, held:

 

                   Here
the offence could be committed by the appellant as principal or as a party as
defined by s. 21 of the Code. The appellant was charged with a single offence
carrying a single conviction and the jury need not agree on any particular way
in which the offence was committed. This ground of appeal fails.

 

Vancise
J.A. did not think the trial judge gave a fair picture of the defence. In his
view the defence of alibi was not treated fairly. The trial judge's handling of
the evidence of one of the witnesses, Mr. Merchant, and the perfunctory manner
in which he dealt with remaining defence evidence was, as I have indicated, in the
opinion of Vancise J.A., tantamount to withdrawing the fact finding function
from the jury. Another flaw, in the view of Vancise J.A., was that the jury
members were instructed to determine which of two conflicting versions of
evidence they would accept. They were instructed to accept one and reject the
other. This, in his view, constituted an error in law. 

 

                                                                            VII

 

The
Issues Before this Court

 

59               The
issues can be stated as follows:

 

(i)                No
Evidence to Support Crown's Alternate Theory

 

Was
there an evidentiary foundation to justify putting to the jury the Crown's
alternate theory of the case that Thatcher was a party to the offence under s.
21 , rather than a principal?

 

(ii)               Failure
to Relate Law to the Facts Regarding the Crown's           Alternative Theory

 

Even
if there was sufficient evidence, did the trial judge fail to instruct the jury
adequately on the application of the legal principles of s. 21  to the evidence
in the case?

 

(iii)               Jury
Unanimity as to the Material Facts

 

Did
the trial judge err by failing to instruct the jury that it had to be unanimous
in relation to either whether Thatcher personally killed the victim or whether
he aided and abetted another person to kill the victim?

 

(iv)              The
Nadeau Issue

 

Did
the trial judge err in putting the jurors to a choice between accepting the
evidence of some witnesses or accepting the evidence of Thatcher, thereby
reducing the burden of proof? Can such an error be cured by s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code ?

 

(v)               Unfair
Jury Charge

 

Did
the trial judge adequately summarize the evidence or the theory of the defence?

 

60               I
propose to deal with each of these issues in the above order. Before doing so,
I should again point out that the primary theory of the Crown was that Thatcher
personally killed JoAnn Wilson though it wished to leave open the possibility
that Thatcher may have committed the murder indirectly, by hiring someone else
to perform the physical act of killing. The trial judge, in charging the jury,
rightly gave far more emphasis to the Crown's primary theory.

 

(i)                No
Evidence to Support the Crown's Alternate Theory

 

61               There
is no merit whatsoever to this ground of appeal. At page 167 of his judgment,
Tallis J.A. cites the following evidence:

 

(i) The
jury could have inferred that the person in the car watching the Wilson
residence in the days before the murder was someone other than the appellant,
but that the car, which was identified as one checked out to the appellant, had
been supplied to this person by the appellant.

 

(ii) The
evidence of witnesses such as Collver, Mendell, Anderson and Wilde, indicated
not only that the appellant had a motive for such a killing, but that he had
been interested in hiring or getting someone else to do the actual shooting.

 

(iii) The
calibre and type of bullet found in the skull of the deceased were consistent
with the use of the appellant's .357 Ruger revolver in the shooting.

 

(iv) Anderson's
evidence that he delivered a car and the revolver on the day of the murder
support either theory.

 

62               In
addition to the above, there is the evidence of witness Dotson regarding an
individual leaving the scene of the crime at about the time of the crime. There
is also the evidence on the tape, which, if Thatcher's explanations are not
believed, are consistent with Thatcher having procured the death of his wife.
And, of course, there is the alibi evidence of Hammond, Wright, Silversides and
the Thatcher boys, which, if accepted at all, is consistent with the Crown's
alternate theory. 

 

63               In
short, there is very strong evidence, particularly in relation to the murder
weapon and the appellant's desire to kill his ex‑wife, connecting
Thatcher with the crime. There is some evidence which, if believed, points to
his not having committed the crime personally. The facts are for the jury, and
the trial judge was correct not to preclude the jury from considering all the
alternatives. There is, of course, no burden on the Crown to point to a
specific, identified person as the personal assailant of the victim. The trial
judge was cognizant of this fact and he rightly instructed the jury in the
following way:

 

It
is not your concern whether some other person or persons have neither been
charged or found guilty of the offence of murder. Nor is it your concern
whether or not the person who actually committed the crime is known. If you are
satisfied from the evidence that JoAnn Thatcher was murdered and that this
accused aided or abetted in the commission of the murder, it is open to you to
find him guilty of murder. But again if the Crown has failed to satisfy you
that Colin Thatcher either committed the murder or that someone else did so,
aided and abetted by Colin Thatcher, then you must give him the benefit of the
doubt and find him not guilty.

 

In
my view, the case meets the requirements set out by Martin J.A. in R. v.
Sparrow, supra, at p. 458 (approved by McIntyre J. in R. v. Isaac,
supra):

 

I
am of the view that it is also appropriate, where an accused is being tried
alone and there is evidence that more than one person was involved in the
commission of the offence, to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of
s. 21 of the Code, even though the identity of the other participant or
participants is unknown, and even though the precise part played by each
participant may be uncertain. It is, in my view, however, improper to charge
the jury with respect to the liability of the accused as a party under s. 21 
where there is no evidence proper to be left with the jury that more than one
person was actually involved in the commission of the offence.

 

Since
there was such evidence, the trial judge's direction concerning s. 21 of the Code
was perfectly proper.

 

(ii)               Failure
to Relate the Law to the Facts Regarding the               Crown's Alternative
Theory

 

64               The
trial judge read the contents of s. 21(1)  to the jury and referred, correctly,
to what was meant by the term ""aiding"" or ""abetting"":
""intentional encouragement or assistance in the commission of the
offence"". As stated, he pointed out that the actual perpetrator need not
be identified. He thus accurately stated the law as to s. 21(1) .

 

65               Instead
of carving his jury charge into discrete sections in which he reviewed the
evidence consistent with Thatcher having personally committed the murder,
Thatcher having committed the murder by means of s. 21(1) , and, finally,
Thatcher not having committed the murder at all, the trial judge simply went
through the evidence of each witness in turn. I do not think he was wrong in
this. Much of the Crown evidence was consistent with either Crown
theory, and much of the defence evidence was consistent with either Thatcher's
innocence or his guilt under s. 21(1) . It is not incumbent on a trial judge to
go through the evidence in a repetitive fashion which could only have bored the
jury. Nor do I think we should assume jurors are so unintelligent that they
will fail to see the obvious: the presence of a government car at the home of
the victim, when combined with evidence suggesting that the man in the car was
not Thatcher, may point to Thatcher's having aided and abetted; and surely they
can discern that the alibi evidence, if believed, when combined with the murder
weapon evidence, may point to a similar conclusion.

 

66               Furthermore,
it is obvious that the two Crown theories are not legally different
views of what happened. The whole point of s. 21(1)  is to put an aider or
abettor on the same footing as the principal. To stress the difference between
the Crown theories might leave a jury with the erroneous impression that it is
vital for the jurors to decide individually and collectively which way the
victim was killed. But the correctness of this point hinges on issue (iii),
below, and I will pursue it in that context.

 

(iii)               Jury
Unanimity as to the Material Facts

 

67               This
is the most difficult issue presented by the case. I have noted that as there
was no dissent on the point in the Court of Appeal, leave of this Court was
required and was granted.

 

68               I
begin my analysis of this issue by quoting s. 21(1)  of the Criminal
Code :

 

                   21. (1) Every
one is a party to an offence who

 

                   (a) actually
commits it,

 

                   (b) does
or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

 

                   (c) abets
any person in committing it. 

 

This
provision is designed to make the difference between aiding and abetting and
personally committing an offence legally irrelevant. It provides that either
mode of committing an offence is equally culpable and, indeed, that whether a
person personally commits or only aids and abets, he is guilty of that
offence, in this case, causing the death of JoAnn Wilson, and not some separate
distinct offence. This is in contrast with the provisions of the Code
relating to accessories after the fact or conspirators (ss. 421 and 423) which
create distinct offences for involvement falling short of personal commission.

 

69               In
Chow Bew v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 124, Locke J. (Taschereau and
Fauteux JJ. concurring) explained the effect of the predecessor provision to s.
21  at pp. 126‑27:

 

                   The
first sentence of s. 69 provides, inter alia, that every one is a party
to and guilty of an offence who actually commits it, or does or omits an act
for the purpose of aiding any person to commit the offence, or abets any person
in committing it. This section appeared as s. 61 when the Code was first
enacted in 1892.

 

                   As
it affects the present case, the matter is thus stated in the 10th Edition of Russell
on Crime, at p. 1853, as follows:

 

                   Thus
where several persons are together for the purpose of committing a breach of
the peace, assaulting persons who pass, and while acting together in that
common object, a fatal blow is given, it is immaterial which struck the blow,
for the blow given under such circumstances is in point of law the blow of all,
and it is unnecessary to prove which struck the blow.

 

                   There
was evidence in the present matter from which a jury might properly draw the
inference that the appellant and Cathro had meant to inflict grievous bodily injury
to Ah Wing and had aided and abetted each other in doing so for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of the offence of robbery and that his death had
resulted. If the jury chose to draw this inference, the offence was murder as
defined by s. 260, whether they or either of them meant that death should ensue
or knew that death was likely to ensue. In such circumstances, it would be a
matter of indifference which of the two struck the fatal blow or inflicted the
fatal injury, since each would be liable in law for the act of the other.

 

Locke
J.'s discussion points to one of the principal policy arguments for not
requiring jury unanimity as to which of the subsections of s. 21  grounds the
criminal liability of a particular accused: it would otherwise be open to co‑accused
to escape conviction by imbuing members of a jury with doubt as to which of the
co‑accused physically performed the criminal act, even if the jurors
entertained no doubt that any individual co‑accused either personally
committed the crime or else aided and abetted in its commission. This policy
concern was recognized long ago by Pollock C.B. in R. v. Swindall and
Osborne (1846), 2 Car. & K. 230, 175 E.R. 95, a case which predated the
abolition of the distinction between principals and accomplices.

 

70               The
Court canvassed the authorities in considerable detail in R. v. Harder,
[1956] S.C.R. 489, and articulated the proposition that it was unnecessary for
the Crown to specify in an indictment that an accused was being charged as a
party rather than as a principal simpliciter. Rand J. at p. 498 refers
to an old English case, R. v. Folkes and Ludds (1832), 1 Mood. 354, 168
E.R. 1301, in which, upon Rand J.'s view of the case, the judges held that a
defendant could be convicted by a jury on a count of having feloniously
ravished the prosecutrix ""either on the evidence going to the ravishment
or that going to his secondary role as abettor"". Kellock J. referred with
approval at pp. 500‑01 to the following passage from Sir Henri
Elzéar Taschereau's work on the Criminal Code :

 

                   The
prosecutor may, at his option, prefer an indictment against the accessories
before the fact, and aiders and abettors as principal offenders, whether the
party who actually committed the offence is indicted with them or not; R. v.
Tracey, 6 Mod. 30. For instance: A. abetted in the commission of a theft by
B. The indictment may charge A. and B. jointly or A. or B. alone as guilty of
the offence, in the ordinary form, as if they had actually stolen by one and
the same act....

 

                   In
every case where there may be a doubt whether a person be a principal or
accessory before the fact, it may be advisable to prefer the indictment against
him as a principal, as such an indictment will be sufficient whether it turn
out on the evidence that such person was a principal or accessory before the
fact, as well as where it is clear that he was either the one or the other but
it is uncertain which he was. [Emphasis added.]

 

To
the same effect, Kellock J. cites passages from Russell on Crime (10th
ed. 1950) and Archbold's Pleading, Evidence & Practice in Criminal Cases
(33rd ed. 1954).

 

71               I
should perhaps note that the old common law authorities stand for the
proposition that an indictment may charge all who are present and abet
the act as principals in the first degree. As Fauteux J. states in Harder,
at p. 492: 

 

                   At
common law, the actor or actual perpetrator of the fact and those who are,
actually or constructively, present at the commission of the offence and aid
and abet its commission, are distinguished as being respectively principal in
the first degree and principals in the second degree; yet, in all felonies in
which the punishment of the principal in the first degree and of the principals
in the second degree is the same, the indictment may charge all who are present
and abet as principals in the first degree.

 

Thus,
the common law generally drew no distinction between a principal in the first
degree (someone who actually committed the offence) and a principal in the
second degree (someone who was actually or constructively present but who only
aided and abetted in the commission of the offence) for the purposes of
indictment. The upshot of this rule was stated in East, Pleas of the Crown
(1803), vol. 1, at p. 350: ""the blow of one is, in law, the blow of
all"". The common law did, however, draw a distinction between principals
and accessories. Accessories were those who conspired with the principal in the
first degree or who aided and abetted him but were neither actually nor
constructively present at the scene of the crime. See R. v. Smith
(1876), 38 U.C.Q.B. 218, at pp. 227‑28. Thus, if Thatcher aided and
abetted, rather than personally committed, I do not think it is contended that
he was necessarily physically present at the murder. Therefore, his case might
well not fall within the old common law rule permitting one charge but two
different possible modes of participation in the offence. But this is precisely
the distinction that disappeared when Parliament abolished the common law
distinction between principals and accessories. As Fauteux J. states in Harder,
at p. 493, in relation to s. 21 's predecessor:

 

This
Imperial statute [24 & 25 Vict. c. 94], later adopted into Canadian law
(R.S.C. 1886, c. 145) practically brought to an end the distinctions between
accessories before the fact and principals in the second degree.

 

                   By
the enactment of section 61, the predecessor of section 69, these distinctions
in the substantive law entirely disappeared from our criminal laws when
codified in 1892. With them, of course, also disappeared, because being made no
longer necessary, the relevant adjective rules related to the framing of the
indictment of such persons who, not actually committing the offence charged,
were then made, by statute, principals and equally party to, guilty of and
punishable for the offence as if actually committed by them. It is unthinkable
that, getting rid of the difficulties arising out of these prior distinctions,
Parliament would, in the same breath, have created new ones by refusing to the
Crown the right to indict‑‑which right it had before, under common
and statutory law‑‑as principal simpliciter, either as a principal
in the second degree or an accessory before the fact, and this, under the
regime of this new law holding each and all particeps criminis as being
nothing less than principals.

 

72               Thus,
s. 21 has been designed to alleviate the necessity for the Crown choosing
between two different forms of participation in a criminal offence. The law
stipulates that both forms of participation are not only equally culpable, but
should be treated as one single mode of incurring criminal liability. The Crown
is not under a duty to separate the different forms of participation in a
criminal offence into different counts. Obviously, if the charge against
Thatcher had been separated into different counts, he might well have been
acquitted on each count notwithstanding that each and every juror was certain
beyond a reasonable doubt either that Thatcher personally killed his ex‑wife
or that he aided and abetted someone else who killed his ex‑wife. This is
precisely what s. 21 is designed to prevent.

 

73               In
sum, this Court has held that it is no longer necessary to specify in the
charge the nature of an accused's participation in the offence: Harder.
Moreover, if there is evidence before a jury that points to an accused either
committing a crime personally or, alternatively, aiding and abetting another to
commit the offence, provided the jury is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the accused did one or the other, it is ""a matter of
indifference"" which alternative actually occurred: Chow Bew. It
follows, in my view, that s. 21 precludes a requirement of jury unanimity as to
the particular nature of the accused's participation in the offence. Why should
the juror be compelled to make a choice on a subject which is a matter of legal
indifference?

 

74               This
conclusion, however, is said by the appellant to run counter to a recent
decision of the English Court of Appeal, R. v. Brown (1984), 79 Cr. App.
R. 115, to which I now turn. In R. v. Brown, the appellant was charged
with fraudulently inducing investments, contrary to s. 13(1)(a) of the Prevention
of Fraud (Investments) Act, 1958 (U.K.), 6 & 7 Eliz. 2, c. 45, which
provides the following:

 

                   13.‑‑(1) Any
person who, by any statement, promise or forecast which he knows to be
misleading, false or deceptive...induces or attempts to induce another person‑‑

 

                   (a) to
enter into or offer to enter into ‑‑

 

(i)
any agreement for, or with a view to, acquiring, disposing of, subscribing for
or underwriting securities...shall be guilty of an offence....

 

More
specifically, the Crown alleged that the appellant had fraudulently induced
four persons to enter into agreements for acquiring shares in a company,
knowing the agreements to be misleading. Each count with which he was charged
contained particulars of a number of different statements relied on by the
prosecution as constituting the inducement referred to in s. 13(1)(a) of
the Act. 

 

75               The
jury asked the judge two questions. The first was whether the defendant would
be guilty on a whole count if he was found guilty of only one part of that
count. The second was whether the defendant was guilty on the whole count and the
verdict unanimous if individual members found him guilty of different parts of
the count. With respect to the first question, the trial judge is said by
Eveleigh L.J. of the Court of Appeal, at p. 117, to have responded:

 

...if
you are satisfied that, with the necessary state of mind, the defendant made
the statements or representations which are alleged in the indictment in
relation to each count, it is sufficient if you find that he made one or some
or all of them but you do not have to find that he made them all.

 

With
respect to the second, more relevant, question, he stated:

 

Members
of the jury, the answer to that is this: what you have to be satisfied of in
relation to each of the counts is that the defendant dishonestly made the
statements and by making them induced the victim concerned to act in the way
set out in the count.

 

...It
does not matter that some of you are satisfied that one of the various
statements is made out, and others of you are satisfied not about that
statement being made out but that another is made out. It is sufficient if you
are all agreed that there was a dishonest inducement. So if you find some of
you are satisfied that representation A was made out, some of you are not
satisfied about that but are satisfied that representation B was made out, then
it does not matter, provided that you are all satisfied that there was the
dishonest inducement made and that it operated upon the mind of the person to
whom it was made and caused him to act in the way that he did.

 

76               The
Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred by not informing the jury
that it must be agreed that every single ingredient necessary to constitute the
offence has been established. Eveleigh L.J., at p. 119, stated:

 

                   In
a case such as that with which we are now dealing, the following principles
apply: 1. Each ingredient of the offence must be proved to the satisfaction of
each and every member of the jury .... 2. However, where a number of matters
are specified in the charge as together constituting one ingredient in the
offence, and any one of them is capable of doing so, then it is enough to
establish the ingredient that any one of them is proved; but (because of the
first principle above) any such matter must be proved to the satisfaction of
the whole jury. The jury should be directed accordingly, and it should be made
clear to them as well that they should all be satisfied that the statement upon
which they are agreed was an inducement as alleged.

 

77               The
appellant, relying on a recent article by Mark A. Gelowitz entitled ""The Thatcher
Appeal: A Question of Unanimity"" (1986), 49 C.R. (3d) 129, argues that
just as in Brown, where the English Court of Appeal held that ""each
ingredient of the offence must be proved to the satisfaction of each and every
member of the jury,"" this Court ought to hold that the nature of
Thatcher's participation must be proved to each and every juror before he can
be convicted of ""unlawfully causing"" JoAnn Wilson's death.

 

78               The
appellant accepts, as any reasonable person must, that the jurors need not be
unanimous with respect to their acceptance or rejection of each individual
piece of evidence. In a long, complicated trial it is absurd to suppose that
twelve people could form the same opinion of each item of evidence, and it is
absurd to suppose that the Crown could ever prove or explain beyond a
reasonable doubt every detail of a murder. A defendant at a murder trial should
obviously not be acquitted if some jurors think a .38 calibre bullet was used
and others think that a .357 calibre bullet was used. The appellant submits,
however, that the jurors ought to be unanimous as to the ""material
facts"" making out the offence. He does not provide a definition of
""material facts"", except to rely on Mr. Gelowitz for the proposition
that jurors must be ""in substantial agreement as to just what an accused
has done"". This argument, however, overlooks the whole point of s. 21, as
I have said, which makes the distinction between principals and aiders and
abettors legally irrelevant.

 

79               Moreover,
if Brown is correct, and this need not be decided in the present appeal,
I am far from convinced that it lays down a proposition as sweeping as the
appellant suggests. Eveleigh L.J. acknowledged that jurors could arrive at
their conclusions by different routes. Jurors ""may be able to say that,
whichever way one looks at it, the case is proved"". To be sure, Eveleigh
L.J. also articulated the propositions referred to previously. But, in my
opinion, s. 21 does not create ""ingredients"" in the offence of
murder, in the same way that each particular ""misrepresentation"" was
an ingredient in the offence of Brown. As I read Eveleigh L.J.'s
remarks, his second proposition is restricted to cases in which ""a number
of matters are specific in the charge"". This would be analogous to the
case when there were several counts in an indictment. If Thatcher had been
charged on two counts, of course unanimity would be required in respect of any
count for which he is convicted. Such a conclusion flows from the proposition
that a verdict stands for guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt, of that for which
the accused has been charged. In the present case, Thatcher was charged that he
did ""unlawfully cause the death of JoAnn Kay Wilson and did thereby commit
first degree murder"". The charge was carefully worded, and there is no
injustice in his conviction on the indictment irrespective of whether the
jurors shared the same view as to the most likely manner in which Thatcher
committed the murder. 

 

80               When
one considers the implications of the appellant's submission, it becomes even
clearer that it is without merit. In the present case there were doubtless
three alternatives in the minds of each of the jurors:

 

(a)               Thatcher personally killed his ex‑wife;

 

(b)               he aided and abetted someone else
to do so;

 

(c)               he is innocent of the crime.

 

81               The
jurors were told that if any of them had a reasonable doubt regarding (c),
Thatcher should be acquitted. Every single juror was, evidently, solidly
convinced that (c) was simply not what occurred. Each one was certain that the
true state of affairs was (a) or (b). Even if we suppose, as the appellant
would have us do, that the jurors individually went beyond thinking in terms of
(a) or (b) and specifically opted for one theory, and that some jurors thought
only (a) could have occurred and others thought only (b) could have occurred, I
am far from convinced that there would have been any injustice from convicting
Thatcher. As stated, there is no legal difference between the two. Much is made
of the fact that (a) and (b) are factually inconsistent theories, in the
sense that evidence proving (a) tends to disprove (b). But this is really only
true of one category of evidence, namely identification and alibi evidence. The
overwhelming mass of evidence against Thatcher was consistent with either
theory. In particular, the evidence tracing the murder weapon to Thatcher was
highly probative, as were his statements to various witnesses (prior to the
murder) of his intention to kill JoAnn Wilson, and his statement to Lynn
Mendell (after the murder) that he had ""blown away"" his wife.

 

82               The
appellant's suggestion would fail to achieve justice in a significant number of
cases. Suppose the evidence in a case is absolutely crystal clear that when X
and Y entered Z's house, Z was alive, and when X and Y left, Z was dead.
Suppose that in their evidence each of X and Y says that the other of them
murdered Z but each admits to having aided and abetted. Are X and Y each to be
acquitted if some of the jurors differ as to which of X and Y actually
committed the offence? I can see absolutely no reason in policy or law to
uphold such an egregious conclusion. The appellant's submission ignores the
very reason why Parliament abolished the old common law distinctions: namely,
they permitted guilty persons to go free. As Professor Peter MacKinnon points
out in, ""Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowitz and Stuart"" (1986), 51
C.R. (3d) 134, at p. 135, if an accused is to be acquitted in situations when
every juror is convinced that the accused committed a murder in one of two
ways, merely because the jury cannot agree on which of the two ways,
""it is difficult to imagine a situation more likely to bring the
administration of justice into disrepute ‑‑ and deservedly
so.""

 

(iv) The
Nadeau Issue

 

83               The
appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in putting the jurors to a
choice between accepting the evidence of some witnesses or accepting the
evidence of Thatcher, thereby reducing the burden of proof. This submission is
based on this Court's decision in Nadeau v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
570, where Lamer J., at pp. 572‑73, states:

 

The
accused benefits from any reasonable doubt at the outset, not merely if `the
two (2) versions are equally consistent with the evidence, are equally valid'.
Moreover the jury does not have to choose between two versions. It is not
because they would not believe the accused that they would then have to agree
with Landry's version. The jurors cannot accept his version, or any part of it,
unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, having regard to all the
evidence, that the events took place in this manner; otherwise the accused is
entitled, unless a fact has been established beyond a reasonable doubt, to the
finding of fact the most favourable to him, provided of course that it is based
on evidence in the record and not mere speculation.

 

84               The
trial judge, during his charge to the jury, made specific references to the
conflict between the evidence given by Thatcher, and that of An­derson, Mendell
and Collver. He stated the following:

 

                   The
final witness for the defence was the accused, Colin Thatcher. Both his
examination‑in‑chief and cross‑examination were very lengthy.
I have been talking almost too long as it is and I do not propose to review his
evidence in detail. Much of it related to the tape recording to which he
admitted he was a party and you will determine whether you accept his version
of the meaning to be attributed to the conversation he had with Gary Anderson.

 

                   Thatcher
denies that he had anything to do with either of the two shootings of his wife
and you will weigh his testimony against the other evidence before you and
particularly I suggest against the evidence of Lynn Mendell and Anderson and
Wilde.

 

                   The
evidence of Thatcher is also in direct contradiction to that of Dick Collver
with respect to the hiring of the hit man and it will be up to you to decide
whose evidence you accept.

 

The
Crown, quite properly, concedes that the passage, if it stood alone, would be
bad in law as violating the principle in Nadeau. It submits, however,
that such remarks have to be looked at in their context within the whole of the
charge to the jury. More specifically, the Crown argues that the charge as a
whole made it clear that the jury was not obliged to take a binary view of the
evidence (accept or reject it) but had to give effect to reasonable doubt. 

 

85               By
my count, the trial judge correctly stated the reasonable doubt principle on at
least eleven occasions during his charge to the jury. One such occasion was
directly preceding the offending passages relied upon by the appellant. He
said:

 

                   I
must tell you that as a matter of law that it is not incumbent upon the accused
to adduce evidence to satisfy you that an alibi has been proven. If evidence as
to alibi raises a reasonable doubt as to the presence of Thatcher at the scene
when the murder was committed, you must give him the benefit of that doubt and
conclude he was not there.

 

Moreover,
early on in his charge he stated:

 

It
is up to you to weigh the evidence of each witness, one against the
other, and determine what you find to be true and reject what you
do not believe. [Emphasis added.]

 

When
the offending passages are read with the above and subsequent admonitions, it
is clear‑‑and, I believe, must have been clear to the jury‑‑that
the trial judge means ""accept beyond a reasonable doubt"" when he
refers to ""accepting"" Crown evidence, and means ""accept as
raising a reasonable doubt"" when he refers to ""accepting""
defence evidence. I believe there was no error made when the charge is read as
a whole. It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the Crown's submissions with
respect to s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.

 

(v) Unfair
Jury Charge

 

86               The
gist of the complaint is that the trial judge revealed to the jurors his own
perception of the accused's guilt, through undue emphasis on the Crown's
evidence and inadequate summary of the defence. The defence evidence was
simple, however, and the Crown's case was complex, relying on circumstantial
evidence from a large number of witnesses. It is simply inappropriate to try to
measure the fairness of the charge by reference to quantity.

 

87               Although
there were a few unfortunate expressions used by the trial judge, a juror would
have to read in a lot to surmise that the trial judge thought Thatcher guilty
or his witnesses generally not credible, with the possible exception of Mr.
Merchant. It should be noted in this respect that at the outset of his charge
the trial judge was clear as to the respective duties of the judge and jury. He
stated:

 

                   Your
duty as jurors is to determine the guilt or innocence of this accused from the
evidence that's been placed before you. This is not a light duty because if a
crime has been committed, in this case, the murder of a female individual, it
is your obligation to so find. Likewise you have a duty to this accused to see
that he is not improperly convicted.

 

                   Your
functions and mine are separate and distinct. You are the sole arbiters of the
facts. In that area you are supreme. It is your duty and your responsibility
and yours alone to decide those facts in accordance with the oaths you took at
the outset of the trial. If I express an opinion with respect to the evidence,
and I probably will, you are free to disregard my opinion for that is your
field and you make the findings of fact in accordance with your individual
conscience.

 

88               Moreover,
the jury was instructed that it could obtain clarification or a review of any
or all of the evidence presented at trial. On the second day of their
deliberations, after requesting information the previous evening, the jury
reviewed portions of the evidence given by numerous witnesses, including
Thatcher himself. In my view, the trial judge gave a fair picture of the
defence. As Lord Goddard C.J., in R. v. Clayton‑Wright (1948), 33
Cr. App. R. 22, at p. 29, states, a trial judge is not required ""to paint
in the details or to comment on every argument which has been used or to remind
them of the whole of the evidence"". The jury deliberated for approximately
four days. They returned a verdict of guilty. In my opinion, the charge of the
trial judge cannot be read as unfair. I may add that I think there is some
merit to the Crown's argument that Thatcher would not have benefited from a
more thorough review of the defence evidence.

 

89               I
would dismiss the appeal. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

90               Lamer J.‑‑I
agree with the Chief Justice's reasons and disposition of this appeal. I
should, however, qualify my concurrence in those of his reasons addressing the
ground he refers to as ""Jury Unanimity as to the Material Facts"".

 

91               I
agree with the Chief Justice that the jury unanimity point fails. I would
suggest, however, that it fails because of the nature of the evidence in this
case. It is true that the Crown presented two factually inconsistent theories:
that the appellant actually killed the deceased or that he aided and abetted
the killer. The overwhelming mass of the evidence against the appellant,
however, was consistent with both theories and pointed only to his
participation in the murder. The jury could not have been convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt of one theory to the exclusion of the other, but must have
been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant participated in the
murder, either as principal or aider and abettor. Since, as the Chief Justice
points out, s. 21(1)  of the Criminal Code  makes the distinction between
participation as a principal and participation as aider and abettor legally
irrelevant, it was not necessary for the jury to decide on the form of his
participation and the jury was correct in convicting. As Peter MacKinnon wrote
in ""Jury Unanimity: A Reply to Gelowitz and Stuart"" (1986), 51 C.R.
(3d) 134, at p. 137:

 

If,
as their deliberations progress, the jurors, though not in agreement in their
assessment of the probable type of involvement, are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the only possible types of involvement establish
guilt, they should convict.

 

92               However,
I am not prepared to go so far as the Chief Justice's unqualified assertion
that ""s. 21 precludes a requirement of jury unanimity as to the particular
nature of the accused's participation in the offence."" Depending on the
nature of the evidence presented by the Crown, the jury unanimity issue may
arise in any case where the Crown alleges factually inconsistent theories, even
if those theories relate to the particular nature of the accused's
participation in the offence. If the Crown presents evidence which tends to
inculpate the accused under one theory and exculpate him under the other, then
the trial judge must instruct the jury that if they wish to rely on such
evidence, then they must be unanimous as to the theory they adopt. Otherwise,
the evidence will be taken into account by some jurors to convict the accused
under one theory while the fact that the evidence exculpates the accused under
the other theory is being disregarded by the other jurors who are taking the
latter route. In effect, the jury would be adding against the accused the
inculpatory elements of evidence which cannot stand together because they are
inconsistent. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

93               La Forest J.‑‑I
am in general agreement with the reasons of the Chief Justice. I have some
concerns, not addressed by him, however, that I would wish to underline.

 

94               The
essential point in this case is that although alternative theories of
culpability were advanced by the Crown, there were ample grounds for the jury
to find Thatcher guilty beyond a reasonable doubt while remaining unsure
whether he had committed the murder himself or through another person. There
may, however, be cases where the interrelationship between competing Crown
theories and the evidence adduced in relation thereto will not justify a
verdict of guilt. In each case, therefore, it will be for the trial judge,
having regard to the nature of the offence, the theories of the parties, and
the totality of the evidence, to realistically assess the possibility that the
evidence will be used improperly, and to direct the jury accordingly. Suffice
it to say, however, the present is not such a case.

 

95               I
would also add that, in my view, s. 21  of the Criminal Code  is not
unique in this regard. Rather, it is merely one example of a situation where
the Crown is relying on alternative theories of culpability to found an
accused's guilt. The fact that s. 21  makes the particular nature of the accused's
involvement in an offence legally irrelevant does not, in my view, in and of
itself justify conviction on the basis of mutually exclusive or alternative
theories of culpability. Were it otherwise, concerns would be raised
dangerously akin to those flowing from multiplicious counts. Concerns about
multiplicity of counts and jury unanimity are functional, real concerns
embodying society's pre‑eminent desire to avoid injustice to accused
persons and, as such, cannot be explained away by the mere invocation of a
legal fiction. I cannot believe that such a result would have been in the
contemplation of Parliament in enacting s. 21 . Nor do I read the Chief
Justice's judgment as countenancing this result.

respect of the charge of kidnapping for the same offence under federal U.S.
law. She claims that it violated her rights under ss. 7  and 11 (h) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  as well as the provisions of the
extradition treaty between Canada and the United States. The defence was
rejected by the extradition judge, the judge who reviewed the case on habeas

                   Held: The

                   (1)
The Jurisdictional Issue

 

                   This
Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to s. 719(5)  of the Criminal
Code . Having regard to the history of the section, it is clear that it was
intended to give to the courts of appeal and to this Court a right of appeal in
habeas corpus proceedings, including proceedings upon a writ of habeas
corpus arising out of a claim for extradition. In enacting this provision,
Parliament obviously overlooked s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act . It must,
however, be taken to have been superseded by s. 719 . To the extent that there
is a conflict between s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  and s. 719 of the Code,
then, s. 40  has been impliedly repealed.

                   (2)
The Extradition and Charter Issues 

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: An extradition hearing is
not a trial. It is simply a hearing to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence of an alleged extradition crime to warrant the Government under its
treaty obligations to surrender a fugitive to a foreign country for trial by
the authorities there for an offence committed within its jurisdiction. Thus,
the judge at an extradition hearing has no jurisdiction to deal with defences
that could be raised at trial unless, of course, the Act or the treaty
otherwise provides. Here, article 4(1)(i) of the extradition treaty between
Canada and the United States expressly provides that extradition shall not be
granted ""When the person whose surrender is sought is being proceeded
against, or has been tried and discharged or punished in the territory of the
requested State for the offense for which his extradition is requested"".
If the parties had considered that double jeopardy in the requesting state
should be a valid defence at an extradition hearing, the treaty would have
referred to it since the parties evidently adverted to the issue.

 

                   Section
11 (h) of the Charter  does not apply to an extradition hearing.
There can be no doubt that the actions undertaken by the Government of Canada
in extradition as in other matters are subject to scrutiny under the Charter 
(s. 32 ). But the Charter  does not govern the actions of a foreign
country. In particular the Charter  cannot be given extraterritorial
effect to govern how criminal proceedings in a foreign country are to be
conducted. Section 11  relates to charges laid by the governments referred to in
s. 32  of the Charter . An extradition hearing does not fall within that
description.

 

                   It
does not follow that the Charter  has no application to extradition.
While the general extradition procedure constitutes a reasonable limit, under
s. 1  of the Charter , on the right not to be surrendered for trial, that
a fugitive may have the manner in which the procedures are conducted in Canada
and the conditions under which a fugitive is surrendered can invite Charter 
scrutiny. The pre‑eminence of the Constitution must be recognized; the
treaty, the extradition hearing in this country and the exercise of the
executive discretion to surrender a fugitive must all conform to the
requirements of the Charter , including the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

                   Generally,
there is nothing unjust in surrendering to a foreign country a person accused
of having committed a crime there for trial in accordance with the ordinary
procedures prevailing in that country, even though those procedures may not
meet the specific constitutional requirements for trial in this country. But
the courts may intervene if the executive's decision to surrender a fugitive
would, in the particular circumstances of a case, violate the principles of
fundamental justice. This is, however, a jurisdiction that must be exercised
with caution. The discretion to make the decision to surrender is primarily
that of the executive and this is an area where it is likely to be far better
informed than the courts, and where the courts must be extremely circumspect so
as to avoid interfering unduly in decisions that involve the good faith and
honour of this country in its relations with other states. In a word, judicial
intervention must be limited to cases of real substance. Finally, barring
obvious or urgent circumstances, the courts should not ordinarily intervene
before the executive has made an order of surrender.

 

                   In
the case at bar, the surrender of the appellant did not constitute a breach of
s. 7  of the Charter . The attempt by state authorities to enforce their
own laws did not violate the principles of fundamental justice by reason only
that the federal authorities, in attempting to enforce their laws, prosecuted
her for an offence bearing some similarity to that for which the state
prosecution was initiated. The two offences contain different elements, and
different interests were involved with different prosecutorial authorities
following their own paths. Therefore, there was nothing sufficiently oppressive
in this situation to warrant refusing surrender on the basis that such
prosecution, ipso facto, violates the principles of fundamental justice.

 

                   Per Lamer
J.: The Charter  does not govern the actions of a foreign country and, in
particular, cannot govern how criminal proceedings in a foreign country are to
be conducted. Therefore, the Charter  should not, save special
circumstances, be given extraterritorial effect by refusing to conduct a
hearing or surrender a person on the grounds that the prospective trial in the
foreign country would be in violation of its provisions. But the Charter 
does apply to the extradition proceedings taking place in Canada. These
proceedings are in the nature of a preliminary inquiry and there is no reason
why a person undergoing such an inquiry for the purpose of determining whether
there is sufficient evidence to put that person on trial in a foreign country
should be denied the protection that would be afforded that same person at his
preliminary inquiry for a charge to be tried in a Canadian court. Thus, ss. 7
to 14 of the Charter  are applicable to these proceedings in so far as
they would apply to a preliminary inquiry.

 

                   The
plea of autrefois acquit, whether raised under s. 11 (h) or s. 7,
is premature at the stage of the preliminary inquiry and should generally be
raised at the trial. But this plea could be raised at the extradition hearing
when the foreign country where the trial is to take place does not allow it, as
in this case, between federal and state prosecutions. Here, however,
appellant's plea of autrefois acquit could not succeed because the two
offences involve quite different elements.

 

                   Per Wilson
J.: A Canadian citizen who is the subject of extradition proceedings in Canada
is entitled to the benefit of the Charter  in those proceedings.
Charter  rights are enshrined in our Constitution as part of the supreme law
of Canada and must be recognized and given effect in any judicial proceeding in
Canada unless a reasonable limit justified under s. 1  has been imposed upon
them. Although the recognition of Charter  rights in the extradition
proceedings in Canada may have repercussions abroad, it does not give
extraterritorial effect to the Charter  and does not constitute an
interference with the processes of the foreign court. In the present case,
appellant was entitled to plead ss. 7  and 11 (h) as a defence to the extradition
court's grant of an order committing her to prison to await the decision of the
executive branch of government whether or not to surrender. But she failed to
demonstrate that the federal and the state offences were the same offence, and
thus failed to establish that her Charter  rights would have been
violated if the order sought by the respondents was made.

delivered by

 

1.                La Forest J.‑‑The
appellant, Helen Susan Schmidt, resists extradition to the United States on a
charge of child stealing contrary to the law of the State of Ohio on the ground
that she was acquitted in respect of the same activity of a charge of
kidnapping under federal law of the United States. This she claims violates her
rights under ss. 7  and 11 (h) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and

extradition treaty; see Canada Treaty Series 1976, No. 3. This defence
was rejected by the extradition judge, the judge who reviewed the case on habeas
corpus and the Ontario Court of Appeal. From the latter judgment, she was
given leave to appeal to this Court.

 

Facts

 

2.                On
August 28, 1980, Schmidt, with the assistance of her son, Charles Gress, and a
friend of his, Paul Hildebrand, is alleged to have abducted a two‑year
old girl, Denise Gravely, from a Cleveland sidewalk. Schmidt took the child
with her to New York State, where she kept her for almost two years, raising
her as her daughter. In the interim, the child's father committed suicide,
allegedly as a result of his inability to discover his child's whereabouts.

 

3.                On
March 22, 1982, Schmidt attended a family reunion in Buffalo, New York,
accompanied by Denise. Another son of hers, Donald Gress, was also at the
reunion. By sheer coincidence, Donald Gress not only came from Cleveland but
knew the child's parents and had helped to search for her after her abduction.
Following the reunion, he told Cleveland police of Denise's whereabouts and she
was returned to her mother on March 26, 1982.

 

4.                Following
her arrest, Schmidt was charged with the federal offence of kidnapping and the
state offence of child‑stealing. Grand juries returned indictments on
both charges, on March 29, 1982 on the state charge and on March 31, 1982 on
the federal charge.

 

5.                The
two charges have some similarities but they also have important differences.
The federal offence under the United States Code, Title 18 reads:

 

§ 1201. Kidnapping

 

(a) Whoever unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles,
decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or
otherwise any person, except in the case of a minor by the parent thereof,
when:

 

(1) the person is willfully transported in interstate
or foreign commerce;

 

(2) any such act against the person is done within
the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States;

 

(3) any such act against the person is done within
the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States as defined in section
101(36) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1301(36));
or

 

(4) the person is a foreign official, an
internationally protected person, or an official guest as those terms are
defined in section 1116(b) of this title,

 

shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years
or for life.

 

The
offence under the Revised Code of Ohio reads:

 

§ 2905.04‑‑Child Stealing

 

(A) No person, by any means, and with purpose to
withhold a child under the age of fourteen or mentally incompetent from the
legal custody of his parent, guardian or custodian, shall remove such child
from the place where he is found.

 

(B) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under
this section that the actor reasonably believed that his conduct was necessary
to preserve the child's health or welfare.

 

6.                On
July 26, 1982, Schmidt was tried on the federal charge by a judge and jury. She
admitted the abduction, but contended that she had taken part in it in the
belief that Denise was the illegitimate daughter of her son Donald Gress, and
that she had been abandoned by her father and was living with her natural
mother ""in a home of ill repute"". On July 30, 1982, the jury found
Schmidt not guilty and she was acquitted. 

 

7.                On
August 6, 1982, while the state offence of child‑stealing was still
pending, Schmidt, who is a Canadian citizen, left the United States and came to
Canada. She was arrested in Kirkland Lake, Ontario on August 30, 1982 and extradition
proceedings against her were begun pursuant to the Canada‑United States
extradition treaty.

 

8.                I
should add that Schmidt's counsel argues that if Schmidt is returned to Ohio,
she will not have the benefit of raising her previous federal prosecution in
bar of her prosecution under state law. While under the Fifth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States, a person is protected from double jeopardy
against federal prosecutions, that provision does not apply to the states
although at some point the cruelty of harassment by multiple prosecutions by a
state would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: see Bartkus
v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959). It is clear, however, that the Fourteenth
Amendment does not automatically protect an individual from being prosecuted
under a state law although the accused was earlier tried and acquitted of an
offence under federal law. Thus in Bartkus v. Illinois, supra,
the accused was tried and acquitted under a federal law of robbing a federally
insured bank. He was later tried and convicted on substantially the same
evidence in an Illinois state court for violating an Illinois robbery statute.
On an action to test the constitutionality of the second prosecution, the
Supreme Court of the United States held that the Illinois prosecution did not
violate the due process clause.

 

The
Courts Below

 

9.                At
the extradition hearing, Collins Dist. Ct. J., having found that the
requirements of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21, had
been met, considered whether s. 11 (h) of the Charter  would be
violated by an order committing Schmidt to prison to await the Government's
decision on the request for her surrender. He held, however, that the Charter 
only applied within the boundaries of Canada. He also noted that it had already
been held in Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca (1983), 4 C.C.C.
(3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.) that the extradition process itself was a reasonable limit
on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter . Finally, he
refused to consider the common law plea of autrefois acquit or the
American doctrine of double jeopardy on the ground that they were not within
the scope of his jurisdiction as an extradition judge. Accordingly, he ordered
Schmidt's committal for surrender to the United States.

 

10.              In
a proceeding on a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid
before Steele J. (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 399, 147 D.L.R. (3d) 616, 4 C.C.C. (3d)
409, 4 C.R.R. 323, Schmidt's principal argument was that she should not have
been committed because such committal violated the principle of autrefois
acquit, either under the Charter  or at common law.

 

11.              Steele
J. held that at common law and under the Extradition Act, Schmidt was
not entitled to plead autrefois acquit. Section 3 of the Act, he noted,
incorporates the extradition treaty, article 2 of which provides that
extradition is to be ordered for certain named offences that are offences in
both the requesting and the requested State. He pointed out that no defences
are provided for. In his opinion, the fact that a defence might be raised to a
charge in Canada is not a valid reason for refusing extradition. Indeed, since
article 4(1)(i) of the treaty provides that extradition is not to be ordered
where a fugitive has been previously tried in the requested state, the raising
of autrefois acquit or convict where the fugitive has been tried
in the requesting state is implicitly ruled out. In any event, federal and
state charges in this case differed from one another and the defence,
therefore, had no application.

 

12.              As
to the Charter , Rauca, supra, having already determined
that extradition was a reasonable infringement on the right to remain in
Canada, any argument that specific aspects of extradition are contrary to the Charter 
were, in Steele J.'s opinion, ruled out. ""[I]f the Extradition Act
is a proper infringement upon the rights of the individual to remain in Canada,
then I do not see how the details of whatever rights there may be within the Extradition
Act can be overridden by the provisions of the Charter .""

 

13.              Finally,
he held that because an extradition judge has the same powers as a magistrate
on a preliminary inquiry, autrefois acquit, as a defence on the merits,
could only be raised at trial, and consequently could not properly be raised
before an extradition judge any more than before a magistrate on a preliminary
inquiry.

 

14.              In
the Ontario Court of Appeal (1984), 44 O.R. (2d) 777, 7 D.L.R. (4th) 95, 10
C.C.C. (3d) 564, 2 O.A.C. 336, Lacourcière J.A. held that the statutory plea of
autrefois acquit under s. 535  of the Criminal Code  was not
available at an extradition hearing. Under s. 13 of the Extradition Act,
the extradition judge has the same powers as a justice at a preliminary
inquiry. The powers of a justice under Part XV of the Code are
statutory, and do not include the authority to entertain special pleas. The
special plea of autrefois acquit could only be raised on arraignment for
an indictable offence under Part XVII of the Code and not at a
preliminary inquiry or an extradition hearing. Nor, he held, could a common law
plea in the nature of res judicata or issue estoppel be raised. Such
pleas are defences on the merits, also to be dealt with at trial. 

 

15.              Lacourcière
J.A. held that it was possible that article 8 of the treaty, which acknowledged
the right of a fugitive to all remedies and recourses provided by the law of
the requested state, permitted the raising of a Charter  issue. However,
he did not find it necessary to decide the point since in his view, the federal
and state offences in this case were not the same, and Schmidt therefore had
not been acquitted of ""the offence"" as required by s. 11 (h) of
the Charter .

 

16.              The
appeal was, therefore, dismissed. Leave was then granted to appeal to this
Court, [1984] 1 S.C.R. xiii.

 

Jurisdiction
of this Court

 

17.              Before
addressing the substantive issues raised by the appellant, it is first
necessary to consider an issue raised by the respondent, namely, whether this
Court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. This issue arises out of the fact
that there is an apparent conflict between s. 40 of the Supreme Court Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. S‑19, as amended, and s. 719(5) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34.

 

18.              Taken
by itself, s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  makes it clear that no appeal
lies in habeas corpus proceedings in extradition matters. It reads:

 

                   40. No appeal to
the Supreme Court lies under section 38 or 39 from a judgment in a criminal
cause, in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari
or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge, or in proceedings for or
upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of a claim for extradition made
under a treaty. [Emphasis added.]

 

In Re
Lazier (1899), 29 S.C.R. 630, this Court held that, by virtue of the
forerunner of this provision, the Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain an
appeal from habeas corpus proceedings in an extradition matter. As here,
the attempted appeal was from a provincial court of appeal: see also Gaynor
and Greene v. United States of America (1905), 36 S.C.R. 247, at p. 249.

 

19.              In
1965, however, s. 719  of the Criminal Code  was enacted (S.C. 1964‑65,
c. 53). It provided for appeals from decisions in proceedings involving
extraordinary remedies and, in particular, under s. 719(5) from a judgment in a
habeas corpus proceeding to a provincial court of appeal and thence to
this Court. Section 719(5) reads:

 

                   (5) Where a judgment is issued
on the return of a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, an appeal
therefrom lies to the court of appeal, and from a judgment of the court of
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, with the leave of that court, at the
instance of the applicant or the Attorney General of the province concerned or
the Attorney General of Canada, but not at the instance of any other party.

 

20.              To
understand the interrelationship of the two provisions, it is essential to
examine their history. When the precursor of s. 40  was passed, Parliament was
then guided by a general policy of preventing prolonged litigation in criminal
matters by restricting appeals. For many years Parliament made no provision for
appeals from habeas corpus proceedings to provincial courts of appeal,
though appeals to the Supreme Court were, in some circumstances, possible (see Supreme
Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259, ss. 57 and 58). The policy appears to have
been particularly marked in relation to extradition matters; see Gaynor and
Greene, supra, at p. 249, and the predecessors of s. 40  of the Supreme
Court Act  ensured that such appeals could not be entertained in the Supreme
Court either.

 

21.              There
were instances, however, where provincial courts of appeal overlooked the fact
that there was no provision for appeal from habeas corpus hearings in extradition
matters; see, for example, in Ontario, Re Low (1932), 41 O.W.N. 468, and
in Quebec, Ecrement v. Séguin (1921), 39 C.C.C. 113. In Re Storgoff,
[1945] S.C.R. 526, however, this Court made it clear that there was no appeal
to these courts from a decision on habeas corpus, but it was only later
that this ruling was applied to extradition cases: see Re Wattebled
(1952), 106 C.C.C. 200 (Que. C.A.); Re Johnston and Shane (1959), 18
D.L.R. (2d) 102 (Ont. C.A.)

 

22.              Over
the past several decades, however, Parliamentary attitude towards criminal
appeals has changed, and such appeals have been provided on a much more
extended basis. The right of the Crown to appeal against an acquittal is an
example. More specifically, three years after the last mentioned case, Johnston
and Shane, was decided, in November 1962 a Bill was introduced in the House
of Commons to provide an appeal from habeas corpus proceedings.
Provisions of this Bill, as amended, now appear in s. 719  of the Criminal
Code . Given that the recent cases holding that there was no appeal from habeas
corpus proceedings were extradition cases, and given that habeas corpus
was the only means of reviewing extradition cases, it is reasonable to assume
that appeals from judgments in habeas corpus in extradition cases were
intended to be comprised in s. 719 . 

 

23.              This
development was traced by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Re Federal Republic
of Germany and Rauca, supra, which concluded its examination of this
issue with the following passage, at p. 396:

 

                   Having regard to the history of the
amendment of the Code, we think it is clear that s. 719  was intended to
give a general right of appeal in habeas corpus proceedings, including
proceedings upon a writ of habeas corpus arising out of a claim for
extradition, and is not restricted to habeas corpus proceedings under
the Criminal Code . We hold, therefore, that the appellant has the right
to appeal to this court.

 

The
Court of Appeal of British Columbia soon adopted this reasoning in Re Meier
and The Queen (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 210.

 

24.              If
one concludes that there is an appeal to a provincial court of appeal from habeas
corpus in an extradition matter, one must equally conclude that a
subsequent appeal may be brought to this Court because s. 719  creates an
integrated scheme. In enacting this provision, Parliament obviously overlooked
s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act . It must, however, be taken to have been
superseded by the later provision. To the extent that there is conflict between
s. 40  of the Supreme Court Act  and s. 719 of the Code, then, s.
40  has been impliedly repealed. I should perhaps say that in dealing with this
issue in my book Extradition To and From Canada (2nd ed. 1977), at pp.
131‑32, I did not advert to the intertwined judicial and legislative
history of the two provisions.

 

25.              I,
therefore, hold that this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal.

 

The Non‑Charter
Extradition Issues

 

26.              I
shall deal with the non‑Charter  arguments on extradition before
addressing the Charter  issues. It may be useful at the outset, however,
to recall precisely what extradition is. Extradition is the surrender by one
state to another, on request, of persons accused or convicted of committing a
crime in the state seeking the surrender. This is ordinarily done pursuant to a
treaty or other arrangement between these states acting in their sovereign
capacity and obviously engages their honour and good faith. A surrender under
these treaties is primarily an executive act. Charter  considerations and
international implications apart, it is under domestic law in the discretion of
the executive to surrender or not to surrender a fugitive requested by another
state.

 

27.              However,
as Laskin J. (as he then was) noted in Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.
Hernandez, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 228, at p. 245, concern for the liberty of the
individual has not been overlooked in these rather special proceedings. That is
why provision is made in the treaties and in the Extradition Act to
ensure that, before the discretion to surrender can be exercised, a judicial
hearing must be held for the purpose of determining whether there is such
evidence of the crime alleged to have been committed in the foreign country as
would, according to the law of Canada, justify his or her committal for trial
if it had been committed here. If so, the judge commits the fugitive for
surrender, and the executive may then exercise its discretion to surrender; if
not, he or she is discharged (s. 18 of the Act). The hearing is similar to a
preliminary hearing, the presiding judge being ordained by s. 13 of the Act to
hear the case in the same manner, ""as nearly as may be"", as at a
preliminary hearing for a crime committed in this country.

 

28.              The
hearing thus protects the individual in this country from being surrendered for
trial for a crime in a foreign country unless prima facie evidence is
produced that he or she has done something there that would constitute a crime
mentioned in the treaty if committed here. It must be emphasized that this
hearing is not a trial and no attempt should be made to make it one. The trial,
when held, will be in the foreign country according to its laws for an alleged
crime committed there, and it should require no demonstration that such a
prosecution is wholly within the competence of that country. A judge at an
extradition hearing has no jurisdiction to deal with defences that could be
raised at trial unless, of course, the Act or the treaty otherwise provides.

 

29.              Counsel
for Schmidt argued, however, that the principle of double jeopardy is so
fundamental to our criminal law that in providing that an extradition hearing
should be conducted ""as nearly as may be"" like a preliminary hearing,
Parliament must have intended to import into the extradition hearing some way
of presenting defences to prevent a person from being twice prosecuted for the
same offence. That, however, would seem to me to import trial procedures into
the hearing, an approach that is out of keeping with extradition law generally.
In domestic law, such pleas can be made at trial. In extradition matters, too,
these are issues that can be raised at the trial in the foreign country. In my
view, the reference to a procedure that is the same ""as nearly as may
be"" as a preliminary hearing is intended to accommodate the differences
between the two types of proceedings, such as, for example, the provisions in
the treaty and the Act for presenting evidence by depositions.

 

30.              This
conclusion is supportable both in principle and on practical grounds. In
principle, as Hagarty J. long ago reminded us, the country seeking
surrender under a treaty must be trusted with the trial of offences; see Re
Burley (1865), 1 C.L.J. 34 (C.L. Ch.) It should not be forgotten
either that the good faith of this country in honouring its international
obligations is involved. 

 

31.              As
well, an attempt by courts to consider defences more appropriately dealt with
at trial could seriously affect the efficient working of a salutary system
devised by states for the mutual surrender of suspected wrongdoers. In
particular, a proper determination of pleas such as autrefois acquit and
res judicata presents difficult problems requiring an in‑depth
knowledge of facts and law that are best dealt with at trial. This is
especially so in extradition matters where it is necessary to prove the foreign
law as a fact if such defences are permitted, and where only sufficient facts
are presented as are necessary to justify the committal of the fugitive.

 

32.              That
the parties to the present treaty must have looked at the situation in this way
is apparent from a treaty provision upon which counsel for Schmidt relies.
Article 4(1)(i) expressly provides that extradition shall not be granted ""‑‑When
the person whose surrender is sought is being proceeded against, or has been
tried and discharged or punished in the territory of the requested State
for the offense for which his extradition is requested"" (emphasis added).
If the parties had considered that double jeopardy in the requesting
state should be a valid defence at an extradition hearing, one would have
thought the treaty would have referred to it since the parties evidently
adverted to the issue. The truth is that the parties obviously understood the
practical difficulties of providing for such a defence at the hearing, leaving
it, like other trial matters, to be dealt with in the requesting country. That
is what is done under most of the treaties. When states wish to provide for a
defence of autrefois acquit in circumstances where the fugitive has
already been tried in the requesting state, or elsewhere for that matter, they
expressly provide for it; see, for example, the extradition treaty with Israel,
article 4, Canada Treaty Series 1969, No. 25. I do not, therefore,
accept the dicta to the contrary expressed in Atkinson v. United
States of America Government, [1971] A.C. 197. I might add that I see
nothing in the principle set forth in article 2 of the treaty (that the offence
concerned must be a crime in both countries) that affects the foregoing
reasoning.

 

33.              Finally,
in the course of the oral argument counsel referred to the early English case
of Re Windsor (1865), 6 B. & S. 522, 122 E.R. 1288 (K.B.), where it
appears to have been thought that extradition could not be granted for state
crimes in the United States but, as Duff J. said in Re Collins (No. 3)
(1905), 10 C.C.C. 80 (B.C.S.C.), this view was based on a misconception of the
division of legislative power in the United States and has never been followed.

 

Section
11 (h) of the Charter 

 

34.              The
appellant's major arguments, however, relate to the Charter . Counsel
submitted that the child stealing charge is substantially the same as the
kidnapping charge and that consequently the appellant is protected from being
tried under the child stealing charge under s. 11 (h) of the Charter ,
which reads as follows:

 

                   11. Any person charged
with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(h) if finally acquitted of the offence, not
to be tried for it again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the
offence, not to be tried or punished for it again;

 

35.              There
can be no doubt that the actions undertaken by the Government of Canada in
extradition as in other matters are subject to scrutiny under the Charter 
(s. 32 ). Equally, though, there cannot be any doubt that the Charter  does
not govern the actions of a foreign country; see, for example, Spencer v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 278. In particular the Charter  cannot be
given extraterritorial effect to govern how criminal proceedings in a foreign
country are to be conducted.

 

36.              These
propositions must, I think, be kept firmly in mind in examining the right
protected by s. 11 (h). The right is that of a person charged with an
offence not to be tried for the offence again if he or she has already been finally
acquitted of the offence. The Government of Canada, to which the Charter 
applies, is not trying the fugitive. An extradition hearing, we saw, is not a
trial. It is simply a hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence
of an alleged extradition crime to warrant the Government under its treaty
obligations to surrender a fugitive to a foreign country for trial by the
authorities there for an offence committed within its jurisdiction. To repeat,
s. 11 (h) was not intended to be given extraterritorial application so as
to govern criminal processes in another country. It was intended to govern
trials conducted by the governments of this country mentioned in s. 32 . Here no
trial is being conducted by the Government of Canada. If a trial is to be held,
it will be conducted by a foreign government in a foreign country for an
offence under its laws.

 

37.              Fundamentally,
what the appellant seeks to do is to restructure the extradition hearing (which
is simply one to determine a condition precedent to the executive's power to
surrender, i.e., whether there is a prima facie case that an alleged
extradition crime was committed) into a quite different proceeding to determine
whether the foreign trial meets the standards of a trial conducted in this
country. I agree with the extradition judge, Collins Dist. Ct. J., that he had
no jurisdiction to do this. 

 

38.              This
approach is supported by the whole structure of s. 11 . Not only is a fugitive
at an extradition hearing not being charged with an offence, certainly not by
the Government of Canada, several of the rights of a ""person charged with
an offence"" can simply have no application to extradition. These include
the right to be presumed innocent (s. 11 (d)) and the right to a jury
trial (s. 11 (f)), both of which do not exist in a number of countries
with which we have extradition treaties. How could Canada surrender fugitives
to those countries to be tried there if such issues could be raised at an
extradition hearing? Nor can these provisions be isolated. To say that some
provisions of s. 11  apply to extradition hearings, while others do not,
involves giving varying meanings to ""any person charged with an
offence"" in the opening words of the section. In my view, Tallis J.A. was
correct in saying in R. v. Heit (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Sask. C.A.),
at p. 100, that the expression must have a constant meaning throughout, one
that harmonizes with the various paragraphs of the section.

 

39.              Briefly
stated, I think s. 11  relates to charges laid by the governments referred to in
s. 32  of the Charter . An extradition hearing does not fall within that
description. It is interesting that the courts of the United States have
arrived at a similar result under their constitution. The Fifth Amendment right
not ""to be twice put in jeopardy"", has been held to be available only
in the United States: see Re Ryan, 360 F. Supp. 270 (E.D. N.Y. 1973).

 

40.              I
would not, however, wish to be interpreted as saying that some of the interests
involved in s. 11 , such as the right to bail (s. 11 (e)), are not
similarly protected at an extradition hearing under other provisions of the Charter ;
consider the interplay between s. 7  (the right to liberty) and s. 15  (equality
before the law).

 

41.              I
am, therefore, of the view that s. 11 (h) of the Charter  does not
apply to an extradition hearing.

 

Section
7  of the Charter 

 

42.              As
will be evident from what I have already said, I am far from thinking that the Charter 
has no application to extradition. The surrender of a person to a foreign
country may obviously affect a number of Charter  rights. In Rauca,
supra, for example, the Ontario Court of Appeal recognized that
extradition intruded on a citizen's right under s. 6  to remain in Canada,
although it also found that the beneficial aspects of the procedure in
preventing malefactors from evading justice, a procedure widely adopted all
over the world, were sufficient to sustain it as a reasonable limit under s. 1 
of the Charter . Section 6  was not raised in this case, though Schmidt is
a Canadian citizen, no doubt because her counsel believed, as I do, that it was
properly disposed of in the Rauca case. However, it does not follow from
the fact that the procedure is generally justifiable that the manner in which
the procedures are conducted in Canada and the conditions under which a
fugitive is surrendered can never invite Charter  scrutiny. The pre‑eminence
of the Constitution must be recognized; the treaty, the extradition hearing in
this country and the exercise of the executive discretion to surrender a
fugitive must all conform to the requirements of the Charter , including
the principles of fundamental justice.

 

43.              No
issue was raised that Canadian officials did anything improper in the conduct
of the proceedings. Nor was any objection raised in this Court about the nature
of the extradition procedure itself, the objection raised below that the
fugitive offender had a right under s. 7  of the Charter  to cross‑examine
deponents on affidavits submitted in support of the extradition application
having, in my view, rightly been abandoned.

 

44.              What
is squarely in issue here is whether the surrender of a fugitive by the
Government of Canada to the United States for the purpose of having her tried
for a state crime which bears some similarity to a federal crime for which she
has already been tried and acquitted in respect of the same transaction
violates s. 7  of the Charter , which reads as follows:

 

                   7. Everyone has
the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be
deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

45.              In
so far as any general objection might be made that extradition interferes with
the right to life, liberty and security of the person is concerned, such
objection would be met by considerations similar to those adopted in Rauca
in respect of s. 6  of the Charter . The real question is whether the
fugitive in the circumstances of this case would, by virtue of her proposed
extradition, be deprived of this right in a manner that did not conform to the
principles of fundamental justice.

 

46.              I
should at the outset say that the surrender of a fugitive to a foreign country
is subject to Charter  scrutiny notwithstanding that such surrender
primarily involves the exercise of executive discretion. In Operation
Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, Dickson J. (now C.J.)
made it clear that ""the executive branch of the Canadian government is
duty bound to act in accordance with the dictates of the Charter ""
(p. 455) and that even ""disputes of a political or foreign policy nature
may be properly cognizable by the courts"" (p. 459); see also Wilson J. at
p. 464. 

 

47.              I
have no doubt either that in some circumstances the manner in which the foreign
state will deal with the fugitive on surrender, whether that course of conduct
is justifiable or not under the law of that country, may be such that it would
violate the principles of fundamental justice to surrender an accused under
those circumstances. To make the point, I need only refer to a case that arose
before the European Commission on Human Rights, Altun v. Germany (1983),
5 E.H.R.R. 611, where it was established that prosecution in the requesting
country might involve the infliction of torture. Situations falling far short
of this may well arise where the nature of the criminal procedures or penalties
in a foreign country sufficiently shocks the conscience as to make a decision
to surrender a fugitive for trial there one that breaches the principles of
fundamental justice enshrined in s. 7 . I might say, however, that in most
cases, at least, judicial intervention should await the exercise of executive
discretion. For the decision to surrender is that of the executive authorities,
not the courts, and it should not be lightly assumed that they will overlook
their duty to obey constitutional norms by surrendering an individual to a
foreign country under circumstances where doing so would be fundamentally
unjust.

 

48.              I
hasten to add, however, that I see nothing unjust in surrendering to a foreign
country a person accused of having committed a crime there for trial in the
ordinary way in accordance with the system for the administration of justice
prevailing in that country simply because that system is substantially
different from ours with different checks and balances. The judicial process in
a foreign country must not be subjected to finicky evaluations against the rules
governing the legal process in this country. A judicial system is not, for
example, fundamentally unjust‑‑indeed it may in its practical
workings be as just as ours‑‑because it functions on the basis of
an investigatory system without a presumption of innocence or, generally,
because its procedural or evidentiary safeguards have none of the rigours of
our system.

 

49.              What
has to be determined is whether or not, in the particular circumstances of the
case, surrender of a fugitive for a trial offends against the basic demands of
justice. In determining that issue, the courts must begin with the notion that
the executive must first have determined that the general system for the
administration of justice in the foreign country sufficiently corresponds to
our concepts of justice to warrant entering into the treaty in the first place,
and must have recognized that it too has a duty to ensure that its actions
comply with constitutional standards. Blind judicial deference to executive
judgment cannot, of course, be expected. The courts have the duty to uphold the
Constitution. Nonetheless, this is an area where the executive is likely to be
far better informed than the courts, and where the courts must be extremely
circumspect so as to avoid interfering unduly in decisions that involve the
good faith and honour of this country in its relations with other states. In a
word, judicial intervention must be limited to cases of real substance.

 

50.              It
is not beside the point to observe that any other approach would seriously
impair the effective functioning of a salutary system for preventing criminals
from evading the demands of justice in one country by escaping to another. In a
world where modern communications make international and transnational criminal
activity and evasion ever easier, no demonstration is required of the need for
a reasonably effective system for the surrender of fugitives from one country
to another untrammelled by excessive technicality or fastidious demands that
foreign systems comply with our constitutional standards. A decision to
surrender a fugitive for trial in a foreign country cannot be faulted as
fundamentally unjust because the operation of the foreign law in the particular
circumstances has not been subjected to scrutiny to see if it will conform to
the standards of our system of justice.

 

51.              I
would add that the lessons of history should not be overlooked. Sir Edward
Clarke instructs us that in the early 19th century the English judges, by
strict and narrow interpretation, almost completely nullified the operation of
the few extradition treaties then in existence: see A Treatise Upon the Law
of Extradition (4th ed. 1903), c. V. Following the enactment of the British
Extradition Act, 1870 (U.K.), 33 & 34 Vict., c. 52, upon which ours
is modelled, this approach was reversed. The present system of extradition
works because courts give the treaties a fair and liberal interpretation with a
view to fulfilling Canada's obligations, reducing the technicalities of
criminal law to a minimum and trusting the courts in the foreign country to
give the fugitive a fair trial, including such matters as giving proper weight
to the evidence and adequate consideration of available defences and the
dictates of due process generally.

 

52.              That
the approach I have suggested is not unreasonable is evident from the
experience of the United States, with its rather similar constitution. The
application of that country's experience, it is true, must be viewed in light
of the ""political question"" doctrine under which wide judicial deference
is accorded to certain executive decisions, including those in the field of
foreign relations, an issue not yet resolved in this country although it has
been the subject of some discussion in this Court; see the remarks of Wilson J.
in Operation Dismantle Inc., supra, at p. 464. However, the
courts of that country, while recognizing the pre‑eminent role of the
executive in this area, have noted that all branches of government are subject
to the supremacy of the Constitution and that the judiciary may have a useful
role to play: see Holmes v. Laird, 459 F.2d 1211 (D.C. Cir. 1972), certiorari
denied 409 U.S. 869. In particular, they have stated that an extradition
hearing must conform to the requirements of due process: see Gallina v.
Fraser, 177 F. Supp. 856 (D. Conn. 1959), aff'd 278 F.2d 77 (2d Cir. 1960),
certiorari denied 364 U.S. 851.

 

53.              It
is clear, however, that the rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution
are not to be exported to other countries, even where American citizens are
involved. In the leading case of Neely v. Henkel (No. 1), 180 U.S. 109
(1901), the United States Supreme Court was faced with the task of reconciling
its laws governing extradition to Cuba with the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution of the United States. Harlan J., giving the judgment of the court,
had this to say at p. 122: 

 

                   It is contended that the act of June
6, 1900, is unconstitutional and void in that it does not secure to the
accused, when surrendered to a foreign country for trial in its tribunals, all
of the rights, privileges and immunities that are guaranteed by the
Constitution to persons charged with the commission in this country of crime
against the United States. Allusion is here made to the provisions of the
Federal Constitution relating to the writ of habeas corpus bills of
attainder, ex post facto laws, trial by jury for crimes, and generally
to the fundamental guarantees of life, liberty and property embodied in that
instrument. The answer to this suggestion is that those provisions have no
relation to crimes committed without the jurisdiction of the United States
against the laws of a foreign country.

 

At page
123, he continued:

 

                   In connection with the above
proposition, we are reminded of the fact that the appellant is a citizen of the
United States. But such citizenship does not give him an immunity to commit
crime in other countries, nor entitle him to demand, of right, a trial in any
other mode than that allowed to its own people by the country whose laws he has
violated and from whose justice he has fled. When an American citizen commits a
crime in a foreign country he cannot complain if required to submit to such
modes of trial and to such punishment as the laws of that country may prescribe
for its own people, unless a different mode be provided for by treaty
stipulations between that country and the United States.

 

This
course has been followed ever since. In Gallina v. Fraser, supra,
for example, the Federal Court of Appeal (2d Cir.) refused to give effect to an
objection that returning to Italy a fugitive who had been convicted in
absentia in accordance with that country's traditional process violated the
due process clause. Again, in Holmes v. Laird, supra, that court
also refused to countenance objections to a request to surrender an accused
based on several constitutional grounds, including speedy trial and
representation by effective counsel of his choice.

 

54.              In
the latter case, the court underlined the practical problems associated with
adopting another course. It had this to say at p. 1218:

 

                   It is evident that if appellants'
point were to be entertained, an in‑depth examination of the West German
trial record would become an indispensable forerunner of any endeavor to
resolve their claims on the merits. We need not pause to reflect on the
difficulties ‑‑practical or otherwise‑‑of such an
undertaking for appellants' contention that the Constitution has the effect
asserted is doomed, we think, by the Supreme Court's holding in Neely v.
Henkel.

 

The
present case reveals that such fears are not unrealistic. As we have seen, the
courts below engaged in a thorough examination of the trial record in the
federal prosecution for kidnapping and detailed arguments from that record were
made in this Court. It requires little imagination to conclude that if against
a background of widely divergent systems of law such a procedure were
introduced into any significant number of extradition cases, an effective
system of extradition could well be jeopardized. Judicial intervention in this
area must, therefore, as I have stated, be restricted to compelling situations
bearing in mind that the executive has the first responsibility in this area
and that judicial intervention conveys in Lord Russell C.J.'s phrase in Re
Arton, [1896] 1 Q.B. 108, at p. 115, ""a reflection of the gravest
possible kind, not only upon the motive and actions of the responsible
Government, but also impliedly upon the judicial authorities of a neighbouring
and friendly Power"".

 

55.              Though
the arguments made on behalf of Schmidt were largely based on s. 11 (h)
of the Charter , those arguments may also be framed in terms of s. 7 , and
indeed reliance was placed on that provision as well. Counsel contended that
her extradition would deprive her of her right to liberty and security with
respect to a matter for which she could not be brought to trial in Canada. As I
noted previously, I do not think our constitutional standards can be imposed on
other countries. A person who is accused of violating the laws of a foreign
country within its jurisdiction cannot, it seems to me, rightly complain that
she has been deprived of her liberty and security in a manner inconsistent with
the principles of fundamental justice simply because she is to be surrendered
to that country for trial in accordance with its traditional procedures, even
though those procedures may not meet the specific constitutional requirements
for trial in this country. In particular, I do not think we should attempt to
export our particular version of the technical pleas of autrefois acquit
and res judicata to a foreign country. Still less do I think that these
should be raised at an extradition hearing, where to rely on such pleas, in a
setting where foreign law must be proved and where facts may have to be
established under procedural and evidentiary rules different from those of the
requesting state, invites importing into extradition proceedings factors which
the experience of over a hundred years establishes to be unwise.

 

56.              I
find it unnecessary, then, to explore whether the foreign courts should, on
such evidence as we now have, give effect to the pleas of autrefois acquit
and res judicata. This is not to say that the underlying considerations
involved in these pleas are to be ignored in considering whether the executive
should refuse to surrender on the grounds that such surrender would violate the
principles of fundamental justice. Repeated attempts by the same prosecutorial
authorities to prosecute a person for the same offence may, in certain
circumstances, well amount to harassment sufficiently oppressive that surrender
of such a person would violate those principles. As I mentioned earlier,
however, the courts should intervene only in compelling situations.

 

57.              The
present case does not seem to me to meet this standard. I cannot accede to the
proposition that the attempt by state authorities to enforce their own laws
violates those principles by reason only that the federal authorities, in
attempting to enforce their laws, prosecuted her for an offence similar to that
for which the state prosecution was initiated. This is far from being a clear‑cut
situation. The two offences involve quite different elements. The kidnapping
offence is aimed at regulating interstate and foreign commerce, and maritime
jurisdiction, as well as internationally protected persons. The state action is
aimed at public order within the state, and is designed particularly to protect
young persons. Various other elements and defences appear in one provision but
not the other. Different interests are involved with different prosecutorial authorities
following their own paths. Similar situations may exist in this country; see Multiple
Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161; R. v. Chiasson
(1982), 135 D.L.R. (3d) 499 (N.B.C.A.), aff'd [1984] 1 S.C.R. 266. They do not
generally arise in as acute a fashion here because criminal law is exclusively
vested in Parliament, but on the other hand the same prosecutorial authorities
are often involved.

 

58.              I
am not troubled by the possibility that had the prosecution for the state
offence been tried with the federal offence, Schmidt might well have been
acquitted of the state offence. The fact is, of course, that this could not
have happened. The federal court had no jurisdiction over the state offence.
The only way the state authorities could enforce their laws was by prosecuting
in their own courts. I see nothing sufficiently oppressive in this situation to
warrant refusing surrender on the basis that such a prosecution, ipso facto,
violates the principles of fundamental justice. It is interesting that, as we
saw, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that successive
prosecutions at the federal and state level do not automatically offend against
the due process clause, the spirit and content of which bears some resemblance
to s. 7  of the Charter , although the courts would act to prevent
oppressive behaviour; see United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377 (1922); Bartkus
v. Illinois, supra; Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187
(1959).

 

59.              For
these reasons, I do not think that surrendering the appellant Schmidt under
these circumstances constitutes a breach of s. 7  of the Charter .

 

Conclusion

 

60.              I
would dismiss the appeal. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

61.              Lamer J.‑‑I
agree with Justice La Forest for the reasons given by him that this Court has
jurisdiction to hear this appeal. I also agree with La Forest J. when he
states, at p. 518, that:

 

                   There can be no doubt that the
actions undertaken by the Government of Canada in extradition as in other
matters are subject to scrutiny under the Charter  (s. 32 ). Equally,
though, there cannot be any doubt that the Charter  does not govern the
actions of a foreign country; see, for example, Spencer v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 278. In particular the Charter  cannot be given
extraterritorial effect to govern how criminal proceedings in a foreign country
are to be conducted.

 

I also
agree with him when he says (at p. 522):

 

                   I have no doubt either that in some
circumstances the manner in which the foreign state will deal with the fugitive
on surrender, whether that course of conduct is justifiable or not under the
law of that country, may be such that it would violate the principles of
fundamental justice to surrender an accused under those circumstances.

 

62.              I
therefore share the view that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
should not, save special circumstances, be given extraterritorial effect by
refusing to conduct a hearing or surrender a person on the grounds that the
prospective trial would be in violation thereof. Sharing the view of La Forest
J. that the Charter  applies to the proceedings taking place in Canada, I
am however of the view that a person undergoing extradition proceedings is a
""person charged with an offence"" as that term is used in s. 11  of the
Charter . Indeed, I do not see why a person undergoing such an inquiry
for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient evidence to put that
person on trial in a foreign country should be denied the protection that would
be afforded that same person at his preliminary inquiry for a charge to be
tried in a Canadian court. Therefore, as the proceedings in Canada are in the
nature of a preliminary inquiry, those rights of ss. 7  to 14 , including s. 11 ,
guaranteed accused at that stage of the criminal proceedings in Canada are also
guaranteed to those being subjected to extradition proceedings. Some obviously
do not apply to preliminary inquiries and should normally not apply to
extradition proceedings. That is the case of a plea of autrefois acquit,
whether raised under s. 11 (h) or s. 7 . Such a plea is generally
considered to be premature at the stage of the preliminary inquiry and should
generally be raised at the trial (R. v. Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, at
pp. 507‑08). But what if the foreign country where the trial is to take
place does not allow pleas of autrefois acquit as between, as in this
case, federal and state prosecutions? Should this not be a situation where we
should allow the plea to be raised at this phase of the proceedings because we
feel that, to use the words of La Forest J., ""it would violate the principles
of fundamental justice to surrender an accused under those circumstances""?
As regards autrefois acquit or convict I think so. But this
finding will not enure to the benefit of appellant as I share the view of La
Forest J. that in this case that special plea should not succeed because
""The two offences involve quite different elements.""

 

63.              I
would accordingly dismiss this appeal. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

64.              Wilson J.‑‑I
have had the benefit of the reasons of my colleague, Justice La Forest, but am
unable to concur in them although I concur in his proposed disposition of the
appeal.

 

65.              In
my view, no question arises in this case of the extradition court giving the Charter
of Rights and Freedoms extraterritorial effect so as to govern the criminal
process in another country or of the extradition court entertaining defences on
the merits to the foreign charge. The issue, in my respectful view, is whether
a Canadian citizen who is the subject of extradition proceedings in a Canadian
court can plead the Charter  in those Canadian proceedings. I would have
thought that he or she clearly can.

 

66.              The
appellant pleads ss. 11 (h) and 7  not, I emphasize, as a defence in the
projected trial in the State of Ohio, but as a defence to the extradition
court's grant of an order committing her to prison to await the decision of the
executive branch of government whether or not to surrender her to the U.S.
authorities. Her argument in a nutshell is that the extradition court would be
violating her ss. 11 (h) and 7  rights if it made such an order.

 

67.              This
Court held in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1
S.C.R. 177, that the deportation of any person in Canada (let alone a Canadian
citizen) to a country where his or her life, liberty or security of the person
was threatened would constitute a violation of s. 7  if the deportation order
was not made in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. It is
clear from Singh that it is the process in Canada which must
comply with fundamental justice. The appellant submits that to permit her
extradition to the United States to face a trial on a charge on which she has
already been tried and acquitted would be contrary to the principles of
fundamental justice and, in particular, to the principle reflected in s. 11 (h).
We know that that principle will not avail the appellant in the Ohio court. It
is not a defence there. But the question is: is it a defence to the
respondents' claim for an order committing the appellant to prison to await the
discretionary decision of the Executive? This, it seems to me, is the question
before us. A similar question will confront the Executive when it has to decide
whether or not to make the extradition order since acts of the Executive are
also subject to Charter  review: see Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The
Queen, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441. But that is not before us: only the issue as it
relates to the Canadian court proceedings is before us.

 

68.              My
point of departure from La Forest J. is that he appears to think that the
recognition of Charter  rights in the Canadian proceedings would be to
give extraterritorial effect to the Charter  and constitute an
interference with the processes of the foreign court. I must respectfully
disagree. If the Court refuses to commit the appellant to prison for extradition
in the discretion of the Executive because to do so would violate the
appellant's Charter  rights, the Charter  is not being given
extraterritorial effect. The effect is right here in Canada, in the Canadian
proceedings, although it will, of course, have repercussions abroad. But there
is nothing wrong in this. We would not permit a Canadian citizen to be
extradited for torture in a foreign land on the basis that to refuse to permit
it would be to give the Charter  extraterritorial effect. We did not take
that approach in Singh or in Operation Dismantle. If the
participation of a Canadian court or the Canadian Government is required in
order to facilitate extradition so that suspected criminals may be brought to
justice in other countries, it seems to me that we must face up to the question
whether such persons have the benefit of the Charter  or not in the
Canadian proceedings. We must, in other words, decide whether Canada's
treaty obligations override Charter  rights in respect of the Canadian
proceedings or whether Charter  rights must be recognized in those
proceedings whether or not similar rights are available to the person in the
foreign proceedings for which he or she may be ordered extradited.

 

69.              In
my view, Charter  rights which are enshrined in our Constitution as part
of the supreme law of Canada must be recognized and given effect in any
judicial proceeding in Canada unless a reasonable limit justified under s. 1 
has been imposed upon them. The Ontario Court of Appeal has held that the
extradition process is itself a reasonable limit: see Re Federal Republic of
Germany and Rauca (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.) I do not find it
necessary to express a view on this very important question in this case since
I think the appellant has failed to establish that the offence in Ohio is the
same offence as the offence under the United States Code.

 

70.              In
approaching the issue of the sameness of the offences I think it is important
for the Canadian court to apply its mind first to the question of what law is
properly applicable to determine whether two offences in foreign jurisdictions
are or are not the same. It seems to me that two steps are required. First, the
meaning, purpose and effect of each of the foreign laws must be independently
ascertained. This is done, I believe, under Canadian conflict of laws rules by
reference to the law of the respective foreign jurisdictions. Expert evidence
will have to be adduced in the Canadian court. Second, the foreign laws would
then be compared in light of their respective meaning, purpose and effect to
determine whether or not the offences created under them are the same. This
would be done, in my view, by resort to Canadian domestic law, in this case the
law set out by this Court in R. v. Prince, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480. While it
is entirely appropriate for the foreign law to interpret and explain the
nature, purpose and effect of its own offences, the comparison of these
offences for purposes of the application of the Canadian double jeopardy
principle would seem to be peculiarly for Canadian law. I do not believe,
however, that the two steps can be collapsed into one. 

 

71.              The
witness Spiros Gonakis, who was qualified as an expert witness in both Ohio and
federal criminal law, was prepared to collapse them into one and gave his
expert opinion not only as to the nature of the two foreign offences under
review but also as to the degree of their identity for double jeopardy purposes,
even although he acknowledged that double jeopardy was not a defence to the
Ohio charge under Ohio law. He testified that the two offences were the same.
He acknowledged, however, that the essential elements of the offences were not
the same and that the defences to the charges were different. Steele J.
therefore disregarded his opinion as to their sameness and so also did the
Court of Appeal.

 

72.              It
seems to me that counsel for the appellant failed at the extradition hearing to
discharge the burden that was his under ss. 7 and 11(h) of the Charter
of showing that the federal and Ohio offences were the same offence. In
failing to establish that, he failed to establish that the appellant's Charter 
rights would be violated if the order sought by the respondents was made.
This is determinative of the issues in the case.

 

73.              For
these reasons I agree with the disposition of the appeal proposed by La Forest
J. I also agree with La Forest J. for the reasons given by him that this Court
had jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.

 

74.              I
have now had the benefit also of the reasons of my colleague, Justice Lamer,
and, while I am in complete agreement with him as to the applicability of the Charter 
to the appellant's extradition proceedings (leaving aside s. 1 ), I have
some reservations about his view that a person, by virtue of being the subject
of extradition proceedings in Canada, is a ""person charged with an
offence"" in Canada within the meaning of the opening words of s. 11 . I
rely rather on the fact that the opening words of s. 11  are not subject to
geographical limitation. The appellant is indisputably a ""person charged
with an offence"", albeit not in Canada but in Ohio, i.e., the offence of
child‑stealing, but she is a person ""in Canada"" entitled to the
protection of ss. 7  and 11 (h) in any proceedings being conducted in
Canada with a view to such a charge, whether such proceeding itself partakes of
a trial or not. It is on this basis that I conclude somewhat tentatively that
the appellant would have been entitled to the protection of s. 11 (h)
(subject, of course, to the application of s. 1  which I leave open) had she
been able to discharge the burden of showing that she was charged with the same
offence in Ohio as she had been acquitted of under the United States Code.
If, however, there is doubt as to whether the appellant falls within the strict
wording of s. 11 (h), it would seem to me that she clearly falls within
the broader language of s. 7  and is entitled to the protection of that section
in the extradition proceedings subject again to the application of s. 1 .

                   Respondent
is alleged to have killed his wife at their home in Argentina. Shortly after
his entry to Canada, a warrant of apprehension under the Extradition Act
was issued and he was arrested on November 30, 1982. Held in custody until the
extradition hearing, he was set free on February 1, 1983 when appellant failed
to produce the necessary documentation within two months of the arrest as
required by article XIV of the extradition treaty between Canada and Argentina.
In June 1984, appellant made a second request for extradition and respondent
was again arrested. At the outset of the extradition hearing on December 10,
1984, respondent made an application to have the proceedings stayed on two
grounds: (1) that there was an infringement of s. 11 (b) of the Charter 
(trial within a reasonable time); and (2) that the extradition proceedings
constituted an abuse of process. The extradition judge found that respondent's
right under s. 11 (b) had been infringed, and pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the
Charter , dismissed the application for extradition and discharged him.
The extradition judge held that in the absence of any reasonable explanation,
the seventeen‑month delay between the discharge of the respondent because
of evidentiary problems in the first extradition proceedings and the
institution of the second proceedings was inordinate.

 

                   Held (Lamer
J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted to the
extradition judge to continue the proceedings in accordance with the law.

 

                                                (1) The
Jurisdictional Issue

 

                   This
Court has jurisdiction to entertain the present appeal pursuant to s. 41  of the
Supreme Court Act . In dismissing the application for extradition and
discharging the respondent, the superior court judge, acting as an extradition
judge, made a final judgment within the meaning of s. 41 . The decision of this
Court in United States of America v. Link and Green, [1955] S.C.R. 183,
which reached the opposite conclusion, is inconsistent with the reasoning of
this Court in more recent cases and should no longer be followed.

                   (2)   The
Charter  and the Abuse of Process Issues

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: The extradition judge
erred in dismissing the application for extradition on the ground that the
respondent's right under s. 11 (b) of the Charter  has been
infringed. Section 11  has no application to extradition hearings. It relates
only to charges laid by the governments referred to in s. 32  of the Charter .
Respondent was, of course, never charged in Canada by any of the governments to
which the Charter  applies. The prosecution for the offence was within
the jurisdiction of Argentina.

 

                   Further,
s. 11(b) did not apply to the respondent by virtue of article V of the
extradition treaty which provides that extradition shall not take place if
""exemption from prosecution or punishment has been acquired by lapse of
time, according to the laws of the state applying or applied to"". This
provision was intended to bring into operation statutes of limitations that
exist in some countries prohibiting prosecution for certain crimes after a
stated lapse of time. Section 11(b) is not an exemption in that sense.
It would require much stronger words to expand the application of our
constitutional standards for expeditious prosecutions to the international
arena.

 

                   The
contentions that the proceedings should be stayed because the seventeen‑month
delay between respondent's discharge following the first extradition hearing
and the initiation of the second constitute an abuse of process or a breach of
s. 7  of the Charter  must fail. First, the power to grant a stay for
abuse of process, which can be exercised only in the clearest of cases, is not
vested in a judge at an extradition hearing. Second, s. 7 had no application in
this case because the delay cannot be attributed to Canadian authorities, which
is a prerequisite to the application of the Charter  by virtue of s. 32 .
The delay arose because of problems by the Argentinian authorities in framing
the evidence in a form acceptable under Canadian law. Third, the delay in the
present circumstances did not constitute an abuse of process or a contravention
of the principles of fundamental justice. One cannot view delay resulting from
the complexity involved in dealing with activities that reach across national
boundaries and involve different systems of law and several levels of
bureaucracies in the same way as that resulting in local prosecutions.

 

                   In
any event, an extradition judge has no jurisdiction to deal with these issues
and to grant the appropriate remedies. The role of the extradition judge is a
modest one: absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose
of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima
facie case that the extradition crime has been committed. The procedure
bears a considerable affinity to a preliminary hearing, and the judge's powers
have some similarity to those of a magistrate presiding at such a hearing. He
has no jurisdiction to deal with defences that could be raised at trial and he
has no Charter  jurisdiction. The fact that an extradition judge is often
a superior court judge does not alter the matter.

 

                   In
the rare cases where the actions of Canadian officials in the extradition
proceedings may give rise to the need for Charter  review, the
proceedings are to be reviewed by superior courts by means of a writ of habeas
corpus. A court in habeas corpus proceedings is ordinarily confined
to questions of jurisdiction, but as such proceedings are contemplated by
Parliament as the sole means of review in extradition proceedings, a court in habeas
corpus proceedings is obviously the court of competent jurisdiction for the
purpose of s. 24  of the Charter .

 

                   Finally,
there is nothing offensive to fundamental justice in surrendering in accordance
with our extradition procedures an accused to a foreign country for trial in
accordance with its traditional judicial processes for a crime alleged to have
been committed there. Our courts must assume that he will be given a fair trial
in the foreign country. There may be situations where it would be unjust to
surrender a fugitive either because of the general condition of the
governmental and judicial apparatus or, more likely, because some particular
individual may be subjected to oppressive treatment. In such cases, the courts
may, as guardians of the Constitution, on occasion have a useful role to play
in reviewing the executive's exercise of discretion to surrender a fugitive.
But it is obviously an area in which courts must tread with caution. The
decision to surrender and the responsibility for the conduct of external
relations, including the performance of Canada's obligations under extradition
treaties, is vested in the executive.

 

                   Per Wilson
J.: Section 11  of the Charter  is applicable to extradition proceedings
and s. 11 (b) can properly be invoked when the delay in pursuing
extradition in Canada is unreasonable. But any delay relied on under s. 11 (b)
must be delay caused by the Canadian authorities because under the principles
of comity the Canadian court cannot require the foreign authorities to account
for their delay. In the present case, the delay was due in large part to the
conduct of the Argentinian authorities and the extradition judge therefore was
in error in discharging the respondent on the basis of s. 11 (b).

 

                   Respondent's
argument that the delay in the extradition proceedings constituted an abuse of
process or a violation of s. 7  of the Charter  must also fail since the
essence of respondent's complaint was again the delay caused in large part by
the Argentinian authorities.

 

                   An
application may be made to an extradition judge under s. 24(1)  of the Charter 
if, as in this case, he is also a superior court judge. 

 

                   Per Lamer
J. (dissenting): Section 11  of the Charter  generally applies to
extradition proceedings taking place in Canada in so far as it would apply to a
preliminary inquiry. The right to be tried within a reasonable time is one of
the rights guaranteed by s. 11  which is applicable to a preliminary inquiry and
an extradition hearing. The liberty and security of the person subjected to the
extradition hearing are affected by the holding of a hearing, and the
principles of fundamental justice require that that hearing be resolved in a
speedy manner. In the case at bar, the computation of time for the purposes of
s. 11 (b) started to run when the first extradition proceedings were
instituted. If the seventeen‑month delay between the discharge of the
respondent in the first hearing and the institution of the second proceedings
is unexplained, such delay constitutes an infringement of the right to be tried
within a reasonable time under s. 11 (b). It is irrelevant whether that
delay was due to the acts of the Argentinian or the Canadian authorities.

 

                   An
extradition judge is not a court of competent jurisdiction within the meaning
of s. 24(1) of the Char‑ ter and an applicant should normally seek
remedy in the superior court. However, as a matter of practice, an application
under s. 24(1)  can be made to the extradition judge if he is also a superior
court judge. At the time of the application in this case, the law as to who had
jurisdiction under s. 24(1)  was not clear, and it might well be that, as a
result, the authorities did not attempt to explain and justify the otherwise
unacceptable delay. Consequently, the matters should be remitted to the
superior court judge presiding at the extradition proceedings for completion of
the s. 24(1)  hearing and, subject to the decision on that issue, to terminate
the extradition proceedings either way.

1.                La Forest J.‑‑This
appeal concerns the application of ss. 7  and 11 (b) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  to extradition proceedings. These provisions
read as follows:

 

                   7. Everyone has
the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be
deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

appeal also raises the question of which courts have jurisdiction respecting
breaches of the Charter  in relation to extradition matters.

 

Facts

 

3.                On
November 8, 1976, the respondent Hector Mellino is alleged to have shot and
killed his wife at their home in Mendoza, Argentina. A warrant for his arrest
was then issued by the appellant Republic of Argentina on June 27, 1977.

 

4.                In
1979, Mellino was arrested in Uruguay and extradition proceedings were begun
against him. However Argentina was unable to supply the necessary documentation
within the time stipulated in its extradition treaty with Uruguay, and Mellino
was accordingly released after two to three weeks' imprisonment.

 

5.                Mellino
later made his way to the United States and eventually entered Canada in the
Fall of 1982. On November 22, 1982, he was arrested in Calgary under the Immigration
Act. Two days later, on November 24, 1982, a warrant for his apprehension
was issued under the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑21, and he
was arrested on November 30. On December 6, 1982, Mellino was ordered to be
held in custody until his extradition hearing, which was set for February 14,
1983. However, he was set free on February 1, 1983. By that time, two months
had elapsed from the time of his apprehension, a period that brought into play
article XIV of the extradition treaty between Canada and Argentina, which
provides for a fugitive's release unless sufficient evidence is produced within
that time to warrant his committal for surrender; see Statutes of Canada,
1894, p. xlii, at p. xlvii. Article XIV also makes provision for an extension
of time but an application for this purpose by the Government of Canada to
Brennan J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta was dismissed and Mellino
was set free.

 

6.                Mellino
then applied for convention refugee status under the Immigration Act,
and was granted that status on December 1, 1983. However, from some time during
the Spring of 1983 up to the first half of 1984, meetings were held between
officials of the Department of Justice of Canada and of Argentina regarding the
preparation of evidence in a form admissible in a Canadian extradition hearing.

 

7.                On
June 19, 1984, Argentina made a second request for extradition. On June 29, a
warrant of apprehension was issued by Rowbotham J., and on or about July 17,
1984, Mellino was again arrested. The extradition hearing was set for September
10, 1984, but on August 31 the Government of Canada applied to Dixon J. for an
extension of time on the ground that a necessary witness, an Argentinian
official, would be absent. The application was refused, but a further
application on the same grounds to Quigley J. on September 10 was successful,
and the extradition hearing was set for October 30, 1984. Subsequently, another
application for an extension of time was made, this time, however, by counsel
for Mellino. The application was granted and the hearing adjourned to December
10, 1984, by which date Mellino had been in custody for nearly five months.

 

8.                At
the commencement of the extradition hearing on December 10, 1984, an
application was made on behalf of Mellino to the presiding judge, Waite J., to
have the proceedings stayed on two grounds: first, that there was an infringement
of s. 11 (b) of the Charter  (trial within a reasonable time), and
second, that the extradition proceedings constituted an abuse of process. On
December 11, 1984, Waite J. found that Mellino's right under s. 11 (b) of
the Charter  had been infringed or denied, and pursuant to s. 24(1)  of
the Charter  dismissed the application for extradition and discharged
Mellino. At the time of his discharge no evidence had been presented in support
of the request for extradition. 

 

9.                Waite
J. held that in the absence of any satisfactory or reasonable explanation, the
17‑month delay between the discharge of Mellino because of evidentiary
problems in the first extradition proceedings on February 1, 1983, and the
institution of the second proceedings on June 29, 1984, was inordinate,
especially having regard to the relatively simple requirements of the Act and
the treaty, and the fact that Mellino's identity had been known to the
Argentinian authorities since at least 1977. He noted that the second proceedings
could not continue on September 10 as originally scheduled because of further
evidentiary problems including the departure from Canada of an essential
Argentinian witness. In his view, the delay in the proceedings was unreasonable
within the meaning of s. 11 (b) of the Charter , particularly
since, as article XIV of the treaty indicated, in extradition proceedings, time
was of the essence.

 

10.              In
dismissing the application and discharging Mellino pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter ,
Waite J. rejected the argument that a judge in an extradition proceeding
was not a court of competent jurisdiction. An extradition judge was equivalent
to a magistrate on a preliminary inquiry in the sense that he exercised the
same powers and applied the same test to the evidence. But in other senses, the
extradition judge had a much broader jurisdiction. First, he had additional
powers under treaty and by statute. Second, he did not sit as a persona
designata but as a court of law properly constituted. Finally, he was and
remained a judge of a superior court with the jurisdiction and powers
appertaining to that position.

 

11.              Application
for leave to this Court was granted on April 4, 1985, [1985] 1 S.C.R. xii.

 

The
Jurisdiction of this Court

 

12.              This
appeal is brought under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
S‑19, which in broad terms empowers this Court to grant leave to appeal
from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a
province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in a particular
case. The Act again underscores the breadth of the provision in s. 2(1) by defining
""the court appealed from"" as ""the court from which the appeal is
brought directly to the Supreme Court, whether such court is one of original
jurisdiction or a court of appeal"", and ""final judgment"" as
""any judgment, rule, order or decision that determines in whole or in part
any substantive right of any of the parties in controversy in any judicial
proceeding"". On a plain reading of these provisions, I would have thought
it obvious that s. 41 applied to the present case. The decision of Waite J., from
which this appeal is taken, finally dismissed the application for extradition
on the ground that s. 11 (b) of the Charter  had been infringed.

 

13.              A
difficulty arises because in United States of America v. Link and Green,
[1955] S.C.R. 183, this Court, in an oral judgment, held that it had no
jurisdiction under s. 41  to grant leave from a refusal of an extradition judge
to commit a fugitive because in its view this was not a ""judgment""
within the meaning of s. 41  of the Supreme Court Act . Counsel for
Argentina pointed out some factual distinctions between that case and the
present, but in my view he rightly stressed the different contexts in which the
two cases were decided. As I noted in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R.
500, released contemporaneously with this case, the prevailing legislative
policy at the time Link and Green was decided was against providing
appeals in extradition cases. Equally, if not more important, most appeals to
this Court were then as of right and, possibly as a defensive measure, the
Court tended to interpret restrictively those areas of appeal over which it had
control. As well, of course, this Court had just recently assumed the role of
final court of appeal for Canada and the implications of this fact had not yet
been fully apprehended.

 

14.              While
there were portents of things to come (see Commonwealth of Puerto Rico v.
Hernandez, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 228, at pp. 231, 232, 240 and 243), a clear
break with the earlier approach was not made until Hill v. The Queen,
[1977] 1 S.C.R. 827. In that case, the Court refused to follow its earlier
decision in Goldhar v. The Queen, [1960] S.C.R. 60, and held that it had
jurisdiction under s. 41  to hear an appeal against sentence. Pigeon J., for the
majority, noted at p. 850 that s. 41  was enacted substantially in its present
form when appeals to the Privy Council (which had had unlimited jurisdiction
with special leave) were abolished and this Court was made truly supreme. It
was apparent, he added, ""that the new provision was intended to effect the
change from a limited specific jurisdiction to a broad general
jurisdiction"". Laskin C.J., in dissent but not on this point, gave further
emphasis to the expanded jurisdiction under s. 41  by saying, at pp. 831‑32,
that he ""would not exclude cases from the leave jurisdiction of this Court
unless it is quite plain that they have been excluded by statute"". Similar
sentiments were expressed by the present Chief Justice, then Dickson J., in R.
v. Gardiner, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368. After a detailed review of the evolution
of the interpretation of s. 41 , he concluded that ""Hill mandated an
expansive reading of s. 41(1), the better to enable this Court to discharge its
role at the apex of the Canadian judicial system, as the court of last resort
for all Canadians"" (p. 404).

 

15.              It
will be obvious from the foregoing that Link and Green is inconsistent
with the reasoning in more recent cases in this Court and should no longer be
followed. I conclude, therefore, that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain
the present appeal. 

 

Section
11 (b) of the Charter 

 

16.              Waite
J. treated the matter in the same way as if Mellino had been charged before him
with a criminal offence in Canada, and held that s. 11 (b) had been
violated. Mellino was, of course, never charged in Canada by any of the
governments to which the Charter  applies (s. 32 ). Rather he was charged
with an offence in Argentina by the government of that country in respect of an
act that took place wholly in Argentina. The prosecution for the offence was,
therefore, wholly within the jurisdiction of Argentina. As I indicated in Schmidt,
supra, s. 11  of the Charter  has no application to extradition
hearings. It is interesting that the courts of the United States have
interpreted the Sixth Amendment of their Constitution guaranteeing speedy
trials as not applying to extradition proceedings: see Jhirad v. Ferrandina,
536 F.2d 478 (2d Cir. 1976); Sabatier v. Dabrowski, 586 F.2d 866 (1st
Cir. 1978); Matter of Burt, 737 F.2d 1477 (7th Cir. 1984).

 

17.              Counsel
for Mellino, however, argued that s. 11 (b) of the Charter  applied
to Mellino by virtue of article V of the treaty which provides that extradition
shall not take place if ""exemption from prosecution or punishment has been
acquired by lapse of time, according to the laws of the state applying or
applied to"". This provision was obviously intended to bring into operation
statutes of limitations that exist in some countries prohibiting prosecution
for certain crimes after a stated lapse of time; for an example, see R. v.
Brixton Prison (Governor of), Ex parte Van der Auwera, [1907] 2 K.B. 157.
Such statutes are relatively easy to apply at an extradition hearing; one
simply has to compute the time in accordance with the provisions of the
statute. Section 11 (b), on the other hand, is not an exemption in that
sense. It gives a Charter  remedy for delay when a prosecution has been
initiated; no fixed time is involved. One must take into account such matters
as whether the delay is unreasonable having regard to the time particular
procedures ordinarily take. In extradition matters, this would surely require
an inquiry into how proceedings are conducted in the foreign country and
involve comparing them with ours. As well, a thorough examination of the facts
surrounding the delay would have to be made, a function, as I explained in Schmidt,
supra, wholly out of keeping with extradition proceedings. It would
require much stronger words than these to persuade me that a treaty provision
of this kind was intended to expand the application of our constitutional
standards for expeditious prosecutions to the international arena. In the
present case, it would require considerable adaptations to apply s. 11 (b)
to the relevant delay. The delay principally complained of is the time elapsed
between the time Mellino was discharged following the first extradition hearing
and the initiation of the second.

 

18.              I
conclude, therefore, that the extradition judge erred in discharging Mellino on
this ground.

 

Abuse of
Process and s. 7  of the Charter 

 

19.              At
the hearing and on this appeal, counsel for Mellino also argued that the delay
in the proceedings constituted an abuse of process. For this position, he
particularly relied on R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128. There, Dickson
C.J., writing for the Court, adopted the view expressed by Dubin J.A. in R.
v. Young (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 329, that at common
law there existed a discretionary power in a trial judge to stay proceedings in
a criminal case for abuse of process

 

where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate
those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of
fair play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a court's process through
oppressive or vexatious proceedings. [pp. 136‑37]

 

Dickson
C.J., however, expressly repeated the caveat made in Young that this is
""a power which can be exercised only in the `clearest of cases'"".

 

20.              It
should be observed, however, that, according to those cases, the power to grant
a stay for abuse of process is vested in the trial judge, not in a judge at a
preliminary hearing. Charter  considerations apart, a judge at
extradition hearing is in a position more closely related to that of a
magistrate at a preliminary hearing. Such matters are to be dealt with at the
trial in the foreign country like other defences. That approach has been
followed in Canada from the development of extradition procedures as one can
see from the often quoted passage of Hagarty C.J. in R. v. Morton and
Thompson (1868), 19 U.C.C.P. 9, at p. 20:

 

                   I have always felt disposed to give
the fairest and most liberal interpretation to the provisions of an arrangement
like this Extradition Treaty, entered into by two nations professing a common
civilization, with a thousand miles of conterminous boundary. They properly
agree that their respective territories shall not be the asylum for those who
commit crimes abhorrent to the laws of both communities. They agree to
surrender, on demand, such persons, to be dealt with according to the laws they
are said to have violated. I have neither the right nor the desire to doubt
that, when surrendered, they will be legally and fairly dealt with. We are not
asked here to pronounce on their guilt or to commit them for trial: all this is
left to the foreign tribunal. We in effect only send them to be examined before
the magistrate, who will decide if a case be made out for their commitment;
just as we send an offender against our own laws to appear on a warrant granted
on the testimony of witnesses he has never seen. 

 

21.              In
this Court, counsel intertwined his contention that there was an abuse of
process with an argument based on s. 7  of the Charter . As with the
simple abuse of process argument, this argument, too, assumes that an
extradition judge has jurisdiction to deal with the issue and grant the
appropriate remedies. It also assumes that the delay can be attributed to
officials of the Canadian government, which I would have thought was a
prerequisite to the application of the Charter  by virtue of s. 32 : see RWDSU
v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573. However, quite apart from
these assumptions, which I shall address later, I am unable to accept this
argument.

 

22.              On
the particular facts of this case, there would be a breach of s. 7  only if
there had been an abuse of process, and that demands that the circumstances
here were such as could be categorized as the ""clearest of cases"". I
do not think this is such a case. The five‑year delay between the laying
of charges against Mellino and his arrest is not in issue. The extradition
process began soon after his arrival in Canada. Immediately following his
arrest, a warrant of apprehension under the Extradition Act was issued,
and an extradition hearing was scheduled. When Argentina failed to produce the
necessary documentation within two months of Mellino's arrest, he was
discharged as required by the treaty. It is the delay that followed that is
said to constitute an abuse of process. Since an extradition is not a trial,
new proceedings may be initiated on the same or new evidence. Seventeen months
after his discharge, Mellino was again arrested following a second request for
his extradition by Argentina. During these months, Mellino was free. There is
no evidence that he was being harassed or interfered with by officials. So far
as the delay might be thought to affect his defence to the charge, that,
primarily owing to his own actions, was already five years old and his ultimate
defence was, therefore, unlikely to have been prejudiced by the lapse of
another 17 months; see in this context Jhirad v. Ferrandina, supra.
In my view, there was no abuse of process or contravention of s. 7 . I should
perhaps add that while Waite J. found the delay to have been unreasonable
for the purposes of s. 11 (b) of the Charter  (a ground already
disposed of), he made no finding that such delay constituted an abuse of
process or contra‑ vened the principles of fundamental justice.

 

23.              In
assessing the issue, a court must not overlook that extradition proceedings
must be approached with a view to conform with Canada's international
obligations. The courts have on many occasions reiterated that the requirements
and technicalities of the criminal law apply only to a limited extent in
extradition proceedings. One cannot view delay resulting from the complexity
involved in dealing with activities that reach across national boundaries and
involve different systems of law and several levels of bureaucracies in the
same way as that in local prosecutions. This is especially so when one
considers that extradition proceedings are but a small part of the many and
variegated responsibilities of diplomatic officials. It is interesting that the
time schedule set forth in article XIV has been described as hectic and
criticized as too onerous: see V. E. Hartley Booth, British Extradition Law
and Procedure (1980), vol. 1, at p. 42.

 

24.              At
all events, the assumption by a Canadian court of responsibility for
supervising the conduct of the diplomatic and prosecutorial officials of a
foreign state strikes me as being in fundamental conflict with the principle of
comity on which extradition is based. Some protection is afforded the fugitive
by article XIV, which provides for his release if the evidence is not
forthcoming within a certain period. This, however, does not make time of the
essence in the manner contemplated by the trial judge. The article simply
ensures that a fugitive is not imprisoned indefinitely pending the presentation
of evidence. Since a discharge at an extradition hearing for lack of evidence,
like that at a preliminary hearing, is not final, it has long been recognized that
new proceedings may be instituted on new, or even on the same evidence before
the judge at the original hearing or another judge: see, for example, Attorney‑General
of Hong Kong v. Kwok‑A‑Sing (1873), L.R. 5 P.C. 179; Re
Harsha (No. 2) (1906), 11 C.C.C. 62 (Ont. H.C.); Armstrong v. State of
Wisconsin, [1972] F.C. 1228 (C.A.) This was recognized by the judge and the
parties, who acted on that basis.

 

25.              The
record does not show that the delay was attributable to Canadian authorities,
which as already stated appears necessary to trigger s. 7 : see s. 32 . So far as
one can gather, delays arose because of problems by the Argentinian authorities
in framing the evidence in a form acceptable under Canadian law. The delay did
not arise out of the conduct of the Canadian proceedings. There is no
suggestion that the necessary documentary evidence was available before the
date of the second request for extradition.

 

26.              Finally,
counsel for Mellino relied on cases based on s. 17 of the Fugitive Offenders
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑32, which gives the courts power to review
whether a surrender under that Act would be unjust or oppressive. But this is
done in a completely different context. Surrender under that Act is not made
under treaty obligation but as a matter of courtesy to Commonwealth countries.
Consequently, Parliament has felt free to expressly authorize the courts not
only to review on these grounds but to impose greater evidentiary demands on
those seeking surrender. These tasks, I might add, would generally be easier to
perform than they would be at an extradition hearing because Commonwealth
countries are heirs to the British criminal justice system.

 

27.              In
my view, there was no abuse of process or contravention of s. 7 . 

 

The
Jurisdiction of the Extradition Judge

 

28.              The
foregoing is sufficient to dispose of the case, but it raises a further and
important issue that merits attention. The extradition judge took the view that
he enjoyed a much broader jurisdiction than that possessed by a magistrate
presiding at a preliminary hearing under the Criminal Code . He was not,
he affirmed, sitting as a persona designata but as a court of law and,
as such, retained all his powers and jurisdiction as a judge of a superior
court except to the extent that the treaty or a statute otherwise provided.

 

29.              I
cannot accept this proposition. It seems to me to ignore the modest function of
an extradition hearing which (barring minimal statutory and treaty exceptions)
is merely to determine whether the relevant crime falls within the appropriate
treaty and whether the evidence presented is sufficient to justify the
executive surrendering the fugitive to the requesting country for trial there.
Responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, including the
performance of Canada's obligations under extradition treaties, is, of course,
vested in the executive. I repeat: the role of the extradition judge is a
modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose
of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima
facie case that the extradition crime has been committed. The procedure
bears a considerable affinity to a preliminary hearing, and the judge's powers
have some similarity to those of a magistrate presiding at such a hearing, who,
as this Court held in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, has no
power to administer Charter  remedies. Indeed, the reasoning in Mills
appears to me to be even more applicable to an extradition judge.

 

30.              The
fact that an extradition judge is often a superior court judge does not alter
the matter. This has nothing to do with the issue of persona designata,
which was discussed in Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development
v. Ranville, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 518, but rather with what the judge is
authorized to do under the Act. The Act clearly spells out the duties of an
extradition judge and it would be strange if his powers differed in accordance
with whether he was a superior court judge, a county court judge or a
commissioner. This reasoning has been adopted in relation to an extradition
judge's power to grant bail: see, for example, Re Global Communications Ltd.
and Attorney‑General for Canada (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.)
It is interesting that in England extradition hearings are held before
magistrates. When the Extradition Act (which was closely patterned on
the English Act) was enacted over 100 years ago in Canada, jurisdiction was no
doubt assigned to the superior and county court judges and commissioners
because of the conditions prevailing in the country at the time. Many of the
justices of the peace at the time may have been thought not to be equal to the
task. There is nothing to suggest that judges acting in extradition matters
were to be given any greater powers than those traditionally possessed by the
English magistrates.

 

31.              In
particular, it is not the business of an extradition judge to assume
responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the
evidence for an extradition hearing. This would seem to me to be in breach of
the most elementary dictates of comity between sovereign states. A foreign
state obviously has jurisdiction over the actions of its officials, although,
no doubt, the executive of this country must, on occasion, consider such
matters in exercising its discretion to surrender a fugitive.

 

32.              Nor
is an extradition judge empowered to weigh the ultimate issue of whether delay
will affect the trial of the action in the foreign country. The treaty places
Canada under an obligation to surrender the fugitive for trial in the
requesting country where such issues are to be considered. The assumption that
the requesting state will give the fugitive a fair trial according to its laws
underlies the whole theory and practice of extradition and our courts have over
many years made it abundantly clear that an extradition judge should not give
effect to any suggestion that the proceedings are oppressive or that the
fugitive will not be given a fair trial or give proper weight to the evidence.
In truth, the assumption by an extradition judge that delay or other defences
would not be given appropriate consideration by the foreign court is even more
offensive than the assumption of control over the actions of foreign diplomatic
and prosecutorial officials. It amounts to a serious adverse reflection not
only on a foreign government to whom Canada has a treaty obligation but on its
judicial authorities concerning matters that are exclusively within their
competence.

 

33.              It
would cripple the operation of our extradition arrangements if extradition
judges were to arrogate the power to consider defences that should properly be
raised at trial. How would we react to foreign courts exercising this kind of
pre‑emptive jurisdiction in relation to trials in this country? There
are, as well, practical considerations such as the limited information
available to an extradition judge and his jurisdictional inability to obtain
it: see, for example, Re Insull, [1933] 3 D.L.R. 709 (Ont. S.C.); Re
United States of America and Smith (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 540 (Ont. C.A.),
at p. 551; United States of America v. Beaurone (1983), 27 Sask. R. 136
(Q.B.), at p. 138. In Schmidt, supra, allusion was made that the
general extradition procedure constituted a reasonable limit under s. 1 on the
right a fugitive may have not to be surrendered for trial: see in this context Re
Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.)
I also noted there that I see nothing offensive to fundamental justice in
surrendering in accordance with our extradition procedures an accused to a
foreign country for trial in accordance with its traditional judicial processes
for a crime alleged to have been committed there. There may, it is true,
conceivably be situations where it would be unjust to surrender a fugitive
either because of the general condition of the governmental and judicial
apparatus or, more likely, because some particular individual may be subjected
to oppressive treatment. These are judgments, however, that are pre‑eminently
within the authority and competence of the executive to make. The courts may,
as guardians of the Constitution, on occasion have a useful role to play in
reviewing such decisions, but it is obviously an area in which courts must
tread with caution. 

 

34.              Situations
may, as is alleged in the present case, also conceivably arise where the
Canadian officials who carry out the prosecution on behalf of the foreign
state, do so in a manner that violates fundamental justice. In such cases,
fundamental justice considerations may come into play that call for Charter 
review. However, not every delay raises such considerations; all the
circumstances must be weighed; see in this context the American case of Matter
of Burt, supra. It should also be noted that releasing a fugitive in
such circumstances raises a serious problem. Is Canada to be absolved of its
treaty obligation to a foreign state to surrender a fugitive because Canadian
officials have been derelict in performing their duties regarding the request
for surrender duly made by that state? This consideration, however, principally
underlines the importance officials must attach to these matters. Theirs,
acting on behalf of the executive, is the duty to carry out Canada's
obligations. The courts, on the other hand, have the duty to ensure that
actions of Canadian officials meet the standards of the Charter . Because
of the seriousness of the matter, however, a court should not lightly attribute
responsibility for delay to Canadian officials. In the present case what little
there is on the record that could be looked upon as involving any lapses on the
part of Canadian officials is highly tenuous. What the record reveals, instead,
is that the delays came about from the difficulty experienced by the
Argentinian authorities in organizing the evidence in a form acceptable under
Canadian procedures. The circumstances are not, in my view, sufficiently
lengthy or inconvenient as to make surrender under these circumstances
sufficiently oppressive as to violate the principles of fundamental justice.

 

35.              In
the rare cases where the actions of Canadian executives or officials may give
rise to the need for Charter  review, I do not think the extradition
judge has Charter  jurisdiction. For reasons of efficiency, the Act and
the treaty have strictly confined his role. Parliament has indicated how
extradition proceedings are to be reviewed‑‑by superior courts by
means of the writ of habeas corpus. A court in habeas corpus
proceedings is ordinarily confined to questions of jurisdiction, but as such
proceedings are contemplated by Parliament as the sole means of review in
extradition proceedings, and from which, moreover, it has provided appeals to
the Court of Appeal and to this Court, a court in habeas corpus
proceedings is obviously the court of competent jurisdiction for the purposes
of s. 24  of the Charter . It is interesting that a somewhat similar
approach has been taken in the United States. In Matter of Burt, supra,
the United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, held that the merits of a
petitioner's due process claim could be considered as part of a habeas
corpus review. The court thus put it, at p. 1484:

 

                   We hold that federal courts
undertaking habeas corpus review of extraditions have the authority to consider
not only procedural defects in the extradition procedures that are of
constitutional dimension, but also the substantive conduct of the United States
in undertaking its decision to extradite if such conduct violates
constitutional rights.

 

36.              Not
only are the actions of Canadian officials in relation to extradition
proceedings subject to review under the Charter , so too as I noted in Schmidt,
supra, is the executive's exercise of discretion in surrendering a
fugitive. However, this jurisdiction, as I there observed, must be exercised
with the utmost circumspection consistent with the executive's pre‑eminent
position in matters of external relations. The courts may intervene if the
decision to surrender a fugitive for trial in a foreign country would in the
particular circumstances violate the principles of fundamental justice. But, as
already noted, it does not violate such principles to surrender a person to be
tried for a crime he is alleged to have committed in a foreign country in the
absence of exceptional circumstances. Our courts must assume that he will be
given a fair trial in the foreign country. Matters of due process generally are
to be left for the courts to determine at the trial there as they would be if
he were to be tried here. Attempts to pre‑empt decisions on such matters,
whether arising through delay or otherwise, would directly conflict with the
principles of comity on which extradition is based; for a similar view in the
United States, see Jhirad v. Ferrandina, supra. Should there be
circumstances so substantial as to give rise to questions whether surrendering
a fugitive would constitute a breach of fundamental justice, the extradition
judge should bring them to the attention of the executive; see Royal
Government of Greece v. Brixton Prison Governor, [1969] 3 All E.R. 1337
(H.L.)

 

37.              Finally,
in exercising jurisdiction over executive action, a court must firmly keep in
mind that it is in the executive that the discretion to surrender a fugitive is
vested. Consequently, barring obvious or urgent circumstances, the executive
should not be pre‑empted. In cases where the feared wrong may be avoided
by interstate arrangements, it may be doubted that the courts should ordinarily
intervene before the executive has made an order of surrender. As already
mentioned, the primary responsibility for the conduct of external relations
must lie with the executive. The executive may well be able to obtain
sufficient assurances from the foreign country to ensure compliance with the
requirements of fundamental justice. It would, of course, be open to the courts
to review any such arrangements to ensure compliance with Charter 
requirements. However, a court would have to be extremely circumspect in taking
such a course. It should not lightly assume that the executive has ignored its
undoubted duty to ensure that its actions conform to constitutional
requirements or that a foreign country would not act in good faith in complying
with such assurances.

 

38.              It
is clear in any event that these issues are not to be dealt with by the
extradition judge.

 

Conclusion

 

39.              For
these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of Waite J. and
remit the matter to an extradition judge to continue the proceedings in
accordance with the law. 

 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

40.              Lamer J. (dissenting)‑‑I
have read the reasons of my colleague Justice La Forest and agree with him that
this Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal. I also agree with him that
this matter should be remitted below albeit for a different purpose.

 

41.              As
I discussed in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, s. 11  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  generally applies to the extradition hearing
in so far as it would apply to a preliminary inquiry. In my view, s. 11 (b)
is one of the rights guaranteed by s. 11  which is applicable to a preliminary
inquiry and an extradition hearing. The liberty and security of the person
subjected to the extradition hearing are affected by the holding of a hearing,
and the principles of fundamental justice require that that hearing be resolved
in a speedy manner.

 

42.              The
delay at issue here is the 17‑month delay between the discharge of
Mellino because of evidentiary problems in the first extradition proceedings
and the institution of the second proceedings. As this Court held in Carter
v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 981, at p. 985 with respect to the
computation of time under s. 11 (b):

 

                   As I have indicated in Mills v.
The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863, which has been handed down this same day,
the time frame to be considered in computing trial within a reasonable time
generally runs only from the moment a person is charged. In passing, I might
add that I say ""generally"" because there might be exceptional
circumstances under which the time might run prior to the actual charge on
which the accused will be tried. As an example, if the Crown withdraws the
charge to substitute a different one but for the same transaction, the
computation of time might well commence as of the first charge.

 

The
computation of time for the purposes of s. 11 (b) thus started to run
when the first extradition proceedings were instituted. I am of the view that
the 17‑month delay between the discharge of the respondent in the first
hearing and the institution of the second proceedings, if unexplained,
constitutes an infringement of the right to be tried within a reasonable time
under s. 11 (b). It is in my view irrelevant whether that delay was due
to the acts of the Argentinian or the Canadian authorities, as the respondent's
right is no less infringed whatever may be the source of the delay. Further,
both governments are in a sense partners in the undertaking and it could be
said that there is a domestication of the conduct of the Argentinian
authorities.

 

43.              As
I discussed in United States v. Allard, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 564, an
extradition judge is not a court of competent jurisdiction under s. 24(1)  and
applicants should seek remedy in the superior court. The extradition judge in
this case, however, was a judge of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, which is
a superior court. As in Allard, I think that, as a matter of practice,
an application under s. 24(1)  can be made to the extradition judge if he is
also a superior court judge. At the time of the application in this case,
however, the law as to who had jurisdiction under s. 24(1)  was not clear, and
it might well be that, as a result, the authorities did not attempt to explain
and justify the otherwise unacceptable delay. This being so, I would allow the
appeal and send matters back to Waite J. so that he can complete the s. 24(1) 
hearing and, subject to his decision on that issue, terminate the extradition
proceedings either way. 

 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

44.              Wilson J.‑‑I
agree with Justice La Forest for the reasons given by him that this Court has
jurisdiction to hear this appeal. I disagree with him, however, for the reasons
I gave in Canada v. Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, that s. 11  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  has no application to extradition
proceedings. I think that Charter  rights may be pleaded in such
proceedings and that (subject to the application of s. 1  which I leave open)
there could undoubtedly come a point at which the delay in pursuing extradition
in Canada would be unreasonable and s. 11 (b) could properly be invoked.
I do not believe, however, that this is such a case.

 

45.              A
lapse of time which might be unreasonable and constitute a violation of s. 11 (b)
in a purely domestic proceeding may, in my view, be fairly justified in a
proceeding with foreign elements. But I do not think it appropriate for a
Canadian court to call a foreign state to account for delay caused by it.
To this extent I agree with La Forest J. as to the role of international
comity. The Canadian court seized of the extradition proceedings can call the
Canadian authorities to account and demand of them an explanation for any
seemingly unreasonable delay but it cannot, in my view, do the same with the
authorities in a foreign country. Accordingly, unlike my colleague Justice
Lamer, I believe that any delay relied on under s. 11 (b) must be delay
caused by the Canadian authorities. The reason for this conclusion is, in
essence, that an assessment of the reasonableness or otherwise of a delay
presupposes the right to demand an explanation for it. If this right is not
there, no assessment can be made. It cannot be determined whether the foreign
delay was reasonable or not. That delay cannot therefore be considered under s.
11 (b).

 

46.              This
case and United States v. Allard, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 564 (released
contemporaneously herewith), are distinguishable from Schmidt (also
released contemporaneously) in this respect. No breach of international comity
is involved in Schmidt. No autonomous foreign authority is being called
to account in Schmidt. No foreign law is being criticized in Schmidt.
The only issue in Schmidt is the scope of our own constitutional
protections. Are they available to a person involved in Canadian extradition
proceedings?

 

47.              For
the respondent to succeed in this case he would, in my view, have to establish
that the delay caused by the Canadian authorities was unreasonable. Since I do
not see how he could possibly discharge that burden on the facts of this case,
I agree with La Forest J. that the extradition judge was in error in
discharging Mellino on the basis that his s. 11 (b) right had been
violated.

 

48.              With
respect to Mellino's argument that the delay in the extradition proceedings
constituted an abuse of process or a violation of s. 7  of the Charter ,
again for the reasons I gave in Schmidt, I think it was perfectly open
to the accused to raise these issues in the extradition proceedings. However,
since the essence of the complaint is again the delay which was in large part
due to the conduct of the Argentinian authorities, the argument based on abuse
of process or s. 7  of the Charter  must also fail.

 

49.              On
the issue of the jurisdiction of the extradition court judge, I agree with
Lamer J. that an application may be made to such a judge under s. 24(1)  of the Charter 
if, as in this case, he is also a superior court judge.

 

50.              I
would allow the appeal and remit the matter back to Waite J. to continue the
extradition proceedings in accordance with law.

on
appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ First degree murder ‑‑ Indecent assault against
a young boy ‑‑ Accused killing the child after the indecent assault
‑‑ Whether accused murdered the child ""while committing""
the indecent assault ‑‑ Meaning of the words ""while
committing"" in s. 214(5) (b) of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Murder ‑‑ Classification ‑‑ Section
214  of the Criminal Code  not creating a separate substantive offence of murder ‑‑
Section 214  classifying for sentencing purposes the offences in ss. 212 and 213
of the Code.

 

                   The
accused murdered a young boy two minutes after indecently assaulting him. The
killing was motivated by fear that the child would tell his mother about the
incident. At trial, the jury found the accused guilty of first degree murder
pursuant to s. 214(5) (b) of the Criminal Code . At the time of the
offence, s. 214(5) (b) provided that ""murder is first degree murder
in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person while
committing an offence under section . . . 156 (indecent assault on a
male)"". The Court of Appeal dismissed the accused's appeal but substituted
a verdict of second degree murder for the jury's verdict of first degree
murder. This appeal is to determine whether the accused murdered the child
""while committing"" the indecent assault.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

 

                   The
words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  do not require the murder and
the underlying offence to take place simultaneously. Where the act causing
death and the acts constituting the indecent assault all form part of one
continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction, the death is caused
""while committing"" an offence for the purposes of s. 214(5) . The
offences under s. 214(5)  all involve the illegal domination of people by other
people. Accordingly, it is the continuing illegal domination of the victim
which gives continuity to the sequence of events culminating in the murder and
makes it a single transaction. The murder represents an exploitation of the
position of power created by the underlying crime and knits the two together.
The conviction of first degree murder should be restored.

214(5)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, as
amended by S.C. 1974‑75‑76, c. 105, which was in force at the time
of the commission of the offence provided that murder is first degree murder
when the death is caused by a person while the person is committing indecent
assault. The respondent, Marc‑André Paré, indecently assaulted and
murdered a seven‑year‑old boy, Steeve Duranleau. The central issue
in this appeal is whether the respondent murdered the child ""while
committing"" the indecent assault.

 

2.                While
sections 213 and 214 were subsequently amended by An Act to amend the
Criminal Code in relation to sexual offences and other offences against the
person and to amend certain other Acts in relation thereto or in consequence
thereof, S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83, c. 125, the amendments are
not germane to the issue on this appeal.

 

1. The
Facts

 

3.                On
July 13, 1982 at about 1:30 in the afternoon the respondent Marc‑André
Paré, then 17 years old, met Steeve Duranleau, a seven‑year‑old
boy. At Paré's suggestion the two went swimming. After about fifteen minutes in
the pool Paré offered to take Duranleau to look at some used cars. The offer
was only a pretence. Paré's real motive was to get Duranleau alone in order to
have sexual relations with him.

 

4.                After
changing, Paré and Duranleau went to a parking lot where they looked at some
used cars. Near the parking lot was a bridge that crossed the St. Charles
River. Paré lured Duranleau under the bridge. Duranleau wanted to leave but
Paré told him not to and held him by the arm. Paré sat there for the next ten
minutes holding Duranleau by the arm. Then Paré told Duranleau to lie on his
back and to keep quiet. Paré pulled Duranleau's shorts down and lowered his own
pants and underwear. He then lay on top of Duranleau and indecently assaulted
him. After ejaculating beside Duranleau's penis, Paré sat up and got dressed.

 

5.                At
this point Duranleau told Paré that he intended to tell his mother about the
incident. Paré told him that he did not want him to tell his mother and that,
if he did, he would kill him. After this exchange of words Paré was certain
that the boy would tell his mother as soon as he could. Paré made Duranleau lie
on his back. He waited for two minutes with his hand on Duranleau's chest. He
then killed Duranleau by strangling him with his hands, hitting him on the head
several times with an oil filter, and strangling him with a shoe‑lace.

 

6.                The
accused was charged as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  That in Québec City, Quebec, on or around
July 13, 1982, he illegally and intentionally killed Steeve Duranleau, thereby
committing murder in the first degree contrary to sections 212‑214(5)‑218
of the Criminal Code .

 

At trial
the accused admitted all the facts outlined above. On December 7, 1982 the
accused was found guilty of first degree murder. The accused's appeal to the
Quebec Court of Appeal was dismissed on April 2, 1985 (per L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Beauregard and LeBel JJ.A.), the court substituting a verdict of second degree
murder for the jury's verdict of first degree murder: J.E. 85‑556. Leave
to appeal was granted to the Crown by this Court (per Beetz, Lamer and
Wilson JJ.) on June 27, 1985, [1985] 1 S.C.R. xii.

 

2. The
Courts Below

 

The
Superior Court

 

7.                In
his charge to the jury Bienvenue J. discussed the meaning of the words
""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  of the Criminal Code . Since
this appeal hinges upon the meaning of these words it is necessary to reproduce
the relevant comments of the trial judge:

 

                   [TRANSLATION]  Then, section 214(2)
and (5)(b) states the following:

 

"". . . is [est assimilé au] first (1st)
degree murder""

 

‑‑I do not think that the word ""assimilé""
presents any problem to you and me, it is a word which simply means ""is
first (1st) degree murder"", okay, it's a first (1st) degree murder, the
following ‑

 

""murder . . . while committing"";

 

‑‑or if you prefer instead of ""while
committing"" [concomitant] I will suggest a number of expressions
that mean the same thing, namely ""committed on the occasion of"",
""committed at the time of"", ""accompanying"" and so on; the
following, ""which occurred at the same time as"": all these words are
synonyms of ""while committing"";

 

and so

 

""murder . . . while committing"", or if you
prefer, ""which was committed on the occasion of the crime specified in s.
156  of the Criminal Code  (indecent assault on male)"".

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   I am sure you realize ‑‑
I do not think it is even necessary to say it ‑‑ I rely on the
intelligence of you all, but in case anyone should someday claim I had not said
it, when you say ""while committing"", it means ""committed at the
same time"", ""on the same occasion""; you realize the Code does
not go so far as to require that at the time I commit an indecent assault with
my right hand I must be committing murder with my left. Is not it so? In this
the Code is logical: when it says ""at the same time"", committed
""on the same occasion"", it means ""in the same circumstances"".

 

The jury
found the accused guilty of first degree murder.

 

The
Court of Appeal for Quebec

 

8.                Beauregard
and LeBel JJ.A. gave separate reasons; L'Heureux‑Dubé J.A. agreed with
both. Beauregard J.A. examined the case law and decided that s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  should be restrictively interpreted. He concluded that ""while
committing"" must be contrasted with ""after having finished
committing"". A murder committed after the accused had committed the
indecent assault was not a first degree murder. Accordingly, when the trial
judge said to the jury that a murder committed ""on the occasion of""
an indecent assault was a first degree murder, he did not invite the jury to
consider the really critical question, namely whether the murder was committed
during the commission of the indecent assault or after the indecent assault was
over.

 

9.                Beauregard
J.A. was of the opinion that a properly directed jury would not have been
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused murdered his victim while
committing the indecent assault. Consequently, he dismissed the appeal and
substituted a verdict of second degree murder for the verdict of first degree
murder.

 

10.              LeBel
J.A. did not agree with Beauregard J.A.'s conclusion that s. 214(5)  required
the murder and the indecent assault to be absolutely simultaneous. Even if the
section were to be construed restrictively, he stated, it must not be deprived
of all effect. By reading s. 214(5)  in conjunction with s. 213, LeBel J.A.
concluded that the words ""while committing"" demanded a close temporal
connection between the indecent assault and the murder. Moreover, he concluded
that the murder must be an immediate consequence of the first offence for s.
214(5)  to apply. LeBel J.A. found it difficult to conclude that a jury more
completely informed of the nuances of the sections in question would have
necessarily returned the same verdict. The charge given to the jury, he stated,
effectively prevented the jury from directing its attention to the proper
meaning of s. 214(5) . Therefore, despite his reservations about Beauregard
J.A.'s conclusions of law, LeBel J.A. agreed with his disposition of the case.

 

3. The
Issue

 

11.              Counsel
for the appellant submit that the Court of Appeal made two errors in law.
First, it erred in concluding that s. 214(5)  of the Criminal Code 
created a substantive offence of murder. Second, it erred in its interpretation
of the words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5) . I will address both
issues looking first at the general scheme of the murder provisions in the Criminal
Code  and then turning to the interpretation of the particular wording of s.
214(5) .

 

(a) The
General Scheme

 

12.              Counsel
for the appellant submit that the Court of Appeal viewed s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  as creating a substantive offence of murder. I find nothing in the
judgments rendered by the Court of Appeal that suggests that this was the case.
In any event, counsel for the respondent acknowledge that such an approach
would be improper and I agree. Section 214  has a completely different function.

 

13.              The
relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  are as follows:

 

                   212. Culpable homicide
is murder

 

                   (a) where the person who
causes the death of a                 human being

 

(i) means to cause his death, or

 

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is
likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;

 

                   (b) where a person, meaning to
cause death to a                human being or meaning to cause him bodily harm
       that he knows is likely to cause his death, and              being
reckless whether death ensues or not, by        accident or mistake causes
death to another                human being, notwithstanding that he does not        mean
to cause death or bodily harm to that human       being; or

 

                   (c) where a person, for an
unlawful object, does                 anything that he knows or ought to know
is        likely to cause death, and thereby causes death           to a human
being, notwithstanding that he        desires to effect his object without
causing                   death or bodily harm to any human being.

 

                   213. Culpable homicide
is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while committing or
attempting to commit high treason or treason or an offence mentioned in section
52 (sabotage), 76 (piratical acts), 76.1 (hijacking an aircraft), 132 or
subsection 133(1) or sections 134 to 136 (escape or rescue from prison or
lawful custody), 143 or 145 (rape or attempt to commit rape), 149 or 156
(indecent assault), subsection 246(2) (resisting lawful arrest), 247
(kidnapping and forcible confinement), 302 (robbery), 306 (breaking and
entering) or 389 or 390 (arson), whether or not the person means to cause death
to any human being and whether or not he knows that death is likely to be
caused to any human being, if

 

(a) he means to cause bodily harm for the purpose
                                of

 

(i) facilitating the commission of the offence, or

 

(ii) facilitating his flight after committing or
attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

 

                   (b) he administers a
stupefying or overpowering                 thing for a purpose mentioned in
paragraph (a),        and the death ensues therefrom;

 

                   (c) he wilfully stops, by any
means, the breath                    of a human being for a purpose mentioned
in        paragraph (a), and the death ensues therefrom;           or

 

                   (d) he uses a weapon or has it
upon his person

 

(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to
commit the offence, or

 

(ii) during or at the time of his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

 

                          and the death ensues as a
consequence.

 

                   214. (1) Murder is
first degree murder or second degree murder.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (5) Irrespective of whether a murder
is planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree
murder in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person

 

(a) while committing or attempting to commit an
offence under section 76.1 (hijacking aircraft) or 247 (kidnapping and forcible
confinement); or

 

(b) while committing an offence under section 144
(rape) or 145 (attempt to commit rape) or while committing or attempting to
commit an offence under section 149 (indecent assault on female) or 156
(indecent assault on male).

 

It is
clear from a reading of these provisions that s. 214 serves a different
function from ss. 212 and 213. Sections 212 and 213 create the substantive
offence of murder. Section 214 is simply concerned with classifying for
sentencing purposes the offences created by ss. 212 and 213. It tells us
whether the murder is first degree or second degree. This view of s. 214 was
expressly adopted by this Court in R. v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 124 (per
Dickson J. (as he then was) at p. 140) and in Droste v. The Queen,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 208 (per Dickson J. (as he then was) at p. 218). In this
case it is established that the respondent murdered Steeve Duranleau. The issue
is whether s. 214(5) (b) makes the murder first degree.

 

(b) Section
214(5) : ""while committing"":

 

14.              (i)
The Literal Meaning

 

15.              Did
the respondent murder Duranleau while committing an indecent assault? Counsel
for the respondent submit that he did not. The argument here is simple. The
murder occurred, it is submitted, after the indecent assault was complete.
Thus, by a literal reading of s. 214(5)  Paré did not murder Duranleau
""while committing"" an indecent assault.

 

16.              This
argument is a forceful one but by no means decisive. The literal meaning of
words could equally be termed their acontextual meaning. As Professor Dworkin
points out, the literal or acontextual meaning of words is ""the meaning we
would assign them if we had no special information about the context of their
use or the intentions of their author"": see R. Dworkin, Law's Empire
(1986), at p. 17. Thus the words ""while committing"" could have one
meaning when disembodied from the Criminal Code  and another entirely
when read in the context of the scheme and purpose of the legislation. It is
the latter meaning that we must ascertain.

 

17.              A
preliminary problem in ascertaining the contextual meaning of the phrase
""while committing"" arises from a possible inconsistency between the
French and English versions of s. 214(5) . At the time of the offence the French
version of the English words ""while committing"" was ""concomitant"".
In 1983 the word ""concomitant"" was replaced by the phrase
""en commettant"". Is this change in wording in the French
version significant to the interpretation of s. 214(5) ? I think not. I would
agree with Beauregard J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal who said
[TRANSLATION]  ""The amendment does not appear to have introduced anything
new. The word `concomitant' meant `while committing' or `en
commettant' "".

 

(ii) The
Case Law

 

18.              I
now turn to cases which throw some light on the meaning of the words
""while committing"". Counsel for the appellant submit that these words
in s. 214(5)  should not be held to require the murder and the underlying
offence to take place simultaneously. They seek to support this contention by
reference to the judicial interpretation of the same words in s. 213.

 

19.              Section
213 transforms culpable homicide into murder where a person causes the death of
a human being ""while committing"" any one of a number of serious
offences, provided that the case falls within one of the four categories listed
in clauses 213(a) to 213(d). The cases have consistently
construed the words ""while committing"" in s. 213 to include cases
where the homicide is committed during flight after commission of the
underlying offence: see R. v. Vaillancourt (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 137
(Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1976] 1 S.C.R. 13; R. v. Stevens (1984), 11 C.C.C.
(3d) 518 (Ont. C.A.) The appellant's argument is that because ""while
committing"" is broadly construed in s. 213 it should also be broadly
construed in s. 214(5) .

 

20.              This
argument, in my view, is not sound. The particular construction placed on the
words ""while committing"" in s. 213 was mandated by the reference to
flight in paras. (a)(ii) and (d)(ii) of that section. As Martin
J.A. noted in Stevens, supra, at p. 540: ""Any other interpretation
[of the words ""while committing""] would deprive paras. (a)(ii)
and (d)(ii) of s. 213 of any meaning and would render them
inoperative . . . ."" Section 214(5) , however, contains
no such references to flight. Thus, no analogy may properly be drawn from
judicial interpretation of the words ""while committing"" in s. 213.
The same words appearing in s. 214(5)  must be interpreted in the particular
context of that section.

 

21.              In
R. v. Gourgon and Knowles (No. 1) (1979), 9 C.R. (3d) 313 (B.C.S.C.)
(appeal allowed on other grounds (1979), 19 C.R. (3d) 272 (B.C.C.A.)), Anderson
J. construed the words very narrowly. He stated at p. 319:

 

                   The words ""while
committing"" in s. 214(5)  relate to the time of the commission of the
offence of ""forcibly confining"" and to no other time.

 

                   I agree that the words ""while
committing"" in s. 214(5)  do not apply to ""flight"", and that
unlike s. 213, the words ""while committing"" do not have to be given
an extended meaning to make sense out of s. 214(5) .

 

It
should be noted, however, that Anderson J.'s comments on the interpretation
issue were obiter since in that case the underlying offence of
confinement was continuing at the very instant the death took place.

 

22.              Further
support for the narrow interpretation is found in two subsequent cases: R.
v. Kjeldsen (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 55 (Alta. C.A.), and R. v. Sargent (1983),
5 C.C.C. (3d) 429 (Sask. C.A.) In the latter case, the victim was killed after
she had been raped by either the appellant or his companion or both. Hall J.A.,
speaking for the Court concluded at p. 436:

 

                   It is manifest that the jury, in
returning a verdict of guilty of first degree murder accepted those portions of
the evidence which were most unfavourable to the appellant. However, in that
event, there is no basis upon which the jury could return the verdict which
they did. If the jury found, on the evidence before them, that a rape had
occurred, it is clear that the death of the deceased did not occur while that
offence was being committed. That is, there was no evidence to support the
finding that the actions which resulted in the death of Lenny Lou Cosgrove were
perpetrated by the appellant (either alone or with Massong) while committing
the offence of rape. On the only evidence before the jury, the murder was
committed after the actual rape. Therefore the provisions of s. 214(5)  do not
apply to establish the offence of first degree murder: see R. v.
Kjeldsen . . . .

 

23.              Kjeldsen
took the same approach. In that case the appellant raped his victim and then
tied her up. A short time later she freed herself and the appellant then killed
her. At trial the appellant was convicted of first degree murder. The Court of
Appeal substituted a conviction of second degree murder. The Court did not
analyze the meaning of the words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  but
appeared to assume that these words required the underlying offence and the
murder to occur simultaneously (p. 85).

 

24.              The
courts, however, have not been unanimous in adopting the narrow interpretation.
In R. v. Stevens, supra, another case of rape and murder, Martin J.A.
held that there was sufficient evidence on which a jury could conclude that the
murder took place during the commission of an indecent assault. He went on,
however, to make some interesting comments on the interpretation of the words
""while committing"" in s. 214(5) . At page 541, he states:

 

                   Thus, it appears clear that where
death is caused after the underlying offence is complete and the act causing
death is committed for the purpose of facilitating the flight of the offender,
the murder is not under ss. 213  and 214(5) (b) first degree murder.

 

                   I do not wish, however, to be taken
as holding that where the act causing death and the acts constituting the rape,
attempted rape, indecent assault or an attempt to commit indecent assault, as
the case may be, all form part of one continuous sequence of events forming a
single transaction, that death would not be caused during the commission of the
offence, even though the underlying offence in s. 213 in a sense could be said
to be then complete.

 

The
suggestion here is that the words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  do
not require an exact coincidence of the murder with the underlying offence.
Rather, they require a close temporal and causative link between the two. Which
of the competing interpretations should be adopted?

 

(iii) Strict
Construction

 

25.              Counsel
for the respondent argue that the doctrine of strict construction of criminal
statutes requires that this Court adopt the interpretation most favourable to
the accused. According to this argument the words ""while committing""
must be narrowly construed so as to elevate murder to first degree only when
the death and the underlying offence occur simultaneously. In order to assess
the validity of this position we must examine the doctrine of strict
construction.

 

26.              The
doctrine is one of ancient lineage. It reached its pinnacle of importance in a
former age when the death penalty attached to a vast array of offences. As
Stephen Kloepfer points out in his article ""The Status of Strict
Construction in Canadian Criminal Law"" (1983), 15 Ottawa L. Rev.
553, at pp. 556‑60, the doctrine was one of many tools employed by the
judiciary to soften the impact of the Draconian penal provisions of the time.
Over the past two centuries criminal law penalties have become far less severe.
Criminal law remains, however, the most dramatic and important incursion that
the state makes into individual liberty. Thus, while the original justification
for the doctrine has been substantially eroded, the seriousness of imposing criminal
penalties of any sort demands that reasonable doubts be resolved in favour of
the accused.

 

27.              This
point was underlined by Dickson J. (as he then was) in Marcotte v. Deputy
Attorney General for Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108, at p. 115:

 

It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of clarity
and certainty when freedom is at stake. No authority is needed for the
proposition that if real ambiguities are found, or doubts of substance arise,
in the construction and application of a statute affecting the liberty of a
subject, then that statute should be applied in such a manner as to favour the
person against whom it is sought to be enforced. If one is to be incarcerated,
one should at least know that some Act of Parliament requires it in express
terms, and not, at most, by implication.

 

The
continued vitality of the doctrine is further evidenced by the decisions in R.
v. Goulis (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 347 (Ont. C.A.), and Paul v. The Queen,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 621. The question, therefore, is not whether the doctrine of
strict construction exists but what its implications are for this case.

 

(iv) Applying
the Doctrine

 

28.              As
we have noted above, it is clearly grammatically possible to construe the words
""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  as requiring murder to be classified
as first degree only if it is exactly coincidental with the underlying offence.
This, however, does not end the question. We still have to determine whether
the narrow interpretation of ""while committing"" is a reasonable one,
given the scheme and purpose of the legislation.

 

29.              In
my view, the construction that counsel for the respondent would have us place
on these words is not one that could reasonably be attributed to Parliament.
The first problem with the exactly simultaneous approach flows from the
difficulty in defining the beginning and end of an indecent assault. In this case,
for example, after ejaculation the respondent sat up and put his pants back on.
But for the next two minutes he kept his hand on his victim's chest. Was this
continued contact part of the assault? It does not seem to me that important
issues of criminal law should be allowed to hinge upon this kind of
distinction. An approach that depends on this kind of distinction should be
avoided if possible.

 

30.              A
second difficulty with the exactly simultaneous approach is that it leads to
distinctions that are arbitrary and irrational. In the present case, had the
respondent strangled his victim two minutes earlier than he did, his guilt of
first degree murder would be beyond dispute. The exactly simultaneous approach
would have us conclude that the two minutes he spent contemplating his next
move had the effect of reducing his offence to one of second degree murder.
This would be a strange result. The crime is no less serious in the latter case
than in the former; indeed, if anything, the latter crime is more serious since
it involves some element of deliberation. An interpretation of s. 214(5)  that
runs contrary to common sense is not to be adopted if a reasonable alternative
is available.

 

31.              In
my view, such an interpretation has been provided by Martin J.A. in Stevens,
supra. As noted above, Martin J.A. suggested that ""where the act
causing death and the acts constituting the rape, attempted rape, indecent
assault or an attempt to commit indecent assault, as the case may be, all form
part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction""
the death was caused ""while committing"" an offence for the purposes
of s. 214(5) . This interpretation eliminates the need to draw artificial lines
to separate the commission and the aftermath of an indecent assault. Further,
it eliminates the arbitrariness inherent in the exactly simultaneous approach.
I would, therefore, respectfully adopt Martin J.A.'s single transaction
analysis as the proper construction of s. 214(5) .

 

32.              This
approach, it seems to me, best expresses the policy considerations that
underlie the provision. Section 214, as we have seen, classifies murder as
either first or second degree. All murders are serious crimes. Some murders,
however, are so threatening to the public that Parliament has chosen to impose
exceptional penalties on the perpetrators. One such class of murders is that
found in s. 214(5) , murders done while committing a hijacking, a kidnapping and
forcible confinement, a rape, or an indecent assault. An understanding of why
this class of murder is elevated to murder in the first degree is a helpful
guide to the interpretation of the language.

 

33.              The
Law Reform Commission of Canada addressed this issue in its paper on Homicide
(Working Paper 33, 1984). At page 79, the paper states:

 

. . . there is a lack of rationale in the law.
Subsection 214(5)  provides that, whether planned and deliberate or not, murder
is first degree murder when committed in the course of certain listed offences.
It is curious that the list there given is considerably shorter than that given
in section 213 which makes killing murder if done in the commission of certain
specified offences. Inspection and comparison of the two lists, however, reveal
no organizing principle in either of them and no rationale for the
difference between them.

 

With
respect, I disagree. The offences listed in s. 214(5)  are all offences
involving the unlawful domination of people by other people. Thus an organizing
principle for s. 214(5)  can be found. This principle is that where a murder is
committed by someone already abusing his power by illegally dominating another,
the murder should be treated as an exceptionally serious crime. Parliament has
chosen to treat these murders as murders in the first degree.

 

34.              Refining
then on the concept of the ""single transaction"" referred to by Martin
J.A. in Stevens, supra, it is the continuing illegal domination of the
victim which gives continuity to the sequence of events culminating in the
murder. The murder represents an exploitation of the position of power created
by the underlying crime and makes the entire course of conduct a ""single
transaction"". This approach, in my view, best gives effect to the
philosophy underlying s. 214(5) .

 

35.              (v)
The Charge to the Jury

 

36.              Given
this interpretation of s. 214(5) , was Bienvenue J.'s charge to the jury
acceptable? The trial judge gave a number of definitions of ""while
committing"". I do not think, however, that these definitions would have
confused the jury or included events too remote from the underlying offence.
The words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  include conduct which is
part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction with the
underlying offence. The trial judge's instruction to the jury was in line with
this interpretation since it emphasized the need for connection between the two
offences but without demanding that they occurred simultaneously.

 

4. Conclusion

 

37.              The
respondent murdered Steeve Duranleau two minutes after indecently assaulting
him. The killing was motivated by fear that the boy would tell his mother about
the indecent assault. The jury found the respondent guilty of first degree
murder. They were entitled to do so. The murder was temporally and causally
connected to the underlying offence. It formed part of one continuous sequence
of events. It was part of the same transaction.

 

38.              I
would allow the appeal and restore the conviction of first degree murder.

                   Three
years before the proclamation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
appellant was convicted of gross indecency under s. 157  of the Criminal Code ,
found to be a dangerous offender and sentenced to indeterminate detention.
Appellant's appeal from this determination and sentence was dismissed. Gross
indecency was later deleted from the definition of ""serious personal
injury offence"" with the result that conviction under that offence no
longer permits the making of an application under Part XXI of the Code.

 

                   Appellant
queried the lawfulness of his continued detention and commenced the present
proceedings seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum with certiorari
in aid and additionally, or in the alternative, a remedy pursuant to s. 24(1) 
of the Charter . The application was dismissed and the Ontario Court of
Appeal upheld that decision. At issue here, in addition to the ss. 7 , 9 , 11 ,
and 12  Charter  issues considered in R. v. Lyons, is whether the
continued detention of a person, found to be a dangerous offender and sentenced
to indeterminate detention, is valid under the Charter  where the offence
of which he was convicted is no longer one in respect of which indeterminate
detention may be imposed.

 

                   Held (Wilson
J. dissenting in part and Estey J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and McIntyre, Lamer, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: The present Part XXI of
the Criminal Code  does not infringe the Charter : R. v. Lyons.

 

                   A
change in the law that deletes the offence of which the appellant was convicted
from the list of offences in respect of which indeterminate detention may be
imposed does not alter the status of a dangerous offender. The detention of a
""dangerous offender"" is not reviewable by writ of habeas corpus
or under ss. 9  or 12  of the Charter , even if the offender ceases to have
the characteristics of dangerousness that formed the basis for his
indeterminate detention. The argument that ""dangerousness"" must be a
continuing element does not properly reflect the nature, purpose or effect of
the Part XXI sentence, is not supported by the plain words of s. 688 of the Code,
and misconceives the nature, purpose and effect of the Parole Board's review
procedure. Continuing detention is not premised on the status of
""dangerousness"" under existing law respecting dangerous offenders. In
sum, the appellant has the same protections as those afforded any other person
who is convicted of an offence and sentenced to a period of incarceration. He
had a right to appeal when the sentence was pronounced and he may apply for
parole at prescribed times. But like any other person who is properly convicted
and sentenced, he must otherwise serve his sentence according to its tenor.

 

                   The
continued detention of the accused under Part XXI imposed following his
conviction for gross indecency under the pre‑existing law does not amount
to cruel and unusual punishment or arbitrary detention.

 

                   Article
15 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, which provides that if the penalty for an offence is reduced after
its commission, the offender is to benefit thereby, does not invalidate the
appellant's sentence. Assuming it could apply to his situation, it must be read
in the light of s. 11 (i) of the Charter .

 

                   Per Wilson
J. (dissenting in part): The accused had no knowledge when he pleaded guilty to
the offences of which he was convicted that the Crown intended and had been
instructed by the Attorney General to make an application under Part XXI of the
Code. The Crown may have been entitled to function in this way when the
Part XXI order was made prior to the coming into force of the Charter ,
but, for the reasons given in Lyons, accused's continued incarceration
pursuant to an order made in these circumstances cannot be justified subsequent
to the coming into force of s. 7  of the Charter . The accused accordingly
is entitled to relief under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

 

                   Per Estey
J. (dissenting): The continued incarceration of the appellant offends his right
under s. 12  of the Charter . The prospect of a person's serving an
indefinite sentence in a penitentiary for an offence no longer attracting such
a term of imprisonment under the Criminal Code  is ""cruel and
unusual"" as this expression has been defined. Parliament itself found this
sentence to be disproportionate when it amended Part XXI and it only remained
for the courts to apply the Charter  as a matter of law to appellant's
present situation.

 

                   Sections
7  and 9  of the Charter  might also be offended but the issues arising
under ss. 7 , 9 , and 12  are so interwoven as to render this appeal an
unsatisfactory base for any extension of the analysis of these rights.

 

                   Since
habeas corpus with certiorari in aid would be an inappropriate
remedy if the time already served by appellant were less than the proper
sentence, a court must turn to s. 24(1)  of the Charter . The matter
should be remitted to the trial judge, notwithstanding the fact that he is now functus,
for an assessment of the appropriate sentence.

                   The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and McIntyre, Lamer, Le Dain and
La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                La Forest J.‑‑This
appeal raises several general issues identical to those addressed in R. v.
Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, regarding whether the dangerous offenders
provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, Part XXI,
ss. 687‑695 as amended, are constitutionally valid having regard to the
rights guaranteed by ss. 7 , 9 , 11  and 12  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms . In addition, it raises a number of specific issues regarding
whether a person who was convicted before the commencement of the Charter
of what was then, but is no longer, ""a serious personal injury
offence"" under Part XXI and found to be ""a dangerous offender""
under that Part, and in consequence sentenced to ""detention in a
penitentiary for an indeterminate period in lieu of any other sentence"",
can now have that detention reviewed either by means of a writ of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid on the ground that he is no longer a
dangerous offender, or under the Charter  on the ground that such detention
constitutes arbitrary detention or imprisonment (s. 9 ) or cruel and unusual
punishment (s. 12 ). The general issues have already been discussed in Lyons.
The present judgment is, therefore, largely confined to the specific issues.

 

Facts
and Procedural History

 

2.                On
June 20, 1979, some three years before the Charter  was proclaimed, the
appellant George Harvey Milne pleaded guilty, before His Honour Judge Denroche
of the British Columbia Provincial Court, to five counts of gross indecency
contrary to s. 157  of the Criminal Code . The offences occurred over a
period of nine months and involved sexual activity with boys between the ages
of thirteen and sixteen. On the same day, the Crown requested and was granted
an adjournment to enable it to bring a dangerous offender application under
Part XXI of the Code. The application was subsequently made before the
same judge on May 29, 1980.

 

3.                At
that time, s. 687 of the Code defined ""serious personal injury
offence"" to include gross indecency. Section 687(b) then read as
follows:

 

                   687. ...

 

(b) an offence mentioned in section
144 (rape) or 145 (attempted rape) or an offence or attempt to commit an
offence mentioned in section 146 (sexual intercourse with a female under
fourteen or between fourteen and sixteen), 149 (indecent assault on a female),
156 (indecent assault on a male) or 157 (gross indecency). [Emphasis
added.]

 

I should
add that, similar to the situation that now exists, for the dangerous offenders
provisions to apply to these sexual offences, it was necessary to establish to
the satisfaction of the court that ""the offender, by his conduct in any
sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the offence for
which he has been convicted, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses
and a likelihood of his causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons
through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses"" (s. 688(b)).

 

4.                The
judge noted that the appellant had previously been convicted of six property
offences, one bail offence and three indecent assault offences, all against
males. He concluded that the appellant had, by his conduct, shown a failure to
control his sexual impulses, a pattern that was likely to continue in the
future and to cause injury, pain or other evil to other persons. He, therefore,
found the appellant to be a dangerous offender. He was also satisfied that a
sentence of detention for an indeterminate period in lieu of any other sentence
was necessary because of ""how little change has been effected in the
offender's conduct to date, the lack of motivation [to change] exhibited up
until the time of his arrest on the present charges and the only available figures
on recidivism"". The appellant's appeal from this determination and against
sentence to the British Columbia Court of Appeal (Taggart J.A., McFarlane and
Carrothers JJ.A. concurring) was dismissed on March 10, 1982.

 

5.                On
January 4, 1983, s. 687(b) of the Code was amended by S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83,
c. 125 s. 26. These amendments deleted the offence under s. 157  (gross
indecency) from the definition of ""serious personal injury offence"".
This means that a conviction under s. 157  no longer permits the making of an
application under Part XXI of the Code.

 

6.                On
November 14, 1984 the appellant commenced the present proceedings by way of
originating notice of motion in the Supreme Court of Ontario. He sought a writ
of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum with certiorari in aid and
additionally, or in the alternative, a remedy pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which had been proclaimed into force
subsequent to the commencement of his sentence. The proceedings were brought
for the purpose of determining the lawfulness of his continuing detention under
the indeterminate sentence. They were instituted in Ontario because the
appellant was at that time incarcerated in Warkworth Institution, a
penitentiary located in that province.

 

7.                On
December 11, 1984, Montgomery J., dismissed the application. He noted, however,
that the appellant was not left without a remedy. ""He may make application
to the National Parole Board and attempt to convince that body that he is no
longer a danger to the community. An accused who is sentenced to a term of
preventive detention having exhausted his appeal remedies ought in my view to
serve his sentence unless the Parole Board on subsequent review after an
appropriate amount of time has been served finds that he is no longer a risk to
the public.""

 

8.                An
appeal from Montgomery J.'s decision was dismissed, with brief written reasons,
by the Ontario Court of Appeal (Dubin, Morden and Grange JJ.A.) on June 10,
1985. In their opinion ""the amendment to the Criminal Code  did not
affect the validity of the detention of the appellant"". On December 10,
1985, leave to appeal to this Court was granted.

 

9.                On
June 23, 1986 constitutional questions were stated by the Chief Justice in the
following form:

 

1. Whether the provisions of Part XXI of the Criminal
Code  of Canada, dealing with an application for finding, and sentencing, an
individual as a dangerous offender, in whole or in part, infringe or deny the
rights guaranteed by ss. 7 , 9 , 11  and/or 12 of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2. If so, then are the provisions of Part XXI of
the Criminal Code , in whole or in part, justified on the basis of s. 1 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

It
should be noted that these are identical to the questions stated in the Lyons
appeal.

 

10.              Pursuant
to notice under R. 32(4) of the Supreme Court Rules, the Attorneys
General of Ontario and British Columbia subsequently intervened in the appeal.

 

The
Issues

 

11.              As
already intimated, the issues involved in the constitutional questions stated
by the Chief Justice have already been fully discussed in Lyons where I
concluded that the present Part XXI does not contravene the Charter  rights
referred to, and I find it unnecessary to add anything to the analysis there
made. I shall therefore confine myself to the issues that are specific to this
case.

 

12.              The
appellant's principal argument, which I shall for convenience refer to as the
""continuing status argument"", is deceptively simple and may thus be
stated. Part XXI provides a mechanism for determining whether a person
convicted of a ""serious personal injury offence"" is a ""dangerous
offender"". As a consequence of this determination, a person labelled as
having the ""status"" of a dangerous offender may be sentenced to a
period of indeterminate detention, but only for as long as the offender
continues to evince the characteristics that are comprised in the
""status"" of dangerousness. If he ceases to do so, the basis for his
incarceration vanishes and his detention may be reviewed by means of a writ of habeas
corpus, or under the Charter  on the ground that continuing to detain
him amounts to arbitrary detention or imprisonment (s. 9 ), or cruel and unusual
treatment or punishment (s. 12 ).

 

13.              It
follows, so the argument goes, that when a court is called upon to review the
continued detention of the offender, what is sought is not a review of the
initial determination that the offender was dangerous, but rather a
determination of whether he or she continues to be dangerous. The latter
determination, the argument continues, must be made in light of the current
provisions of Part XXI. In the appellant's case, this means that he can no
longer be said to possess the requisite characteristics of dangerousness
because the crime for which he was convicted, gross indecency, is no longer
included in the definition of ""serious personal injury offence"" (s. 687).
His status has therefore ceased to exist and his continued detention can no
longer be justified. In other words, continuing detention is premised on a
condition or status of dangerousness under existing law and therefore, it is
argued, once that status no longer attaches, the offender must be released. The
review by the Parole Board provided by the legislation is, therefore, not an
adequate or appropriate remedy because the criteria the Board applies do not,
if this argument is accepted, properly address the question whether an
applicant should remain in detention, in that they do not oblige the Board to
consider whether he is ""dangerous"" having regard to the current Code
provisions.

 

14.              So
far as Charter  review is concerned, the argument continues, the Charter 
is not being applied retrospectively. The original pre‑Charter 
labelling and sentencing are not, it is said, being reviewed. Instead the Charter 
review is aimed at determining whether the appellant continues to have the
status of a dangerous offender under existing law.

 

15.              It
is obvious that the main reason the ""continuing status"" argument is
advanced is to forestall a claim that the appellant, in now seeking to have the
legality of his detention reviewed, is endeavouring to have the earlier
decisions of the British Columbia Courts reviewed in light of the 1983 Criminal
Code  amendments and the Charter , both of which came into force long
after the original sentence was pronounced and the appeal process exhausted.

 

16.              In
developing this argument, counsel for the appellant referred to several cases.
One was Mitchell v. Attorney General of Ontario (1983), 35 C.R. (3d) 225
(Ont. H.C.), where the status argument also appears to have been raised. The
facts of that case bear a considerable resemblance to the present. There, the
applicant, after having been convicted of fourteen property offences, was found
in 1970 to be an habitual criminal under the then existing habitual criminal
provisions of the Code and was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.
In 1977, long after he had unsuccessfully appealed this sentence, the habitual
criminal legislation was repealed and the dangerous offender provisions of the Code
were enacted under which the applicant could not have been declared a dangerous
offender. After the enactment of the Charter , the applicant applied for
a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum with certiorari in aid,
and in the alternative for relief pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

 

17.              The
judgment in that case affords support for that portion of the appellant's
argument that suggests that it is the present continuing detention, and not the
original sentence, that is being subjected to review and that so far as Charter 
review is concerned, this does not amount to giving it a retroactive or
retrospective application. Linden J. had this to say at p. 229:

 

The imposition of the sentence of preventive detention
is not being challenged in this application. Rather, the applicant has invited
this court to find that his continued detention pursuant to that
sentence violates his rights to be protected against cruel and unusual treatment
or punishment, and not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. The applicant
relies upon changes to the provisions of Pt. XXI of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, and the enactment of the Charter of Rights  in support of
these allegations. [Emphasis in original.]

 

At page
232, he continued:

 

                   Before passing on to the merits of
the application, it also should be noted that no issue as to the retroactive or
retrospective application of the Charter  arises on the facts of this case. This
application is based upon alleged infringements of the Charter  occurring at the
present time as a result of the continuing incarceration of the applicant. None
of the decisions of the various courts and of the parole board is being
challenged. Nor is the legality of the detention of the applicant prior to the
coming into force of the Charter  under attack.

 

18.              As
I read it, however, the Mitchell case gives the appellant no assistance
regarding that aspect of his argument that suggests that in order for his
detention to be valid, the crime for which he was convicted must still be a
serious personal injury offence that could justify an application under Part
XXI. Rather, as I read the judgment, Linden J. would not have released him on
that ground. His decision rests squarely on his view that if it could be shown
on a subsequent application that the applicant was not a menace to society but
was instead merely a social nuisance, his continued detention would amount to
cruel and unusual punishment and so be invalid as violating s. 12  of the Charter .
On the subsequent application, again before Linden J., the applicant's
continued detention was found to violate s. 12  and his release was ordered even
though he had twice earlier, when released, violated the terms of his parole
and despite the fact that the Parole Board had, even after Linden J.'s earlier
decision, refused to grant him parole.

 

19.              To
fall within the rationale of this case, therefore, the appellant would have to
establish that continued indeterminate detention for gross indecency in
circumstances like those in the present case constitutes cruel and unusual
punishment. Counsel for the appellant did argue the general proposition that
Part XXI was invalid as amounting among other things to cruel and unusual punishment
or arbitrary detention, but that argument fails for the reasons given in Lyons.
He also attempted to underline that the offence committed by the appellant did
not appear to be dangerous in the same sense as those now listed in Part XXI.
However, he at no time argued that, assuming the general validity of Part XXI,
it would amount to cruel and unusual punishment or arbitrary detention to
subject the appellant to indeterminate detention because the offence of which
he was convicted was not sufficiently dangerous to warrant such detention. It
would have been very difficult for him to do so. While there was no violence
involved, and so no element of dangerousness in that sense, the evidence
revealed that the appellant was a very manipulative person who engaged in a
pattern of behaviour in which he befriended young boys and then induced them to
participate in sexual activities by first getting them to drink to excess. The
evidence also revealed that the boys involved in the series of incidents that
led to the charges that resulted in his being declared a dangerous offender had
suffered varying degrees of psychological harm from these encounters. The
effect on one of them, for example, was described as ""very traumatic""
and as having ""affected the boy's development severely"". The
appellant is thus far from being merely a social nuisance like the applicant in
the Mitchell case, but has persisted in behaviour of a kind that could
cause injury, pain or other evil similar to the sexual offences still included
in s. 687(b). In my view, therefore, his continued detention for an
indeterminate period does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment or
arbitrary detention.

 

20.              Counsel
for the appellant also relied on the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R.
v. Langevin (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336, as support for his continuing
status argument. In that case, the validity of s. 688 of the Code was
scrutinized by the Court of Appeal in light of the Charter , which had
been proclaimed since the trial judge's decision had been rendered. In
discussing the timing of the appeal, Lacourcière J.A., writing for the court,
noted at p. 352:

 

                   We agree with Mr. Frost's submission
that because the Charter  came into force after the appellant was found to be a
dangerous offender, the sections of the Charter  invoked by the appellant have
no application to the proceedings before Judge Carter and do not reach back and
affect them: R. v. Antoine (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 607 at p. 613, 5 C.C.C.
(3d) 97 at p. 102, 148 D.L.R. (3d) 149 at p. 155.

 

                   However, the time within which an
appeal could be taken was extended by the Associate Chief Justice of Ontario
and the appeal against the indeterminate sentence pursuant to s. 694 of the Code
is properly before us. This sentence, in turn, is based on the finding that
the appellant is a dangerous offender and this status of dangerous offender is
a continuing status necessary for the validity of the sentence and the
consequent detention. I conclude therefore that, on the appeal, the Court
has jurisdiction to determine, as a question of law, whether the sentence,
based on the continuing status, violates any right protected by the Charter .
[Emphasis added.]

 

21.              It
is unclear from the judgment, however, whether the reference to a
""continuing status"" in this passage was intended to have the broad
meaning and consequences which the appellant argues it has in this case, or
whether it was simply used to indicate that the case was still ""in the
system"" (see R. v. Wigman, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 246) as it had not yet
been appealed and therefore could be scrutinized by the Court of Appeal in
light of the Charter . The factual setting of the case and the court's
comments in other parts of the judgment (see for example p. 351) would support
the latter view. I do not, in any event, read this case as authority for the
continuing status argument as that argument was framed by the appellant.

 

22.              However
that may be, I am clearly of the opinion that this argument does not properly
reflect the nature, purpose or effect of the sentence imposed under Part XXI of
the Code. Nor is it supported by the plain wording of s. 688, which does
not on any view support the notion that the sentence is contingent on the
offender continuing to meet the requisites of any subsequent amendments to Part
XXI. The appellant's argument also misconceives the nature, purpose and effect
of the review procedure by the Parole Board mandated by s. 695.1. As I stated
in Lyons at pp. 342‑44:

 

It must be remembered that the offender is being
sentenced indeterminately because at the time of sentencing he was found
to have a certain propensity. The sentence is imposed ""in lieu of any
other sentence"" that might have been imposed and, like any other such
sentence, must be served according to its tenor. The offender is not being
sentenced to a term of imprisonment until he is no longer a dangerous offender.
Indeed, s. 695.1 provides that the circumstances of the offender be reviewed
for the purpose of determining whether parole should be granted and, if
so, on what conditions; it does not provide that the label of dangerous
offender be removed or altered....

 

                   It may be argued that the legislation
could be better tailored. For example, it might have been argued that the
review process should focus solely on whether the offender continued to possess
the characteristics that defined him or her as a proper subject of
indeterminate detention. Indeed, one might say that to ask, as the Parole Board
does, whether the individual has been reformed or rehabilitated, is to pose a
question that ex hypothesi cannot be answered affirmatively, for it was
implicit in the designation of the offender as dangerous that he or she was not
amenable to rehabilitation by usual means. However, this argument must be
rejected for a number of reasons.

 

                   To begin with, the criteria actually
used serve to emphasize the point made earlier in this judgment that
sentencing, even under Part XXI, embodies a complex of penological objectives.
I do not think it can be argued, either as a matter of logic or of common
sense, that by virtue of a decision to sentence an offender according to
considerations based primarily on prevention, other equally valid,
subsisting penal goals cease to be relevant. To reiterate, protecting society
from the dangerous offender never wholly supplants the other legitimate
objectives embodied in a Part XXI sentence.

 

                   Seen in this light it would be
preposterous to require of dangerous offenders only that they demonstrate to
the Parole Board that they have ceased to be ""dangerous"" (in terms
identical to those used in Part XXI), for this would require of them a lesser
showing than is required of other convicts. It seems to me that had s. 695.1
provided for a ""dangerous offender review"", rather than a parole
review, but borrowed the identical criteria employed in the Parole Act,
it would perhaps be more readily apparent that the review provided for does,
indeed, accomplish the requisite tailoring sufficient to sustain the
legislative scheme as a whole. Section 10(1)(a)(iii) requires the Board
to consider whether the release of the inmate would constitute an ""undue
risk"" to society; if the accused continues to be dangerous then, by
definition, this criterion remains unsatisfied. Section 10(1)(a) also
requires that the Board be satisfied that the inmate has derived the maximum
benefit from incarceration and that the inmate's reform and rehabilitation
would be aided by release.

 

                   These criteria seem to me to be no
less pertinent reflections of society's concerns in releasing dangerous
offenders than they are in releasing other offenders. [Emphasis in original.]

 

23.              In
sum, the appellant has the same protections as those afforded any other person
who is convicted of an offence and sentenced to a period of incarceration. He
had a right to appeal when the sentence was pronounced and he may apply for
parole at prescribed times. But like any other person who is properly convicted
and sentenced, he must otherwise serve his sentence according to its tenor.
This is not to say that the appellant is left without a remedy. As noted, he
has the right to be considered for parole every two years. If he can
demonstrate that he satisfies the criteria set out in s. 10(1)(a) of the
Parole Act, he will be paroled. Additionally, he may make an application
under s. 617  of the Criminal Code  for a rehearing or a reference of the
matter to a court of appeal. Accordingly, I am of the view that the appellant
must fail on the continuing status argument.

 

24.              Finally,
counsel for the appellant brought to our attention Art. 15 of the United
Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, G.A. Res.
2200A (XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR, Supp. (No. 16) 52, U.N. Doc. A/6316 (1966), to which
Canada adheres, under which it is provided that if subsequent to the commission
of an offence the penalty is reduced the offender is to benefit thereby.
Counsel concedes that it has not been adopted as part of the law, but he
submits that the Court should use the provision as an aid in interpreting ss. 9 
(arbitrary detention) and 12 (cruel and unusual punishment) of the Charter 
in a way that invalidates at least a penalty of the magnitude of an
indeterminate sentence at a time when that penalty could no longer be imposed.
But even assuming the present situation can be said to fall within the ambit of
the Article in the Covenant (which is by no means clear), it seems to me that
Linden J. in Mitchell, supra, has given a complete answer to this
argument. It is difficult to see how such an approach could be taken in light
of the fact that specific attention was given to this matter in s. 11 (i)
of the Charter , which limits the rights of an accused in this regard to
the benefit of a reduction in sentence made between the time of the commission
of the offence and the time of sentencing.

 

25.              In
light of the conclusions I have arrived at, it becomes unnecessary to consider
respondent's argument against Linden J.'s view in Mitchell, supra,
that the execution or the carrying out of the sentence, as opposed to its original
pronouncement, can be reviewed at any time under the Charter  without
retrospectively applying the latter's provisions to the original pronouncement
(see also R. v. Konechny (1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (B.C.C.A.)) and I
refrain from doing so. Nor is it necessary for me to consider the
jurisdictional issues raised by the respondent.

 

Conclusion

 

26.              I
would dismiss this appeal. I would also, as is the case in Lyons, answer
the first constitutional question in the negative. It is therefore unnecessary
to address the second constitutional question. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

27.              Estey J. (dissenting)‑‑The
issue in this appeal is whether the continued detention of the appellant
violates a right guaranteed to him under the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  to be protected against cruel and unusual punishment (s. 12 ). This
appeal does not raise any issue respecting either the validity or the propriety
of his initial conviction or the imposition of the indeterminate sentence. Nor
does this appeal call into question the process leading up to conviction and
sentence. It is clear therefore that whether the appellant was
""dangerous"" at the time of sentencing under the provisions of the Code
then in force is not the question this Court is now being asked to address.

 

28.              In
my view there is here a violation of s. 12  of the Charter . For the
purposes of this appeal it can be said that the key to s. 12  is that there must
be a requisite degree of proportionality between the offence for which the
accused has been convicted and the sentence imposed by or under the statute.
See R. v. Smith (Edward Dewey), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045.

 

29.              At
the time the appellant was found to be a dangerous offender under Part XXI of
the Criminal Code  it was necessary that the offence for which the
offender had been convicted be a ""serious personal injury offence"".
This was defined in s. 687 :

 

                   687. ...

 

""serious personal injury offence"" means

 

(a) an indictable offence (other than high
treason, treason, first degree murder or second degree murder) involving

 

(i) the use or attempted use of violence against
another person, or

 

(ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger the
life or safety of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe
psychological damage upon another person.

 

and for which the offender may be sentenced to
imprisonment for ten years or more, or

 

(b) an offence mentioned in section 144
(rape) or 145 (attempted rape) or an offence or attempt to commit an offence
mentioned in section 146 (sexual intercourse with a female under fourteen or
between fourteen and sixteen), 149 (indecent assault on a female), 156
(indecent assault on a male) or 157 (gross indecency).

 

Milne
was convicted on five counts of gross indecency.

 

30.              The
definition of ""serious personal injury offence"" was amended by S.C.
1980‑81‑82‑83, c. 125, s. 26, and subs. (b) no longer
includes the offence of gross indecency. Thus ""gross indecency"" has
ceased to be punishable by an indeterminate sentence. Put another way, gross indecency
has ceased to be grounds for a finding of constructive
""dangerousness"" under Part XXI of the Code. The offence of
gross indecency remains an indictable offence which carries a maximum
punishment of five years imprisonment (s. 157 ). It is clear therefore that if
Milne were convicted today he would not face the possibility of an
indeterminate sentence because he is no longer ""dangerous"" within the
statutory meaning.

 

31.              The
appellant has been imprisoned in a penitentiary since May 29, 1980. Depending
upon the sentence which would have been imposed for the five counts to which
the appellant pleaded guilty of gross indecency, the appellant has either
served the appropriate sentence or still has some time to serve.

 

32.              The
question now before the Court is whether in these circumstances the appellant
can be kept in prison.

 

33.              This
Court has held in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, that the imposition
of an indeterminate sentence does not per se violate the Charter .
The question in this appeal is quite different: Can there be a violation of the
Charter  when the very basis for the indeterminate detention has lost its
justificatory force when Parliament decided that the offence of gross indecency
is not one for which an indeterminate sentence is any longer appropriate? Under
his present sentence the appellant will continue to be incarcerated for an
indeterminate length of time although the offence for which he has been imprisoned
is one in respect of which Parliament has now ordained a finite sentence.
Whatever the law may have been prior to the Charter  with respect to the
treatment of prisoners serving sentences which have been revised by Parliament
subsequent to the sentencing, the advent of the Charter  has introduced
new standards. Prisoners in the position of the appellant now have rights
including those flowing from ss. 7 , 9  and 12  of the Charter . Section 7 
of the Charter  protects one's right to ""liberty"" and to
""security of the person"" against deprivation ""except in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"". It may be open to
some debate as to whether there existed any principle of fundamental justice
relating to the continued incarceration of a person in the situation of the
appellant, under the common law. Section 35(d) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑23, should be noted in this connection. It
provides:

 

                   35. Where an
enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) affect any offence committed against or
a violation of the provisions of the enactment so repealed, or any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment incurred under the enactment so repealed;

 

If this
provision does indeed purport to cover the events here unfolded, this provision
must be read along with s. 157  and Part XXI of the Criminal Code  in
determining whether this statutory ensemble can support a continued
imprisonment of the appellant. All of these statutory provisions must, if they
bear on the issue at all, give way to the Charter . The decision of this
Court in R. v. Wigman, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 246, does not reach this issue.

 

34.              It
has, however, long been an element of the criminal law of this country that
sentences must be proportionate to the offence committed. Parliament has now
found that the indeterminate sentence is no longer appropriate in respect of
the violation of s. 157  and presumably so because such imprisonment would be
disproportionate, in the view of Parliament, to the offence of gross indecency.
It might be said therefore that the appellant's continued imprisonment would in
these circumstances be a deprivation of liberty otherwise than in accordance
with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

35.              It
might also be that the continued imprisonment of a person in the circumstances
of the appellant is ""arbitrary"" and hence contrary to s. 9  of the Charter .
Once the indefinite holding of a person convicted of gross indecency is no
longer authorized in the criminal law, such incarceration becomes capricious or
arbitrary and of course if so imposed after the amendment of Part XXI, would be
illegal. Accordingly, the continued incarceration of the appellant may be said
to have become capricious or arbitrary in the ordinary sense of that term as
employed in s. 9 . There can hardly be a rational basis or a justifiable basis
(subject to what is said below concerning the otherwise appropriate sentence
under s. 157 ) for the continued indefinite retention of the appellant. Without
deciding the appropriateness of ss. 7  and 9  under these circumstances, I turn
to the third apparently applicable Charter  provision.

 

36.              In
all the circumstances I would conclude that the continued imprisonment of the
appellant more clearly offends the right of the appellant under s. 12  of the Charter 
which provides:

 

                   12. Everyone has
the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.

 

37.              The
prospect of a person serving an indefinite sentence in a penitentiary for an
offence no longer attracting such a term of imprisonment under the Criminal
Code , must in our ordinary parlance be ""cruel and unusual"" as
this expression has been defined in Smith, supra. The Court is
here not dealing with unreasonable or otherwise offending legislation or even
legislative policy as invasive of a Charter  right. The Court is here
only concerned with the characterization in law of the servitude of the
appellant after the legislative change. It is not necessary to review the
historic background of ""cruel and unusual punishment"" as this has
been undertaken by Lamer J. in Smith, supra. Nor is there any
issue of curial deference to Parliament on issues of policy. Parliament has
already enunciated its policy with reference to the offence of gross indecency.
Unlike the Smith case, supra, the
""disproportionateness"" of the sentence was determined by Parliament
itself when it amended Part XXI. It only remains for the courts to apply the Charter 
as a matter of law to the present condition of the appellant.

 

38.              The
interwoven issues arising under the three Charter  sections mentioned
above render this appeal an unsatisfactory base for the extension of the
analysis of these rights beyond the discussion already undertaken in the Smith
appeal, supra. I conclude that whatever may be the case in respect to
ss. 7  and 9 , the continued imprisonment of the appellant under an indeterminate
sentence is a violation of the appellant's constitutional right under s. 12  of
the Charter .

 

39.              What
then is the appropriate disposition of this appeal?

 

40.              The
appropriate sentence for the appellant under s. 157  independent of the
provisions of Part XXI has never been assessed. The appellant pleaded guilty to
five counts of gross indecency. The maximum sentence under s. 157  is five years.
What the appropriate sentence would be, giving due attention to the principles
of totality and related offences, and other principles of sentencing which may
be appropriate in the circumstances revealed in this record, should be
determined by the trial judge, Denroche Prov. Ct. J. He is now functus
having validly disposed of the conviction and sentence of the appellant under
the law as it then existed.

 

41.              The
remedies here sought are habeas corpus with certiorari in aid or
a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter . Habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid would (even assuming its availability notwithstanding s. 710 of the Code)
be inappropriate should time already served by the appellant be less than the
proper sentence, once determined, under s. 157 , Part XXI aside. In this
situation a court must turn to s. 24(1)  of the Charter . In my view,
""appropriate and just"" remedy in all the unusual circumstances which
have arisen in these proceedings, is a direction that this proceeding be remitted
to Denroche Prov. Ct. J. for the assessment of the appropriate sentence on the
five accounts to which the appellant has pleaded guilty. Should such sentence
be determined to exceed the time already served by the appellant, it shall be
directed that the appellant be retained in prison until such sentence shall
have been served, subject to any rights of the appellant to be released under
any applicable legislation. Should the appropriate sentence be for a period
less than that which the appellant has already served under the sentence
imposed in 1980, it shall be directed that the appellant should be released. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

42.              Wilson J. (dissenting in
part)‑‑For the reasons I gave in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2
S.C.R. 309, I would allow the appeal, quash the order made under Part XXI of
the Criminal Code  and the sentence of indeterminate detention, and remit
the matter back to the learned trial judge for the imposition of the
appropriate determinate sentence.

 

43.              As
in the case of Lyons the accused had no knowledge at the time he pleaded
guilty to the offences of which he was convicted that the Crown prosecutor
intended, and indeed had already received instructions from the Attorney
General, to make an application under Part XXI of the Code. The Crown
was entitled under the provisions of the Code to function in this
fashion prior to the coming into force of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , i.e., at the time the Part XXI order was made, but I do not
believe, for the reasons I gave in Lyons, that subsequent to the coming
into force of s. 7  of the Charter  his continued incarceration pursuant
to an order made in these circumstances can be justified. Accordingly, I believe
that he is entitled to relief under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

            During an armed robbery in
a pool hall, appellant's accomplice shot and killed a client. The accomplice
managed to escape but appellant was arrested and convicted of second degree
murder as a party to the offence pursuant to ss. 21(2)  and 213 (d) of the
Criminal Code . Section 213 (d) provides that ""Culpable
homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while
committing or attempting to commit ... robbery ... whether or not the person
means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that death
is likely to be caused to any human being, if ... he uses a weapon or has it
upon his person during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit the
offence ... and the death ensues as a consequence."" At his trial before
judge and jury, appellant testified that at the time of the robbery, he was
certain that the gun in possession of the accomplice was not loaded. He stated
that they had agreed to commit the robbery armed only with knives and when, on
the night of the crime, the accomplice arrived with a gun he insisted that it
be unloaded. The accomplice removed three bullets from the gun and gave them to
the appellant. Appellant's glove containing the three bullets was recovered by
the police at the scene of the crime. The Court of Appeal dismissed appellant's
appeal from conviction. In this Court, he challenged the constitutional
validity of s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code . This appeal raises
two constitutional questions: (1) Is section 213(d) of the Code
inconsistent with either ss. 7  or 11 (d) of the Charter  and,
therefore, of no force or effect? (2) If not, is the combination of ss. 21 and
213(d) of the Code inconsistent with either ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter  and is s. 21  therefore of no force or effect in the case
of a charge under s. 213 (d)?

 

            Held (McIntyre J. dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed and a new trial ordered. The first constitutional question
should be answered in the affirmative. No answer was given to the second
constitutional question.

 

            Per Dickson C.J. and Estey, Lamer and Wilson
JJ.: Prior to the enactment of the Charter , Parliament had full
legislative powers with respect to criminal law, including the determination of
the essential elements of any given crime. But the Charter  has
restricted these powers. Under section 7, if a conviction will result in a
deprivation of the life, liberty or security of the person of the accused, then
Parliament must respect the principles of fundamental justice. One of these
principles is that a minimum mental state is an essential element of an
offence. However, because of the special nature of the stigma attached to a
conviction for murder, the principles of fundamental justice require a mens
rea reflecting the particular nature of that crime. While the current view
of the justices is that such a conviction cannot rest on anything less than
proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight, for the purpose of
this appeal, it is sufficient to say that, as a principle of fundamental
justice, there cannot be a conviction in the absence of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of at least objective foreseeability.

 

            The presumption of
innocence in s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is offended when an accused
may be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt on an essential
element of the offence. Where Parliament substituted proof of a different
element for proof of an essential element, such substitution is
constitutionally valid if, upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of the
substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact or a jury
not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential
element. Therefore, an accused cannot be found guilty of murder absent proof
beyond a reasonable doubt of at least objective foreseeability, and a murder
provision which allows a conviction in the absence of proof beyond reasonable
doubt of at least that essential element infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of
the Charter .

 

            In the present case, s.
213(d) of the Code is prima facie in violation of ss. 7 
and 11 (d) of the Charter . The mens rea required for s. 213 
consists of the mens rea for the underlying offence and the intent to
commit one of the acts set forth in paras. (a) to (d). Section
213  does not completely exclude the need to prove any objective foreseeability.
Rather, it has substituted for proof beyond a reasonable doubt of objective
foreseeability, if that is the essential element, proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of certain forms of intentional dangerous conduct causing death. But this
substitution is not constitutionally valid because it is still possible that,
notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the matters set forth in
paras. (a) and (d), a jury could reasonably be left in doubt as
to whether the accused ought to have known that death was likely to ensue.

 

            Section 213 (d)
cannot be saved by s. 1  of the Charter . It is clear that Parliament's
objective to deter the use or carrying of a weapon in the commission of certain
offences, because of the increased risk of death, was of sufficient importance
for the purpose of s. 1 . However, the measures adopted were not reasonable and
demonstrably justifiable. While these measures appear to be rationally
connected to the objective, they unduly impair the rights and freedoms in
question. Indeed, it is not necessary to convict of murder persons who did not
intend or foresee the death and who could not even have foreseen the death in
order to deter others from using or carrying weapons. If Parliament wishes to
deter the use or carrying of weapons, it should, as in s. 83 of the Code,
punish the use or carrying of weapons.

 

            Per Beetz and Le Dain JJ.: For the
reasons given by Lamer and La Forest JJ., s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  does not conform to the principles of fundamental justice entrenched
in the Charter  and cannot be saved under s. 1 . For the reasons given by
Lamer J., s. 213 (d) also violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
and cannot be justified under s. 1 . Given these conclusions, it is not
necessary to decide whether there exists a principle of fundamental justice
that a conviction for murder cannot rest on anything less than proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of subjective foresight.

 

            Per La Forest J.: Because of the stigma
attached to a conviction for murder, the principles of fundamental justice
require a mens rea reflecting the particular nature of that crime,
namely one referable to causing death. In addition to the intention to cause
death, this can include a closely related intention such as intention to cause
bodily harm likely to result in death combined with recklessness as to that
result. It is sufficient to say in this case that the mental element required
by s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  is so remote from the intention
specific to murder that a conviction under that paragraph violates fundamental
justice. The provision is so broad that under it a person may be found guilty
of murder even though the death was the result of an accident.

 

            Section 213(d) of
the Code cannot be saved by s. 1  of the Charter . The objective of
discouraging the use of weapons in the commission of crimes can be achieved by
means other than attaching the stigma of a conviction for murder to a person
who has caused death in the circumstances like those described in the
provision.

 

            Per McIntyre J. (dissenting): The two
constitutional questions should be answered in the negative. Parliament has
decided that possession and use of weapons in the course of the commission of
offences is a gravely aggravating factor and has chosen to term a killing
arising in the circumstances described in s. 213 (d) as murder. While it
may be illogical to characterize an unintentional killing as murder, no
principle of fundamental justice is offended because serious criminal conduct,
involving the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the killing of a
human being, is classified as murder and not in some other manner.

 

            In this case, the accused
was properly convicted of murder under the combined effect of ss. 21(2) and
213(d) of the Code. The terms of s. 21(2)  were fully met as there
was evidence of the accused's active participation in the commission of the
robbery, the underlying offence. The section gives expression to a principle of
joint criminal liability long accepted and applied in the criminal law, and
there is no basis upon which one could exempt conduct which attracts criminal
liability, under s. 213 of the Code, from the application of that
principle.

Introduction

 

1                 Vaillancourt was convicted of
second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury in Montréal. He
appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal, arguing that the judge's charge to the
jury on the combined operation of ss. 213(d) and 21(2) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, was incorrect. His appeal was dismissed
and the conviction was affirmed: (1984), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 75. Before this Court,
he has challenged the constitutional validity of s. 213(d) alone and in
combination with s. 21(2) under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

The Facts

 

2                 For the purposes of this appeal,
the Crown does not contest the following statement of the facts.

 

3                 The appellant and his accomplice
committed an armed robbery in a pool hall. The appellant was armed with a knife
and his accomplice with a gun. During the robbery, the appellant remained near
the front of the hall while the accomplice went to the back. There was a
struggle between the accomplice and a client. A shot was fired and the client
was killed. The accomplice managed to escape and has never been found. The
appellant was arrested at the scene.

 

4                 In the course of his testimony,
the appellant said that he and his accomplice had agreed to commit this robbery
armed only with knives. On the night of the robbery, however, the accomplice
arrived at their meeting place with a gun. The appellant said that he objected
because, on a previous armed robbery, his gun had discharged accidentally, and
he did not want that to happen again. He insisted that the gun be unloaded. The
accomplice removed three bullets from the gun and gave them to the appellant.
The appellant then went to the bathroom and placed the bullets in his glove.
The glove was recovered by the police at the scene of the crime and was found
at trial to contain three bullets. The appellant testified that, at the time of
the robbery, he was certain that the gun was unloaded.

 

Constitutional Questions

 

5                 Before this Court, the following
constitutional questions were formulated:

 

1. Is section 213(d) of the Criminal
Code  inconsistent with the provisions of either s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and, therefore, of no force
or effect?

 

2. If not, is the combination of s. 21 
and s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  inconsistent with the
provisions of either s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and is s. 21  of the Criminal Code  therefore of
no force or effect in the case of a charge under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code ?

 

The Law

 

Narrowing the Issue

 

6                 The appellant has framed his
attack on s. 213(d) of the Code in very wide terms. He has argued
that the principles of fundamental justice require that, before Parliament can
impose any criminal liability for causing a particular result, there must be
some degree of subjective mens rea in respect of that result. This is a
fundamental question with far reaching consequences . If this case were decided
on that basis, doubt would be cast on the constitutional validity of many
provisions throughout our Criminal Code , in particular s. 205(5) (a),
whereby causing death by means of an unlawful act is culpable homicide, and s.
212 (c) whereby objective foreseeability of the likelihood of death is
sufficient for a murder conviction in certain circumstances.

 

7                 However, the appellant was
convicted under s. 213 (d) and the constitutional question is limited to
this provision. In my opinion, the validity of s. 213 (d) can be decided
on somewhat narrower grounds. In addition, the Attorney General of Canada has
seen fit not to intervene to support the constitutionality of s. 213 (d),
which is clearly in jeopardy in this case, though he may have intervened to
support ss. 205(5)(a) and 212(c) and other similar provisions. I
will thus endeavour not to make pronouncements the effect of which will be to
predispose in obiter of other issues more properly dealt with if and
when the constitutionality of the other provisions is in issue. I do, however,
find it virtually impossible to make comments as regards s. 213 (d) that
will not have some effect on the validity of the rest of s. 213  or that will
not reveal to some extent my views as regards s. 212(c). However, the
validity of those sections and of paras. (a) to (c) of s. 213  is
not in issue here and I will attempt to limit my comments to s. 213 (d).

 

8                 The appellant has also
challenged the combined operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (d). Given my
decision on the validity of s. 213 (d) and in view of the importance of
s. 21(2) and the absence of the Attorney General of Canada, I do not find it
necessary or advisable to deal with s. 21(2) in this appeal.

 

Analysis of s. 213 (d)

 

Section
213 (d) in the Context of the Murder Provisions

 

9                 It is first necessary to analyze
s. 213 (d) in the context of the other murder provisions in the Code
in order to determine its true nature and scope. Murder is defined as a
culpable homicide committed in the circumstances set out at ss. 212 and 213 of
the Code. There is a very interesting progression through s. 212  to s.
213  with respect to the mental state that must be proven.

 

10               The starting point is s. 212(a)(i),
which provides:

 

                   212. Culpable homicide is murder

 

(a) where the person who
causes the death of a human being

 

(i) means to cause his death,

 

This clearly requires that the accused
have actual subjective foresight of the likelihood of causing the death coupled
with the intention to cause that death. This is the most morally blameworthy
state of mind in our system.

 

11               There is a slight relaxation of
this requirement in s. 212(a)(ii), which provides:

 

                   212. Culpable homicide is murder

 

(a) where
the person who causes the death of a human being

 

                                                                             ...

 

(ii) means to cause him bodily
harm that he knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death
ensues or not;

 

Here again the accused must have
actual subjective foresight of the likelihood of death. However, the Crown need
no longer prove that he intended to cause the death but only that he was
reckless whether death ensued or not. It should also be noted that s. 212(a)(ii)
is limited to cases where the accused intended to cause bodily harm to the
victim.

 

12               Section 212(c) provides:

 

                   212. Culpable homicide is murder

 

                                                                             ...

 

(c) where a person, for an
unlawful object, does anything that he knows or ought to know is likely to
cause death, and thereby causes death to a human being, notwithstanding that he
desires to effect his object without causing death or bodily harm to any human
being.

 

In part, this is simply a more general
form of recklessness and thus the logical extension of s. 212(a)(ii), in
that it applies when the accused ""does anything that he knows . . .
is likely to cause death"" (emphasis added). However, there is also a
further relaxation of the mental element required for murder in that it is also
murder where the accused ""does anything that he . . . ought to know
is likely to cause death"" (emphasis added). This eliminates the
requirement of actual subjective foresight and replaces it with objective
foreseeability or negligence.

 

13               The final relaxation in the
definition of murder occurs at s. 213 :

 

                   213. Culpable homicide is murder
where a person causes the death of a human being while committing or attempting
to commit high treason or treason or an offence mentioned in section 52
(sabotage), 76 (piratical acts), 76.1 (hijacking an aircraft), 132 or subsection
133(1) or sections 134 to 136 (escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody),
143 or 145 (rape or attempt to commit rape), 149 or 156 (indecent assault),
subsection 246(2) (resisting lawful arrest), 247 (kidnapping and forcible
confinement), 302 (robbery), 306 (breaking and entering) or 389 or 390 (arson),
whether or not the person means to cause death to any human being and whether
or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any human being, if

 

(a) he means to cause
bodily harm for the purpose of

 

(i) facilitating the commission
of the offence, or

 

(ii) facilitating his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the death ensues from the bodily
harm;

 

(b) he administers a
stupefying or overpowering thing for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a),
and the death ensues therefrom;

 

(c) he wilfully stops, by
any means, the breath of a human being for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a),
and the death ensues therefrom; or

 

(d) he uses a weapon or
has it upon his person

 

(i) during or at the time he
commits or attempts to commit the offence, or

 

(ii) during or at the time of his
flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the death ensues as a consequence.

 

Under this provision, it is murder if
the accused causes the victim's death while committing or attempting to commit
one of the enumerated offences if he performs one of the acts in paras. (a)
to (d). Proof that the accused performed one of the acts in paras. (a)
to (d) is substituted for proof of any subjective foresight or even
objective foreseeability of the likelihood of death.

 

14               I should add that there appears to
be a further relaxation of the mental state when the accused is a party to the
murder through s. 21(2) of the Code as in this case. However, as I have
said, it is sufficient to deal with s. 213 (d) in order to dispose of
this appeal.

 

The
Historical Development of s. 213 

 

15               Although the concept of felony
murder has a long history at common law, a brief review of the historical
development of s. 213  indicates that its legitimacy is questionable.

 

16               In the early history of English
criminal law, murdrum or murder referred to a secret killing or the
killing of a Dane or, later, a Norman by an Englishman and to the fine levied
on the township where the killing occurred. By the early 14th century, the
fines had been abandoned and murder had come to be the name used to describe
the worst kind of homicide. The expression ""malice aforethought"" was
subsequently adopted to distinguish murder from manslaughter, which denoted all
culpable homicides other than murder. Malice aforethought was not limited to
its natural and obvious sense of premeditation, but would be implied whenever
the killing was intentional or reckless. In these instances, the malice was
present and it is the premeditation which was implied by law.

 

17               Coke took this one step further
and implied both the malice and the premeditation in cases where the death
occurred in the commission of an unlawful act. He wrote in The Third Part of
the Institutes of the Laws of England (London: W. Clarke & Sons, 1817),
at p. 56:

 

                   Unlawfull. If the act be unlawful it is murder.
As if A. meaning to steale a deere in the park of B, shooteth at the deer, and
by the glance of the arrow killeth a boy that is hidden in a bush: this is
murder, for that the act was unlawfull, although A. had no intent to hurt the
boy, nor knew not of him. But if B. the owner of the park had shot at his own
deer, and without any ill intent had killed the boy by the glance of his arrow,
this had been homicide by misadventure, and no felony.

 

                   So if one shoot at
any wild fowle upon a tree, and the arrow killeth any reasonable creature afar
off, without any evill intent in him, this is per infortunium: for it
was not unlawful to shoot at the wilde fowle: but if he had shot at a cock or
hen, or any tame fowle of another mans, and the arrow by mischance had killed a
man, this had been murder, for the act was unlawfull.

 

18               Coke's statement of the unlawful
act murder rule has been much criticized. Stephen demonstrated that Coke's
statement was not supported by the authorities cited (A History of the
Criminal Law of England (1883), vol. 3, at pp. 57‑58). Further, a
recent author has suggested that Coke's statement was just ""a slip of the
quill"" and that Coke intended to say that accidental killing by an
unlawful act was manslaughter (see D. Lanham, ""Felony Murder‑‑Ancient
and Modern"" (1983), 7 Crim. L.J. 90, at pp. 92‑94). Other
17th century writers (Dalton, Countrey Justice (1619), at pp. 225‑26,
and Hale, History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736), vol. 1, at p. 475)
and cases (Sir John Chichester's Case (1647), Aleyn 12, 82 E.R. 888, and
Hull's Case (1664), Kelyng, J. 40) rejected the unlawful act murder rule
as set out by Coke. Despite all of this, Coke's doctrine seems to have been
accepted by the writers and the cases in the 18th century, and their only
contribution was to limit it to killings in the course of felonies (see R.
v. Plummer (1702), Kelyng, J. 109, 84 E.R. 1103, at p. 1107; Hawkins, Pleas
of the Crown (1716), vol. 1, ch. 29, s. 11; R. v. Woodburne and Coke
(1722), 16 St. Tr. 53; Foster, Crown Law (1762), at p. 258; East, Pleas
of the Crown (1803), vol. 1, at p. 255). Of course, at that time, both the
underlying felony and the murder were punishable by death, so the definition of
a homicide in the course of a felony as a murder had little practical effect.

 

19               In the 19th century, the felony
murder rule was accepted as part of the common law (see Stephen's Digest of
the Criminal Law (9th ed. 1950), art. 264(c)). However, the rule was
strongly criticized by Stephen, who labelled it ""cruel"" and
""monstrous"" (A History of the Criminal Law of England, supra,
at p. 75).

 

20               Despite the rule's questionable
origins and the subsequent criticisms, s. 175 of the English Draft Code of 1879
included a restricted form of felony murder which was subsequently adopted in
the first Canadian Criminal Code in 1892. Through subsequent amendments,
this provision has been widened and it is now s. 213 . It is more restricted
than the common law rule in that it is limited to deaths occurring in the
commission of certain enumerated offences and it requires that the accused have
committed one of the acts set out in paras. (a) to (d).

 

21               Section 213 and its predecessors
in the Code have long been subject to academic criticism (see J. Willis,
""Case and Comment"" (1951), 29 Can. Bar Rev. 784, at pp. 794‑96;
J. Ll. J. Edwards, ""Constructive Murder in Canadian and English Law""
(1961), 3 Crim. L.Q. 481, at pp. 506‑9; A. Hooper, ""Some
Anomalies and Developments in the Law of Homicide"" (1967), 3 U.B.C. L.
Rev. 55, at pp. 75‑77; P. Burns and R. S. Reid, ""From Felony
Murder to Accomplice Felony Attempted Murder: The Rake's Progress
Compleat?"" (1977), 55 Can. Bar Rev. 75, at pp. 103‑5; G.
Parker, An Introduction to Criminal Law (1977), at pp. 145‑48; D.
Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law (1982), at pp. 222‑25; I. Grant and
A. W. MacKay, ""Constructive Murder and the Charter : In Search of
Principle"" (1987), 25 Alta. L. Rev. 129; cf. A. W. Mewett
and M. Manning, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1985), at p. 545). It has also
been subject to judicial criticism. In R. v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R.
124, Dickson J., as he then was, wrote that s. 213  seemed harsh (p. 130). In R.
v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, dealing with the mens rea of
attempted murder, McIntyre J. wrote at pp. 250‑51:

 

                   It was argued, and
it has been suggested in some of the cases and academic writings on the
question, that it is illogical to insist upon a higher degree of mens rea
for attempted murder, while accepting a lower degree amounting to recklessness
for murder. I see no merit in this argument. The intent to kill is the highest
intent in murder and there is no reason in logic why an attempt to murder,
aimed at the completion of the full crime of murder, should have any lesser
intent. If there is any illogic in this matter, it is in the statutory
characterization of unintentional killing as murder. [Emphasis added.]

 

22               Finally, the Law Reform Commission
of Canada criticized s. 213  in Homicide (1984), Working Paper 33, at pp.
47‑51, and excluded the notion of constructive murder from its Draft
Criminal Code (Recodifying Criminal Law (1986), Report 30, cl. 6(3), at
p. 54).

 

Felony
Murder in Other Jurisdictions

 

23               Felony murder is a peculiarly
common law concept which appears to be unknown outside a small circle of common
law jurisdictions, and it has not fared well in those jurisdictions. In the
United Kingdom, where the rule originated, it was abolished by the Homicide
Act, 1957, 5 & 6 Eliz. 2, c. 11 (U.K.) The rule is still quite
widespread in the United States, though it is said to be in decline (R. M.
Perkins and R. N. Boyce, Criminal Law (3rd ed. 1982), at p. 70). The
rule has been abolished by statute or by the courts in several jurisdictions
(see People v. Aaron, 299 N.W.2d 304 (Mich. 1980), State v. Doucette,
470 A.2d 676 (Vt. 1983)), and it has been downgraded to manslaughter in others.
In addition, the courts and the legislatures have limited the scope of the
common law rule by limiting the felonies to which it is applicable, requiring
some degree of mens rea with respect to the death, establishing
affirmative defences or limiting the punishments available. The rule also
exists in New Zealand and certain Australian states but it is narrower and
abolition has been recommended in some jurisdictions.

 

Section 213 (d) and the Charter 

 

24               This appeal calls into play two
principles of fundamental justice.

 

The
First Principle: The Essential Elements of Certain Crimes and s. 7  of the Charter 

 

25               Prior to the enactment of the Charter ,
Parliament had full legislative power with respect to ""The Criminal
Law"" (Constitution Act, 1867, s. 91(27) ), including the
determination of the essential elements of any given crime. It could prohibit
any act and impose any penal consequences for infringing the prohibition,
provided only that the prohibition served ""a public purpose which can
support it as being in relation to criminal law"" (Reference re Validity
of s. 5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act, [1949] S.C.R. 1, at p. 50; appeal to
the Privy Council dismissed, [1951] A.C. 179). Once the legislation was found
to have met this test, the courts had very little power to review the substance
of the legislation. For example, in R. v. Corporation of the City of Sault
Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, Dickson J., as he then was, held that,
when an offence was criminal in the true sense, there was a presumption that
the prosecution must prove the mens rea. However, it was always open to
Parliament expressly to relieve the prosecution of its obligation to prove any
part of the mens rea, as it is said to have done in s. 213 of the Code
with respect to the foreseeability of the death of the victim. It is thus clear
that, prior to the enactment of the Charter , the validity of s. 213 
could not have been successfully challenged.

 

26               However, federal and provincial
legislatures have chosen to restrict through the Charter  this power with
respect to criminal law. Under section 7, if a conviction, given either the
stigma attached to the offence or the available penalties, will result in a
deprivation of the life, liberty or security of the person of the accused, then
Parliament must respect the principles of fundamental justice. It has been
argued that the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7  are only procedural
guarantees. However, in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486,
this Court rejected that argument and used s. 7 to review the substance of the
legislation. As a result, while Parliament retains the power to define the
elements of a crime, the courts now have the jurisdiction and, more important,
the duty, when called upon to do so, to review that definition to ensure that
it is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

27               This Court's decision in Re
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act stands for the proposition that absolute liability
infringes the principles of fundamental justice, such that the combination of
absolute liability and a deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person
is a restriction on one's rights under s. 7 and is prima facie a
violation thereof. In effect, Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act acknowledges
that, whenever the state resorts to the restriction of liberty, such as
imprisonment, to assist in the enforcement of a law, even, as in Re B.C.
Motor Vehicle Act, a mere provincial regulatory offence, there is, as a
principle of fundamental justice, a minimum mental state which is an essential
element of the offence. It thus elevated mens rea from a presumed
element in Sault Ste. Marie, supra, to a constitutionally
required element. Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act did not decide what level of
mens rea was constitutionally required for each type of offence, but
inferentially decided that even for a mere provincial regulatory offence at
least negligence was required, in that at least a defence of due
diligence must always be open to an accused who risks imprisonment upon
conviction. In Sault Ste. Marie, Dickson J. stated at pp. 1309‑10:

 

Where the offence is criminal, the
Crown must establish a mental element, namely, that the accused who committed
the prohibited act did so intentionally or recklessly, with knowledge of the
facts constituting the offence, or with wilful blindness toward them. Mere
negligence is excluded from the concept of the mental element required for
conviction. Within the context of a criminal prosecution a person who fails to
make such enquiries as a reasonable and prudent person would make, or who fails
to know facts he should have known, is innocent in the eyes of the law.

 

It may well be that, as a general
rule, the principles of fundamental justice require proof of a subjective mens
rea with respect to the prohibited act, in order to avoid punishing the
""morally innocent"". It must be remembered, however, that Dickson J.
was dealing with the mens rea to be presumed in the absence of an
express legislative disposition, and not the mens rea to be required in
all legislation providing for a restriction on the accused's life, liberty or
security of the person. In any event, this case involves criminal liability for
the result of an intentional criminal act, and it is arguable that different
considerations should apply to the mental element required with respect to that
result. There are many provisions in the Code requiring only objective
foreseeability of the result or even only a causal link between the act and the
result. As I would prefer not to cast doubt on the validity of such provisions in
this case, I will assume, but only for the purposes of this appeal, that
something less than subjective foresight of the result may, sometimes, suffice
for the imposition of criminal liability for causing that result through
intentional criminal conduct.

 

28               But, whatever the minimum mens
rea for the act or the result may be, there are, though very few in number,
certain crimes where, because of the special nature of the stigma attached to a
conviction therefor or the available penalties, the principles of fundamental
justice require a mens rea reflecting the particular nature of that
crime. Such is theft, where, in my view, a conviction requires proof of some
dishonesty. Murder is another such offence. The punishment for murder is the
most severe in our society and the stigma that attaches to a conviction for
murder is similarly extreme. In addition, murder is distinguished from
manslaughter only by the mental element with respect to the death. It is thus
clear that there must be some special mental element with respect to the death
before a culpable homicide can be treated as a murder. That special mental
element gives rise to the moral blameworthiness which justifies the stigma and
sentence attached to a murder conviction. I am presently of the view that it is
a principle of fundamental justice that a conviction for murder cannot rest on
anything less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight.
Given the effect of this view on part of s. 212(c), for the reasons I
have already given for deciding this case more narrowly, I need not and will
not rest my finding that s. 213 (d) violates the Charter  on this
view, because s. 213 (d) does not, for reasons I will set out hereinafter,
even meet the lower threshold test of objective foreseeability. I will
therefore, for the sole purpose of this appeal, go no further than say that it
is a principle of fundamental justice that, absent proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of at least objective foreseeability, there surely cannot be a murder
conviction.

 

The
Second Principle: s. 11 (d) and the Burden of Persuasion

 

29               The presumption of innocence in s.
11 (d) of the Charter  requires at least that an accused be
presumed innocent until his guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt: Dubois
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, at p. 357; R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 103, at pp. 120‑21. This means that, before an accused can be
convicted of an offence, the trier of fact must be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt of the existence of all of the essential elements of the offence. These
essential elements include not only those set out by the legislature in the
provision creating the offence but also those required by s. 7  of the Charter .
Any provision creating an offence which allows for the conviction of an accused
notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential element
infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d).

 

30               Clearly, this will occur where the
provision requires the accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities an
essential element of the offence by requiring that he raise more than just a
reasonable doubt. It is for this reason that this Court struck down the reverse
onus provision in s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1,
in Oakes, supra.

 

31               Sections 7 and 11(d) will
also be infringed where the statutory definition of the offence does not
include an element which is required under s. 7 . As Dickson C.J. wrote for the
majority of the Court in Oakes, supra, at pp. 132‑33:

 

                   In general one
must, I think, conclude that a provision which requires an accused to disprove
on a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an
important element of the offence in question, violates the presumption of
innocence in s. 11 (d). If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a
balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence, it would be
possible for a conviction to occur despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.
This would arise if the accused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a
reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but did not convince the jury on a
balance of probabilities that the presumed fact was untrue. [Emphasis added.]

 

It is clear from this passage that
what offends the presumption of innocence is the fact that an accused may be convicted
despite the existence of a reasonable doubt on an essential element of the
offence, and I do not think that it matters whether this results from the
existence of a reverse onus provision or from the elimination of the need to
prove an essential element. With respect, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal was
thus clearly incorrect when it stated in R. v. Bezanson (1983), 8 C.C.C.
(3d) 493, at p. 508:

 

In my view, there was no attempt by
Parliament to reverse the onus of proof under s. 213 , and s. 11 (d) of
the Charter  has no application. Parliament has not reversed the burden of
proof, it has simply omitted what the appellant argues is an essential element
from the definition of the offence so that no evidence is required at all on
that issue.

 

The omission of an essential element
does bring s. 11 (d) into play.

 

32               Finally, the legislature, rather
than simply eliminating any need to prove the essential element, may substitute
proof of a different element. In my view, this will be constitutionally valid
only if upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of the substituted element it would
be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt of the existence of the essential element. If the trier of fact may have
a reasonable doubt as to the essential element notwithstanding proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of the substituted element, then the substitution infringes
ss. 7  and 11 (d).

 

33               Given the first principle I have
enunciated earlier and my assumption for the sole purpose of disposing of this
appeal with respect to objective foreseeability, an accused cannot be found
guilty of murder absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt of that element, and a
murder provision which allows a conviction in the absence of proof beyond
reasonable doubt of at least that essential element infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d).

 

Application
of the Principles to s. 213

 

34               The mens rea required for
s. 213 consists of the mens rea for the underlying offence and the
intent to commit one of the acts set forth in paras. (a) to (d) (Swietlinski
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956). Section 213 does not impose on the
accused the burden of disproving objective foreseeability. Further, it does not
completely exclude the need to prove any objective foreseeability. Rather, s.
213 has substituted for proof beyond a reasonable doubt of objective
foreseeability, if that is the essential element, proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of certain forms of intentional dangerous conduct causing death.

 

35               The question is, therefore, can
Parliament make this substitution without violating ss. 7  and 11 (d)? As
I have discussed earlier, if Parliament frames the section so that, upon proof
of the conduct, it would be unreasonable for a jury not to conclude beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused ought to have known that death was likely to
ensue, then I think that Parliament has enacted a crime which is tantamount to
one which has objective foreseeability as an essential element, and, if
objective foreseeability is sufficient, then it would not be in violation of s.
7  or s. 11 (d) in doing so in that way. The acid test of the
constitutionality of s. 213 is this ultimate question: Would it be possible
for a conviction for murder to occur under s. 213 despite the jury having a
reasonable doubt as to whether the accused ought to have known that death was
likely to ensue? If the answer is yes, then the section is prima facie
in violation of ss. 7  and 11 (d). I should add in passing that if the
answer is no, then it would be necessary to decide whether objective
foreseeability is sufficient for a murder conviction. However, because in my
view the answer is yes and because I do not want to pass upon the
constitutionality of s. 212(c) in this case, I will not address that
issue.

 

36               To varying degrees it can be said
that in almost any case a jury satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that an
accused has done one of the prohibited acts described in paras. (a) to (d)
will be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused ought to have
known that death was likely to be caused. But not always. Indeed, as a first
example, drunkenness would under certain circumstances leave the jury in doubt
in that regard. The rule as regards the effect of drunkenness on objective
foreseeability was unanimously laid down by this Court in R. v. Vasil,
[1981] 1 S.C.R. 469, a murder prosecution under s. 212(c). This Court
addressed the issue at some length and then summarized its conclusion as
follows, per Lamer J. at pp. 500‑501:

 

(5) Whilst the test under 212(c)
is objective and the behaviour of the accused is to be measured by that of the
reasonable man, such a test must nevertheless be applied having regard, not to
the knowledge a reasonable man would have had of the surrounding circumstances
that allegedly made the accused's conduct dangerous to life, but to the
knowledge the accused had of those circumstances;

 

(6) As a result, drunkenness,
though not relevant in the determination of what a reasonable man, with the
knowledge the accused had of those circumstances, would have anticipated, is
relevant in the determination of the knowledge which the accused had of those
circumstances.

 

It is clear to me that under s. 213 as
drafted there will be cases where the effect of drunkenness on an accused's
knowledge of the circumstances would leave a jury with a reasonable doubt as to
whether the accused ought to have known of the likelihood of death ensuing,
even though it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
actually did one of the acts described under paras. (a) to (d).

 

37               A second example, and this case
amply illustrates the point, is the accused who is brought into s. 213 not as a
principal but through the operation of s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . In
R. v. Trinneer, [1970] S.C.R. 638, this Court had the opportunity to
consider the combined operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213  (s. 202  at the time).
Cartwright C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court, stated at pp. 645‑46.

 

At the risk of repetition, it is my
opinion that on the true construction of s. 202  and s. 21(2)  as applied to the
circumstances of this case it was necessary to support a verdict of guilty
against the respondent that the Crown should establish (i) that it was in fact
a probable consequence of the prosecution of the common purpose of the
respondent and Frank to rob Mrs. Vollet that Frank for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of the robbery would intentionally cause bodily
harm to Mrs. Vollet, (ii) that it was known or ought to have been known to the
respondent that such consequence was probable and (iii) that in fact Mrs.
Vollet's death ensued from the bodily harm. It was not necessary for the
Crown to establish that the respondent knew or ought to have known that it was
probable that Mrs. Vollet's death would ensue. [Emphasis added.]

 

It is clear that an accused can be
convicted of murder under the combined operation of ss. 21(2) and 213 in
circumstances where the death was not objectively foreseeable. As section 21(2)
requires proof of objective foreseeability, the culprit, in my view, must be s.
213.

 

38               These two examples suffice, in my
view, for one to conclude that notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt
of the matters set forth in paras. (a) to (d) a jury could
reasonably be left in doubt as regards objective foreseeability of the
likelihood that death be caused. In other words, s. 213 will catch an accused
who performs one of the acts in paras. (a) to (d) and thereby
causes a death but who otherwise would have been acquitted of murder because he
did not foresee and could not reasonably have foreseen that death would be
likely to result. For that reason, s. 213 prima facie violates ss. 7  and
11 (d). It is thus not necessary to decide whether objective foreseeability
is sufficient for murder as s. 213 does not even meet that standard. This takes
us to s. 1  for the second phase of the constitutional inquiry.

 

Section 1 

 

39               Finding that s. 213  of the Criminal
Code  infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  does not end
the inquiry on the constitutional validity of s. 213 . Any or all of paras. (a)
to (d) of s. 213  can still be upheld as a reasonable limit
""demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society"" under s. 1 
of the Charter .

 

40               In this case and at this stage of
the inquiry, we need only consider para. (d) of s. 213 . The criteria to
be assessed under s. 1  have been set out by this Court in several cases,
particularly R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, and R.
v. Oakes, supra. First, the objective which the measures are
designed to serve must be ""of sufficient importance to warrant overriding
a constitutionally protected right or freedom"" (Big M Drug Mart, supra,
at p. 352). Through s. 213(d) of the Code, Parliament intended to
deter the use or carrying of a weapon in the commission of certain offences,
because of the increased risk of death. In my view, it is clear that this
objective is sufficiently important.

 

41               In addition, the measures adopted
must be reasonable and demonstrably justified. The measures adopted appear to
be rationally connected to the objective: indiscriminately punishing for murder
all those who cause a death by using or carrying a weapon, whether the death
was intentional or accidental, might well be thought to discourage the use and
the carrying of weapons. I believe, however, that the measures adopted would
unduly impair the rights and freedoms in question (see Big M Drug Mart, supra,
at p. 352). It is not necessary to convict of murder persons who did not intend
or foresee the death and who could not even have foreseen the death in order to
deter others from using or carrying weapons. If Parliament wishes to deter the
use or carrying of weapons, it should punish the use or carrying of weapons. A
good example of this is the minimum imprisonment for using a firearm in the
commission of an indictable offence under s. 83  of the Criminal Code . In
any event, the conviction for manslaughter which would result instead of a
conviction for murder is punishable by, from a day in jail, to confinement for
life in a penitentiary. Very stiff sentences when weapons are involved in the
commission of the crime of manslaughter would sufficiently deter the use or carrying
of weapons in the commission of crimes. But stigmatizing the crime as murder
unnecessarily impairs the Charter  right.

 

42               In my view, therefore, s. 213(d)
of the Code is not saved by s. 1 .

 

Conclusion

 

43               As a result of the foregoing, I
would answer the first constitutional question in the affirmative, as s. 213 (d)
violates both s. 7  and s. 11 (d) of the Charter , and I would
declare s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  to be of no force or
effect. I would, for the reasons which I have given, decline to answer the
second constitutional question. It follows that the appeal must be allowed, the
appellant's conviction for murder set aside, and a new trial ordered.

 

                   The reasons of
Beetz and Le Dain JJ. were delivered by

 

44               Beetz
J.‑‑For the reasons given by Justice Lamer and Justice La
Forest, I agree that s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  does not
conform to the principles of fundamental justice entrenched in the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and cannot be saved under s. 1 . I also agree
with Lamer J. that s. 213(d) of the Code violates s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  and cannot be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

45               Given these conclusions, I do not
find it necessary to decide whether there exists a principle of fundamental
justice that a conviction for murder cannot rest on anything less than proof
beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight.

 

46               I would dispose of the appeal in
the manner proposed by Lamer J. and answer the first constitutional question as
he does. I would also decline to answer the second constitutional question.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

47               McIntyre
J. (dissenting)‑‑I have had the advantage of reading the
reasons for judgment in this appeal prepared by my colleague, Lamer J. I find
myself unable to agree with his disposition of the appeal and, with the
greatest respect for his view on the matter, I would dismiss the appeal and
answer both constitutional questions in the negative.

 

48               My colleague has set out the facts
of the case. They need not be repeated here. It is evident as well from his
reasons that, save for the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , he
is in agreement that the appellant would be properly convicted of murder under
the combined effect of s. 21(2)  and s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code .
He would allow the appeal essentially on the basis that a conviction for murder
which will result in the deprivation of liberty or security of the person of
the accused can only be upheld if, in accordance with the terms of s. 7  of the Charter ,
it is procured in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. While
Parliament has the power to define the elements of a crime, in his view the
courts must now review that definition to insure that it is in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice. These principles would require that
there be no murder conviction without proof of a mens rea of at least
objective foreseeability of death. Such foreseeability is not a necessary
requirement under s. 213(d) of the Code.

 

49               I am not prepared to accept the
proposition that s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  admits of a
conviction for murder without proof of objective foreseeability of death or the
likelihood of death, but in the view I take of this case it is not necessary to
reach a firm conclusion on that point. The Crown sought the conviction of
Vaillancourt on the basis of the interaction of s. 21(2) and s. 213(d)
of the Code. For the Crown to succeed in such a prosecution, it would be
required to prove that the accused and another had formed an intention in
common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein. In
addition, in the circumstances of this case, the Crown would be required to
prove that the appellant knew or ought to have known that his associate was
armed with a pistol and would, if necessary, use it during the commission of
the offence or the attempt to commit the offence, or during his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence, and that as a consequence a
death occurred: see R. v. Munro and Munro (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 260 (per
Martin J.A.), at p. 301, and the pre‑Charter  case in this Court in
R. v. Trinneer, [1970] S.C.R. 638.

 

50               It must be recognized at the
outset that Parliament has decided that the possession and use of weapons,
particularly firearms, in the course of the commission of offences is a gravely
aggravating factor. Experience has shown that the presence of firearms leads to
personal injury and loss of life. Parliament has chosen to term a killing
arising in the circumstances described here as ""murder"". In R. v.
Munro and Munro, supra, Martin J.A., speaking for the Ontario Court
of Appeal (Arnup, Martin and Houlden JJ.A.), said this, at p. 293:

 

                   Under the
provisions of s. 213(d) liability for murder attaches if death ensues as
a consequence of the use of the weapon or as a consequence of the possession of
a weapon which he has on his person. Manifestly, s. 213(d) is very
stringent, but it is equally obvious that Parliament intended to create a
stringent basis of liability where death ensued as a consequence of the use or
possession of a weapon which the offender has upon his person during the
commission or attempted commission of certain offences or the offender's flight
after the commission or attempted commission of the offence. It is clear that
Parliament intended to provide a strong deterrent to the carrying of weapons in
the commission of certain crimes because of the high risk to life which
experience has shown attends such conduct.

 

51               The principal complaint in this
case is not that the accused should not have been convicted of a serious crime
deserving of severe punishment, but simply that Parliament should not have
chosen to call that crime ""murder"". No objection could be taken if
Parliament classified the offence as manslaughter or a killing during the
commission of an offence, or in some other manner. As I have observed before
(see R. v. Ancio, [1984] l S.C.R. 225, at p. 251), while it may be
illogical to characterize an unintentional killing as murder, no principle of
fundamental justice is offended only because serious criminal conduct,
involving the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the killing of a
human being, is classified as murder and not in some other manner. As Martin
J.A. said in R. v. Munro and Munro, supra, at p. 301:

 

                   This legislation
has frequently been criticized as being harsh, but that is a matter for
Parliament and not for the courts.

 

I would refer, as well, to the words
found in A. W. Mewett and M. Manning, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1985), at
pp. 544‑45:

 

                   Section 213 and the
concept of constructive murder have been much criticized and, in fact,
abolished in many jurisdictions. The criticism is that it imposes liability for
murder in situations where death was not intended nor even, in some cases,
foreseen. But murder is a legal concept; it does not have to be defined in
terms of intentional killing, and even under s. 212 the definition is not this
narrow. The policy behind s. 213 is to put the risk of killing a victim during
the course of the commission of certain offences upon the offender to a higher
degree than if it were merely classified as manslaughter. In any case, with the
present distinction between murder punishable by death and murder punishable by
life imprisonment now abolished, much of the criticism loses its force. It was
the thought of someone being executed for a non‑intended homicide that
led to the feeling that the definition of murder should somehow be limited to
the old common law concept of ""murder with malice aforethought"".

 

52               As has been noted, the appellant's
conviction is based on a combination of s. 21(2)  and s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code . There was in this case evidence of active participation in the
commission of the robbery, the underlying offence, and the terms of s. 21(2) 
were fully met. It must be accepted that the section gives expression to a
principle of joint criminal liability long accepted and applied in the criminal
law. I am unable to say upon what basis one could exempt conduct which attracts
criminal liability, under s. 213  of the Criminal Code , from the
application of that principle. In R. v. Munro and Munro, supra,
Martin J.A. said, at p. 301:

 

                   Patently,
Parliament has decided that the carrying of weapons during the commission of
certain crimes, such as robbery, so manifestly endangers the lives of others,
that one who joins a common purpose to commit one of the specified offences and
who knows or ought to know that his accomplice has upon his person a weapon
which he will use if needed, must bear the risk if death, in fact, ensues as a
consequence of the use or possession of the weapon during the commission of one
of the specified offences or during the flight of the offender after the
commission or attempted commission of the underlying offence . . .

 

In my view, Martin J.A. has stated the
policy considerations which have motivated Parliament in this connection and I
would not interfere with the Parliamentary decision. I would, therefore,
dismiss the appeal and answer the two constitutional questions in the negative.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

53               La
Forest J.‑‑I have had the advantage of reading the judgment
of Lamer J. and would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by him. I am
in agreement with him that because of the stigma attached to a conviction for
murder, the principles of fundamental justice require a mens rea
reflecting the particular nature of that crime, namely one referable to causing
death. In addition to the intention to cause death, this can include a closely
related intention such as intention to cause bodily harm likely to result in
death combined with recklessness as to that result. Whether and how much
further the intention can be extended it is not necessary to explore for the
purposes of this case. It is sufficient to say that the mental element required
by s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  is so remote from the intention
specific to murder (which intention is what gives rise to the stigma attached
to a conviction for that crime) that a conviction under that paragraph violates
fundamental justice. All the provision requires is an intention to commit
another crime and to possess a weapon while carrying out this intention or in
fleeing afterwards. The provision is so broad that under it a person may be
found guilty of murder even though the death was the result of an accident.
This occurred in Rowe v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 713, and more extreme
examples can easily be imagined. The section is thus not only remote from the mens
rea specific to murder, but even removes its actus reus as
traditionally defined; see I. Grant and A. W. MacKay, ""Constructive Murder
and the Charter : In Search of Principle"" (1987), 25 Alta. L. Rev.
129.

 

54               As my colleague notes, the
objective of discouraging the use of weapons in the commission of crimes can be
achieved by means other than attaching the stigma of a conviction for murder to
a person who has caused death in the circumstances like those described in the
provision.

judgment of Dickson C.J. and Estey, Lamer and Wilson JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                Lamer J.‑‑This
appeal raises a question of law that is decided in the judgment rendered this
day in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, namely the
constitutionality of constructive murder as provided by s. 213(d) of the
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34.

 

2.                The
appellant, his elder brother Stephen Laviolette and a third person went to a
parish house with the intention of committing a robbery. Stephen gained
entrance to the house through a ground‑floor window. He asked Brian to
give him an iron pipe that was leaning against the house and Brian did so.
Stephen then opened the front door of the house and the others entered. Finding
nothing on the ground floor, they went upstairs. Awakened by the noise, the
priest emerged from his bedroom and saw Stephen. Stephen beat him to death with
the pipe.

 

3.                Stephen
pleaded guilty to second degree murder. The appellant and the third person were
charged with second degree murder under the combined operation of ss. 21(2) and
213(d) of the Code and were convicted following a joint trial.
The Prince Edward Island Supreme Court in banco set aside their
convictions and ordered the accused to be re‑tried separately. At his
second trial the appellant was again convicted of second degree murder. The
third person was acquitted.

 

4.                The
appellant appealed from this second conviction on the ground, inter alia,
that the combination of ss. 21(2) and 213(d) of the Code
contravened s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
The Prince Edward Island Supreme Court in banco unanimously dismissed
his appeal: (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 106.

 

5.                MacDonald
J., with whom Campbell J. concurred, held that the presumption of innocence is
not affected by ss. 21(2) and 213(d) of the Code, because the
Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt all of the elements required by s.
213(d). With respect to the elements required by s. 213(d), he
stated (at p. 114):

 

By not including in the definition of murder in s. 213(d)
a requirement of mens rea to commit murder, Parliament has not taken
away from an accused the right to be presumed innocent.

 

6.                McQuaid
J., in separate reasons, came to the same solution. He wrote, at p. 110:

 

Neither of those two sections, taken either separately
or in concert, creates a presumption of guilt or violates a presumption of
innocence. They simply say that if persons act in a certain way, with certain
consequences, and an independent and impartial tribunal, i.e., a jury,
finds that they have done so, in accordance with law, i.e., on the
initial assumption of innocence, in a fair and public hearing, i.e., a
trial, then certain sanctions will inevitably follow, i.e., conviction
and sentence. Indeed, it can be truly said that not only does the conjunctive
effect of ss. 213(d) and 21(2) not violate s. 11 (d) of the
Charter , but rather is the practical embodiment of it.

 

7.                With
respect, I do not share these views. For the reasons that I have given this day
in this Court's judgment in Vaillancourt, supra, I am of the view
that s. 213(d) of the Code infringes the rights guaranteed by ss.
7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  and is not a reasonable limit on those
rights, and is thus inoperative. The appellant's conviction pursuant to s. 213 (d)
thus cannot stand.

 

8.                I
would thus allow the appeal, set aside the appellant's conviction and order a
new trial.

Whether or not judge's instructions correct.

 

                   The
judge, at the trial of appellant and two others for criminal conspiracy to
raise funds for a political party then in power through their influence with
the government, invited members of the jury panel to claim exemptions from jury
service on grounds which included partiality as between the Crown and the
accused. The claims of the individual claimants were considered in open court
but out of the hearing of the accused and his counsel. Thirty‑six
exemptions were granted from the eighty‑three member panel; the trial
judge indicated that some question existed as to the impartiality of at least
four jurors. The jury, selected from the remaining panel, found the accused
guilty. The Appeal Division dismissed his appeal from conviction.

 

                   The
grounds of appeal raised here were: (1) whether or not the Appeal Division
erred in holding that the trial judge's examination under oath of members of
the jury panel in the absence of the appellant and his counsel did not vitiate
the appellant's trial; (2) whether or not the Appeal Division erred in holding
that the political party was a ""person"" within the meaning of s.
110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code ; (3) whether or not the trial
judge's instructions to the jury referable to the co‑conspirators'
exception to the hearsay rule were correct; (4) whether or not miscarriage of
justice has been occasioned as a result of the trial judge's failure to
instruct the jury as to the use, in law, that could be made of evidence of
appellant's good character.

 

                   Held
(McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Beetz, Estey, Wilson and La Forest JJ.: Section 577  of the Criminal
Code  should be given an expansive reading; the words ""whole of the
trial"" mean just that. Because of the fundamental importance of the
selection of the jury and because the Criminal Code  gives the accused
the right to participate in the process, the jury selection should be
considered part of the trial for the purposes of s. 577(1) . The exemptions
granted by the trial judge here did not constitute an in‑court extension
of the pre‑trial process contemplated in s. 577(1) .

 

                   In
jury selection, the provincial power for the administration of justice stops
and the federal power over criminal procedure begins when the judge's activity
is not concerned with the assembly of an array of eligible citizens but rather
with the precautions necessary to ensure an impartial jury. The Nova Scotia Juries
Act is consistent with this interpretation of the scope of the provincial
power. The balance of the Criminal Code 's comprehensive scheme, which is
designed to ensure as fair a jury as is possible and to ensure that the parties
and the public at large are convinced of its impartiality, would be upset by an
addition from another source. The province cannot give the judge any power to
make decisions as to partiality and any judge who attempts to participate in
such decisions usurps the function of the jurors established by s. 569(2) .
Usurpation of this sort is so severe an error of law by the judge that it
mandates a new trial, even if no prejudice to the accused can be shown.

 

                   Both
the accused and the public must perceive the proceedings to be fair; both would
have difficulty seeing a private conference between judge and juror after the
charges had been read and a plea entered as an administrative matter that did
not affect the accused's right to a fair trial. The decision should not turn
solely on the technical definition of when the trial began. Even if the excusal
can be seen as a purely administrative act, the public expectation of the
judicial role in these circumstances requires the judge to execute the
administrative task judicially. The judge must allow counsel to participate and
the public to know the reasons for the decision.

 

                   Sections
598, 599 and 600 do not apply here. The import of ss. 598 and 599 is that an
irregularity of form which does not affect the substance of a trial cannot be
used to challenge the result. These sections cannot cure doubts as to the
impartiality of the jury and the appearance of justice. Section 569(2) requires
all questions of partiality to be decided by the two jurors sworn for that
purpose, and accordingly, s. 600 does not authorize the judge to perform this
function.

 

                   All
of the jurors excused on grounds of partiality cannot be assumed to be partial
to the Crown. The grounds of partiality the trial judge used to exclude them
were not known and could only be a matter of speculation. The trial judge's
screening, too, could not be assumed to have helped the accused without
impairing the ability to challenge for cause later. It is quite possible that
jurors partial to the Crown or accused could have slipped through the screening
process.

 

                   Per
McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. (dissenting): The appellant was not present at the
selection of panel members prior to jury selection in that neither he nor his
counsel was permitted to hear the examination.

 

                   The
examination of the panel members claiming exemption was not conducted
""during"" the trial. While anything that occurs in the course of the
courtroom proceedings which could involve the accused's vital interests should
constitute part of the trial, not every step in the long process leading to the
ultimate verdict will be part of the trial for the purposes of s. 577 . The
accused's rights under s. 577  of the Criminal Code  will be violated if
the trial judge examines a juror for partiality in the absence of the accused
after the jury has been empanelled. But, the situation is profoundly different
if the trial judge examines jurors for partiality prior to the jury selection
process under the Code.

 

                   There
are two distinct steps involved in providing a jury to try an individual case.
The first, which involves assembling the jury panel from which individual
juries are to be selected, is governed by provincial law. The accused has no
interest in the process, save the interest of any citizen in the due
administration of the law. The second is governed by ss. 558 to 571 of the Code
and involves the selection from the jury panel of a jury to try a particular
case. The course taken by the trial judge was quite proper for his inquiry of
panel members was part of the first step of the jury process and could not
affect the vital interests of the accused touching on the question of guilt or
innocence.

 

                   The
word ""person"" in s. 110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  must
be read in the light of s. 2 of the Code. The Nova Scotia Liberal
Association clearly falls within the meaning of ""society"" found in
that section and accordingly is a person for the purposes of s. 110(1) (d).

 

                   The
evidence directly admissible against each of the three conspirators differed in
some particulars. There was evidence upon which the jury could conclude that a
conspiracy did exist and much of the evidence, as it would apply to each
individual charged, would be hearsay. The hearsay exception was therefore
available to the Crown if the jury, on a consideration of the evidence directly
admissible against each individual, had reached a conclusion as to membership
in the conspiracy in respect of each of the accused. The jury was properly
instructed as to their duties in this respect.

 

                   Evidence
of appellant's good reputation and character was clearly put before the jury
and was emphasized and given fair treatment by the trial judge. While not
directly stated by the trial judge, the jury must have been aware that they
could consider the evidence as relevant to show that the appellant was not
likely to have committed the crime with which he was charged. No miscarriage of
justice occurred with respect to the charge as a whole because of what at best
was a technical non‑direction.

principal issue in this appeal, and the only issue with which I intend to deal

The Jury
Selection

 

3.                       At
the opening of the trial the appellant was arraigned before an assembled jury
panel and entered a plea of not guilty on the charge before the court. The
trial judge then, in the following terms, invited the members of the jury panel
to claim exemptions on grounds which included potential partiality:

 

Members of the jury panel, you've just witnessed the
procedure under which the two accused persons in this case, have been arraigned
and you've heard the charge against them, and you've also heard their pleas of
not guilty to the charge, in each case. Now, we will later this morning, be
proceeding to select a Jury of twelve, who will try this case, which I may say,
is the only case on the docket for which you have been called. It's usual at
this time, however, to invite members of the jury panel to come forward and
claim exemption if there's any circumstance, such as relationship to one of
the accused, or other involvement with the case, that would prevent the
Juror from serving impartially in the case. To that usual call for
exemption claims, there are several matters I must add in this case. The first
is, that there has been in the press and in the broadcast media considerable
publicity about this case and I advise you that if exposure to that
publicity in your opinion, would operate to prevent you from being impartial in
this case, then you should come forward on that ground, as well as others
I've mentioned and claim exemption, and the other matter that I want to bring
to your attention in inviting claims for exemption, is that it's anticipated
that this case will last from four to six weeks and that, in some instances,
may create special hardship and that can be a basis on which you may now claim
exemption. So with those words of explanation I invite persons claiming
exemption in this case, now to come forward. You will be sworn and I will
consider the basis of your claim and deal with it. [Emphasis added.]

 

4.                       The
judge then proceeded to swear the jurors and considered claims for exemption
advanced by members of the jury panel in the courtroom but out of earshot of
all counsel and the accused. Counsel for Senator Barrow made objection to the
procedure in the following terms:

 

I have just one very respectful submission to make to
your Lordship. I realize there may be some very personal claims for exemption
that would be none of my business, and I wouldn't want to listen to it, but
since your Lordship invited the members of the Jury who might feel that they
couldn't be impartial by reason of publicity to claim exemption on that basis,
if some claim for exemptions made on that basis, I am wondering whether, my
Lord, that shouldn't be a claim that we should be able to listen to. I
am in your Lordship's hands as to that. [Emphasis added.]

 

5.                       The
judge advised counsel that he was prepared to note the grounds of exemption but
declined to depart from the procedure adopted. As appears from the judgment of
the Appeal Division, the judge considered claims for exemption on behalf of
members of the jury panel and granted thirty‑six exemptions. The jury
panel had consisted of eighty‑three members. After all exemptions had
been granted, the panel had been reduced to forty‑seven persons. The record
does not state whether any exemptions were refused.

 

                                                                    II

 

The
Judgment of the Appeal Division

 

6.                       The
decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, reported at
(1984), 65 N.S.R. (2d) 1, referred to s. 577(1)  of the Criminal Code 
which reads:

 

                   577. (1) Subject
to subsection (2), an accused other than a corporation shall be present in
court during the whole of his trial.

 

7.                       The
Appeal Division was satisfied that neither Senator Barrow nor his counsel was
able to hear the examination conducted by the trial judge and, in such
circumstances, Senator Barrow was effectively deprived of his right and duty to
be present. Being present included being able to hear the proceedings. The
Appeal Division then turned to the question of whether Senator Barrow had been
denied the right to be present during his trial. His counsel submitted that the
trial commenced with arraignment and plea; the Crown submitted that at the time
of the examination the jury of twelve had not been empanelled, the appellant
had not been placed in charge of the jury, and the trial had not commenced.

 

8.                       The
Appeal Division referred to several authorities and concluded that (i) a trial
does not commence until after a plea is entered; (ii) the call for exemptions
by the judge took place after plea and would therefore seem to be part of the
trial proceedings, at least for the purposes of s. 577 of the Code;
(iii) it has been the practice in Nova Scotia under s. 4(2) of the Juries
Act, S.N.S. 1969, c. 12, to exercise a wide discretion in granting
exemptions from jury duty, ""at least before arraignment"". (Section
4(2) reads: ""The judge presiding at a session or the Chief Justice may
grant to any person exemption from service as a juror at the whole or part of
that session upon application by or on behalf of the person."")

 

9.                       The
Appeal Division then noted that in this case the trial judge saw fit to examine
the jurors out of earshot of all counsel and the accused and in following that
process he indeed exempted thirty‑six jurors. It said at p. 10:

 

                   If this matter had ended at this
point we would have grave reservations as to the validity of the judge's
actions.

 

The
Appeal Division continued:

 

However, following this procedure defence counsel were
then given the right to challenge all jurors for cause and all remaining jurors
were challenged for cause and underwent a trial by two other jurors to
determine their partiality. Consequently, the defence was given every
opportunity to explore the question of impartiality with each juror. In these
circumstances we cannot see how any possible prejudice could have been suffered
by the appellant accused. Indeed his privileges were emphasized both by the
court and by counsel. The judge eliminated any juror whom he thought had any
semblance of partiality and the appellant accused was able subsequently to
further screen the jury by way of challenge for cause to determine whether or
not the jurors were impartial. In these circumstances and indeed even giving
the liberal construction to the process with respect to s. 577 of the Code
recommended by Dickson J. in R. v. Basarabas, supra, we have come to the
conclusion that the vital interests of the appellant were never jeopardized and
that there was no denial of any fundamental right. In our opinion the practice
followed by the trial judge was eminently fair to the accused person. There was
no error on the part of the trial judge in examining under oath the members of
the jury panel with respect to claims for exemption that would vitiate the
trial.

 

                                                                   III

 

10.                     With
the greatest of respect, I disagree with the reasoning of the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Like the Appeal Division, I have grave
reservations about the propriety of the procedure followed by the trial judge.
Unlike the Appeal Division, I do not think that the breach of the appellant's
right to be present was cured by the later opportunity afforded the accused,
pursuant to the Criminal Code , to challenge the remaining jurors for
cause. An inquiry of that sort may be appropriate to decide whether, an error
having been made, that error can be cured under s. 613(1) (b)(iii). It is
not relevant to the determination of whether an error has occurred in the first
place. I think there was an error, a breach of s. 577(1) , and for reasons which
I will make clear, I do not think that the error can be cured by s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

 

1.                Section
577  of the Criminal Code 

 

11.                     The
appellant submits that s. 577(1)  of the Criminal Code  not only entitles,
but requires, an accused to be ""present"" at his trial for a criminal
offence. The right and duty to be present is fundamental. It is further
submitted that the examination of members of the jury panel under oath was part
of the ""trial"" for the purposes of s. 577(1)  and that the inability
of the accused and his counsel to hear the exchanges between the judge and the
panel members claiming exemption effectively ensured that the accused was not
""present"" for that part of his trial. It is therefore necessary to
consider whether the trial of the accused had begun at the time the judge
examined the jurors.

 

12.                     Basarabas
and Spek v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 730, raised a similar question: when
does a trial before a jury begin for the purposes of s. 573 of the Code?
That section permits a judge to discharge a juror where in the course of a
trial the judge is satisfied that a juror should not, because of illness or
other reasonable cause, continue to act. At the trial of the two appellants in
that case a juror was discharged pursuant to s. 573 after the jury had been
empanelled but before the accused had been put in charge of the jury and before
any evidence had been called. The Crown contended that the juror was discharged
""in the course of"" the trial. The accused said that a jury trial did
not commence at least until the time at which the accused was put in charge of
the jury. This Court held unanimously that (i) the time of commencement of a
jury trial will vary according to the circumstances and the language of the
section of the Criminal Code  being applied; (ii) subject to s. 573 , an
accused in a criminal jury trial is entitled to be tried by twelve jurors and
is entitled to the unanimous verdict of twelve jurors unless and until ""in
the course of a trial"" the judge is satisfied that a juror should not
continue to act; (iii) in so far as s. 573  deprived an accused of his common
law right to the unanimous verdict of twelve persons, it should be narrowly construed;
(iv) the words ""continue to act"" in s. 573  suggested that the jury
had been acting qua jury before the discharge of the juror. In the
result, and in the context of s. 573 of the Code, the Court held that
the weight of authority supported the position that a jury trial commenced when
the accused had been placed in charge of the jury.

 

13.                     In
the course of the Basarabas judgment, however, reference was made to the
section of the Code in issue in the present appeal. After noting that the
time of commencement of a jury trial will vary according to the circumstances
and the language of the section of the Criminal Code  being applied, the
Court continued, at p. 740:

 

Thus, the word ""trial"" in s. 577(1)  which
assures the accused the right to be present ""during the whole of his
trial"" will be liberally construed to afford the accused the right to be
present during the selection of the jury. In like manner, the word
""trial"" in s. 566 which denies the prosecutor the right to direct a
juror to stand by on the trial of an indictment for the publication of a
defamatory libel will be interpreted to embrace the proceedings preceding the
empanelling of the jury. In other sections ""trial"" may have a
different connotation depending upon the section of the Code being
applied.

 

14.                     The
reason for varying starting points is that different sections of the Code
protect different interests. Section 573 allows the judge to remove a juror who
for some reason is unable to continue, but the removal of a juror is a very
serious matter. An accused has the right to be tried by twelve jurors (ss.
560(5) and 572(1)) and every effort must be made to avoid a jury of less than
twelve members. If the jury has heard no evidence, as in Basarabas, then
a juror can be replaced and s. 573 should not be used. ""Trial"" there
refers to the heart of the trial, the presentation of evidence before the trier
of fact. Section 577 , however, protects different interests and in my opinion
should be given an expansive reading. The words ""whole of the trial""
mean just that, the whole of the trial.

 

15.                     In
my view the examination of prospective jurors by the trial judge, relating in
part to their impartiality and following arraignment and plea, formed part of
the trial for the purposes of s. 577 . This conclusion is supported by several
cases which have emphasized the centrality of an impartial jury to a fair
trial.

 

16.                     In
R. v. Hertrich (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal
refused, [1982] 2 S.C.R. x, one of the questions raised was whether a judge's
examination in chambers of two jurors concerning anonymous phone calls, and
with only counsel present, breached the right of the accused to be present and
thus vitiated the trial. Martin J.A. delivered the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and adverted to the ""fundamental principle"" of the criminal
law that a person charged with an indictable offence is entitled, indeed
required, by s. 577  to be personally present at his trial. For the purpose of
this principle ""trial"" means the entire proceedings, including
sentence. Martin J.A. continued, at p. 527:

 

                   Generally speaking, the trial of an
accused does not commence until after plea: see Giroux v. The King (1917),
29 C.C.C. 258 at p. 268. However, ""trial"" for the purpose of the
principle that an accused is entitled to be present at his trial clearly
includes proceedings which are part of the normal trial process for determining
the guilt or innocence of the accused such as arraignment and plea, the
empanelling of the jury, the reception of evidence (including voir dire
proceedings with respect to the admissibility of evidence), rulings on
evidence, arguments of counsel, addresses of counsel to the jury, the judge's
charge, including requests by the jury for further instructions, the reception
of the verdict and the imposition of sentence if the accused is found guilty.
[Emphasis added.]

 

The
following two passages are also relevant, at p. 537:

 

                   The essential reason the accused is
entitled to be present at his trial is that he may hear the case made out
against him and, having heard it, have the opportunity of answering it: R.
v. Lee Kun (1915), 11 Cr. App. R. 293. The right of the accused to be present
at his trial, however, also gives effect to another principle. Fairness and
openness are fundamental values in our criminal justice system. The presence of
the accused at all stages of his trial affords him the opportunity of acquiring
first‑hand knowledge of the proceedings leading to the eventual result of
the trial. The denial of that opportunity to an accused may well leave him with
a justifiable sense of injustice. Indeed, in my view, an examination of the
Canadian decisions shows that the latter principle is, in fact, the implicit
and overriding principle underlying those decisions.

 

                                                                    ...

 

...the characterization of a proceeding as a part of the
trial in relation to the accused's right to be present at the proceeding would
seem to depend upon whether his exclusion from the proceeding violates his
right to be present so that at all times he may have direct knowledge of
anything that transpires in the course of his trial which could involve his
vital interests.

 

17.                     In
the result the Court of Appeal held that the appellants were entitled to be
present to hear from the jurors' own lips whether they were affected by those
telephone calls and whether the calls prevented them from continuing to
discharge their duties as jurors. This conclusion, Martin J.A. said, is
consistent in principle with the Canadian decisions, the course followed in the
two Australian decisions mentioned by him in the course of his judgment and the
weight of judicial opinion in the United States. Martin J.A. found this
persuasive, although he added at pp. 539‑40 that ""the force of that
[American] opinion is somewhat diminished by the fact that the American courts
frequently apply the `harmless error rule' where the right of a defendant to be
present at all stages of his trial has been infringed. By contrast, s. 577  and
the jurisprudence surrounding it precludes the application of any such rule in
Canada"".

 

18.                     In
Hertrich, Martin J.A. conducted an admirable survey of the American case
law on this subject and concluded that in that country as well the accused has
a right to be present during any examination of a juror as to his or her
impartiality. A distinction is drawn in the United States, however, between
exemptions claimed on grounds of partiality and those claimed on essentially
private grounds of hardship, illness, and the like. In the latter instances,
the examination by the judge has been held to be outside the scope of the trial
(Hertrich, p. 534). Of course, this was precisely the distinction
advanced by the defence counsel at the trial of the instant case. He objected
to the trial judge's course of action only in the case of jurors claiming
exemption on grounds of prejudice.

 

19.                     As
Martin J.A. suggests, the weight of authority both in Canada and in the United
States supports the contention of the appellant that the questioning under oath
of jurors as to their possible partiality is a part of the trial. The appellant
therefore had a right to be present, a right which must include the right to
hear the proceedings.

 

20.                     Martin
J.A. in Hertrich identified two important principles that underlie s.
577 . First, the accused is present to hear the case he or she faces and is
thereby able to put forward a defence. Second, the accused sees the entire
process by which he or she is tried and is able to see that the correct
procedure is followed and the trial fair. For Martin J.A., the second principle
was the more important one. I agree with him that this second value is of
enormous importance to the perceived fairness of the Canadian criminal justice
system. The sight of a judge conferring in private with jurors on issues that
go to the partiality of the trier of fact can only prompt cynicism in an
accused. It should be avoided.

 

21.                     The
question of what is included in the trial for purposes of s. 577(1) was also
addressed by this Court in Vézina and Côté v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
2. Justice Lamer for the Court held that the right to be present at trial
included the right to be present at an examination of jurors for partiality
after the trial had begun. Adopting the reasoning of Martin J.A. in Hertrich,
Lamer J. held that the test of what should be included in ""trial"" was
not limited to the presentation of the case against the accused and to matters
that directly affected the decision as to guilt or innocence, such as rulings
on the admissibility of evidence. For Lamer J., s. 577(1) is triggered whenever
the ""vital interests"" of the accused are at stake, or as Martin J.A.
put it in Hertrich, when a decision bears on the ""substantive
conduct of the trial."" Any question about the partiality of the jurors individually
or the jury as a whole reflects on the substantive conduct of the trial and
must be dealt with in the presence of the accused. The accused has a right to a
fair trial as well as a right to hear the case and make a defence. Section
577(1) protects both rights. In both Hertrich and Vézina and Côté,
s. 577(1) was infringed when the judge examined jurors for partiality after the
trial began and in the absence of the accused.

 

22.                     The
Crown argues that the trial judge must oversee the jury selection process as
part of the duty to ensure a fair trial. Even if the Nova Scotia Juries Act
does not authorize the process followed here, the Crown suggests that it was
part of the judge's inherent powers under the Criminal Code , continued
by s. 600 . The Crown cites the case of R. v. Hubbert (1975), 29 C.C.C.
(2d) 279 (Ont. C.A.); affirmed [1977] 2 S.C.R. 267. Hubbert raised the
question whether a trial judge, when empanelling a jury, might properly ask the
panel as a whole whether any member of the panel has any connection with any of
the parties. The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal reads, in part, at pp.
292‑93:

 

                   Turning to the practical
consideration of the methods by which the process should be carried out, we
deal first with the kind of obvious partiality dealt with in the English
practice direction. Some trial Judges make a practice of saying to the jury
panel, before the selection process begins, something of this nature:

 

If there is anyone on this panel who is closely
connected with a party to this case or with a witness who is to testify, will
you please stand?

 

(Rarely does anyone respond.) If someone does stand, the
trial Judge asks him to come forward (usually to the jury‑box), and
inquires further as to that person's connection with the case. To take obvious
examples, if the juror is the uncle of the accused, or the wife of a witness,
or the brother of the investigating police officer, he ought not to serve.

 

                   In our view, the trial Judge on his
own should excuse that prospective juror from the case, without more ado. The Criminal
Code  makes no express provision for it, but it does not expressly or
impliedly forbid it either, and in our view it is in the power of the trial Judge
as part of his function of ensuring a fair trial. We think the practice of
excusing jurors of obvious partiality is a desirable one in all cases.

 

The Hubbert
case was appealed to this Court. The appeal was dismissed orally without
calling upon Crown counsel.

 

23.                     In
Hubbert, the Ontario Court of Appeal and this Court approved the common
practice of a trial judge's asking the members of the jury array if any of them
had any obvious connection to the case that would disqualify them. There are
two differences between Hubbert and the case at bar. The first is that
in the procedure recommended by the Ontario Court of Appeal, any member of the
array who responds to the initial question answers any subsequent questions
from the jury box. In other words, the judge's questions and the juror's
responses are heard by everyone in the court, including the accused, and all
will know the reason why the juror thinks he or she is not impartial. There is
a world of difference between this procedure and a whispered conference between
the judge and the potential juror, at the bench. The Hubbert procedure
does not violate the accused's right to be present.

 

24.                     The
second difference is that an initial question by the judge to the jury array is
best seen as a summary procedure to speed up the jury selection, done with the
consent of the parties. This was the view of the majority of the Quebec Court
of Appeal in Guérin v. R., [1984] C.A. 305, 13 C.C.C. (3d) 231. Both
Bisson J.A. (at p. 246) and Jacques J.A. (at pp. 248‑49) make the point
that when counsel agree to initial questions by the judge there is no violation
of the Code procedure. Either side can challenge any juror that the
judge does not exclude and obvious cases are decided quickly on consent. Where
counsel for either side objects to the process, as in this case, the judge
cannot continue with the questions but must leave it to the parties and the
jurors, under the judge's supervision.

 

25.                     The
selection of an impartial jury is crucial to a fair trial. The Criminal Code 
recognizes the importance of the selection process and sets out a detailed
procedure to be followed (ss. 554 ‑573). Both the Crown and the accused
participate in the process, with the right to challenge for cause or
peremptorily and, in the case of the Crown, to stand aside potential jurors
(ss. 562 ‑568). The challenge for cause involves trial of the impartiality
of potential jurors, with examination by either side. The accused, the Crown,
and the public at large all have the right to be sure that the jury is
impartial and the trial fair; on this depends public confidence in the
administration of justice. Because of the fundamental importance of the
selection of the jury and because the Code gives the accused the right
to participate in the process, the jury selection should be considered part of
the trial for the purposes of s. 577(1) .

 

2.                Section
4(2) of the Juries Act

 

26.                     The
issue in this case is complicated, however, by the relationship between the Criminal
Code  and s. 4(2) of the Nova Scotia Juries Act which, as noted
above, states:

 

                   4. ...

 

                   (2) The judge presiding at a
session or the Chief Justice may grant to any person exemption from service as
a juror at the whole or part of that session upon application by or on behalf
of the person.

 

""Session""
is defined in s. 1(m) of the Act as including any convening of the Trial
Division of the Supreme Court for the purpose of one or more civil matters or
one or more criminal matters. It is not readily apparent why the word
""session"" is used rather than the word ""trial"". The record
is silent on the question of whether Burchell J. had convened the Trial Division
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and was therefore presiding at a
""session"" as well as at a trial. I do not make anything of the point
as it was not advanced before us.

 

27.                     In
the present case, as I understand its position, the Crown argues that even if
the word ""trial"" in s. 577(1) includes the selection of the jury, the
examination of jurors claiming exemptions is not part of the jury selection
process. It occurs before the commencement of the jury trial and is part of the
pre‑trial process of assembling a jury array of qualified, non‑exempt
jurors. Crown counsel contends that the jury selection process under the Criminal
Code  had not yet begun. The judge was using his authority under s. 4(2) of
the Juries Act to provide an eligible array, after which selection of
the jury would begin under the Code. It is asserted that the exemptions
granted by the trial judge in this case ""merely constituted an in‑court
extension"" of the pre‑trial process contemplated in s. 577(1). Since
by this argument the trial had not yet begun, s. 577(1) did not yet apply and
the accused had no right to attend or to participate. Neither did he have a
right under s. 4(2) of the Juries Act to participate in the exemption
process. Once the judge began the jury selection process under the Code
he allowed full participation by counsel for the accused. The Crown thus
concludes that there was no breach of s. 577(1).

 

28.                     I
am firmly of the view that these submissions cannot be sustained. First, s. 4(2)
of the Juries Act relates specifically to exemption before formal court
proceedings. How can it be said that proceedings in court after arraignment and
after a plea has been entered are not formal court proceedings? Secondly, the
pre‑process exemptions must be intended to allow persons who would suffer
serious inconvenience from serving on any jury during the session to petition
for a discretionary order to allow them to avoid that inconvenience. Some of
the exemptions granted in the present case related not to inconvenience, but to
prejudice. The considerations must surely be different.

 

3.                Constitutional
Considerations

 

29.                     The
Crown's arguments also fail when set against the principles of the division of
powers under the Constitution Act, 1867 , the nature of the power
conferred on the judge by s. 4(2) of the Juries Act, and the jury
selection process in the Code. The Juries Act does not authorize
the judge to screen the panel in secret after charges have been read out and plea
entered. Even if it did, the appearance of justice and the need for a fair
trial suggests that the power could not be exercised in the way the trial judge
did in the case at bar.

 

30.                     It
is undoubtedly the right and the duty of the Nova Scotia Legislature to pass a
law for the gathering of the jury array. Section 92(14)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 , enables the province to legislate for the administration of
justice within the province so long as it does not infringe on matters of
criminal procedure, reserved to the federal government by s. 91(27) . Part of
this provincial power includes the assembly of an array of potential jurors for
the courts of criminal jurisdiction to use in accordance with the Criminal
Code . This power, however, is largely an administrative task, as s. 92(14) 
itself implies. In the case of jury selection, the provincial power for the
administration of justice stops and the federal power over criminal procedure
begins when the judge's activity is not concerned with the assembly of an array
of eligible citizens, but with the precautions necessary to ensure an impartial
jury. The Nova Scotia Juries Act is consistent with this interpretation
of s. 92(14) . The Act as a whole sets out the procedure to assemble the jury
panel by the time court sessions begin. It states who will make up the jury
committee for each municipality, how and when they will go about the task, and
how the judiciary shall supervise it. The emphasis in the Act is to gather as
random a sample of eligible jurors as possible, with no discussion of
partiality. Significantly, s. 4(1) sets out certain categories of people who
cannot serve on a jury because of their occupation. Subsection 4(2) seems to be
a general clause to enable the judge supervising a session to exempt people who
have personal reasons not to serve on a jury yet do not fit into the specific
exemptions. Neither subsection is directly concerned with the partiality of
potential jurors.

 

31.                     This
interpretation of s. 4(2) of the Nova Scotia Juries Act is strengthened
by a survey of the jury acts in the other Canadian jurisdictions. In every
other province and in both territories there is a provision similar to the
disqualification in s. 4(1) of a broad range of people by occupation, notably
those connected with the justice system. No other jurisdiction has a provision
similar to s. 4(2), with its unqualified reference to ""exemptions"".
In every other jurisdiction but Nova Scotia, the legislature provides that
exemptions are available only if the applicants meet certain criteria. These
criteria vary from the laconic ""for a good cause"" in the territories,
to ""hardship"" in some provinces, to more detailed criteria of
hardship, age, religious belief, or similar factors in some provinces. Every
other jurisdiction recognizes that its authority over the jury pool is limited
to eligibility and personal matters unconnected with the criminal case to be
tried. In spite of its apparently broad phrasing, the Nova Scotia provision
should be interpreted as similarly limited, to maintain its constitutional
integrity.

 

32.                     The
Code sets out a detailed process for the selection of an impartial jury.
It gives both parties substantial powers in the process and sets up a mechanism
to try the partiality of a potential juror when challenged for cause. The trier
of partiality is not the judge but a mini‑jury of two potential or
previously selected jurors (s. 569(2)). Overall, it is a comprehensive scheme
designed to ensure as fair a jury as is possible and to ensure that the parties
and the public at large are convinced of its impartiality. Any addition to this
process from another source would upset the balance of the carefully defined
jury selection process. This is especially the case of any attempt to add to
the powers of the judge. Parliament has decided that the issue of partiality is
a question of fact that must be decided by two of the jurors themselves, not by
the judge. The province cannot give the judge any power to make decisions as to
partiality and any judge who attempts to participate in such decisions usurps
the function of the jurors established by s. 569(2). Usurpation of this sort is
so severe an error of law by the judge that it mandates a new trial, even if no
prejudice to the accused can be shown (Guérin v. R., supra). The
judge's role is to supervise trials of partiality, not to decide them.

 

4.                The
Appearance of Justice

 

33.                     The
argument of the Crown in this appeal does not address what may be the most
important aspect of the case, namely, the appearance of justice. Even if the
two‑stage analysis of the empanelling process is a legally accurate
description of the interplay of the Criminal Code  and the Nova Scotia Juries
Act, it leaves out of account the effect of the proceedings in this case as
they would appear to the average citizen: prospective jurors were able to speak
to the judge in private, albeit in open court, and be excused from jury duty
with no reason given. The problem arises because the Nova Scotia Juries Act
gives an administrative duty to the judge: the power to exempt potential jurors
for personal reasons unconnected with the facts of a particular trial. This
administrative duty concerns a particularly sensitive point of a trial and
closely resembles the judicial duty of examining jurors for partiality, a
fundamental part of the duty to provide a fair trial. The average citizen
watching would not likely appreciate the legal categorization of the judge's
power to excuse for personal reasons, and it would be difficult for the
accused, who is particularly sensitive on this point, to see a private
conference between judge and juror after the accused's name was called out, the
charges read and a plea entered, as an administrative matter that did not
affect his right to a fair trial. The decision should not turn solely on the
technical definition of when the trial began. I think that an accused who
appears before a judge in a courtroom with his counsel, hears the charge read,
and pleads to the charge, would think it very strange to be told that his trial
had not begun. He would, I think, find it equally strange that almost half of
those called for jury duty were relieved of that duty after whispered goings on
with the presiding judge.

 

34.                     What
of the public perception? This is a case where the public perception of the
fairness of the proceedings is crucial. A judge sitting in open court embodies
the judicial role in the public mind, a role different from that of the
administrative officer who assembles the array initially. The same act,
excusing a juror for personal reasons, will be seen in a different light when
done by the drafters of the jury list as part of the first stage of assembling
an array of potential jurors and when done by a judge in open court once the
accused is charged and plea entered. Even if the excusal can be seen as a
purely administrative act, the public expectation of the judicial role in these
circumstances requires the judge to execute the administrative task judicially.
The judge must allow counsel to participate and the public to know the reasons
for the decision. Nothing should be done in private in open court.

 

35.                     Again,
a comparison to the statutes of the other jurisdictions is illuminating. In
most of them, a person who wishes to be exempted from the jury list applies to
the official who drew up the list, the sheriff (in New Brunswick, the Jury
Board). If the exemption is refused there is either a right of appeal to a
superior court judge or the person can make a new application to a judge, as
specified by the statute. (In Newfoundland the application is to a provincial
court judge, with appeal from a refusal to a supreme court judge. In Prince
Edward Island the application is directly to the judge at trial.) These
provisions show that other jurisdictions consider exemptions for personal
reasons to be administrative issues for court officials to decide, subject to
the review and supervision of the judiciary. Such review of administrative
decisions normally includes the duty to act judicially, with due regard for the
appearance of justice.

 

5.                Sections
598, 599 and 600

 

36.                     It
was suggested that even if the trial judge erred in his questioning and
exemption of the jurors, that error could be cured by the application of ss.
598 or 599. It was also questioned whether the screening was authorized by s.
600. In my opinion, none of these provisions applies in this case.

 

37.                     Section
598 provides that irregularities in the summons of the jury or in its
membership cannot be used to attack a verdict, while s. 599 states that failure
to follow precisely the rules for jury selection does not warrant setting aside
a verdict reached subsequently. The import of these two provisions is that an
irregularity of form which does not affect the substance of a trial cannot be
used to challenge the result.

 

38.                     The
right to be present is a fundamental right of the accused. Exclusion of the
accused from part of the trial, especially part of the selection of an
impartial jury, is not an irregularity of form. It casts into doubt two of the
most basic aspects of a fair trial, the impartiality of the jury and the
appearance of justice. Sections 598 and 599 do not cure the defect. As the late
MacKinnon A.C.J. held in R. v. Varga (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 281, when
one of the parties is denied a right in the jury selection process given by the
Criminal Code , prejudice can be inferred and these sections are of no
assistance.

 

39.                     There
is another reason why the sections are inapplicable. The Quebec Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Side), held in R. v. Battista (1912), 21 C.C.C. 1, that
the predecessors of the two sections apply to objections to the jury selection
raised for the first time after verdict. The Supreme Court of Canada considered
and approved this decision in R. v. Stewart, [1932] S.C.R. 612, saying
that the situation is entirely different when the objection to the jury
selection is taken at trial. Defence counsel here objected to the judge's
actions from the beginning.

 

40.                     As
for s. 600, it is a provision to carry forward any common law power of the
judge in relation to the jury selection process that is not «...expressly
altered by or is inconsistent with this Act.» Whether or not a judge ever had
the power to examine jurors for partiality need not be decided. The Criminal
Code  has eliminated any power of the judge to decide issues of partiality.
By section 569(2), all questions of partiality are to be decided by the two
jurors sworn for that purpose. Section 600  therefore does not authorize the
judge to perform this function.

 

6.                Section
613(1)(b)(iii)

 

41.                     It
is no doubt true, as the respondent Crown submits, that the accused retained
his right to challenge any prospective juror for cause even after the trial
judge had excluded thirty‑six members of the panel. It is suggested that
this possibility wiped out any prejudicial effect on the judge's secret
questioning. The Appeal Division would appear to have held that view. The
response to this assertion is that, as a matter of authority, this Court has
already held that the denial of the right under s. 577  is
""fundamental"", requiring the setting aside of the conviction. The
curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) are innately inapplicable: Meunier
v. The Queen (1965), 48 C.R. 14, [1966] (Que. Q.B.) 94n, affirmed
[1966] S.C.R. 399. Since the decision in Meunier, it has been the rule
that no breach of the right to be present can be cured by s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
as the absence of the accused deprives the court of all jurisdiction.

 

42.                     In
R. v. Hertrich, supra, at p. 527, Martin J.A. followed Meunier
and the other authorities mentioned in the passage following and concluded that
the curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) were not applicable if the
accused is deprived of his right to be present at his trial in contravention of
s. 577 :

 

                   The law is settled that depriving an
accused of his right to be present at his trial in contravention of s. 577  is
the denial of a fundamental right requiring the setting aside of the
conviction, and the curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) are
inapplicable: see Meunier v. The Queen (1965), 48 C.R. 14, [1966] Que.
Q.B. 94n; affirmed [1966] S.C.R. 399, 50 C.R. 75; Ginoux v. The Queen
(1971), 15 C.R.N.S. 117; affirmed 16 C.R.N.S. 256n; R. v. Reale
(1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 345, [1973] 3 O.R. 905: affirmed 22 C.C.C. (2d) 571, 58
D.L.R. (3d) 560, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 624 sub nom. A.‑G. Ont. v.
Reale; R. v. Grimba (1980), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 570, 117 D.L.R. (3d) 740,
30 O.R. (2d) 545.

 

43.                     There
was in the instant case a major deviation from the Code procedure for
the selection of the jury, one that eliminated nearly half the jury pool for
reasons unknown to the accused. That is not a minor breach of the accused's
right to be present. It is a breach that casts into doubt the impartiality of
the jury, which in turn reflects on the fairness of the entire trial.

 

44.                     The
rigidity of Meunier has been criticized, notably in Côté v. R.,
[1982] C.A. 419, 3 C.C.C. (3d) 155, and in R. v. Fenton (1984), 11
C.C.C. (3d) 109 (B.C.C.A.) Some doubt was also cast upon the rule in Meunier
in this Court's decision in Vézina and Côté, supra, where Lamer
J. emphasized, at p. 14:

 

As a last comment on the matter I should not want it to
be taken that, when adopting Martin J.A.'s views in Hertrich, the issue
of whether the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) was available, has been
inferentially reconsidered and the reasoning in Meunier on that point
reaffirmed in this case.

 

But this
comment should not necessarily be read as impugning the decision in Meunier.
On the facts of Vézina and Côté, it was simply unnecessary to decide the
point. Lamer J. left open the possibility that the rule might be reconsidered.
The issue is raised more starkly in the instant case, but I believe that no
grounds are raised that should cause the Court to reverse a decision of long
standing.

 

45.                     Indeed,
I am not convinced that the appellant suffered no prejudice. The Crown would
have this Court assume, first, that all the jurors who were excused on grounds
of partiality were partial to the Crown, and second, that the trial judge's
screening could only have helped the accused without impairing the ability to
challenge for cause later. Neither of these assumptions seems to me to be
correct. First, we simply do not know and can only speculate as to the grounds
of partiality the trial judge used to exclude jurors. It may very well be that
in reducing the panel by over forty percent, the trial judge excluded persons,
perhaps friends of the accused or Liberal party supporters, who might have been
more favourable to the accused than to the Crown. While the accused does not
have the right to a favourable jury, only an impartial one, it is not obvious
that the exclusion was only to the benefit of the accused.

 

46.                     As
for the second assumption, it may be that the trial judge's screening might
actually have hindered the selection of an impartial jury. Suppose a juror
conscientiously told the judge that he or she might not be impartial for some
reason, such as membership in a political party, and the judge decided that the
juror was impartial. The juror's concern about impartiality may then have been
set to rest by the judge's decision so that the juror would not raise the issue
again when challenged for cause. After all, if the judge had so concluded, why
would the juror express any doubt about it when challenged by counsel? The
juror's concern about his or her own impartiality has been set to rest on the
highest authority, that of the judge. If counsel had heard the exchange between
the juror and the judge and thought that the judge was wrong, counsel could
have pursued the issue further. As it was, there was no reason not to accept
the juror's response to the challenge at face value. Thus, jurors partial to
the Crown or the accused may have slipped through the screening process.

 

47.                     The
point of these examples is not that the jury should have included friends of
the accused, or political allies, or partisan opponents. Nor is it to suggest
that political affiliation is automatically cause to challenge in such a case.
The point is that we cannot assume that whatever screening occurred in secret
was beneficial for the accused, or even neutral. These examples show the
fundamental reason why all questions of partiality must be decided in public:
the accused, the Crown, and the public at large have the right to know that the
jury is as impartial as is humanly possible. Such speculation is harmful.

 

                                                                   IV

 

Summary

 

48.                     In
sum, s. 577(1)  of the Criminal Code  requires that the accused be present
at his trial for a criminal offence. The examination of the prospective jurors
by the trial judge, relating in part to their impartiality and following
arraignment and plea, was part of the trial for purposes of s. 577 . It is
important for the accused to see and hear the entire process by which he or she
is tried so that he or she sees that the trial is fair, and s. 4(2) of the Nova
Scotia Juries Act should be construed as relating to exemption of jurors
for reasons of hardship, illness or inconvenience before the commencement of
formal court proceedings. A wider interpretation of s. 4(2) of the Juries
Act, one that permits exemption of jurors after arraignment and plea and on
grounds of possible prejudice, would intrude into federal jurisdiction over
criminal procedure. The public perception of the fairness of the trial process
would be damaged if potential jurors were excluded after private conversations
with the judge. Further, the judge's actions were not authorized by s. 600 of
the Code. Finally, the trial judge's error in this case was of a
fundamental nature and therefore the curative provisions in ss. 598, 599 and
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code should not be applied.

 

49.                     In
closing, the words of Haines J. in R. v. Elliot, [1973] 3 O.R. 475
(H.C.), are an accurate summary of both the method and the goals of the jury
selection process:

 

Much more in keeping with the realities of the situation
is to allow the accused through his counsel to ask such relevant questions in
open Court as to the partiality and fitness of the juror under the watchful eye
of the Judge who will in the exercise of his discretion protect the interest of
the Crown and the accused as well as the administration of justice. In this
matter the tribunal itself is enhanced in the eyes of the public. Lay triers
have found the juror fair and impartial. Justice is at its highest when its
administration is shared by our citizens.

Conclusion

 

50.                     I
would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Appeal Division of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and order a new trial for the appellant. Although
strictly speaking I do not have to decide the other three issues, for the
guidance of the trial judge who re‑tries the case I think it useful to
state that I would agree with McIntyre J.'s opinions on those issues.

 

                   The
reasons of McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. were delivered by

 

51.                     McIntyre J.
(dissenting)‑‑The appellant Barrow was jointly charged with one
MacFadden and one Simpson with an offence under ss. 423(1) (d) and
110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code . The indictment is in these terms:

 

that [they]...unlawfully did...conspire together and
with James G. Simpson and with various officials of the government of the
Province of Nova Scotia and with another person or persons unknown, to demand
or accept for the benefit of themselves or the Nova Scotia Liberal Association
or a member or members thereof or another person or persons, rewards,
advantages or benefits, as consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise
of influence or an act or omission in connection with the transaction of
business with or any matter of business relating to the Province of Nova Scotia
or any benefit that Her Majesty is authorized or is entitled to bestow,
contrary to Section 423(1) (d) and 110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

Simpson
pleaded guilty in the magistrates' court and was fined $75,000. MacFadden and
the appellant elected trial by judge and jury and after a preliminary inquiry
they were committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The
trial commenced on April 5, 1983. The Crown called extensive evidence and when
it closed its case a motion was made by the defence for a directed verdict.
This motion was denied and the appellant and MacFadden elected not to call
evidence. On May 11, 1983, the jury returned a verdict of guilty against both
accused and, on May 12, l983, the trial judge sentenced each man to the payment
of a fine of $25,000.

 

52.                     The
appellant appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia (the Court of Appeal). MacFadden did not appeal. The Court of Appeal
dismissed the appellant's appeal against conviction in reasons for judgment
delivered September 11, l984 (65 N.S.R. (2d) 1). The appellant was granted
leave to appeal to this Court, pursuant to s. 618(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code .

 

The
Facts

 

53.                     In
1968, the Nova Scotia Liberal Association created a finance committee to raise
funds for the purposes of the party. The Committee was composed of the
appellant, as chairman, and MacFadden and Simpson who acted primarily as
collectors. Two bank accounts were opened by the Committee for the purpose of
receiving financial contributions. The accounts were in the name of Cambridge
Investments and J. G. Simpson, in trust. The signing authorities on the
Cambridge account were Simpson and MacFadden and, on the other, Simpson and his
secretary. Monies collected or received were deposited to these accounts and
then disbursed to several trust funds which had been set up over the years for
the purposes of the Nova Scotia liberal party, to various individuals and the
Nova Scotia Liberal Association. The common trustee of all the trust funds was
the appellant.

 

54.                     According
to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which on this point is not challenged,
the evidence, particularly documentary evidence, showed clearly that the
appellant and his co‑accused were at all times aware of the flow of cash
through both bank accounts. Meticulous accounting records were kept with respect
to the two accounts and none of the monies disbursed from the accounts or the
various trust funds was expended by the appellant or his two co‑accused
for their own use or benefit. The evidence also revealed a close relationship
between the members of the Committee, as well as a close connection between the
committee members and government officials from whom they received information
relating to such matters as the identity of those who were doing business with
the Government of Nova Scotia.

 

55.                     In
October of 1970, the liberal party defeated the then Government of Nova Scotia
in a general election and formed the new government which held power until
1978. During the period from 1970 to 1978, the Committee collected contributions
amounting in total to $3,836,468.13, of which $2,770,773.52 was deposited in
one bank account and $1,065,694.61 in the other. A police investigation
commenced in the autumn of 1978 resulted in the seizure of many documents from
government departments and agencies and also from several wineries,
distilleries and other corporations. The evidence revealed that the
contributions made by liquor and wine companies dealing with the government
were based on a fixed amount per case of products sold to the Government. Other
companies doing business with the government paid a percentage of monies they
received from government work which ranged from three to five per cent.

 

56.                     The
theory of the Crown was that the monies contributed to the Committee were not,
in fact, bona fide political contributions but were payments made by them to
ensure the continuation of their business relationship with the Government. To
secure these contributions, the appellant and his two accused, out of their
desire to support the liberal party in Nova Scotia, agreed among themselves to
""peddle their influence with the Government"" to the various companies
doing business with the Government. The appellant defended on the basis that
his character and reputation refuted the charge against him. It was said that
the whole case for the Crown was an attempt to involve the appellant in conduct
of the co‑accused Simpson in which he was in no way involved. The
appellant did not contend before the Court of Appeal, nor does he in this
Court, that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or could not be supported
by the evidence. He raised four grounds of appeal before the Court of Appeal
and raised the same grounds in this Court. They are set out hereunder:

 

1. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the learned Trial
Judge's examination under oath of members of the jury panel on April 5, 1983 in
the absence of the appellant (and his counsel) did not vitiate the appellant's
trial.

 

2. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the Nova Scotia
Liberal Association is a ""person"" within the meaning of Section
110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

3. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the learned Trial
Judge's instructions to the jury, referable to the co‑conspirators'
exception to the hearsay rule were correct.

 

4. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that no miscarriage of
justice was occasioned as a result of the learned Trial Judge's failure to
instruct the jury as to the use, in law, that could be made of evidence of
Senator Barrow's good character.

 

I will
address the grounds in that order.

 

Right to
Presence at Trial (s. 577(1) of the Criminal Code )

 

57.                     On
April 5, 1983, the appellant and MacFadden were arraigned before a panel of
jurors and pleaded not guilty. The trial judge, following what he described as
""the ordinary procedure"", then invited members of the panel to claim
exemptions from jury service on grounds which included partiality as between
the Crown and the accused. He said:

 

Members of the Jury Panel, you've just witnessed the
procedure under which the two accused persons in this case, have been arraigned
and you've heard the charge against them, and you've also heard their pleas of
not guilty to the charge, in each case. Now, we will later this morning, be
proceeding to select a Jury of twelve, who will try this case, which I may say,
is the only case on the docket for which you have been called. It's usual at
this time, however, to invite members of the Jury panel to come forward and
claim exemption if there's any circumstance, such as relationship to one of the
accused, or other involvement with the case, that would prevent the Juror from
serving impartially in the case. To that usual call for exemption claims, there
are several matters I must add in this case. The first is, that there has been
in the press and in the broadcast media considerable publicity about this case
and I advise you that if exposure to that publicity in your opinion, would
operate to prevent you from being impartial in this case, then you should come
forward on that ground, as well as the others I've mentioned and claim
exemption, and the other matter that I want to bring to your attention in
inviting claims for exemption, is that it's anticipated that this case will
last from four to six weeks and that, in some instances, may create special
hardship and that can be a basis on which you may now claim exemption. So, with
those words of explanation I invite persons claiming exemption in this case,
now to come forward. You will be sworn and I will consider the basis of your
claim and deal with it.

 

58.                     The
trial judge then swore the individual claimants and considered their claims for
exemption, doing so in the courtroom but out of hearing of the accused or his
counsel. Counsel for the appellant commented on this procedure in response to
an invitation by the trial judge:

 

I have just one very respectful submission to make to
your Lordship. I realize there may be some very personal claims for exemption
that would be none of my business, and I wouldn't want to listen to it, but
since your Lordship invited the members of the Jury who might feel that they
couldn't be impartial by reason of publicity to claim exemption on that basis,
if some claim for exemptions made on that basis, I am wondering whether, my
Lord, that shouldn't be a claim that we should be able to listen to. I am in
your Lordship's hands as to that.

 

The
trial judge replied:

 

I'm prepared Mr. Cooper to note in those instances what
the ground of exemption is, but beyond that, I don't think we should depart
from the ordinary procedure.

 

He
proceeded to hear claims for exemption, still out of hearing of the appellant
and his counsel. In the end, he granted thirty‑six exemptions from
service. No reasons were given for the exemptions of thirty‑two of the
jurors, but the judge gave reasons in respect of the remaining four in these
terms (the jurors' names are omitted):

 

#85 ...is excused on the ground of his association
with the accused persons in this case. It's not necessary ...that you remain
here.

 

#11 ...is excused on the ground of familiarity with
the publicity concerning the case and his relationship to a minister of
government.

 

#34 [is excused as he] served on the Grand Jury
that dealt with this case.

 

#75 ...is excused on the ground that he feels that
he cannot be impartial in his case because of the nature of the case.

 

Jury
selection then began from the remaining panel members. Each one was challenged
for cause. The appropriate procedures for such challenges provided for in the Criminal
Code  were followed and no objection has been made on that ground. As a
result, each juror who was empanelled to try the accused's case had been
challenged for cause according to law and had survived the challenge. On the
basis of these facts, the appellant's first ground is advanced.

 

59.                     The
appellant submits that his right under s. 577  of the Criminal Code  to be
""present in court during the whole of his trial"" was violated when
the trial judge examined jurors for partiality out of hearing of the accused
and his counsel. This submission raises two issues: (1) Was the accused present
during the examination of the panel members claiming exemption? (2) Was the
examination of those claiming exemption conducted ""during"" the trial?
With respect to the first issue, I agree with the Court of Appeal and counsel
for the appellant that the accused was not present when the trial judge
conducted his examination of persons claiming exemption. ""The presence of
the accused means not merely that he must be physically in attendance, but also
that he must be capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings"": R.
v. Lee Kun, [1916] l K.B. 337. Although the appellant was physically
present during the trial judge's examination of the jurors, neither he nor his
counsel was permitted to hear the examination. It is, therefore, clear that the
accused was not ""present"" in any effective sense.

 

60.                     The
second issue is more difficult than the first and depends upon the meaning of
the expression, the ""whole of the trial"", in s. 577 . The word
""trial"" was considered by this Court in Basarabas and Spek v. The
Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 730. In that case, the Court was asked to determine
when a jury trial commences for the purposes of s. 573  of the Criminal Code ,
which provides for the discharge of a juror by the trial judge ""in the
course of a trial"". The trial judge in the case discharged a juror after
the jury had been empanelled and sworn, and pleas of not guilty entered, but
before the accused had been put in the jury's charge and before the Crown was
called upon to present its case. The Court, per Dickson J. (as he
then was) held, at pp. 741‑42, that for the purposes of s. 573  the trial
commences when the accused has been placed in charge of the jury. However
Dickson J. had earlier noted that the meaning of the word trial varies with the
language of the section in question and with the circumstances. He stated, at
p. 740, that:

 

                   First, the time of commencement of a
jury trial will vary according to the circumstances and the language of the
section of the Criminal Code  being applied. Thus, the word
""trial"" in s. 577(1)  which assures the accused the right to be
present ""during the whole of his trial"" will be liberally construed
to afford the accused the right to be present during the selection of the jury.
In like manner, the word ""trial"" in s. 566  which denies the
prosecutor the right to direct a juror to stand by on the trial of an
indictment for the publication of a defamatory libel will be interpreted to embrace
the proceedings preceding the empanelling of the jury. In other sections
""trial"" may have a different connotation depending upon the section
of the Code being applied.

 

The
meaning of the expression ""the whole of the trial"" will therefore
depend upon the language of s. 577 , the principles underlying the section and
the circumstances of the case. A circumstance of particular importance in this
case is the nature of the communications or proceedings from which the accused
was excluded.

 

61.                     The
meaning of ""trial"" in s. 577  of the Criminal Code  and the
principles underlying the section were considered by the Ontario Court of
Appeal in R. v. Hertrich, (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.)
Speaking for a unanimous court, Martin J.A. outlined the general approach to s.
577 , at p. 527:

 

                   Generally speaking, the trial of an
accused does not commence until after plea: see Giroux v. The King
(1917), 29 C.C.C. 258 at p. 268. However, ""trial"" for the purpose of
the principle that an accused is entitled to be present at his trial clearly
includes proceedings which are part of the normal trial process for determining
the guilt or innocence of the accused such as arraignment and plea, the
empanelling of the jury, the reception of evidence (including voir dire
proceedings with respect to the admissibility of evidence), rulings on
evidence, arguments of counsel, addresses of counsel to the jury, the judge's
charge, including requests by the jury for further instructions, the reception
of the verdict and the imposition of sentence if the accused is found guilty.

 

Later,
at p. 537, he added:

 

...the characterization of a proceeding as a part of the
trial in relation to the accused's right to be present at the proceeding would
seem to depend upon whether his exclusion from the proceeding violates his
right to be present so that at all times he may have direct knowledge of
anything that transpires in the course of his trial which could involve his
vital interests. [Emphasis added.]

 

The
general approach developed by the Court of Appeal was expressly adopted by this
Court in Vézina and Côté v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2, at p. 10, in a
case where the trial judge interviewed jurors in his chambers in the absence of
the accused or counsel, but after they had been sworn and had heard evidence.

 

62.                     While
anything that occurs in the course of the courtroom proceedings which could
involve the accused's vital interests should constitute part of the trial, it
is clear that not every step in the long process leading to the ultimate
verdict will be part of the trial for the purposes of s. 577 . As Martin J.A.
stated in Hertrich, supra, at p. 529:

 

                   Manifestly, however, not everything
that occurs during a trial is a part of the trial. Zuber J.A., speaking for
this court, in R. v. Grimba, supra, said at p. 574 C.C.C., p. 744
D.L.R., p. 548 O.R.:

 

The Crown points out, however, that improper exclusion
from the court‑room by itself does not contravene s. 577 . Something must
transpire in the court‑room which can be said to be a part of the trial.
Obviously, if following the exclusion of the appellant for his misconduct, the
Court had recessed for a time and then resumed in his presence, the appellant
could not claim that he was not present during his trial. In Meunier v. The
Queen (1965), 48 C.R. 14, [1966] Que. Q.B. 94n, Casey J. of the
Quebec Court of Appeal put the question as follows at p. 17:

 

                   ""Our problem is whether the
Court proceeded, whether it did anything of a nature to advance the case, in
the absence of the appellant. If it did not appellant's argument must be
rejected; if it did the conviction must be quashed.""

 

                   Subsequent cases have repeated this
question and have used the phrase ""advance the case"": Collin v.
The Queen (1968), 5 C.R.N.S. 201, [1968] Que. Q.B. 340n. I cannot
think that this phrase was intended to be definitive. It is one way of putting
the essential question of whether or not the trial continued and it is of
little consequence whether the continuance embraced the adduction of evidence,
the presentation of argument, rulings on evidentiary points, the address to the
jury, etc.

 

                   I accept the remarks of Zuber J.A.
and would add that during the course of the trial things may occur that,
although in one sense part of the trial, cannot reasonably be considered to be
a part of the trial for the purpose of the present principle, because they
cannot reasonably be said to have a bearing on the substantive conduct of the
trial, or the issue of guilt or innocence.

 

Later,
at p. 539, he added:

 

                   Obviously, as previously indicated,
not every communication between the judge and the jury or a juror that may
occur during the trial is a part of the trial. For example, the mere
communication by the judge to the jury in the absence of the accused of an administrative
decision that he has made, that if the jury were unable to reach a verdict,
they would go to a hotel that night and resume deliberations the next day, is
not a violation of s. 577 : see R. v. Hamilton (1980), 58 C.C.C. (2d)
467. And in the present case, for example, the communication by the deputy
sheriff to the judge of the information with respect to the anonymous telephone
call, and the preliminary in‑chambers conference with counsel to
determine the necessity for an inquiry and the form that it should take clearly
did not constitute part of the trial.

 

Applying
these principles, the issue before us is whether the judge's examination of
members of the jury panel for partiality, prior to selection of the jury to try
the case, constituted part of the trial, in that it involved the accused's
vital interests and could reasonably be said to have a bearing on the
substantive conduct of the trial and the issue of guilt or innocence.

 

63.                     The
courts have consistently held that after the jury has been empanelled an
examination of a juror for partiality by the trial judge in the absence of the
accused violates the accused's rights under s. 577  of the Criminal Code .
In R. v. Côté and Vézina, [1982] C.A. 419, 3 C.C.C. (3d) 155 (hereinafter
cited to C.C.C.), the trial judge received notes from two of the jurors
alleging that two of the other jurors were being or had been influenced by one
of the accused. The trial judge informed the accused and their counsel of these
communications and attempted to obtain their consent to interview privately the
two jurors who had sent the notes. After failing to obtain their consent, he
decided to interview the two jurors before a court reporter but in the absence
of the accused and counsel. Following the interviews, the trial judge was
satisfied that there was no foundation for the allegations and informed counsel
that ""there is no valid reason that the jury cannot, will not, be able to
or should not continue its deliberations in order to arrive at their
verdict"". The trial proceeded and the accused were convicted.

 

64.                     On
appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal (Owen and Malouf JJ.A.) found that
the interviews violated the accused's rights under s. 577  and ordered a new
trial. Owen J.A. stated in his reasons, at p. 160, that:

 

                   The right to a trial by an impartial
jury is a fundamental one. The accused has the right to be present when the
jury is empanelled and the impartiality of prospective jurors is considered. In
virtue of the same principle, the accused has the right to be present when an
inquiry is conducted to determine whether the impartiality of the jurors has
been affected after they have been sworn in and before the verdict has been
rendered.

 

Malouf
J.A. in separate reasons stated, at p. 188, that:

 

                   The authorities cited in the opinion
of my colleague, Mr. Justice Owen, clearly show that such a proceeding is part
of the trial. The jurors questioned are the very same persons who, together
with the remaining members of the panel, will be called upon to decide the
guilt or innocence of each accused. This is an issue vital to each accused.
Surely, any matter which could influence the members of the jury in the verdict
that they are called upon to render is part of the trial. It is so in this
case.

 

L'Heureux‑Dubé
J.A., in dissent, was of the view that the interviews were a preliminary
investigation for determining the impartiality of the jurors and therefore did
not violate s. 577 .

 

65.                     The
judgment of the Court of Appeal was upheld on appeal to this Court. Lamer J.,
speaking for a unanimous court, stated, at p. 13:

 

                   In this case it is abundantly clear
from the written messages that the partiality of jurors was in issue. L'Heureux‑Dubé
J.A. concluded that this is not so relying in part on what was eventually
reported in the transcripts of the exchange between the judge and the jurors in
chambers. This analysis, in my respectful view, misses the point. For it is
confusing the determination of whether partiality was in issue with the further
determination of the issue of partiality. Finding the jurors impartial does not
mean that their impartiality was not in issue. It merely means that the issue
was determined in favour of their impartiality. The events of this case well
illustrate the need for the issue of partiality to be determined in the
presence of the accused, specifically when one considers that counsel for the
accused argued their motion for a mistrial without knowing what the jurors had
to say as regards the partiality of others, not knowing whether the jurors had
conveyed to their fellow jurors including the suspects, their suspicions, and
not even knowing whether the judge had met with those jurors. I would therefore
dismiss the Crown's appeal.

 

The
accused's presence when jurors are interviewed for partiality was also
considered in Hertrich, supra. The relevant facts in Hertrich
are conveniently set out in the head‑note to 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510, in these
terms, at p. 511:

 

                   The three accused and two others were
tried on a charge of the first degree murder and following a lengthy trial the
three accused were convicted. During the trial it was brought to the trial
judge's attention that two anonymous telephone calls had been received at the
home of one of the jurors and that during one of the calls it was stated that
the accused Sk had killed twice before. This juror had then told another juror
of the anonymous telephone call. The trial judge brought defence counsel into
his chambers and informed him of the information he had received concerning the
jurors. Over objection of some of the counsel the trial judge then conducted an
inquiry in his chambers in the presence of counsel but in the absence of the
accused. Both jurors were examined under oath and indicated that they felt they
could still be true to their oath as jurors. The trial judge then brought the
two jurors into open court and indicated that what had been said in the
anonymous telephone call was not true and he then refused an application by
defence counsel for a mistrial. Proceedings were then resumed with the full
jury where it was explained that one of the jurors had received an anonymous
telephone call, had discussed it with another juror but that there was no
suggestion that the call came from anyone associated with the trial and that
the trial judge was satisfied that the trial could continue. The trial
thereafter resumed.

 

On
appeal, Martin J.A., speaking for the court, held, at p. 539, that:

 

                   Each of the opposing views on this
question can justly lay claim to both pragmatic and intellectual support.
However, in my opinion, after a great deal of careful consideration, the right
of the accused to have direct knowledge of anything that transpires in the
course of his trial which could involve his vital interests tips the scales in
favour of the view that the in‑chambers examination of the jurors was
part of the trial.

 

                   I have, therefore, concluded that the
examination of the jurors on April 6th was a part of the trial for the purpose
of the rule here under consideration. The proceeding involved the vital issue
whether the jurors in question were affected by the anonymous telephone calls
and whether the appellants could receive a fair trial if those jurors continued
to serve on the jury. The appellants were entitled to be present to hear from
the jurors' own lips whether they were affected by those telephone calls and
whether the calls prevented them from continuing to discharge their duties as
jurors.

 

A
similar view was expressed in R. v. Fenton (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 109
(B.C.C.A.) and Frisco v. The Queen, [1971] C.A. 176, 14 C.R.N.S. 194.

 

66.                     It
is therefore clear that the accused's rights, under s. 577  of the Criminal
Code , will be violated if the trial judge examines a juror for partiality
in the absence of the accused after the jury has been empanelled. But, the
situation is profoundly different if the trial judge examines jurors for
partiality prior to the jury selection process under the Code. To
appreciate the significance of this difference, it is useful to outline the
procedures for summoning and selecting juries. There are two distinct steps
involved in providing a jury to try an individual case. The first step involves
assembling the jury panel from which individual juries are to be selected.
According to s. 554 of the Code, this step is governed by provincial
law, which in this case is the Nova Scotia Juries Act, S.N.S. 1969, c.
12, as amended. The second step is governed by ss. 558 to 571 of the Code
and involves the selection from the jury panel of a jury to try a particular
case.

 

67.                     Considering
the initial step in more detail, the Juries Act sets out the criteria
for qualification for and exemption from jury service. It further details the
procedure for assembling jury panels for each jury district in the province.
Under the Act, the Attorney General appoints a jury committee for each jury
district. The proceedings of the committee are to be conducted in secrecy. Each
year, the jury committee randomly selects the names of prospective jurors from
voters lists or, if necessary, from tax rolls and other lists of qualified
persons. In selecting the names of persons, the jury committee reviews each
name to determine whether the person is both qualified to serve and not
exempted from service as a juror. When the list is completed it is certified by
the committee and presented to a judge, who must satisfy himself on information
given by the jury officer that the jurors have been properly selected and the
list properly prepared. If the list is approved by the judge, it becomes the
jury list for the district until a new one is prepared. Whenever a jury is
required, the judge who is to preside at the session of the court or the chief
justice selects at random from the list the number of jurors he thinks
necessary to form a jury panel. The names of the jurors selected for the panel
are made public four to eight days before the stated date for the appearance of
the jury by posting the names in the office of the Prothonotary of the Supreme
Court of the jury district.

 

68.                     It
can be seen at once that this process of drawing up a jury list and assembling
a jury panel for a particular session is designed to create a pool of
disinterested jurors. It is a process in which an individual accused plays no
part and has no right to intervene except ""on the ground of partiality,
fraud or wilful misconduct on the part of the sheriff or his deputies by whom
the panel was returned"" (s. 558 of the Code). The accused has no
interest in the process, save the interest of any citizen in the due
administration of the law.

 

69.                     The
second step in the procedure involves the selection of the jury from the jury
panel. As set out in the Code, the name of each juror on the panel is
written on a card which is placed in a box by the clerk of the court. The clerk
then draws at random one card at a time from the box and calls out the name of
the juror on the card. As each juror is called, counsel for the accused or the
Crown may challenge the juror for cause on a number of specific grounds
enumerated in s. 567, including the ground that ""a juror is not
indifferent between the Queen and the accused"". In addition, counsel for
the accused and the Crown may challenge a fixed number of jurors without cause.
This procedure continues until twelve jurors have been selected. During this
procedure, the accused has a right to be present and to participate in the
process to ensure that the jurors selected are impartial and that his vital
interests are protected.

 

70.                     At
any stage during the first step in assembling the jury panel a judge ""may
grant to any person exemption from service as a juror at the whole or part of
that session upon application by or on behalf of that person"", (s. 4(2) of
the Juries Act). This section (s. 4(2) of the Juries Act) gives
statutory recognition in provincial law to a practice which has been approved
for application in the criminal law by very high authority. In the case of R.
v. Hubbert (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 279, the Ontario Court of Appeal (Gale
C.J.O., Jessup, Arnup, Dubin and Martin JJ.A.) in a per curiam judgment
dealt with questions relating to challenges for cause, empanelling of jurors,
and the position of the trial judge in assuring impartiality of jurors. The
court expressed the view that a fundamental assumption of the jury process, as
carried out in Canadian criminal law, was that jurors would observe and follow
the direction of the trial judge in reaching their verdict and base their
judgment upon the evidence before them and not upon preconceptions on matters
of which they had received knowledge before the trial. At trial, counsel for
the accused had asked that the trial judge address the jury panel and direct
that if any potential juror had any connection with the accused he should
declare himself prior to being sworn. The trial judge refused. The Court of
Appeal, in considering the whole question of challenges for cause under the Criminal
Code  and the question of partiality of jurors, quoted with approval the apt
words of Seaton J.A. in R. v. Makow (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 513, at p.
519, ""an accused is entitled to an indifferent jury not a favourable
one"". Reference was made as well to the English practice direction
(jurors) issued by Lord Widgery C.J. on January 12, [1973] l All E.R. 240, in
these terms:

 

I have to make a practice direction which is made after
consultation with the judges of the Queen's Bench and Family Divisions. A jury
consists of 12 individuals chosen at random from the appropriate panel. A juror
should be excused if he is personally concerned in the facts of the particular
case, or closely connected with a party to the proceedings or with a
prospective witness. He may also be excused at the discretion of the judge on
grounds of personal hardship or conscientious objection to jury service. It is
contrary to established practice for jurors to be excused on more general
grounds such as race, religion, or political beliefs or occupation.

 

On the
general question of partiality in jurors and the position of a trial judge in
these matters, the court said, at pp. 292‑93:

 

                   Turning to the practical
consideration of the methods by which the process should be carried out
[insuring impartiality of jurors] we deal first with the kind of obvious
partiality dealt with in the English practice direction. Some trial Judges make
a practice of saying to the jury panel, before the selection process begins,
something of this nature:

 

If there is anyone on this panel who is closely
connected with a party to this case or with a witness who is to testify, will
you please stand?

 

(Rarely does anyone respond.) If someone does stand, the
trial Judge asks him to come forward (usually to the jury‑box), and
inquires further as to that person's connection with the case. To take obvious
examples, if the juror is the uncle of the accused, or the wife of a witness,
or the brother of the investigating police officer, he ought not to serve.

 

                   In our view, the trial Judge on his
own should excuse that prospective juror from the case, without more ado. The Criminal
Code  makes no express provision for it, but it does not expressly or
impliedly forbid it either, and in our view it is in the power of the trial
Judge as part of his function of ensuring a fair trial. We think the practice
of excusing jurors of obvious partiality is a desirable one in all cases.

 

And, at
pp. 296‑97, he said:

 

                   Finally, there is Mr. Hamilton's
""afterthought"" at the trial, that the trial Judge should inquire
generally of the panel whether any of them had ""any connection with the
accused"". From our earlier observations as to the appropriate procedure,
it follows that in our view it would have been desirable for the trial Judge to
have acceded to this request, and indeed to have ""screened"" the panel
for what we have called obvious cases of partiality. There is not the slightest
suggestion that in fact any juror chosen had any connection whatever with the
accused, and we decline to hold that this ruling vitiated the trial. If it were
otherwise, most of the criminal trials heretofore held in Ontario have been
likewise vitiated.

 

71.                     In
my view, the course taken by the trial judge in the case at bar was quite
proper and well within the scope of the propositions that emerge from Hubbert,
which have been set out above. The only question which could be raised to
distinguish what occurred in the case at bar is that the trial judge conducted
his inquiry in the absence of the accused and his counsel. From the authorities
earlier cited, the question is whether the judge's inquiry of panel members as
to partiality could affect the vital interests of the accused, touching on the
question of guilt or innocence. It is evident from the foregoing review of the Juries
Act that the questioning of the jurors in the courtroom was a part of the
first step of the jury process, that is, the constitution of the jury panel,
and comes within the provisions of the Juries Act. In interviewing the
jurors as he did, the trial judge was exercising powers in relation to the
selection of the panel in accordance with what we were told is normal procedure
and it is also evident that he was exercising a power known and approved in
proceedings under the Criminal Code . This is a step in which the
appellant has no part and, as has been said, no legal right to intervene. As
long as the procedure adopted to constitute the jury panel conforms with the
Act and produces a divers and disinterested group, no vital interest of the
accused is affected. As said by Seaton J.A., supra, an accused person is
entitled at law to have an indifferent rather than a favourable jury. The
process by which the Juries Act provides for the creation of the jury
panel, based on a random choice, from among those members of the community who
are eligible for jury service is designed to achieve that objective. That
process involved a judicial examination of the jury lists and a judicial
discretion to excuse or exempt jurors. Following completion of this process,
the accused is entitled to challenge jurors on a variety of grounds, including
partiality, as provided in the Criminal Code . That is what occurred
here. Each juror who served on the jury was challenged for cause under the Criminal
Code  in the presence of the accused and each one survived the challenge.
The appellant thus obtained‑‑as nearly as the law can provide‑‑that
to which he is entitled, an impartial jury, and participated in those
procedures which affected his vital interests. I would reject this ground of
appeal.

 

Is the
Nova Scotia Liberal Association a Person?

 

72.                     Is
the Nova Scotia Liberal Association a ""person"" within the meaning of
s. 110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code ? Section 110(1)(d) of
the Code upon which the indictment in part is based makes it an offence
to offer or agree to accept for himself or another person a reward, advantage
or benefit of any kind as consideration for the exercise of influence. It was
argued that the main recipient of any alleged benefits was the Nova Scotia
Liberal Association, and that the Association is not a ""person""
within the meaning of s. 110(1)(d) of the Code. I am in agreement
with the Court of Appeal that for the purposes of s. 110(1)(d) of the Code
the Nova Scotia Liberal Association is a person. I accept the reasoning of the
Court of Appeal on this point. In my view, the word ""person"" in s.
110(1)(d) of the Code must be read in the light of s. 2  of the Criminal
Code , which provides, in part:

 

                   2. ...

 

""every one"", ""person"",
""owner"", and similar expressions include Her Majesty and public
bodies, bodies corporate, societies, companies and inhabitants of counties, parishes,
municipalities or other districts in relation to the acts and things that they
are capable of doing and owning respectively;

 

The Nova
Scotia Liberal Association clearly falls within the meaning of the word
""society"" in s. 2 . There was evidence that the Nova Scotia Liberal
Association was an active organization, hiring staff, renting premises,
receiving and disbursing funds and carrying on general political activities. To
hold that the Association was not a ""person"" and, therefore, not within
the purview of s. 110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , would lead to
an absurd result and frustrate the obvious purpose of the enactment. I would
reject this ground of appeal.

 

Conspirator's
Exception to the Hearsay Rule

 

73.                     The
appellant concedes that the charge of the trial judge on the question of the
application of the conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule was generally in
accordance with the decision of this Court in R. v. Carter, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 938. This was also the view of the Court of Appeal which conveniently
summarized in three steps, at p. 486, the approach propounded in Carter:

 

 

 

1. The trier of fact must first be satisfied beyond
                                   reasonable doubt that the alleged conspiracy
in  fact existed.

 

2. If the alleged conspiracy is found to exist then
                                   the trier of fact must review all the
evidence       that is directly admissible against the accused                            and
decide on a balance of probabilities whether        or not he is a member of
the conspiracy.

 

3. If the trier of fact concludes on a balance of                                       probabilities
that the accused is a member of     the conspiracy then he or they must go on
and                         decide whether the Crown has established such        membership
beyond reasonable doubt. In this last       step, only the trier of fact can
apply the  hearsay exception and consider evidence of acts                             and
declarations of co‑conspirators done in        furtherance of the object
of the conspiracy as              evidence against the accused on the issue of
his        guilt.

 

It was
argued for the appellant that while the indictment referred to unnamed
conspirators, the Crown's case was that the only members of the conspiracy were
the appellant and his two co‑accused. Accordingly, in determining beyond
a reasonable doubt on all the evidence whether a conspiracy had existed at the
first stage of their deliberations, the jury must necessarily have determined
on all the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt that either MacFadden or the
appellant, or both, were members of the conspiracy. It was submitted that this
instruction undermined the rationale of the conspirator's exception to the
hearsay rule, in that the jury of necessity determined the guilt of one or both
of the accused ab initio on all the evidence tendered at the trial.

 

74.                     This
argument, in my view, is based upon a misunderstanding and misconstruction of
this Court's decision in Carter. It rests upon the proposition that in
taking the first step in the Carter case the jury would of necessity
have to determine beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of at least two
persons involved in the conspiracy. This, in my view, does not follow. It may
often be true, that in determining beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a
conspiracy one may also determine the identity of some of the members. On some
occasions and in respect of some conspirators it may not be necessary to have
resort to the hearsay exception, but this is not always so. It is entirely
possible, and not uncommon, to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on all
the evidence that a conspiracy for the purposes alleged in the indictment
existed while still being uncertain as to the identity of all the conspirators.
Once this is understood it becomes evident that there is no substance to the
appellant's argument. On this first step what is considered is the existence of
the conspiracy, not individual membership. At this point the hearsay exception
is inapplicable. This is in accordance with the view expressed by Martin J.A.
in R. v. Baron and Wertman (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 525, in reference to
the conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule, where he said, at p. 544:

 

It only comes into play, however, where there is
evidence fit to be considered by the jury that the conspiracy alleged between A
and B exists. It is clear that where the fact in issue to be proved is whether
a conspiracy exists between A and B, A's acts, or declarations implicating B
cannot be used to prove that B was a party to the conspiracy, in the absence of
some other evidence admissible against B to bring him within the conspiracy:
see Savard and Lizotte v. The King (1945), 85 C.C.C. 254 at p. 262,
[1946] 3 D.L.R. 468, [1946] S.C.R. 20 at p. 29.

 

Where,
at this stage, the ""evidence fit to go to a jury"" does not satisfy
the trier of fact according to the criminal standard of proof that the
conspiracy existed, it need go no further for no conspiracy has been shown. The
remaining steps, as outlined in Carter, follow only where the trier of
fact has reached its first determination‑‑that the conspiracy
exists.

 

75.                     Applying
the Carter approach to the case at bar, it must be observed that there
were three conspirators named and that the evidence directly admissible against
each differed in some particulars, particularly in the case of the appellant
who had little if any direct contact with the persons doing business with the
Government while the other two did. There was evidence upon which the jury
could conclude that a conspiracy did exist, and much of the evidence as it
would apply to each individual charged would be hearsay. The hearsay exception
was therefore available to the Crown, if the jury on a consideration of the
evidence directly admissible against each individual had reached, in respect of
each of the accused, a conclusion as to membership in the conspiracy. The jury
was properly instructed as to their duties in this respect and it is evident
that they concluded on both issues, conspiracy and membership, against the
appellant.

 

76.                     In
argument it was suggested that the Carter approach could not apply to an
allegation of a conspiracy between two people. Indeed, this seemed to be at the
root of the argument advanced on this issue. It was formerly considered, where
there were two conspirators only (and no others), that both must be convicted
or both acquitted. This was to avoid an inconsistency in verdicts, to avoid a
finding that A was guilty of conspiring with B but that, on the same occasion,
B was not guilty of conspiring with A. This problem would not, of course, arise
at bar where three accused conspirators were involved but, in any event, in the
present state of our law it could not prevail. The former view has been
authoritatively rejected in the judgment of the majority of this Court in Guimond
v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 960. It is not necessary for me to discuss in
any detail the majority judgment of Ritchie J. in that case in which he
reviewed and distinguished the earlier authorities and made special reference
to Director of Public Prosecutions v. Shannon, [1975] A.C. 717. He said,
at p. 977 [S.C.R.]:

 

                   I think it can be taken, that where
only two persons are charged with conspiracy and they are separately tried
whether or not they are separately indicted, the conviction of one is not
necessarily invalidated by the acquittal of the other.

 

In my
view, these words are equally applicable to a case where the two conspirators
were jointly charged and jointly tried.

 

77.                     In
my view, there is no inconsistency in this position. The apparently
inconsistent verdict does not result from the impossible conclusion that A
conspired with B to commit a given crime and that B did not conspire with A on
the same occasion to commit the same crime, but rather from the fact that there
was evidence admissible against A to establish his guilt but no sufficient
evidence admissible against B to prove his participation. The fact that upon
arrest Mr. A says to the police ""Yes, B and I agreed to murder X""
will not be admissible against B does not deprive it of its evidentiary force
against A.

 

78.                     I
would reject this ground of appeal.

 

Use of
Character Evidence

 

79.                     The
defence of the appellant at trial was that his good name and reputation refuted
the charges. There was a good deal of evidence of the appellant's good
character and reputation before the jury. Great stress was placed upon it by
the defence and there can be no doubt that it was forcefully brought before the
jury. In dealing with this point in his directions to the jury, the trial judge
said:

 

In the case of Senator Barrow, you may take the
following evidence into account at the second stage of your deliberations, and
you will take it into account against the background of the general matters
that I covered at the beginning of my review‑‑what I have described
as background evidence, in other words, of Senator Barrow's association with
Mr. MacFadden and Mr. Simpson in connection with the financial and other
affairs of the Liberal party, and, in the same category, evidence of his
association with party figures, including the fact that he was regarded as a
senior statesman and adviser whose opinion was respected by the Premier and
others. In that same category, you must also take into account the
uncontradicted evidence of many witnesses who testified as to the character and
reputation of Senator Barrow as a man of honesty and integrity and as to his
many unpaid public and charitable endeavours. All of that is background.

 

In
referring to the theory of defence, he also stated:

 

There are differences in detail in the submissions that
were made on behalf of Senator Barrow and those made on behalf of Mr.
MacFadden. The position taken on behalf of Senator Barrow was that his
character and reputation deny the charge against him, that the whole case for
the Crown is an attempt to implicate Senator Barrow in conduct on the part of
Mr. Simpson in which he was not involved, that being indicated by the fact that
none of the liquor representatives knew Senator Barrow. It's argued on his behalf
that no significance can be attached to the finding of some Liquor Commission
documents in his possession since he was not a collector. As to the handling of
funds, Senator Barrow was merely an administrator.

 

80.                     Counsel
for the appellant, in addressing the issue in this Court, acknowledged that in
reviewing the evidence for the jury the trial judge related instances where
witnesses testified to the appellant's good reputation for integrity and
honesty. It was argued, however, that evidence of good character is relevant to
show that the accused was not likely to commit the crime charged (R. v. Khan
(1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 32, at p. 42) and that this had not been made clear to
the jury. It was also argued that the trial judge did not expressly instruct
the jury, as a matter of law, on the use to which they could put such evidence.
This was said to be a non‑direction, particularly because of the
importance of the character evidence to the appellant's case. In dealing with
this issue, the Court of Appeal said, at p. 16:

 

                   Throughout the trial the evidence of
the appellant's good character was emphasized. It was referred to by
appellant's counsel in his address and the trial judge referred to it several
times during his address. The appellant did not testify and accordingly his
credibility as a witness was not in issue. While not directly stated by the
trial judge we are satisfied that the jury must have been aware that they could
consider the evidence as relevant to show that the appellant was not likely to
have committed the crime with which he was charged. Having regard to the charge
as a whole we are unable to say that any miscarriage of justice occurred as a
result of what at best was a technical non‑direction.

 

81.                     It
is my view, from a perusal of the charge to the jury and of several extracts
from the evidence, that the Court of Appeal's comments on this question are
apt. There can be no doubt that evidence of the good reputation and character
of the appellant was clearly put before the jury. It was emphasized and given
fair treatment by the trial judge. I am in full accord on this point with the
Court of Appeal. I would therefore reject this ground and for the reasons given
above, I would dismiss the appeal.

whereby a person can regain possession of things allegedly related to the
commission of a narcotics offence and seized under s. 10 of the Act. The
original applicant for restoration, Ernest Gombosh, was searched on two
occasions in October, 1979. Several quantities of drugs, drug paraphenalia and
cash were seized in the course of those searches and Mr. Gombosh was
subsequently charged with offences under the Narcotic Control Act. Mr.
Gombosh applied, in December 1979, for restoration of the monies seized. The
hearing was adjourned and Mr. Gombosh died before being prosecuted and before
the restoration hearing process was completed. Letters of administration were
granted to the current applicant‑‑a person innocent of any wrong‑doing‑‑who
pursued the restoration of the seized monies in his capacity as administrator.
A judge of the Provincial Court ordered restoration but this order was quashed
in the Supreme Court of Ontario and the matter remitted to Provincial Court.
The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the decision to quash.








 

                   The two‑part test for restoration in s. 10(6)(a)
required that the magistrate be satisfied that (1) the applicant is
""entitled to possession of the thing seized"", and (2) the thing
seized is not required as evidence. The three crucial questions to this appeal,
then, were: what was meant by s. 10(6)(a) entitlement, on whom was the
burden of proof or disproof, and what was the standard of proof? 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   In order to satisfy a magistrate at a restoration
hearing on the question of entitlement to possession, a claimant must show on
the balance of probabilities that he was in possession of the property at the
time of seizure. To place the onus on the claimant in this way does not offend
established rules of procedure as the claim of entitlement at this stage is
simply the assertion of a civil right. In addition, such evidence is readily
obtainable by most claimants. The generous standing in s. 10(5) leaves it open
to ""any"" other person to rebut the claim to possession.

 

                   While entitlement within the meaning of s. 10(6)(a)
can reasonably be assumed to mean ""lawful entitlement"", the rule of
public policy that a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrong
doing should only operate where there is turpitude. Where that turpitude is a
criminal wrong, criminality must be demonstrated in accordance with normal
procedures. Section 10(8), which directs forfeiture of things seized which were
""used in any manner"" in connection with a narcotics offence of which
a person has been convicted, codifies the ex turpi causa non oritur actio
rule in the context of narcotics convictions.

 

                   The tainted connection leading to forfeiture under
s. 10(8) must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence
as well as the nature of the proceedings under s. 10 make it inappropriate to
transform a restoration hearing into a trial in which the Crown need only meet
the civil standard of proof in order to establish guilt or taint. The
culpability of the owner of the seized property must have been proven at
antecedent criminal proceedings under the Narcotic Control Act. In the
absence of a specific finding at trial of the requisite ""tainted
connection"", the Crown can prove taint on the reasonable doubt standard at
the restoration hearing. Where there was no antecedent conviction and no basis
for laying a narcotics related charge, proceedings should be initiated under s.
312(1)  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Although s. 10(8) might imply that the ex turpi
rule is excluded by the expressio unius est exclusio alterius
rule from operation under s. 10(6)(a), where the things are connected to
a conviction for a non‑narcotics offence, such an interpretation would
multiply proceedings and offend public perception of the justice system. The expressio
unius rule, therefore, should not prevent a reading of s. 10(6)(a)
entitlement to mean ""lawful entitlement"" in this very limited
context. 

 

                   Where the rule of public policy legitimately
applies, the status of an applicant as the innocent representative of a
convicted but deceased owner would not entitle the applicant to restoration.
However, where no conviction has been entered and where the evidentiary use of
the things has either expired or is non‑existent the magistrate may not
deny restoration to the person entitled to possession.

1.                Wilson
J.‑‑This case raises the issue of the proper interpretation
of s. 10 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1. Section
10 allows an officer to seize things which he or she suspects are related to
the commission of a narcotics offence. However, the seizure provisions are not
directly at issue in this appeal. Rather, the focus of the case is on the
procedure called a restoration hearing by means of which a person can regain
possession of the things seized. Section 10(6) sets out a two‑part test
governing restoration. The first part requires the magistrate to be satisfied
that the applicant is ""entitled to possession of the thing seized"".
The second part requires him to be satisfied that the thing seized is not
required as evidence. It is the first part of the test and the nature of the
burden it imposes which must be resolved in order to settle the present appeal.
The meaning of the phrase ""entitled to possession"" must be
ascertained in the context of the peculiar facts of this case, namely that the appellant
is the innocent representative of the allegedly non‑innocent person from
whom the things were seized. The original claimant died before being prosecuted
and before the restoration hearing process was completed.

 

1. The Facts

 

2.                The original applicant for restoration,
Ernest Gombosh, was searched on two occasions in October of 1979. Several
quantities of drugs, drug paraphenalia and cash were seized in the course of
those searches and Mr. Gombosh was subsequently charged with offences under the
Narcotic Control Act. On December 17, 1979 Mr. Gombosh applied for
restoration of the monies seized. The hearing was adjourned. However, on
February 28, 1980 Mr. Gombosh died before being prosecuted and before the
restoration hearing process was completed. Letters of administration were
granted to the current appellant, Eric Fleming. He pursued restoration of the
seized monies in his capacity as administrator of Mr. Gombosh's estate.

 

2. The Legislative Scheme

 

3.                Mr. Gombosh and subsequently the
appellant proceeded under ss. 10(5) and (6) of the Narcotic Control Act.
However, s. 10 deals not only with restoration but also with seizure,
possession by the Minister of things seized, and forfeiture. Thus the
restoration hearing is only one aspect of the larger process. I have set out
the relevant subsections below as they appeared at the time of these
proceedings:

 

                   10. (1) A peace officer may, at any time,

 

(a) without a
warrant enter and search any place other than a dwelling‑house, and under
the authority of a writ of assistance or a warrant issued under this section,
enter and search any dwelling‑house in which he reasonably believes there
is a narcotic by means of or in respect of which an offence under this Act has
been committed;

 

(b) search any
person found in such place; and

 

(c) seize and take
away any narcotic found in such place, any thing in such place in which he
reasonably suspects a narcotic is contained or concealed, or any other thing by
means of or in respect of which he reasonably believes an offence under this
Act has been committed or that may be evidence of the commission of such
an offence.

 

                                                                    ...


 

                   (5)
Where a narcotic or other thing has been seized under subsection (1), any
person may, within two months from the date of such seizure, upon prior
notification having been given to the Crown in the manner prescribed by the
regulations, apply to a magistrate within whose territorial jurisdiction the
seizure was made for an order of restoration under subsection (6).

 

                   (6)
Subject to subsections (8) and (9), where upon the hearing of an application
made under subsection (5) the magistrate is satisfied

 

(a) that the
applicant is entitled to possession of the narcotic or other thing seized, and

 

(b) that the thing
so seized is not or will not be required as evidence in any proceedings in
respect of an offence under this Act,

 

he shall order that the
thing so seized be restored forthwith to the applicant, and where the
magistrate is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to possession of the
thing so seized but is not satisfied as to the matters mentioned in paragraph (b),
he shall order that the thing so seized be restored to the applicant

 

(c) upon the
expiration of four months from the date of the seizure, if no proceedings in
respect of an offence under this Act have been commenced before that time, or

 

(d) upon the final
conclusion of any such proceedings, in any other case.

 

                   (7)
Where no application has been made for the return of any narcotic or other
thing seized under subsection (1) within two months from the date of such
seizure, or an application therefor has been made but upon the hearing thereof
no order of restoration is made, the thing so seized shall be delivered to the
Minister who may make such disposition thereof as he thinks fit.

 

                   (8)
Where a person has been convicted of an offence under section 3, 4 or 5, any
narcotic seized under subsection (1), by means of or in respect of which the
offence was committed, any money so seized that was used for the purchase of
that narcotic and any hypodermic needle, syringe, capping machine or other
apparatus so seized that was used in any manner in connection with the offence
is forfeited to Her Majesty and shall be disposed of as the Minister directs.

 

                   (9)
Where a person has been convicted of an offence under section 4 or 5, the court
may, upon application by counsel for the Crown, order that any conveyance
seized under subsection (1) that has been proved to have been used in any
manner in connection with the offence be forfeited, and upon such order being
made the conveyance is forfeited to Her Majesty and, except as provided in
section 11, shall upon the expiration of thirty days from the date of such
forfeiture be disposed of as the Minister directs. 

 

4.                The broad delineation of the seizure
power in s. 10(1) is of particular importance for the analysis of the legal
issues in this appeal. That section allows an officer without a warrant to
enter and search certain premises and seize things found therein which he
reasonably believes are related to a narcotics offence or may be
evidence of such an offence. Restoration under s. 10(6) is contingent on the
presiding magistrate's being satisfied that the appellant is ""entitled to
possession"" of the thing seized and that it is not required as
evidence. Conversely, where as in the present case there is no evidentiary use
for the property and no conviction has been entered, the Minister's custody
under s. 10(7) of ""things seized"" is legitimate only where
entitlement has not been demonstrated to the presiding magistrate's
satisfaction. Thus, the crucial questions to be answered are what is meant by
entitlement, who has the burden of its proof or disproof, and what is the
standard of proof? Finally, it should be noted that ""disentitlement""
or forfeiture is mandated where the narrow conditions of s. 10(8) are met, i.e.
where seized monies were used for the purchase of a narcotic in respect of
which a person has been convicted of a narcotics offence.

 

3. The Courts Below

 

5.                The decisions in the courts below
reflect different approaches to the nature of the burden on the applicant to
establish entitlement under s. 10(6)(a). Waisberg J. of the Ontario
Provincial Court presided at the restoration hearing. He felt that entitlement
should be narrowly construed since the consequence of failing to meet the test
was to deprive an applicant of ""several rights"". Because of the original
applicant's death there was no possible evidentiary use for the seized monies
in this case. Judge Waisberg observed that if the matter had gone to trial
there might well have been a conviction. Nevertheless, he felt satisfied that
the current appellant was entitled to possession as administrator of the
original applicant's estate. In his view, the suspected connection of the
monies to drug trafficking did not defeat restoration. He made the requested
order.

 

6.                Smith J. [(1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 323]
quashed the Provincial Court Judge's order on the basis of Largie v. R.
(1982), 25 C.R. (3d) 289, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal which had
been handed down in the interim. In his view, Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. had failed
to take account of the rule of public policy that the courts will not permit a
litigant to benefit from his or her crime. He rejected the appellant's argument
that ""when a claimant accused has died, the purpose behind the rule loses
its legitimacy assuming the absence of any evidence that the representative is
tainted"", and thus ""restoration should be made virtually for the
asking"". Such a result, to Smith J.'s mind, ignored the scheme of the
legislation as defined in Re Aimonetti and The Queen (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d)
164, a decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal which was heavily relied on in Largie,
supra. The Ontario Supreme Court in Largie had quashed the trial
judge's restoration order on the basis of the rule of public policy. The
Ontario Court of Appeal upheld that decision without, however, giving express
approval to the reasoning on which it was based. Instead, Houlden J.A. adopted
the approach of the majority in Aimonetti which, by reading s. 10 in its
totality, found that the Minister's right to custody under s. 10(7) is directly
proportionate to the scope of the seizure power in s. 10(1)(c). Thus, in
order to obtain restoration an applicant must disprove the suspected
relationship between the things seized and narcotics offences. Smith J. in the
case at hand combined the public policy rationale with the textual
analysis of Aimonetti in the following passage at p. 327: 

 

                   Perhaps
the matter might be put differently. When applying the public policy rule in
the context of the seizure provisions of the Narcotic Control Act, the
courts have tended to apply the taint to the ""thing"" or the monies
rather than to the applicant. And that view is supported by the wording of the
section.

 

This hybrid version of the two approaches perhaps obscures the
importance of the distinction between them for the purposes of this case.
However, the core of Smith J.'s reasoning is that once one replaces the person‑specific
approach of an analy­sis based on the rule of public policy with the thing‑specific
approach of an analysis based on the statutory text, the innocence of the
person applying for restoration becomes irrelevant.

 

7.                The Ontario Court of Appeal [(1983), 3
C.C.C. (3d) 575] upheld Smith J.'s decision to quash in very short reasons
written by Lacourcière J.A. However, Lacourcière J.A.'s analysis appears to be
a reversion to the public policy rationale so carefully avoided by the
Court of Appeal in Largie. He founds his decision on the view [at pp.
575‑76] that ""the appellant as administrator of the deceased's
estate can be in no better position to claim the restoration of the funds, the
apparent proceeds of the alleged crime, than the alleged deceased
perpetrator"". Implicit in that position is the belief that the person‑specific
public policy rule applies and that the entire case therefore turns on the
peculiar fact that the applicant is an innocent representative of the allegedly
non­innocent original applicant.

 

8.                This divergence in analytic approach in
the decisions below reflects a divergence in jurisprudential treatment of s.
10(6)(a) generally. B. R. Shilton in his article ""Drug Moneys‑‑The
Fruits of Crime?"" 25 C.R. (2d) 294, has identified three conceptually
distinct judicial interpretations of s. 10(6)(a) entitlement. The
parties to this appeal admit of two possible approaches in their written
argument. An examination of the restoration hearing transcript reveals that a
third restrictive interpretation was proposed by the appellant at first
instance and, indeed, was accepted by Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. as being the most
appropriate approach. For convenience I will label the three interpretive
approaches as follows: (1) the simple proof of entitlement approach; (2) the
public policy approach; and (3) the legislative text approach. The unusual fact
of the original applicant's death throws into sharp relief the conceptual
distinction between the latter two approaches. Generally, an applicant is the
person from whom the things in question were originally seized. From that perspective,
the effect of the public policy approach and the legislative text approach is
the same, i.e., an applicant must disprove ""taint"" in order to
show entitlement. However, standing under the Act is quite broad; it allows
""any person"" to apply for restoration. If that person has no
connection to the reasonable suspicion which prompted the seizure in the first
place, the difference between the two approaches, as Lacourcière J.A.'s
decision demonstrates, becomes very important. If the taint attaches to the person,
then the appellant's innocent representative status may be significant. But, if
the taint attaches to the thing seized, as Smith J. concluded, then the
innocent status of the applicant may be irrelevant. It must be remembered,
however, that this dichotomy arises only if one rejects the first approach
which simply requires an applicant to prove entitlement. 

 

9.                It was suggested by counsel for the
respondent that the appellant made a concession in the course of the
restoration hearing which concludes the case against him and obviates the need
to discuss the distinctions between the various approaches. I would
respectfully disagree. At the hearing the appellant's counsel argued that,
since forfeiture could only occur under the conditions set out in s. 10(8), the
first approach, namely simple proof of entitlement, was all that was required
of an applicant in order to succeed on his application. He went on to concede
that, if he was wrong in that and had to prove in addition the absence of
taint, he would be unable to discharge that burden. Accordingly, if the Court
were to find that the rule of public policy operated vis‑à‑vis
innocent representatives of less worthy litigants, this concession would be
fatal to the appellant's case under both the public policy and the legislative
text approaches. The concession would be irrelevant, however, if the Court were
to find, as did Waisberg Prov. Ct. J., that all s. 10(6)(a) requires is
proof of the right to possession. Thus, at the very least the Court must
discuss the merits of the first analytic approach. Then, if that analysis is
rejected, it must go on to discuss the viability of the argument that a claim
by an innocent representative should not be defeated by the taint associated
with the original claimant. If the result is again negative, only then does the
appellant's concession disqualify him from success. However, it would be
difficult to discuss fully the merits of any of the possible approaches to s.
10(6)(a) entitlement without reviewing the divergent lines of
jurisprudence. I propose therefore not to limit my analysis of the section in
the way suggested by respondent's counsel.

 

4. The Jurisprudence

 

10.              Much of the jurisprudence is in the nature
of magistrate or provincial court decisions and is therefore reported only
through incorporation in appellate decisions reviewing by way of certiorari.
In addition, many of the decisions fail to distinguish between the latter two
approaches, viewing them as one and the same or as different versions of each
other. Nevertheless, it is possible to separate out the various strands of
analysis.

 

(a)               The Simple Proof of Entitlement Approach

 

11.              The cases adopting the first approach,
which is a strict approach to the concept of legal entitlement, largely depend
on the argument that forfeiture should only occur under s. 10(8) and that penal
statutes and statutes depriving a person of proprietary rights should be
strictly construed. Implicit in the reasoning is the notion that the reasonable
suspicion which gives rise to a s. 10 search and seizure should not operate as
a finding of guilt unless there is compliance with the normal rules of proof.

 

12.              In Burgess v. The Queen (1975), 18
Cr.L.Q. 254, one of the earliest reported cases, Rice Prov. Ct. J., after
finding that the terms of s. 10(8) could not be met even after conviction,
concluded that the main issue was the evidentiary use of the seized monies. He
thereby assumed that the Minister could not retain the monies under s. 10(7) on
any other basis. This diminished reading of the purpose of the Minister's
custody is confirmed by Rice Prov. Ct. J.'s treatment of s. 10(6)(a) in
the hearing at first instance in Largie, supra. There he held,
according to Houlden J.A., that entitlement in s. l0(6)(a) ""was
used in the legal sense, not in the moral sense and that if the appellant could
show that he was entitled to possession of the money as opposed to any other
person, he was entitled to an order of restoration"": see Largie, supra,
at p. 291. 

 

13.              The same assumption is implicit in Smith
(M.J.) v. The Queen, [1976] 1 F.C. 196, a case which arose out of a civil action
against the Minister to reclaim monies seized in a s. 10 search but for which
no s. 10 application had ever been made. The accused had pleaded guilty to an
offence under the Narcotic Control Act. There was no indication in the
evidence that the monies were related to that offence. Addy J., like Rice Prov.
Ct. J., was of the view that, where there was no evidentiary use for the
property and no forfeiture under s. 10(8), entitlement was simply a question of
who was the most likely owner or had the right to possession. Property rights
were not subject to the applicant's disproof of taint. Quite the contrary; the
Minister's s. 10(7) possessory right was subject to the proprietary rights of
interested persons. He stated at pp. 199‑200:

 

It is obvious that section
10(8), in addition to providing that the Minister may direct the disposition of
money seized, specifically stipulates that any money seized which was used
for the purchase of a narcotic is forfeited to Her Majesty. This is the
only case where any provision is made as to forfeiture of monies and it is
clear from the admitted facts, in the case at bar, that the monies in question
were not so used. Altogether apart from the principle that if a statute
purporting to forfeit a property right must specifically state so, in view of
the specific provisions as to forfeiture in subsection (8), I must conclude
that subsection (7) does not in any way provide for the forfeiture of any
property right or any right to possession since no forfeiture is mentioned in that
subsection. Thus, the discretion of the Minister in that particular subsection
is subject to any property rights of persons interested in the
""thing"" seized.

 

And later at p. 201:

 

                   It
seems quite clear to me that subsections (5) and (7) of section 10 are merely
procedural and custodial. They provide a ready mechanism for a person to obtain
by some re‑application the return of anything which has been seized and
also provide for the custody of same in the event of any application not being
made or in the event of the application being denied. They do not either
explicitly or by necessary implication cause any property right to be
forfeited.

 

                   I might
add that if, in enacting these subsections, the Parliament of Canada did
purport to provide that any money whatsoever, seized in a police raid under the
Narcotic Control Act, including money which is not eventually connected
with the commission of a criminal offence, would be forfeited to the Crown in
the right of Canada in the event of an application not being made for the
return of same within two months, then, these provisions would be ultra
vires as infringing on the property and civil rights jurisdiction of the
provinces. 

 

14.              By employing the language of ultra vires
and of interference with property rights Addy J. articulates the underlying rationale
of the first approach. From this standpoint the scope of entitlement in s.
10(6)(a) is bounded on the one hand by the presumption of innocence and
on the other hand by the presumption of constitutionality. The presumption of
innocence addresses the impropriety in terms of fundamental principles of
criminal law of the imposition of a penalty of forfeiture where there has been
no proof that an offence associated with the goods has been committed. The
presumption of constitutionality addresses the impropriety in terms of
legislative competence of federal legislative interference with property rights
apart from any valid federal objective.

 

15.              The decision of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal in Re Hicks and The Queen (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 91, takes this
same narrow interpretive approach. The case deals with s. 10(9) which is
exclusively concerned with forfeiture of seized conveyances. Subsection 10(6)
is subject to ss. 10(8) and 10(9). At the restoration hearing the Crown argued
that ""subject to"" meant that s. 10(9) should prevail until it was
established that its terms could not be met. The applicant argued that this
restricted s. 10(6) to a very limited operation as the class of things liable
to seizure under s. 10(1)(c) but not liable to forfeiture under ss.
10(8) and 10(9) is almost non‑existent. The majority at the Court of
Appeal quashed the order denying restoration at first instance. Although the
applicant had not disproved taint, it was felt that the requirements of ss.
10(6)(a) and (b) had nevertheless been met. Hall J.A., with whom
three others concurred, found that an order granting restoration is not
necessarily inconsistent with a later order of forfeiture. In the course of his
reasons he stated at p. 95:

 

                   It is
here appropriate to observe that statutes of this nature should be strictly
construed. Deprivation of property as provided in the Narcotic Control Act
is, to say the least, an extraordinary measure; that is not to say it is bad
but rather the remedy of restoration and the ultimate penalty of forfeiture
need to be reviewed in the context of the Act providing for them. Clear terms
are required before depriving a person of his property, either temporarily or
permanently.

 

16.              Both Addy J. and Hall J.A. describe the
principle of strict construction in terms of deprivation of property. However,
such deprivation is not unusual under criminal statutes although, as Addy J.
has pointed out, an attempt by Parliament to expropriate property for a purpose
which is outside federal competence would likely be ultra vires.
Alternatively, the rule can be described in terms of a presumption favouring
strict construction of penal statutes. Indeed, this seems to be the context in
which Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. invoked a restrictive interpretive approach in the
present case. Although he explained that he was doing so because forfeiture
deprives the accused of ""several rights"", he also pointed out that
the Narcotic Control Act is a statute ""involving criminal
prosecution"", that all criminal matters with regard to the original
applicant came to an end with his death, and that there has never been a final
adjudication of guilt or innocence. 

 

17.              The principle of strict construction of
penal statutes, however, is problematic. This Court in R. v. Robinson,
[1951] S.C.R. 522, determined that no such general rule exists in Canadian
criminal law. Admittedly subsequent cases have modified that position. However,
the impropriety of requiring an applicant to disprove taint in a s. 10
restoration hearing does not stem simply from an assertion, dubious since Robinson,
that it is improper to give a large and remedial reading to criminal
provisions. Rather, the impropriety relates to the use of that broad
interpretive approach to undermine the presumption of innocence which
traditionally places the burden of proof on the Crown. Although it is clear
from the case law under the Canadian Bill of Rights that it is open to
Parliament to enact exceptions to the presumption of innocence, s. 2 of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, if nothing else, expressly requires that any such
exceptions be strictly construed. That section reads in part:

 

[Construction of law]

 

                   2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act
of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian
Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of
the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no
law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 

(f) deprive a
person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an
independent and impartial tribunal, or of the right to reasonable bail without
just cause; ...

 

Thus the unwillingness to apply the mischief rule to s. 10(6)(a)
which is manifested in the decisions adopting the first analytic approach has a
solid legal foundation in both the Canadian Bill of Rights and common
law principles of criminal justice.

 

18.              The case of Re Collins and The Queen
(1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 377, comes closest to articulating fully the
inconsistency between an enlarged definition of entitlement and fundamental
principles of criminal law. The case concerned a post‑acquittal
restoration hearing at which the trial judge denied restoration. The Quebec
Court of Appeal overturned his decision. Montgomery J.A.'s reasons at p. 378
are brief and to the point:

 

                   The
practical effect of the judgment refusing the order of restoration is to
subject respondent to a heavy fine for an offence of which he has been
acquitted. This is contrary to the principle of autrefois acquit, and I
cannot agree that it was Parliament's intention that s. 10 of the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1, should bear such a meaning.

 

This amounts to a statement that forfeiture can and should only take
place under s. 10(8). McCarthy J.A., with whom Jacques J.A. concurred,
acknowledges that s. 10 places the burden of disproof of taint on an applicant
but finds that it is an error of law not to consider the applicant's acquittal
when applying the test of entitlement. He states at pp. 380‑81:

 

In fact, it is only
because the police believed that an offence under the Narcotic Control Act
had been committed that they were able to carry out the seizure (s. 10(1)(c)).
The innocence of the accused with respect to the offence for which he is
charged is settled once and for all (except for appeal, which is not the
present case) by his acquittal. I do not believe that Parliament wished that
the accused be obliged to convince the judge of his innocence, whether the same
judge or another judge, a second time, or to convince him of his innocence with
respect to offences with which he has not even been charged, in order to regain
possession of a thing which had been seized.

 

Again, there is an implicit assumption that forfeiture can only occur
upon a finding of guilt. Unfortunately, McCarthy J.A. does not address the
issue of why in a pre‑trial situation it is not likewise an error of law
to require an applicant to disprove guilt on pain of forfeiture with respect to
offences with which he or she may not be charged, or if charged, of which he or
she may not be convicted. That issue is central to the resolution of the
present appeal. 

 

19.              Finally, in R. v. Molina (1985), 7
O.A.C. 235, the Ontario Court of Appeal refrained from clarifying and
reinforcing its decision in Largie, supra, and from making a
clear pronouncement with regard to onus of proof of ""taint"" in s.
10(6)(a). Vanek Prov.Ct.J. had restored seized monies to an applicant in
spite of finding that the applicant was ""reluctant, unwilling or unable to
provide a satisfactory explanation of the source from which all this money was
generated, and how it came to be accumulated"". Neither Aimonetti, supra,
nor Largie, supra, nor the provisions of the Narcotic Control
Act in Vanek J.'s view justified the conclusion that there is an onus on an
applicant to prove that seized monies were not derived from traffic in drugs.
As the Crown had failed to adduce any evidence on which he could reasonably
conclude that the monies were tainted, he restored them. The Court of Appeal
quashed the trial judge's restoration order. Grange J.A., in oral reasons for
the Court, based his decision on a finding that Vanek J.'s assessment of the
evidence was in error and that the Crown had provided enough evidence on which
one could reasonably conclude that the applicant acquired the seized monies
from drug trafficking. In doing so Grange J.A. not only sidesteps the question
of onus but also gives a very cautious reading to Largie and Aimonetti
as follows at p. 238:

 

                   It
appears clear to us that whatever the onus may be and wherever it may lie, the
application may be refused if the magistrate concludes that the money resulted
from an illegal trade in narcotics. This is precisely what was held in Aimonetti
at p. 172 and approved in Largie at p. 511.

 

(b) The Public Policy Approach

 

20.              The requirement that an applicant disprove
taint because of ""the well known rule of public policy"" is found by
reading ""entitled"" in s. 10(6)(a) as meaning ""lawfully
entitled"". This triggers the application of the maxim ex turpi causa
non oritur actio. Failure to consider this rule of public policy
constitutes the requisite ""error of law"" on the basis of which a
superior court reviewing on certiorari can quash a magistrate's
decision. In order to prove lawful entitlement an applicant is usually called
upon to demonstrate that the monies came from a legitimate source and are
therefore not the profits of crime. It is generally accepted that the rule is
person‑specific, i.e., that what is abhorrent to public perception
is the spectacle of the actual wrongdoer reaping the benefits of his or her wrongdoing
with the compliance, if not the assistance, of the courts. From this standpoint
the appellant's assertion that his status as an innocent representative
undermines the purpose of the rule is crucial to his success in the current
appeal. The cases can be divided into two categories: (1) those in which the
turpitude which triggers the rule consists of a reasonable belief on the part
of the authorities that the monies seized are related to a narcotics offence,
and (2) those in which the suspected taint has been confirmed by the
applicant's own admissions.

 

21.              The cases of Re Regina and Blaney
(1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 395, Hughes J.'s decision in Largie, and Sowrey
v. Minister of National Health and Welfare, [1985] 1 W.W.R. 85 fall into
the first category. In Blaney the parties foreclosed discussion of the
operation of ex turpi causa in this context by admitting that the rule
applied but arguing on an alternative basis. However Grange J. (as he then was)
of the Ontario High Court comments at p. 398:

 

                   I might
have had some doubt that the well recognized principle that the Courts will not
by giving judgment in his favour permit a litigant to profit by his crime
extends to cover situations such as this where the accused seeks to recover
money removed from him under judicial process but certainly the proposition is
arguable and, as I have said, is not disputed before me. 

 

22.              In Largie Hughes J. of the Ontario
Supreme Court quashed Rice Prov. Ct. J.'s restoration order because of his
failure to take account of the rule. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld that
result but only by applying the legislative text approach set out in Aimonetti.

 

23.              Only in Sowrey does one find a full‑blown
use of the public policy rationale in spite of the lack of turpitude in
the strict sense. In that case an undercover agent had arranged to exchange
sixty‑four pounds of marijuana for some cash and several thousand units
of LSD. The applicant was arrested and a quantity of cash seized before the
transaction occurred. Garfinkel Prov. Ct. J. of the Manitoba Court denied
restoration in a post‑conviction hearing. There was no evidence to
connect the cash to the offences with which the applicant had been convicted at
trial. Hicks, supra, was distinguished on the basis that there
the interest of an innocent finance company in the seized conveyance swung the
balance in favour of restoration. Although Garfinkel Prov. Ct. J. quotes
extensively from Aimonetti, he uses the language of public policy in his
conclusion at p. 95:

 

                   In the
case before me, it is equally contrary to public policy and against the public
interest for a court to grant an order of restoration if to do so would place
in the hands of the applicant money which, on the facts before me, was
associated with an illegal drug transaction and was intended to be used in an
illegal drug transaction. I want to say I am not deciding the issue of
ownership, which could be the subject of civil proceedings.

 

24.              The second category of cases is comprised
of those in which the turpitude which triggers the rule is an actual admission
of guilt. They include Re Regina and Buxton (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 278,
and Minister of National Health and Welfare v. Medd, [1983] 6 W.W.R. 304
(Man. C.A.) In Buxton the applicant admitted that part of the cash
seized came from the sale of cocaine although not from the sale of the cocaine
seized. The trial judge clearly adhered to the first analytic approach as the
following passage quoted at p. 280 illustrates:

 

                   I come
back again to the point that on the admitted facts it is not possible to
determine what amounts came from what source (i.e., legitimate or
illegitimate). Putting the Crown's case in its strongest possible position‑‑that
the amount derived from narcotic sale is to be considered as $1,099 and the
amount derived from the sale of the car at $1 still results in the sum of $1
being forfeited to the Crown completely without any authority to do so. Further
to require the applicant to prove the proportions of the source of the money
when the admitted facts are that the ""mixed fund"" is in
""indeterminate proportions"" places an impossible burden upon him
which again would result in an effective forfeiture without authority in that
the money would be held in perpetuity by the Minister ... .

 

                   In
conclusion then I would hold that although the Kolstad case and public
policy are both some authority that Courts should not, and should not appear
to, countenance returning money to a person who obtained that money from an
illegal activity; nevertheless, whereas here the money is a ""mixed
fund"" in ""indeterminate proportions"" I would hold that the right
to property is paramount in these circumstances. I find that the applicant has
proved on a preponderance of evidence that he is entitled to possession of the
$1,100 concerned, and since subpara. (b) has been complied with in the admitted
facts, and since s. 10(8) does not apply, that the applicant is entitled to an
order restoring the $1,100 to him. 

 

25.              McFadyen J. of the Alberta Queen's Bench
quashed the restoration. In her view it was contrary both to public policy and
to the scheme set out in s. 10 to allow restoration of the proceeds of crime.
She stated at p. 282:

 

                   In my
view, the words in s. 10(6); ""is entitled to possession"" must be read
as lawfully entitled to possession. In this matter the Court had notice that
Buxton obtained some of the money by unlawful means. Buxton is not entitled to
possession of that sum of money. The onus is on Buxton to establish the amount
of money which he was lawfully entitled to possess.

 

26.              In Medd there was likewise an
admission of guilt, although the illegality was not narcotics related. The
applicant in that case was arrested with a suitcase containing narcotics and
cash. At the restoration hearing he testified that the money was unconnected with
drug trafficking and that most of it stemmed from an illegal pyramid scheme in
Alberta. He also admitted that he intended to use the money to purchase
narcotics for re‑sale. The trial judge restored the monies. Even in the
face of the applicant's admission he refused to abandon the simple proof of
entitle­ment approach or to apply the ex turpi rule. Hall J.A. quotes
from the trial judge's reasons at p. 306:

 

                   Applying
this definition of the `strict interpretation' principle, to the Crown's
allegation that the words `entitled to possession' in s. l0(6) means [sic]
""lawful"" possession, I cannot, on grounds of interpretation or public
policy, extend the plain, and ordinary meaning, sought by the Crown. It is
clear in law that, if the language of a criminal statute creates uncertainty,
the person against whom it is being enforced is entitled to the benefit of any
doubt, or to the less harsher of interpretations.

 

The trial judge was of the view that the proper way for the Crown to
proceed would be to charge the applicant under the relevant section of the Criminal
Code  although he admitted that proof would be difficult as the applicant
had invoked the protection of the Canada Evidence Act  [R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10]
in making his admission.

 

27.              Wilson J. quashed the restoration. Unlike
the trial judge he felt that entitlement meant lawful entitlement. The Court of
Appeal upheld his decision. Quoting from the reasons of Hall J.A. at
p. 308:

 

                   In my
view, it is quite unnecessary to consider the scope of the words ""entitled
to possession"". It is sufficient to dispose of the matter by saying that
it would be contrary to public policy and against the public interest for the
Court to lend its process to grant an order of restoration, if to do so would place
in the hands of the applicant money which, by his own admission, was illegally
obtained. Mr. Medd swore that the money was not the fruits of illegal trade in
narcotics but of another illegal activity. He asks for the money back. The
court should not entertain that approach. In rejecting it, the court is not
deciding the issue of ownership, which could be the subject of separate civil
proceedings if Mr. Medd be so advised. 

 

(c) The Legislative Text Approach

 

28.              The third approach also requires an
applicant to disprove taint. However it replaces the narrow focus of the public
policy rationale on the word ""entitlement"" in s. 10(6)(a)
with a careful reading of the entire statutory scheme in s. 10. There are two
consequences of this difference in approach which are significant for the
purposes of the current appeal. First, as mentioned earlier, the taint attaches
to the thing seized rather than to the person applying. Thus the innocence of
the present appellant has no impact on result under this analysis. Secondly,
the turpitude which is traditionally required to trigger the ex turpi
rule has been legislatively replaced by the reasonable belief of the officer
who seized the goods initially that those goods are associated with narcotics
offences.

 

29.              Kopstein Prov. Ct. J.'s decision in R.
v. Tupper (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 529 (Man.), is one of the earliest
expressions of this approach. Although the application failed for non‑compliance
with the technical requirements in s. 10(5), the trial judge nevertheless
considered the merits of the claim and in particular the scope of s. 10(6)(a)
entitlement. He placed great importance on the use of the word
""satisfied"" in that section in terms of the Magistrate's being
satisfied that the applicant was entitled to possession of the goods. In his
view the word meant different things in different contexts. Therefore he
focused on the context of s. 10 in its totality. He wrote at p. 535:

 

                   While
it appears that under s. 10(1)(c) a peace officer may seize anything,
including any money by means of which or in respect of which he reasonably
believes an offence to have been committed under the Narcotic Control Act,
it is only where such seized moneys were used for the purchase of the narcotic
in respect of which an accused was convicted that such moneys are forfeited to
Her Majesty under s‑s. (8). Any other money seized may be restored
pursuant to an application under s‑s. (5). If it had been Parliament's
intention, however, that such money was to be restored merely upon the failure
of the Crown to show that it was used for the purchase of the narcotic which is
the subject of the proceedings, it might simply have enabled or required the
Court to restore such money by reason of that failure to the person, if any,
from whom it was seized. Parliament, however, has made it necessary that an
application be made to a Magistrate and that the Magistrate be satisfied of the
applicant's entitlement to possession.

 

                   Under
s. 10(1)(c), a peace officer may seize anything by means of or in
respect of which ""he reasonably believes"" an offence under the Narcotic
Control Act has been committed. In the circumstances of such a seizure it
appears likely that it was the legislative intent to require a person who seeks
restoration to provide proof of his right to possession. Evidence relating to
the legitimate source of the applicant's acquisition of the moneys, in a case
such as the present case, might well be a relevant consideration. 

 

The thrust of Kopstein Prov. Ct. J.'s analysis is to treat the scope of
s. 10(6)(a) proof of entitlement as a function of the scope of the s.
10(1)(c) seizure power. In other words the fact of a s. 10 seizure is
evidence of taint, and strictly speaking, the Crown need not lead any further
evidence. If the applicant fails to demonstrate the legitimacy of the funds'
source, the fact of seizure becomes conclusive evidence of taint. In Tupper
the Crown actually did call a witness who gave additional circumstantial
evidence of the monies' taint, namely that they were found in a vase along with
two scraps of paper on which figures followed by the abbreviations
""lbs."" and ""oz."" were written.

 

30.              Aimonetti, supra, is the
authority usually cited for the proposition that the scheme of s. 10 requires
an applicant to disprove taint in order to obtain restoration. Again, the Crown
in that case led additional evidence of taint, namely that traces of cannabis
resin were found on some of the seized bills. Huband J.A.'s majority reasons
are very similar to the reasons in Tupper. The following passage, which
was approved by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Largie, sets out the
critical elements of the third analytic approach at pp. 171‑72:

 

                   Looking
at s. 10 in its totality, I think it is clear that the authorities are entitled
to seize cash, beyond that which may be involved in a particular illicit
transaction with respect to which a charge is laid. Money actually used in the
purchase of a narcotic is to be forfeited to Her Majesty at the conclusion of a
trial, under s‑s. (8). The money we are now concerned with falls in a
different category. The scheme of the Act, as I see it, allows police authority
to seize property related to the illicit trade in drugs, possession of which is
then turned over to the Minister unless the applicant is able to make out a
case for restoration. The procedures under s. 10 do not constitute the Minister
or the Crown as owner of the property in question. The Minister becomes entitled
to ""possession"", but it is then open to the accused, or indeed anyone
else, to advance a civil claim for the recovery of the property from the
Minister. In Smith v. The Queen (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 252, 67 D.L.R.
(3d) 177, [1976] 1 F.C. 196, Addy J. of the Federal Court made it clear that s.
10(5) and (7) are ""merely procedural and custodial"", and that
""they do not either explicitly or by necessary implication"" cause any
property right to be forfeited. The right to advance a proprietary claim in
separate civil proceedings is open to anyone.

 

                   Where
the property in question is money, the claim for restoration of possession will
not be allowed if the cash appears to be the fruits of illegal trade in
narcotics. The scheme of the Act is to deny possession of such funds to one
accused and subsequently convicted of participating in illegal trade, (subject
to that person's right to claim ownership in separate civil proceedings). It
would be contrary to the scheme of the Act to allow restoration on the limited
ground that the money could not be identified in a transaction with the
specific narcotic found on the premises. In my opinion, Kopstein Prov. J. had
the jurisdiction to deny the application for restoration in spite of the fact
that the money in question was not directly identified as flowing from a
transaction involving the cannabis resin seized from the premises. So
long as there was evidence upon which he could reasonably conclude that the
money resulted from illegal trade in narcotics, he was entitled to treat such
money as a thing ""in respect of which ... an offence ... has been
committed"", to borrow from the language employed in s. 10(1)(c). 

 

31.              Largie reinforced this position by
reference to s. 312 of the Code which makes it an offence to knowingly
possess the proceeds of crime. Houlden J.A. in that case stated that
restoration should not be granted if the seized money was obtained from the
sale of narcotics thus encouraging the commission of a s. 312(1)  offence. This
glosses over the fact that the elements of a s. 312(1)  offence had not been
proven. Indeed, in Largie it appears that the ""taint"" stemmed
from the simple fact that the money was seized in the course of a s. 10 search.
In the case at hand the respondent makes a similar argument, although in a more
tentative form, by submitting that ""the Court, if it were to order
restoration, could be in the position of placing property in the applicant's
hand which could constitute an offence under s. 312(1)  of the Criminal Code "".

 

32.              In discussing R. v. Molina, supra,
I noted that the Court of Appeal of Ontario seemed to retreat from the position
that the scheme of the Act requires an applicant to make out a case for
restoration by demonstrating the legitimacy of the source of the funds. Rather,
Grange J.A. reduced the cases of Largie and Aimonetti to the
proposition that there must be evidence on which a Magistrate could reasonably
conclude that the monies were tainted. He refrained from a discussion of onus
thus avoiding what is perhaps the most troubling aspect of both the public
policy approach and the analysis based on the total scheme in s. 10.

 

5. Statutory Construction and Section 10(6)(a)

 

33.              The question of what is entailed in s.
10(6)(a) entitlement is largely one of statutory construction. The
jurisdiction of a magistrate under s. 10 must be found within the confines of
the authority and powers described in its provisions. In that sense Huband
J.A.'s method of analysis in Aimonetti which relies on a cohesive view
of the legislative text is persuasive. However, the interpretation which he
proposed, while it is supported by the text, is difficult to reconcile with the
substantive and constitutional limits on statutory construction, and in
particular with the presumption of innocence as it has evolved at common law and
under the Canadian Bill of Rights.

 

34.              The classic formulation of the principle
that a person accused of a criminal offence is innocent until proven guilty is
found in Viscount Sankey's decision in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
[1935] A.C. 462 (H.L.), at pp. 481‑82:

 

Throughout the web of the
English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the
duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have
already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception.
If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt,
created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to
whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the
prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an
acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the
prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of
England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained. 

 

35.              The principle is the foundation for a host
of evidentiary rules and determines the otherwise inexplicable boundary between
legal and scientific truth. As Viscount Sankey's pronouncement makes clear, two
fundamental tenets flow from the presumption of innocence: first, that the
burden of proof is upon the Crown and second, that proof is on the high
standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, Viscount Sankey
acknowledged the legitimacy of statutory incursion into the principle and the
jurisprudence of this Court under the Canadian Bill of Rights
acknowledges to some degree the validity of such legislative derogation.
However, Ritchie J.'s majority decision in the leading case of R. v. Appleby,
[1972] S.C.R. 303, maintained that an enactment which reverses the onus of
proof must do so expressly. Indeed, the Canadian Bill of Rights itself,
as discussed earlier, if nothing else requires express words in order ""to
abrogate, abridge or infringe"" any of the rights and freedoms in s. 2.
Accordingly, if legislation permanently dispossessing a person of his or her
property is properly characterized as penal, and in this case I think it is,
then the procedural protections enshrined in the Canadian Bill of Rights
which attend the imposition of penalties by the state should apply.

 

36.              The appellate decisions which favour
imposing a burden of disproof of taint on an applicant offer two rationales
to justify their position. Houlden J.A. in Largie proposes a form of
preventive criminal regulation; Huband J.A. in Aimonetti explains the
denial of restoration under s. 10(6)(a) by maintaining that legal title
is not affected by the restoration proceedings.

 

37.              As discussed earlier, Houlden J.A. in Largie
was of the view that the approach in Aimonetti was strengthened by s.
312(1)  of the Criminal Code . He wrote at p. 293:

 

By virtue of s. 312(1) , it
would be an offence for the appellant to be in possession of money derived from
the sale of narcotics. The court should not, therefore, make an order of
restoration if the money were obtained in this way.

 

While this would perhaps be reasonable if the elements of a s. 312(1) 
offence had been proven, it seems unorthodox to deny restoration on the
possibility that this would lead to the commission of such an offence. Section
312(1)  stipulates that not only must an accused be in possession of tainted
property but he or she must also have knowledge of the taint. In Largie
the applicant led evidence at his hearing to show that the seized monies were
derived from painting and decorating. Rice Prov. Ct. J. took the position that
entitlement could be established without evidence of the source of the cash. No
other evidence of taint or of knowledge of taint is mentioned by Houlden J.A.
apart from the initial seizure. While a law which is specifically aimed at the
prevention of crime was upheld in Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. v. The Queen,
[1956] S.C.R. 303, its operation was contingent on the previous commission of
an offence. The provision in question allowed the court under s. 31 of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26 as re‑enacted by 1952 (Can.),
c. 39, s. 3, to order, in addition to any other penalty, the prohibition of the
continuation or repetition of the offence of which the person had been
convicted. In the present case not only is there no conviction, but there is no
express legislative grant of authority to the magistrate. Furthermore, the
judicial exercise of such a preventive power in these circumstances undermines
established rules of proof and procedure designed to protect the accused. It is
unnecessary for the purposes of this case to decide whether in fact an explicit
legislative attempt would fall within federal competence over crime prevention.


 

38.              The same observations can be made about
the decisions which employ the public policy approach in the absence of any
proof of turpitude. Again this seems to be an unwarranted exercise of judicial
power in the form of preventive regulation of criminal behaviour contrary to
both the normal operation of the ex turpi rule as well as fundamental
principles of our justice system. In the circumstances it would be more
consistent with considerations of public policy to grant rather than to deny
restoration.

 

39.              The second rationale is much more
persuasive. In the previously quoted passage from Aimonetti, at pp. 171‑72,
Huband J.A. makes reference to Addy J.'s characterization in Smith of
ss. 10(5) and 10(6) as ""merely procedural and custodial"" and as
neither explicitly nor implicitly causing forfeiture. Rather, a denial of
restoration was described by Huband J.A. as simply a denial of possession and
he was at pains to point out that it remained open to an applicant ""to
advance a proprietary claim"" in a separate civil action against the
Minister. Indeed, this was the nature of the action in Smith.

 

40.              However, Huband J.A.'s view of the
restoration hearing process was rejected by Mahoney J. of the Federal Court of
Appeal in R. v. Aimonetti (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 481. When the applicant
in Aimonetti met with failure in the Manitoba Court of Appeal and his
application for leave to appeal that decision to this Court was dismissed, he
instituted a civil action in the trial division of the Federal Court for the
return to him as legal owner of the seized money plus interest. A preliminary
question concerning the Federal Court's jurisdiction and res judicata
was put to the Court of Appeal. Mahoney J. held that the cause of action at the
restoration hearing was the same as the cause of action before the Federal
Court. The applicant's ownership of the property had never been in question as
no s. 10(8) forfeiture had ever taken place. Thus, the issue of possession had
been conclusively determined under ss. 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) in favour of the
Minister. There was no need to distinguish Smith as in that case no
previous restoration hearing had taken place. If Mahoney J. is correct, then
what might otherwise be described as administrative detention of property
subject to an ultimate determination of legal title is in fact a final and
judicial determination of possessory rights. A denial of restoration is
tantamount to a penalty of permanent dispossession.

 

41.              It seems to me that the first analytic
approach, which requires proof only of the right to possession and which does
not require disproof of taint on the part of an applicant, is not only
supported by the text of s. 10 but is also consistent with the interpretive
tenets that flow from the entrenchment of the presumption of innocence in the Canadian
Bill of Rights. Furthermore, the notion that there should be an exact
correlation between the scope of the seizure power in s. 10(1)(c) and
ministerial custody in s. 10(7), while formally pleasing in its symmetry, does
not make functional sense. The considerations which would favour a fairly broad
grant of power to a police officer under a search warrant to the detriment of
the right of an individual to preserve his or her privacy no longer operate at
the point of a restoration hearing. A further detention of property which has
no evidentiary use and which has not been shown to be associated with the
commission of an offence serves no legitimate purpose and would seem to require
much clearer language than that employed in s. 10. 

 

6. Conclusions

 

42.              At the beginning of these reasons I stated
that three crucial questions must be answered in order to settle this appeal:
what is meant by s. 10(6)(a) entitlement, on whom lies the burden of its
proof or disproof, and what is the standard of proof? In light of the foregoing
discussion I would conclude that, generally speaking, the restrictive
interpretation which I have called the simple proof of entitlement approach is
completely consistent with the general principles of criminal justice and with
the actual scheme in s. 10. Many of the decisions which employ this approach,
including that of Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. in the present case, rely either
explicitly or implicitly on the presumption of legal title to the goods which
arises from the fact of possession. The rule is summarized in Halsbury’s
Laws of England, vol. 35, 4th ed., at paragraph 1122 as follows:

 

1122. Possession prima
facie title. The presumption of law is that the
person who has de facto possession also has the property, and accordingly such
possession is protected, whatever its origin, against all who cannot prove a
superior title. This rule applies equally in criminal and civil matters. Thus,
as against a stranger or a wrongdoer, a person in actual or apparent
possession, but without the right to possession, has all the rights and
remedies of a person entitled to and able to prove a present right to
possession.

 

In Canada the presumption has been applied in the cases of McDonald
v. Lane (1882), 7 S.C.R. 462, R. v. Meloche, [1970] 3 O.R. 798 (C.A.),
and R. v. Bagshaw, [1972]) S.C.R. 2. Thus, in order to satisfy a
magistrate at a restoration hearing on the question of entitlement, a claimant
should be prepared to show on the balance of probabilities that he or she was
in possession of the property at the time of seizure. To place the onus on the
claimant in this way does not offend established rules of procedure as the
claim of entitlement at this stage is simply the assertion of a civil right. In
addition, such evidence is readily obtainable by most claimants. The generous
standing in s. 10(5) leaves it open to ""any"" other person to rebut
the claim to possession.

 

43.              While it seems sensible to assume that
entitlement means lawful entitlement, the rule of public policy should only
operate where there is turpitude. Where that turpitude is a criminal wrong,
criminality must be demonstrated in accordance with normal procedures. Section
10(8) which directs forfeiture of things seized which were ""used in any
manner"" in connection with a narcotics offence of which a person has been
convicted, codifies the ex turpi rule in the context of narcotics
convictions. This leaves open two questions. How must the tainted connection be
proven under s. 10(8), and does that section imply that the ex turpi
rule is excluded from operation under s. 10(6)(a) where the things
seized are connected to a conviction for a non‑narcotics offence?

 

44.              The answer to the first question is
subject to the same considerations that apply to the discussion of the burden
imposed on an applicant by s. 10(6)(a) entitlement. Fundamental
principles of criminal justice as well as the nature of the proceedings under
s. 10 make it inappropriate to transform a restoration hearing into a trial in
which the Crown need only meet the civil standard of proof in order to
establish guilt or ""taint"". Thus the culpability of the owner of the
seized property must have been proven at antecedent criminal proceedings under
the Narcotic Control Act. In the absence of a specific finding at trial
of the requisite ""tainted connection"", the Crown may fill the
evidentiary gap by proving taint on the reasonable doubt standard at the
restoration hearing. Where there is no antecedent conviction and no basis for
laying a narcotics related charge, proceedings should be initiated under s.
312(1)  of the Criminal Code . 

 

45.              The second question concerns the situation
in which the Crown places in evidence a prior conviction for a non‑narcotics
offence and the association of the seized property with the commission of that
offence. The interpretive guideline expressio unius est exclusio alterius
suggests that s. 10(8) precludes the operation of the ex turpi rule
here. However, such an interpretation would multiply proceedings as well as
offend public perception of the justice system. Accordingly, I do not think the
expressio unius rule should prevent a reading of s. 10(6)(a)
entitlement to mean ""lawful entitlement"" in this very limited context.
The more fundamental question remains whether the ex turpi rule has been
correctly applied, namely whether the facts of a connection between the
property and the commission of an offence, be it a Code offence or a
narcotics offence, have been properly established. In summary, the public
policy approach is to be faulted only in those cases in which this factual
basis for its operation is lacking. In addition, where the rule of public
policy legitimately applies, the status of an applicant as the innocent
representative of a convicted but deceased owner would not entitle the
applicant to restoration. In general, I agree with the following
characterization of the ex turpi rule by Lord Diplock in Hardy v.
Motor Insurers' Bureau, [1964] 2 All E.R. 742, at pp. 750‑51, and
with his assumption that a successor stands in the shoes of the original
claimant:

 

All that the rule means is
that the courts will not enforce a right which would otherwise be enforceable
if the right arises out of an act committed by the person asserting the right
(or by someone who is regarded in law as his successor) which is regarded by
the court as sufficiently anti‑social to justify the court's refusing to
enforce that right.

 

Whether countervailing considerations apply where, as in that case, the
benefit in question is claimed under an insurance policy, need not be decided
here. 

 

7. Disposition of the Present Appeal

 

46.              Much of the argument in this case centred
on the appellant's status as an innocent representative of the estate in answer
to the allegation of taint associated with the seized monies. There was no
admission of guilt by the appellant, simply an admission that a burden of
disproof of guilt could not be met. In the debate over the effect of the
original applicant's death on the interpretive alternatives, little attention
was paid to the preliminary question of whether in any circumstances a
magistrate under s. 10 may deny restoration of things seized to their proper
owner where no conviction has been entered and where the evidentiary use of the
things has either expired or is non‑existent. It seems to me, for the
reasons given in the preceding discussion, that a negative answer must be given
to that question. While the Crown may defeat entitlement by fulfilling the
terms of s. 10(8) or alternatively, by placing in evidence the necessary facts
to show that entitlement under s. 10(6)(a) would be unlawful, in both those
situations the fact of a previous conviction is a condition precedent. Thus the
appellant's lack of association with the reasonably held belief which prompted
the initial seizure is irrelevant. Indeed, even if it were clear on the
evidence that the appellant was closely involved in Mr. Gombosh's affairs, this
would not be determinative by itself. The Crown has not argued that the monies
seized are related to any ongoing investigation of Mr. Gombosh, the appellant,
or any other person. As Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. pointed out, all criminal
proceedings against Mr. Gombosh were discontinued at his death. Thus, there is
no evidentiary use for the monies and the s. 10(6)(b) branch of the test
for restoration is satisfied. In addition, counsel for the Crown conceded at
the restoration hearing that there was sufficient evidence to show that Mr.
Gombosh was in physical possession of the seized monies. The presumption of
entitlement which operates in that circumstance has not been rebutted. Nor has
the appellant's status as the representative of Mr. Gombosh's estate been
challenged. Accordingly, the s. 10(6)(a) branch of the test for
restoration has also been satisfied.

 

47.              I would allow the appeal, set aside the
orders of Smith J. and of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and reinstate
Waisberg Prov. Ct. J.'s order for the restoration of the property to the
appellant.

                   Appellant faced a charge of robbery and of unlawful
use of a firearm while committing an indictable offence. The preliminary
hearing judge ruled that he had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
there was some positive identification and found that the accused was not
positively identified as the person who committed the crime. There was no
indication that the preliminary inquiry judge addressed his mind to whether the
evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing could convince a reasonable jury of
guilt. The respondent Crown applied to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba
by way of originating notice of motion for an order of certiorari to
quash the decision of the preliminary hearing judge and to return the matter to
the Provincial Court for processing under s. 475 of the Code. The
application was dismissed but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision on
appeal. The main points in issue were: (1) whether on the Crown's application certiorari
was available to correct errors on the face of the record or whether it was
only available to correct errors of jurisdiction; (2) if certiorari only
applied to errors of jurisdiction, was it a jurisdictional error to apply the
wrong standard of proof in determining whether there was ""sufficient
evidence"" of guilt to commit an accused person for trial; (3) if certiorari
lay to correct the error here, should the remedy be withheld because the Crown
had other remedies available which had not been exhausted.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   It is settled that in a review of a committal for
trial the only ground for action by the reviewing court is lack of
jurisdiction. The same principle applies where certiorari is sought to
review a discharge. A preliminary hearing is not intended to determine
innocence or guilt but only whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant the
accused's standing trial. It is therefore inappropriate to allow supervisory
remedies exercised in proceedings to quash a committal to be expanded to
correct errors of law relating to matters such as admissibility and production.
Errors going to the jurisdiction of the preliminary hearing judge, however, are
different. Superior courts have always exercised their inherent authority to
ensure that the lower courts fully exercise their powers without exceeding
their jurisdiction. Both parties to the preliminary hearing are subject to the
same obligations and enjoy the same rights under the jurisdictional test. 

 

                   Jurisdictional error is committed where
""mandatory provisions"" of the Criminal Code  are not followed,
and in the context of s. 475 , there must be at least some basis in the evidence
proferred for the justice's decision to commit. Where there is some evidence,
it is clearly within the justice's jurisdiction to come to a decision as to
whether the evidence is of sufficient weight to commit. Jurisdictional error is
not committed by an incorrect ruling on admissibility at the preliminary
hearing unless it should affect the right to cross‑examine or to call
witnesses to the extent that natural justice is violated.

 

                   Jurisdictional error was present here. The
preliminary inquiry judge's decision to not commit appellant to trial, because
the evidence did not identify him beyond a reasonable doubt, was acting in
excess of his jurisdiction under the mandate issued by Parliament in s. 475.
The reviewable error did not lie in the adoption of a mistated test, but in the
exercise of a function reserved by Parliament to another forum.

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                Estey
J.‑‑This appeal brings before this Court once again the
difficult and long‑discussed question as to when certiorari is
available to quash the decision of a Provincial Court Judge sitting in
preliminary hearing under s. 475  of the Criminal Code . The appellant
faced a charge of robbery and of unlawful use of a firearm while committing an
indictable offence. In disposing of the matter, the learned preliminary hearing
judge said:

 

...I have to be satisfied,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that there has been some positive identification....
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind as to identification and I am not at
liberty to infer from the surrounding circumstances that he was the person
there, so on the question of identification I must hold that the accused was
not positively identified as being the person who committed the offence....

 

This was clearly an error of law. Whether it goes beyond that to
constitute a jurisdictional error is the crux of this appeal. Section 475(1)  of
the Criminal Code  states:

 

                   475. (1) When all the evidence has been taken by the justice he shall,

 

(a) if in his
opinion the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on trial,

 

(i) commit the accused for
trial, or

 

(ii) order the accused,
where it is a corporation, to stand trial in the court having criminal
jurisdiction; or

 

(b) discharge the
accused, if in his opinion upon the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is
made out to put the accused on trial.

 

2.                The test to be employed under this
section is to be found in the judgment of this Court in United States of
America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, per Ritchie J. at p.
1080:

 

                   I agree
that the duty imposed upon a ""justice"" under s. 475(1)  is the same as
that which governs a trial judge sitting with a jury in deciding whether the
evidence is ""sufficient"" to justify him in withdrawing the case from
the jury and this is to be determined according to whether or not there is any
evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a
verdict of guilty. The ""justice"" ... is, in my opinion, required to
commit an accused person for trial in any case in which there is admissible
evidence which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction.

 

In this case, there is no indication that Norton Prov. Ct. J. addressed
his mind, as he was required to do, to the question whether the evidence
adduced at the preliminary hearing could convince a reasonable jury of guilt. 

 

3.                The respondent Crown applied to the
Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba by way of originating notice of motion for
an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the preliminary hearing
judge and to return the matter to the Provincial Court for processing under s.
475 of the Code. Wright J., sitting in Chambers, dismissed the
application. His decision was overturned on appeal to the Manitoba Court of
Appeal (O'Sullivan J.A. dissenting).

 

4.                The principal decisions of this Court on
the application of judicial review to proceedings held under s. 475  have been
directed to proceedings wherein the accused has been committed and the
committal has been brought under challenge in judicial review. In those
circumstances, certiorari lies only where the error goes to
jurisdiction, and not in respect of a non‑jurisdictional error of law,
even where the error appears on the face of the record: Patterson v. The
Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 409, Attorney General (Que.) v. Cohen, [1979] 2
S.C.R. 305, Forsythe v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 268, Skogman v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93. The issue raised in this appeal is whether
the same or some other limitation applies to the review of a discharge in
contrast to a committal of an accused at preliminary hearing. Depending upon
the answer to that question, there may arise the narrower question as to
whether the reasonable doubt test applied by the learned magistrate here
instead of the Shephard test, supra, deprived the Provincial
Court Judge of jurisdiction or was merely an error of law committed within his
jurisdiction, and hence not within the reach of judicial review. We are here
concerned, of course, not with a proceeding which commenced without
jurisdiction but rather with one in which there is an allegation that in the
course of performing its statutory role, the tribunal acted in violation of its
jurisdiction, either by exceeding or by declining to exercise it: see Forsythe,
supra, per Laskin C.J. at pp. 271‑72.

 

5.                At trial, Wright J. held that the error
was jurisdictional, because ""excess or absence of jurisdiction occurs if a
wrong standard of proof is applied that has the effect of causing the judge to
go further than the law permits, or to fail to go as far as the law
permits"". However, he denied certiorari because in his view, the
applicant Crown had other remedies, such as the right to ""start over again
with a new charge, or to indict directly"".

 

6.                In the Manitoba Court of Appeal, Monnin
J.A. (as he then was) held that certiorari lay despite the fact that the
error in this case was merely an error of law not going to jurisdiction. Matas
J.A. concluded that the availability of certiorari to quash the
committal or discharge of an accused at a preliminary inquiry is limited to
cases involving jurisdictional errors. In any case, he agreed with Wright J.
and held that the error in this case was jurisdictional: 

 

                   The
presiding judge at a preliminary hearing is circumscribed by law in how he
approaches his task of determining the sufficiency of evidence. The Sheppard
[sic] test governs the exercise of his discretion. The test ... gives
substance to the bare admonition in s. 475 of the Code requiring the
judge to form an opinion on whether the evidence is sufficient; the test must
form the substratum of the judge's opinion. If a judge applies the Sheppard
[sic] test, he acts within his jurisdiction. The decision, right or
wrong, will stand. A jurisdictional error will arise only if he makes an error
in reliance on a test which is fundamentally wrong. (See Reid and David,
Administrative Law and Practice, 2 ed., at pp. 206‑207, where it is
said that with respect to civil proceedings, jurisdictional error exists when a
tribunal disregards the basic principles on which its enabling legislation is
based.)

 

7.                O'Sullivan J.A. dissented. In his
opinion, certiorari was only available in cases of jurisdictional error,
and the error in this case was not of that sort. Rather, the misdirection as to
the burden of proof was an error ""made in the course of the exercise of a
judicial jurisdiction bestowed on him as a court by Parliament.... He erred in
directing himself as to what was a `sufficient case' but his error does not
mean he failed to comply with the provision of the statute.... He did not ask
the wrong question but answered the right question wrongly.""

 

8.                The points in issue framed by the
appellant number six; however, they clearly resolve themselves into three.
These are:

 

1.                Is certiorari available in these
circumstances to correct errors of law on the face of the record, or is it only
available to correct errors of jurisdiction?

 

2.                If the latter, is it a jurisdictional error to
apply the wrong standard of proof in determining whether there is
""sufficient evidence"" of guilt to commit an accused person for trial?

 

3.                If certiorari lies to correct the error
in this case, should the remedy be withheld because the Crown has other
remedies available which have not been exhausted?

 

9.                The starting point in the analysis of
the position of the preliminary hearing judge is found in the judgment of
Judson J. in Patterson v. The Queen, supra, where he wrote at p.
411:

 

                   I
intend to confine these reasons within the very narrow issues raised by the
case and to repeat what has been emphasized so often that if it is sought to
review a committal for trial, there is only one ground for action by the
reviewing Court and that is lack of jurisdiction.

 

This was a certiorari proceeding in which it was asserted that
the committing judge, by declining to order the production of a statement given
by a Crown witness to the police, had thereby committed an error of law
reviewable by certiorari. Although Spence J. dissented, he agreed that certiorari
would not lie to correct errors ""made by a magistrate in the performance
of his duties"" (p. 419). Judson J.'s statement of the law has been
specifically confirmed in three subsequent decisions of this Court (Cohen,
Forsythe and Skogman, supra) and must be taken as settled. 

 

10.              However, this case is in fact the converse
of those four. Here, certiorari is sought not by the accused to
challenge a committal, but by the Crown. Monnin J.A. (alone of the three judges
in the Court of Appeal) did not believe that, in the absence of a ""very
clear and definite pronouncement from the Supreme Court"", Patterson
and the cases following it should be taken to have excluded all recourse to certiorari
for error of law on the face of the record in the decision of a justice acting
under s. 475 , when review for error of law is in other contexts clearly
available: R. v. Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd., [1922] 2 A.C. 128 (P.C.), R.
v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal. Ex parte Shaw, [1952] 1
K.B. 338 (C.A.), Alberta Board of Industrial Relations v. Stedelbauer
Chevrolet Oldsmobile Ltd., [1969] S.C.R. 137). Those cases were, of course,
all directed to a process in a tribunal other than a preliminary hearing
operating under s. 475 of the Code. The preliminary hearing under review
here is entirely statutory and, so far as this appeal is concerned, is
completely prescribed in s. 475 .

 

11.              It may be said that there is a rationale
in law for drawing a distinction between judicial review of committals and
judicial review of discharges after a preliminary hearing. A primary emphasis
in the cases involving error of law in the committal of an accused has been on
avoiding delay of the trial, which it might be within the power of an accused
to bring about through applications for judicial review for errors of law. The
same consequence does not follow where the Crown seeks an order quashing the
discharge of the accused.

 

12.              However, the reason underlying the court's
restriction of supervisory remedies is equally valid in both cases. It has been
said numerous times that the objective of holding a preliminary inquiry is
merely to determine whether there is enough evidence against the accused to
justify ordering him to stand trial. It is not intended to determine, finally
or otherwise, the accused's guilt or innocence. Therefore, it is inappropriate
to allow the expansion of supervisory remedies designed to correct errors of
law made in the course of preliminary inquiries which relate, for example, to
the admission of evidence, the questioning of witnesses, or the production of
documents. A preliminary hearing ""is not a trial and should not be allowed
to become a trial"" (Patterson, supra, per Judson J.
at p. 412; see also Cohen, supra, per Pigeon J. at p.
309). The questioning of errors of law is therefore as inappropriate in
proceedings to quash a discharge as it is in proceedings to quash a committal.
Errors which go to the preliminary hearing judge's jurisdiction are, however,
different. Superior courts, from the earliest days in our law, have exercised
their inherent authority to enforce compliance with the law by lower tribunals
which must exercise fully without exceeding their statutory jurisdiction. Such
is the position of a preliminary hearing tribunal. 

 

13.              It follows that both parties to the
preliminary hearing process are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the
same rights under the jurisdictional test as applied in Patterson, supra,
to the parent statute as interpreted by Shephard, supra. It must,
therefore, be determined whether the error in this case was jurisdictional.

 

14.              An analogous jurisdictional issue arose
before this Court in Doyle v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597, where the
Court confined the powers of a judge sitting in a court whose jurisdiction,
specified by statute, is limited to those powers set forth in the statute, that
is the Criminal Code , and no others. The tribunal was there, and is
here, entirely statutory and its activities are measured on judicial review
against the jurisdiction accorded to it by the governing statute. In the
simplest terms, the question in this appeal therefore reduces itself to
whether, as interpreted in Shephard, supra, s. 475  provides an
authorization or mandate only for a test or process directed to determining
that a jury could, upon the evidence presented, convict the accused.

 

15.              The cases, though not conclusively
determining whether the error here is jurisdictional or not, are nevertheless
instructive. Patterson was a case in which the accused had been
committed for trial on a charge of using an instrument with intent to procure a
miscarriage. He argued that it was reviewable error for the committing justice
to refuse production of a statement made by the woman mentioned in the charge
to the police so that defence counsel could use it in cross‑examination.
The majority of this Court disagreed. Spence J. in dissent, and Hall J. who concurred
in the result reached by Spence J. but delivered separate reasons, both held
that a limitation on the accused's right to fully cross‑examine the
witnesses at the preliminary inquiry would amount to a denial of natural
justice, and thus to jurisdictional error. Their disagreement related to their
different conclusions as to whether such a limitation had occurred on the
facts.

 

16.              In the Cohen case, supra,
the application was brought before the magistrate's decision had been reached.
The error alleged in that case was that the magistrate had wrongly sustained
the Crown's objection to questions asked by defence counsel of Crown witnesses.
This Court held that a decision as to the admissibility of evidence, however
erroneous, does not constitute jurisdictional error. See also R. v. Norgren
(1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 488 (B.C.C.A.) and Re Nicols and The Queen,
reported with Re Martin, Simard and Desjardins and The Queen (1977), 20
O.R. (2d) 455 (C.A.), in which the refusal by the presiding judge to order the
production of a police notebook for cross‑examination by the accused may
have been an error in law, but was not jurisdictional and hence beyond review.

 

17.              Forsythe, supra, was a
similar case. The accused's application for certiorari was denied where
the Provincial Court Judge had disallowed questions sought to be asked of the
complainant at an in camera hearing pursuant to s. 142  of the Criminal
Code . Laskin C.J. set out a catalogue of some of the types of errors which
might result in a loss of jurisdiction by a justice at a preliminary inquiry.
He said, at pp. 271‑72: 

 

                   In
speaking of lack of jurisdiction, this Court [in Patterson] was not
referring to lack of initial jurisdiction of a judge or magistrate to enter
upon a preliminary inquiry. This is hardly a likelihood. The concern rather was
with the loss of this initial jurisdiction and, in my opinion, the situations
in which there can be a loss of jurisdiction in the course of a preliminary
inquiry are few indeed. However, jurisdiction will be lost by a magistrate who
fails to observe a mandatory provision of the Criminal Code : see Doyle
v. The Queen [[1977] 1 S.C.R. 597]. Canadian law recognizes that a denial
of natural justice goes to jurisdiction: see Alliance des Professeurs
catholiques de Montréal v. Labour Relations Board of Quebec [[1953] 2
S.C.R. 140]. In the case of a preliminary inquiry, I cannot conceive that this
could arise otherwise than by a complete denial to the accused of a right to
call witnesses or of a right to cross‑examine prosecution witnesses. Mere
disallowance of a question or questions on cross‑examination or other
rulings on proffered evidence would not, in my view, amount to a jurisdictional
error. However, the judge or magistrate who presides at a preliminary inquiry
has the obligation to obey the jurisdictional prescriptions of s. 475  of the Criminal
Code .

 

18.              This Court's most recent statement on the
question, Skogman v. The Queen, supra, was also a case in which
the accused applied for certiorari to quash his committal, here because,
as was admitted by the Crown, there was no evidence of an essential element of
the offence. The application was successful. The majority of the Court, held at
pp. 100‑01 that s. 475 ,

 

At
minimum, . . . calls upon the presiding justice to form an
opinion as to whether evidence is ""sufficient"" or whether ""no
sufficient case is made out"" so as to justify a conclusion by the
presiding justice ""to put the accused on trial"" or not to commit the
accused to trial. There is no rule within the statutory framework adopted by
Parliament for arbitrary action by the tribunal.

 

It was therefore concluded, at p. 104:

 

                   The
courts of this country have, since the judgment in Martin [Re Martin,
Simard and Desjardins and The Queen], supra, generally adopted the
rule that a committal of an accused at a preliminary, in the absence of
evidence on an essential ingredient in a charge, is a reviewable jurisdictional
error.... ""No evidence"" on an essential element of the charge against
the accused cannot amount to ""sufficient evidence"" under s. 475 .

 

A number of lower court decisions were to the same effect: Re
Martin, Simard and Desjardins and The Queen, supra, Re Poirier
and The Queen (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 452, Re Robar and The Queen
(1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 133 (N.S.C.A.)

 

19.              In summary, it is clear enough that no
jurisdictional error is committed where the justice incorrectly rules on the
admissibility of evidence or incorrectly decides that a particular question or
line of questioning cannot be pursued at the preliminary inquiry. This is, of
course, subject to the important condition that rulings in the course of a
preliminary hearing on evidentiary questions as to the extent of limitation on
the basic right to cross‑examine or to call witnesses, may develop into a
violation of natural justice and fall within the condemnation of Forsythe,
supra, and hence be subject to judicial review. See also Re Martin,
Simard and Desjardins and The Queen, supra, at p. 488.
Jurisdictional error is committed where ""mandatory provisions"" of the
Criminal Code  are not followed, and in the context of s. 475 , this means
at least that there must be some basis in the evidence proffered for the
justice's decision to commit. There is no jurisdiction to act
""arbitrarily"". However, where there is some evidence, it is clearly
within the justice's jurisdiction to come to a decision as to whether that
evidence is of sufficient weight to commit. This follows from the statement of
Lord Sumner in Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd., supra, at p. 144: 

 

On certiorari, so far as
the presence or absence of evidence becomes material, the question can at most
be whether any evidence at all was given on the essential point referred to.
Its weight is entirely for the inferior Court....

 

The Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd. appeal, supra, concerned the
attempted judicial review of a conviction by a magistrate on a charge under a
provincial statute from which there was no appeal. The Court was not there
concerned with s. 475 , although some of the evidentiary considerations relating
to judicial review bear the same consequences whether the review is of a
decision of an inferior tribunal or the proceedings under s. 475 .

 

20.              The question therefore remains whether the
preliminary hearing judge, in deciding that because the evidence did not
establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was identified as the person
responsible for the offences charged, he could not commit him for trial, was
acting within his jurisdiction or was acting in excess of his jurisdiction
under s. 475 . The appellant rightly points out that the section does not direct
the judge as to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the
sufficiency of the evidence for committal or for discharge. It might be said,
therefore, that the judge exercised his discretion as to the proof demanded by
the statute. There is certainly no specific direction, as there was in Doyle,
supra, where the statute required that the judge ""shall"" grant
an adjournment in a particular way and subject to particular limitations.

 

21.              In my view the appellant cannot
successfully sustain his submissions. This is not a case where the reviewing
judge merely thinks that the justice was wrong, in the sense that if the
reviewing judge had been sitting at the preliminary inquiry, he would have
reached a different conclusion as to the sufficiency of the evidence. It is a
case in which the real complaint is that the exercise of weighing the evidence
proceeded on an entirely erroneous basis in law, which in turn goes to the
mandate issued by Parliament in s. 475 . That is to say, s. 475 , in the context
in which it is found in the Criminal Code , does not direct the
preliminary hearing judge to determine guilt or innocence. This is clear from
s. 475  viewed alone and would be the case even if Shephard, supra,
which now defines the test or standard of proof that should in law be applied
by a preliminary hearing judge, had never been decided. 

 

22.              There are dicta suggesting that an
error as to the burden or standard of proof applicable under s. 475  of the Criminal
Code  is error of law only, and does not go to jurisdiction: see R. v.
Hubbard, [1976] 3 W.W.R. 152 (B.C.S.C.), Re Mitchell and Maynes and The
Queen (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 344 (Alta. S.C.) (In an entirely different
context, Lowry J. in R. (Hanna) v. Ministry of Health and Local Government,
[1966] N.I. 52 (Q.B.), assumed that error as to the ""kind and standard of
proof"" resting on a party who sought certiorari to review the
decision of a Minister on an appeal from a planning decision was an error of
law only and did not go to jurisdiction.) In my view, Hubbard and Re
Mitchell, supra, are not supportive of the appellant's position in
this case. The preliminary hearings in those cases took place before this Court
in Shephard, supra, had authoritatively interpreted the
parliamentary directive to the judicial officer presiding over a preliminary
hearing. While the tests employed in Hubbard and Re Mitchell
under s. 475  were later rejected in Shephard, in neither of these cases
did the decision‑maker fundamentally misconstrue the nature of the task
in which he was engaged under the section. In both cases, the preliminary
inquiry judge in fact made the determination as to sufficiency of evidence
required of him by s. 475 .

 

23.              In applying the wrong test for
sufficiency, a preliminary inquiry judge does not commit jurisdictional error.
In deciding an issue reserved to another forum, however, he does. That is the
nature of the error in this appeal. Norton Prov. Ct. J.'s adoption of the
reasonable doubt test indicates that he was not, as s. 475  requires, directing
his mind to the question whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant
committing the accused to stand trial. Rather, in effect, he arrogated to
himself the decision of the issue reserved by Parliament to another forum, the
trial court. He engaged in a process designed for determining guilt or
innocence, that is, for acquitting or convicting an accused. In fact, the
formal order, signed by the learned preliminary hearing judge, indicates that
the charges against the accused were ""dismissed"", and not
""discharged"" as required by the section of the Code. A
dismissal is, if made by a court of competent jurisdiction, a final disposition
of the case against an accused sufficient to support the plea of autrefois
acquit: Petersen v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 493, R. v. Riddle,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 380. Norton Prov. Ct. J.'s jurisdiction was defined by the
enabling statute. That jurisdiction was exceeded when, instead of performing
the function assigned to him, he did something quite different. The error in
this proceeding was not that the Provincial Court Judge merely misstated the
test (which would, as was concluded in Hubbard, supra, be an error of
law within jurisdiction) but that he dismissed the information. 

 

24.              I therefore conclude that jurisdictional
error is present in this case and that these proceedings are subject to
judicial review because certiorari, or proceedings in the nature of certiorari,
run equally where the error in jurisdiction results in a discharge or a
committal.

 

25.              I then turn to the final issue, which is
whether certiorari should provide a remedy where the Crown has other
remedies available which have not been exhausted. This matter has been touched
upon by this Court in other cases. In Forsythe, Laskin C.J. wrote that
although certiorari is a discretionary remedy, it would not be denied to
quash a committal for trial because ""there is no other recourse.
Committals for trial are not appealable and can only be challenged by certiorari
or motion to quash"" (at p. 271). Here, it is alleged that there are
alternative remedies, or at least alternative avenues of action: the Crown can
prefer a direct indictment or it can re‑charge the accused and proceed to
a new preliminary inquiry.

 

26.              The discretion to decline to grant certiorari
is most frequently exercised where the alternative remedy consists of a right
to appeal the decision complained of (see Reid and David, Administrative Law
and Practice (2nd ed., 1978), at pp. 369‑72, Harelkin v.
University of Regina, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561). Other alternative remedies have
also been considered to justify a refusal of certiorari (i.e.,
where the statute sets out specific alternatives other than an appeal, or where
there may be a right of action for damages or for a declaration). However,
""[t]he court ought not to refuse certiorari because of alternative
remedies other than appeal unless it is clearly satisfied that those other
remedies are more appropriate"" (De Smith’s Judicial Review of
Administrative Action (4th ed., 1980), at p. 426).

 

27.              There is a possibility, as the appellant
concedes, that if the Crown were to proceed by either of the two routes said to
afford alternative remedies, this may be held to amount to abuse of process.
Further, it must be considered that in this case, the alternatives are not
truly alternative, in the sense that an appeal, for example, is. As Monnin J.A.
pointed out in the Court of Appeal, ""It is not a remedy available to
correct an error to have to start all over again, or to prefer an indictment
with specific consent of the Attorney‑General."" The erroneous
determination continues to stand, and may well hinder the pursuit of the
suggested alternatives. In taking these factors into account, it is not
""clearly"" more appropriate to require the Crown to embark on the
doubtful course of relaying the charges or preferring a direct indictment. As
Matas J.A. pointed out below, these courses of action also may lead to the very
opportunities for delay in bringing the case to trial which the limitations on certiorari
in this context were designed to avoid. The remedy of certiorari should
not, therefore, be denied.

 

28.              For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Provocation ‑‑
“Ordinary person” standard ‑‑ Whether or not “ordinary person”
means ordinary person of same age and sex as accused ‑‑ Whether
standard correctly and clearly explained in charge to jury ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 215(1), (2).

 

                   Respondent was convicted of second degree murder for
a fatal stabbing. He was sixteen when the incident occurred and testified that
he had reacted to the victim's uninvited homosexual advances. He relied on the
defences of provocation and self‑defence. The Court of Appeal ordered a
new trial because the trial judge failed to charge the jury that the objective
""ordinary person"" standard for the defence of provocation had to take
account of the age and sex of the accused. The central question here was how
the objective test for the provocation defence was to be formulated and the extent
to which characteristics peculiar to the individual accused could be taken into
account.








 

                   Held (Lamer, Wilson and
Le Dain JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Beetz, Estey, Chouinard and La Forest JJ.: The trial judge's charge to the
jury as to the ordinary person standard in the defence of provocation was
consistent with the requirements of the Criminal Code  and was correct in
law. It was not necessary to direct the jury that the ordinary person means an
ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused.

 

                   The ordinary or reasonable person has a normal
temperament and level of self‑control and is not exceptionally excitable,
pugnacious or in a state of drunkenness. In terms of other characteristics of
the ordinary person, the ""collective good sense"" of the jury will
lead it to ascribe to the ordinary person any general characteristics relevant
to the provocation in question. Since features such as sex, age, or race, do
not detract from a person's characterization as ordinary, particular
characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic can be ascribed to an
ordinary person without subverting the logic of the objective test. It would be
impossible to conceptualize a sexless or ageless ordinary person. The central
criterion, however, is the relevance of the particular feature to the
provocation in question. 

 

                   It should be noted that the trial judge in each case
is not bound to tell the members of the jury what specific attributes they are
to ascribe to the ordinary person. In applying their common sense to the
factual determination of the objective test, jury members will quite naturally
and properly ascribe certain characteristics to the ""ordinary
person"".

 

                   The second test of provocation involves an
assessment of what actually occurred in the mind of the accused. The trial
judge must make clear to the jury that its task at this point is to ascertain
whether the accused was in fact acting as a result of provocation. In
this regard, a trial judge may wish to remind jury members that they are
entitled to take into account the accused's mental state and psychological
temperament.

 

                   The trial judge did not err in failing to specify
that the ordinary person, for the purposes of the objective test of provocation,
is deemed to be of the same sex and age as the accused. It is neither wise nor
necessary to make this a mandatory component of all jury charges on
provocation. The judge's charge on the subjective prong of the provocation
defence would not have misled the average juror with respect to the objective
test when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole.

 

                   Per McIntyre J.:
Section 215  of the Criminal Code  established the standard of the
ordinary person as the standard applicable to all persons in determining what
will amount to provocation. This standard means an ordinary person of either
sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of
self‑control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens
will exercise in today's society. If the allegedly provocative conduct will not
cause this ordinary person to lose ""the power of self‑control"",
there can be no application of the defence. Where the threshold is passed,
however, the act meets the test for provocation and consideration may be given
to the defence. If the accused lost self‑control through that provocation
and if he acted on the sudden before his passion cooled, the defence applies.
The jury applies the subjective test in making this last determination and
considers the individual characteristics of the accused which could affect his
reaction to the insult or wrongful act.

 

                   Per Lamer J. dissenting
in result: When giving content to the ordinary person standard, age is a
relevant consideration when dealing with a young accused person and will be an
important contextual consideration for a jury assessing the reaction of the
ordinary person in those circumstances. It was not mandatory that the judge
instruct the jury that the ordinary person is deemed to be of the same age and
sex as the accused for the objective test of provocation. In some cases,
however, failure to do so would be unfair and constitute reversible error, not
because of a special rule applicable to charges on provocation, but because of
the general rule that the judge's charge be fair.

 

                   The trial judge here erred when he gave instructions
to the jury tantamount to excluding age as a relevant factor when addressing
the ""first leg"" of the provocation test. The jury here must have
understood, from the charge, that the objective test excluded consideration of
age while the subjective test did not and that the accused's age could be
considered at that later stage. 

 

                   Per Wilson J., dissenting:
Subjective character traits cannot be taken into account in measuring an
accused's acts against the objective standard of the ""ordinary
person"" at the first stage of the provocation defence. To do so would
undermine the basic principles of equality and individual responsibility.
However, the accused's physical characteristics and the circumstances in which
he is found can be considered in applying the objective ""ordinary
person"" test if they are relevant in placing the wrongful act or insult in
its proper context for the purpose of assessing its gravity. The jury must be
directed to consider any facts which make the wrongful act or insult
comprehensible to them in the same way that it was comprehended by the accused
and then, having appreciated the factual context in which that wrongful act or
insult took place, measure the accused's response to this insult against the
objective standard of the ordinary person similarly situated and similarly
insulted.

 

                   The legal system, to accurately reflect the view of
children as being in the developmental stages en route to full
functioning capability as adults, must measure their actions against a standard
culminating in that of the ordinary adult. The standard of the ordinary adult,
therefore, must be adjusted to an incremental scale reflecting the reduced
responsibility of the accused resulting from his age.

 

                   Given the objective test of the ""ordinary
person"" similarly situated and similarly insulted, the fact that the
victim of the assault was male and that the assault was homosexual may be
properly considered.

 

                   Per Le Dain J., dissenting:
The youth of the accused was relevant to the consideration by the jury whether
there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive the ordinary person of the power of self‑control. The accused's
age was relevant to the standard of self‑control of the ordinary person
rather than to the gravity of the provocation: Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Camplin, [1978] A.C. 705. The trial judge's charge to the
jury was calculated to lead the jury to conclude that they should not consider
the age of the accused with reference to whether there had been a wrongful act
or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of
the power of self‑control, but only with reference to whether the accused
acted upon the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his
passion to cool. For this reason the appeal should be dismissed. As to whether
the trial judge was required to say anything concerning the age and sex of the
accused: the sex of the accused and its relevance to the nature and gravity of
the provocation were obvious and did not require any observation from the trial
judge; the relative youth of the accused would also presumably be obvious but
its relevance as a matter of law to the question whether there had been
wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self‑control might be less obvious to a
jury and should probably have been drawn to their attention.

                   The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Estey,
Chouinard and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑Gordon James Elmer Hill was charged with
committing first degree murder at the City of Belleville, County of Hastings,
on the person of Verne Pegg, contrary to s. 218(1) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34. He was found by the jury not guilty of first degree
murder but guilty of second degree murder. He was sentenced to imprisonment for
life without eligibility for parole until ten years of his sentence had been
served.

 

2.                Hill appealed his conviction to the
Court of Appeal of Ontario. He raised many grounds of appeal, but the Court of
Appeal called upon the Crown with respect to one ground only, relating to the
charge on the issue of provocation. The ground of appeal was that the trial
judge failed to instruct the jury properly as to the ""ordinary
person"" in s. 215(2)  of the Criminal Code . Section 215 of the Code
reads in part:

 

                   215. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to
manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

                   (2) A
wrongful act or insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive
an ordinary person of the power of self‑control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

3.                These two subsections, given their plain
meaning, produce three sequential questions for answer by the tribunal:

 

1. Would an ordinary
person be deprived of self‑control by the act or insult?

 

2. Did the accused in fact
act in response to those ""provocative"" acts; in short was he or she
provoked by them whether or not an ordinary person would have been?

 

3. Was the accused's
response sudden and before there was time for his or her passion to cool?

 

At this stage it is important to recall the presence of subs. (3) of s.
215  which provides:

 

                   (3) For
the purposes of this section the questions

 

(a) whether a
particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

 

(b) whether the
accused was deprived of the power of self‑control by the provocation that
he alleges he received,

 

are questions of fact.... 

 

4.                In the answering of these successive
questions, the first or ""ordinary person"" test is clearly determined
by objective standards. The second de facto test as to the loss of self‑control
by the accused is determined, like any other question of fact as revealed by
the evidence, from the surrounding facts. The third test as to whether the
response was sudden and before passions cooled is again a question of fact.

 

5.                At the time of the killing, Hill was a
male, sixteen years of age. The narrow question in this appeal is whether the
trial judge erred in law in failing to instruct the jury that if they found a
wrongful act or insult they should consider whether it was sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person ""of the age and sex of the appellant"" of
his power of self‑control. Was it incumbent in law on the trial judge to
add that gloss to the section? That is the issue.

The Facts

 

6.                At trial both parties agreed that it was
the acts of Hill which caused the death of Pegg but dis­agreed otherwise. The
position of the Crown at trial was that Hill and Pegg were homosexual lovers
and that Hill had decided to murder Pegg after a falling out between them. The
Crown argued that Hill deliberately struck Pegg in the head while Pegg lay in
bed. This did not kill Pegg who immediately ran from the bedroom into the
bathroom to try and stop the flow of blood from his head. Realizing he had been
unsuccessful, Hill took two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death.

 

7.                Hill's version of the events was very
different. He admitted to causing the death of Pegg but put forward two
defences: self‑defence and provocation. Hill testified that he had known
Pegg for about a year through the latter's involvement with the ""Big
Brothers"" organization. Hill stated that on the night in question he had
been the subject of unexpected and unwelcome homosexual advances by Pegg while
asleep on the couch in Pegg's apartment. Pegg pursued Hill to the bathroom and
grabbed him, at which time Hill picked up a nearby hatchet and swung it at Pegg
in an attempt to scare him. The hatchet struck Pegg in the head. Hill then ran
from the apartment but returned shortly afterward. Upon re‑entering the
apartment, he was confronted by Pegg who threatened to kill him. At this point,
Hill obtained two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death.

 

8.                Hill was arrested, after a car chase
with the police, at the wheel of a Pontiac automobile owned by Pegg. At the
scene of arrest Hill denied knowing Pegg, but later he made a statement to the
police which was substantially similar to his oral testimony at trial.

The Charge

 

9.                The trial judge instructed the jury on
the defence of provocation in the following terms:

 

                   The
Criminal Code  provides that culpable homicide that would otherwise be murder
shall be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the
heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

 

                   Under
the Code, a wrongful act or insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient
to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control is
provocation, if the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was
time for his passion to cool.

 

The foregoing paragraphs are simply a recital of the Code. The
judge continued: 

 

                   Provocation
may come from actual words or a series of each or a combination of both, and it
must be looked at in the light of all the surrounding circumstances.

 

                   First,
the actual words must be such as would deprive an ordinary person of self‑control.
In considering this part of the Defence you are not to consider the particular
mental make‑up of the accused; rather the standard is that of the
ordinary person. You will ask yourselves would the words or acts in this case
have caused an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

After reviewing the evidence in support of the defence of provocation
the judge continued:

 

                   You
will consider that evidence and you will decide whether the words and acts were
sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

                   The
acts were rubbing the accused's legs and chest, grabbing him by the shoulder
and spinning him around, and later Pegg grabbing his right wrist before the
second stab. The words were, ""I am going to kill you, you little
bastard"".

 

                   If you
find that they were, you will then secondly consider whether the accused acted
on the provocation on the sudden before there was time for his passion to cool.
In deciding this question you are not restricted to the standard of the
ordinary person. You will take into account the mental, the emotional, the
physical characteristics and the age of this accused.

 

                   The
incidents or the words upon which the provocation is based must be
contemporaneous words or closely related to the tragedy. The killing must take
place immediately after the acts or words constituting the provocation or so
soon thereafter that the accused's passion had no time to cool.

 

                   You
will also ask yourselves was the provocation such that it would have led a
person with the mental and physical condition and the age of the accused to
respond in this way. 

 

10.              At trial, counsel for Hill objected to the
instruction of the trial judge as to the objective requirement of the defence
of provocation, submitting that the ""ordinary person"" referred to in
s. 215(2)  ought to have been defined as an ordinary person of the age and sex
of the accused. Counsel submitted that the objective requirement would be
satisfied if the judge were to recharge the jury by defining ""ordinary
person"" as an ""ordinary person in the circumstances of the
accused"". The judge refused to recharge the jury in those terms.

 

                                                                   III

 

The Court of Appeal

 

11.              In oral reasons Brooke J.A. (Martin and
Morden JJ.A. concurring) noted that counsel for the defence, relying on Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin, [1978] A.C. 705 (H.L.), submitted that
the judge should have instructed the jury to consider whether the wrongful act
or insult was sufficient to deprive an ""ordinary person"" of the age
and sex of the accused of his power of self‑control. The Court of Appeal
held that because the trial judge declined to do so he erred. In reaching this
conclusion, Brooke J.A. stated:

 

The age and sex of the
appellant are not ""peculiar characteristics"" excluded from
consideration of the ""ordinary person"" in the objective test in s.
215(2)  (see Fauteux J. (as he then was) in Wright v. The Queen, [1969] 3
C.C.C. 258 at 264‑5 discussing Bedder v. D.P.P., [1954] 2 All E.R.
801).

 

He also added:

 

In our respectful opinion,
there is nothing in that judgment which precludes charging the jury as the
defence requested. As the matter was left to the jury, the age of the appellant
was only a consideration if and when the jury turned to the question of whether
the wrongful act or insult deprived him of his power of self‑control. The
effect of the charge was that an ordinary person did not include a 16 year old
or youth and may well have established as the standard an ordinary person more
experienced and mature than the ordinary 16 year old or youth. If this is so,
the jury may have rejected the defence judging the objective test on that
basis.

 

12.              In the result, the Court of Appeal held
that the judge was in error and there may well have been misdirection which
seriously prejudiced Hill and so the conviction could not stand. The appeal was
allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial on the charge of second
degree murder ordered.

The Issue

 

13.              The issue in this appeal is whether the
Ontario Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the trial judge erred in
law with respect to the elements of the objective test relevant to the defence
of provocation in failing to direct the jury that the ""ordinary
person"" within the meaning of that term in s. 215(2)  of the Criminal
Code  was an ""ordinary person of the same age and sex as the
accused"".

 

                                                                    V

 

The Defence of Provocation

 

14.              The defence of provocation appears to have
first developed in the early 1800's. Tindal C.J. in R. v. Hayward
(1833), 6 C. & P. 157, at p. 158, told the jury that the defence of
provocation was derived from the law's ""compassion to human
infirmity"". It acknowledged that all human beings are subject to
uncontrollable outbursts of passion and anger which may lead them to do violent
acts. In such instances, the law would lessen the severity of criminal
liability.

 

15.              Nevertheless, not all acts done in the
heat of passion were to be subject to the doctrine of provocation. By the
middle of the nineteenth century, it became clear that the provoking act had to
be sufficient to excite an ordinary or reasonable person under the circumstances.
As Keating J. stated in R. v. Welsh (1869), 11 Cox C.C. 336, at p. 338:

 

The law is, that there
must exist such an amount of provocation as would be excited by the
circumstances in the mind of a reasonable man, and so as to lead the jury to
ascribe the act to the influence of that passion.

 

16.              The Criminal Code  codified this
approach to provocation by including under s. 215  three general requirements
for the defence of provocation. First, the provoking wrongful act or insult
must be of such a nature that it would deprive an ordinary person of the power
of self‑control. That is the initial threshold which must be surmounted.
Secondly, the accused must actually have been provoked. As I have earlier
indicated, these two elements are often referred to as the objective and
subjective tests of provocation respectively. Thirdly, the accused must have
acted on the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his or her
passion to cool.

 

(a)               The Objective Test of Provocation and the
Ordinary Person Standard

 

17.              In considering the precise meaning and
application of the ordinary person standard or objective test, it is important
to identify its underlying rationale. Lord Simon of Glaisdale has
perhaps stated it most succinctly when he suggested in Camplin, at p.
726, that ""the reason for importing into this branch of the law the
concept of the reasonable man [was] ... to avoid the injustice of a man being
entitled to rely on his exceptional excitability or pugnacity or ill‑temper
or on his drunkenness"". 

 

18.              If there were no objective test to the
defence of provocation, anomalous results could occur. A well‑tempered,
reasonable person would not be entitled to benefit from the provocation defence
and would be guilty of culpable homicide amounting to murder, while an ill‑tempered
or exceptionally excitable person would find his or her culpability mitigated
by provocation and would be guilty only of manslaughter. It is society's
concern that reasonable and non‑violent behaviour be encouraged that
prompts the law to endorse the objective standard. The criminal law is
concerned among other things with fixing standards for human behaviour. We seek
to encourage conduct that complies with certain societal standards of
reasonableness and responsibility. In doing this, the law quite logically
employs the objective standard of the reasonable person.

 

19.              With this general purpose in mind, we must
ascertain the meaning of the ordinary person standard. What are the
characteristics of the ""ordinary person""? To what extent should the
attributes and circumstances of the accused be ascribed to the ordinary person?
To answer these questions, it is helpful to review the English and Canadian
jurisprudence. Since Canadian courts have relied heavily on English
developments, I shall begin with the English cases.

 

(i)                English Law of Provocation and the Ordinary
Person Standard

 

20.              In R. v. Lesbini (1914), 11 Cr.
App. R. 7, the English Court of Criminal Appeal refused to take into account
the mental deficiency of the accused in assessing the availability of the
provocation defence. It confirmed the threshold objective test for provocation
whereby there must be sufficient provocation to excite a reasonable person. A
reasonable or ordinary person was not one with mental deficiencies. In Mancini
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1942] A.C. 1, the House of Lords
endorsed the Lesbini case and further elaborated the objective test of
provocation. Viscount Simon stated, at p. 9:

 

The test to be applied is
that of the effect of the provocation on a reasonable man, as was laid down by
the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Lesbini so that an
unusually excitable or pugnacious individual is not entitled to rely on
provocation which would not have led an ordinary person to act as he did.

 

The ordinary or reasonable person, therefore, was one of normal
temperament and average mental capacity. 

 

21.              In 1954, the House of Lords was faced with
the question of whether, in applying the objective test of provocation, it
should take into account certain physical characteristics of the accused. In Bedder
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1119, a sexually
impotent man killed a prostitute after she taunted him about his physical
condition. The House of Lords had to determine whether, in applying the
objective test of provocation, the sexual impotence of the accused should be
taken into account. The test would then have been whether an ordinary person,
who was sexually impotent, would have been provoked. The Court rejected this
approach and held that the peculiar physical characteristics of the accused
were not to be ascribed to the ordinary person for the purposes of the
objective test.

 

22.              Despite the House of Lords' conclusion
that the physical characteristics of the accused were irrelevant to the
determination of whether a reasonable person would have been provoked, it
appears that the Court was primarily concerned with the difficulty of
distinguishing ""temperament"" from ""physical defects"". As
Lord Simonds L.C. stated, at p. 1121:

 

It appeared to that court,
as it appears to me, that ""no distinction is to be made in the case of a
person who, though it may not be a matter of temperament, is physically
impotent, is conscious of that impotence, and therefore mentally liable to be
more excited unduly if he is `twitted' or attacked on the subject of that
particular infirmity"". The court thereupon approved and reiterated the
proposition that the question for the jury was whether on the facts ... from
the evidence the provocation was in fact enough to lead a reasonable person to
do what the accused did.

 

23.              The Bedder approach to the ordinary
person standard is no longer the law in England. In Camplin, the House
of Lords expressly rejected the narrow objective test articulated in Bedder.
The Camplin case involved a youth of fifteen years of age who maintained
that he had been provoked by a homosexual assault. The House of Lords
unanimously concluded that the ordinary person, for the purposes of the
objective test of provocation, was to be an ordinary person of the same age and
sex as the accused. It should be noted that in Camplin, the trial judge
had specifically directed the jury to take age and sex into account and the
appeal sought to establish that this was wrong. In the present case, there was
no such instruction. 

 

24.              In justifying its shift away from the Bedder
approach, the House of Lords relied in part on legislative changes in the law
of provocation introduced after the Bedder opinion. Specifically, in
1957, s. 3 of the Homicide Act, 1957 (U.K.), 5 & 6 Eliz. 2, c. 11,
was passed; it provides:

 

                   3. Where on a charge of murder there is evidence on which the jury can
find that the person charged was provoked (whether by things done or by things
said or by both together) to lose his self‑control, the question whether
the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do as he did shall be left
to be determined by the jury; and in determining that question the jury shall
take into account everything both done and said according to the effect which,
in their opinion, it would have on a reasonable man.

 

The phrase, ""the jury shall take into account everything"" was
interpreted to allow a consideration of relevant characteristics in connection
with the objective test.

 

25.              Lord Diplock clarified the underlying rationale
for expanding the notion of the ordinary person when he wrote, at p. 717:

 

To taunt a person because
of his race, his physical infirmities or some shameful incident in his past may
well be considered by the jury to be more offensive to the person addressed,
however equable his temperament, if the facts on which the taunt is founded are
true than it would be if they were not.

 

On a similar note, Lord Morris of Borth‑y‑Gest held, at p.
721:

 

If the accused is of
particular colour or particular ethnic origin and things are said which to him
are grossly insulting it would be utterly unreal if the jury had to consider
whether the words would have provoked a man of a different colour or ethnic
origin‑‑or to consider how such a man would have acted or reacted.

 

26.              Taking these considerations into account,
Lord Simon of Glaisdale formulated the objective test as follows, at p. 727:

 

                   I think
that the standard of self‑control which the law requires before
provocation is held to reduce murder to manslaughter is still that of the
reasonable person...; but that, in determining whether a person of reasonable
self‑control would lose it in the circumstances, the entire factual situation,
which includes the characteristics of the accused, must be considered. 

 

27.              One conceptual difficulty was acknowledged
by Lord Diplock. He recognized that ""in strict logic there is a transition
between treating age as a characteristic that may be taken into account in
assessing the gravity of the provocation addressed to the accused and treating
it as a characteristic to be taken into account in determining what is the
degree of self‑control to be expected of the ordinary person"" (p.
717). In most cases, it is appropriate to assume that the level of self‑control
or degree of reasonableness is the same regardless of certain physical
differences. Age, however, in Lord Diplock's view posed a more difficult
problem. He resolved this problem with respect to age by appealing to the
acknowledged importance of the law's compassion to human infirmity. On a more
general level, he rejected the solution of separating out the inquiry into two
phases as overly complicated for the jury.

 

(ii) Canadian Case Law

 

28.              The Supreme Court of Canada has also had
occasion to provide guidance on the ordinary person standard for provocation.
In Taylor v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 462, a case in which the accused
was drunk at the time of his alleged provocation, Kerwin J., as he then was,
made clear that for the purposes of the objective test of provocation, the
""criterion is the effect on the ordinary person.... the jury is not
entitled to take into consideration any alleged drunkenness on the part of the
accused"" (p. 471).

 

29.              This Court again rejected a consideration
of the drunkenness of the accused in connection with the objective test in Salamon
v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 404. Fauteux J., as he then was, endorsed the
trial judge's instruction to the jury not to consider ""the character,
background, temperament or condition of the accused"" in relation to the
objective test of provocation. Similarly, Cartwright J., as he then was
(dissenting on another issue) wrote, at p. 415, that the trial judge correctly
""made it plain that on this [objective] branch of the inquiry no account
should be taken of the idiosyncracies of the appellant and that the standard
was that of an ordinary person"".

 

30.              Finally, in Wright v. The Queen,
[1969] S.C.R. 335, a son was charged with the shooting death of his father. The
evidence suggested that there had been some difficulties in their relationship.
The father was said to have been a bad tempered and violent man who had
mistreated his son on a number of occasions. The accused had not seen his
father for a period of about five years until a few days prior to the fatal
incident. On the evening of the shooting, the accused had spent most of the day
drinking with his friends. In considering the objective test of provocation,
the Court rejected the relevance of the quality of the accused's relationship
with his father, the mentality of the accused or his possible drunkenness.
Fauteux J. quoted, at p. 340, the words of Lord Simonds L.C. in Bedder,
that the purpose of the objective test is ""to invite the jury to consider
the act of the accused by reference to a certain standard or norm of conduct
and with this object the ‘reasonable’ or the ‘average’ or the ‘normal’ man is
invoked"". The Court went on to state, at p. 340: 

 

While the character,
background, temperament, idiosyncracies, or the drunkenness of the accused are
matters to be considered in the second branch of the enquiry, they are excluded
from consideration in the first branch. A contrary view would denude of any
sense the objective test.

 

31.              Appellate courts at the provincial level
have also considered the nature of the ordinary person standard of provocation.
In R. v. Clark (1974), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (Alta. C.A.), the ""morbid
jealousy and slight mental degeneration"" suffered by the accused was held
not to be relevant to the objective test. According to Clement J.A., at p. 16:

 

                   In the
first branch of the inquiry, the objective test, which in essence has to be
determined as a standard of comparison is the reaction that might be expected
from ordinary human nature to the wrongful act, or to the alleged insult in the
present case.

 

32.              In R. v. Parnerkar (1971), 5 C.C.C.
(2d) 11, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that the cultural and religious
background of the accused was not relevant to the determination of the
objective test. The accused, born in India, was alleged to have been provoked
by, inter alia, the deceased's statement ""I am not going to marry
you because you are a black man"". The Court's ruling seems to narrow
unduly the conception of the ordinary person and rigidly prohibit a
consideration of the physical characteristics of the accused along the lines of
the Bedder case. I should note that Par­nerkar was affirmed by
this Court on appeal: see [1974] S.C.R. 449; however, this particular question
was not addressed.

 

33.              In more recent decisions, appellate courts
at the provincial level appear to be moving towards the Camplin
approach. The Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in the present appeal, R.
v. Hill (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 394, and R. v. Daniels (1983), 7
C.C.C. (3d) 542 (N.W.T.C.A.), reflect this trend. In the Daniels case,
Laycraft J.A. held that in instructing the jury on the objective test of
provocation, the trial judge should tell the jury to take into account all of
the external events putting pressure on the accused. He stated at p. 554:

 

                   The
purpose of the objective test prescribed by s. 215  is to consider the actions
of the accused in a specific case against the standard of the ordinary person.
Hypothetically, the ordinary person is subjected to the same external pressures
of insult by acts or words as was the accused. Only if those pressures would
cause an ordinary person to lose self‑control does the next question
arise whether the accused did, in fact, lose self‑control. In my view, the
objective test lacks validity if the reaction of the hypothetical ordinary
person is not tested against all of the events which put pressure on the
accused.

 

(iii)               The Appropriate Content of the Ordinary
Person Standard

 

34.              What lessons are to be drawn from this
review of the case law? I think it is clear that there is widespread agreement
that the ordinary or reasonable person has a normal temperament and level of
self‑control. It follows that the ordinary person is not exceptionally
excitable, pugnacious or in a state of drunkenness. 

 

35.              In terms of other characteristics of the
ordinary person, it seems to me that the ""collective good sense"" of
the jury will naturally lead it to ascribe to the ordinary person any general
characteristics relevant to the provocation in question. For example, if the
provocation is a racial slur, the jury will think of an ordinary person with
the racial background that forms the substance of the insult. To this extent,
particular characteristics will be ascribed to the ordinary person. Indeed, it
would be impossible to conceptualize a sexless or ageless ordinary person.
Features such as sex, age, or race, do not detract from a person's
characterization as ordinary. Thus particular characteristics that are not
peculiar or idiosyncratic can be ascribed to an ordinary person without
subverting the logic of the objective test of provocation. As Lord Diplock
wrote in Camplin at pp. 716‑17:

 

...the ""reasonable
man"" has never been confined to the adult male. It means an ordinary
person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed
of such powers of self‑control as everyone is entitled to expect that his
fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today.

 

36.              It is important to note that, in some
instances, certain characteristics will be irrelevant. For example, the race of
a person will be irrelevant if the provocation involves an insult regarding a
physical disability. Similarly, the sex of an accused will be irrelevant if the
provocation relates to a racial insult. Thus the central criterion is the
relevance of the particular feature to the provocation in question. With this
in mind, I think it is fair to conclude that age will be a relevant
consideration when we are dealing with a young accused person. For a jury to
assess what an ordinary person would have done if subjected to the same
circumstances as the accused, the young age of an accused will be an important
contextual consideration.

 

37.              I should also add that my conclusion that
certain attributes can be ascribed to the ordinary person is not meant to
suggest that a trial judge must in each case tell the jury what specific
attributes it is to ascribe to the ordinary person. The point I wish to
emphasize is simply that in applying their common sense to the factual
determination of the objective test, jury members will quite naturally and
properly ascribe certain characteristics to the ""ordinary person"". 

 

(b)               The Subjective Test and Actual Provocation

 

38.              Once a jury has established that the
provocation in question was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the
power of self‑control, it must still determine whether the accused was so
deprived. It may well be that an ordinary person would have been provoked, but
in fact the accused was not. This second test of provocation is called
subjective because it involves an assessment of what actually occurred in the
mind of the accused. At this stage, the jury must also consider whether the
accused reacted to the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for
his passion to cool.

 

39.              In instructing the jury with respect to
the subjective test of provocation, the trial judge must make clear to the jury
that its task at this point is to ascertain whether the accused was in fact
acting as a result of provocation. In this regard, a trial judge may wish to
remind the jury members that, in determining whether an accused was actually
provoked, they are entitled to take into account his or her mental state and
psychological temperament.

 

                                                                   VI

 

The Validity of the Trial Judge's Charge

 

40.              To apply this statement of the law to the
present appeal, we must return to the actual words of the trial judge. When
instructing the jury on the objective test of provocation, he began by stating:

 

                   First,
the actual words must be such as would deprive an ordinary person of self‑control.
In considering this part of the Defence you are not to consider the particular
mental make‑up of the accused; rather the standard is that of the
ordinary person. You will ask yourselves would the words or acts in this case
have caused an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

He later added:

 

                   You
will consider that evidence and you will decide whether the words and acts were
sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

In my view, this part of the charge was well‑stated and correct
in law. The trial judge did not err in failing to specify that the ordinary
person, for the purposes of the objective test of provocation, is to be deemed
to be of the same age and sex as the accused. Although this type of instruction
may be helpful in clarifying the application of the ordinary person standard, I
do not think it wise or necessary to make this a mandatory component of all
jury charges on provocation. Whenever possible, we should retain simplicity in
charges to the jury and have confidence that the words of the Criminal Code 
will provide sufficient guidance to the jury. Indeed, in this area of the law,
I take heed of the words of Lord Goddard C.J. in R. v. McCarthy, [1954]
2 Q.B. 105, at p. 112: 

 

No court has ever given,
nor do we think ever can give, a definition of what constitutes a reasonable or
average man. That must be left to the collective good sense of the jury.

 

41.              It has been suggested that the instruction
of the trial judge on the subjective prong of the provocation defence had the
effect of misleading the jury on the appropriate content of the ordinary person
standard. The charge stated:

 

... you will then secondly
consider whether the accused acted on the provocation on the sudden before
there was time for his passion to cool. In deciding this question you are not
restricted to the standard of the ordinary person. You will take into account
the mental, the emotional, the physical characteristics and the age of this
accused.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   You
will also ask yourselves was the provocation such that it would have led a
person with the mental and physical condition and the age of the accused to
respond in this way.

 

In my opinion, these words would not have misled the average juror with
respect to the objective test, particularly when viewed in the context of the
charge as a whole.

 

42.              I have the greatest of confidence in the
level of intelligence and plain common sense of the average Canadian jury
sitting on a criminal case. Juries are perfectly capable of sizing the matter
up. In my experience as a trial judge I cannot recall a single instance in
which a jury returned to the courtroom to ask for further instructions on the
provocation portion of a murder charge. A jury frequently seeks further
guidance on the distinction between first degree murder, second degree murder
and manslaughter, but rarely, if ever, on provocation. It seems to be common
ground that the trial judge would not have been in error if he had simply read
s. 215 of the Code and left it at that, without embellishment. I am
loathe to complicate the task of the trial judge, in cases such as the case at
bar, by requiring him or her as a matter of law to point out to the members of
the jury that in applying the objective test they must conceptualize an
""ordinary person"" who is male and young. The accused is before them.
He is male and young. I cannot conceive of a Canadian jury conjuring up the
concept of an ""ordinary person"" who would be either female or
elderly, or banishing from their minds the possibility that an ""ordinary
person"" might be both young and male. I do not think anything said by the
judge in the case at bar would have lead the jury to such an absurdity.

Conclusion

 

43.              I find that the trial judge's charge to
the jury on the ordinary person standard in the defence of provocation was
consistent with the requirements of the Criminal Code  and correct in
law. It was not necessary to direct the jury that the ordinary person means an
ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused. I would, therefore,
allow the appeal and restore the conviction. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

44.              McIntyre
J.‑‑I have read the reasons for judgment of the Chief
Justice. I agree with his result and generally with his reasons. I wish only to
add a brief comment of my own.

 

45.              Section 215  of the Criminal Code 
provides for a defence of provocation, which will allow, if it is successful,
the reduction of what would be murder to the lesser crime of manslaughter.
Subsection (1) provides for the defence. Subsection (2) defines the nature of
the act or insult which will be sufficient to amount to provocation. It does
not deal with the nature or with any of the individual characteristics of the
person seeking to rely on the defence. It establishes a standard to apply to
all persons in determining what will amount to provocation, the standard of the
ordinary person. The concept of the ordinary person or the reasonable man is
well‑known in the law. Many definitions have been formulated. A fitting
one may be found in the words of Lord Diplock in the Camplin case [[1978]
A.C. 705 (H.L.), at pp. 716‑17], cited by the Chief Justice, in these
terms:

 

...the ""reasonable
man"" has never been confined to the adult male. It means an ordinary
person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed
of such powers of self‑control as everyone is entitled to expect that his
fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today.

 

If the conduct alleged to have been provocative will not cause this
ordinary person to lose ""the power of self‑control"", then there
can be no application of the defence. However, where that threshold is passed,
the act meets the test for provocation and consideration may be given to the
defence. If it is found that the accused was deprived of the power of self‑control
by the provocation and that he acted upon it on the sudden and before there was
time for his passion to cool, the defence will apply. In making that last
determination the jury may apply what has been called the subjective test, the
individual characteristics of the accused which could affect his reaction to
the wrongful act or insult, such as race, colour, religion, sex and
drunkenness, and other subjective factors affecting his reaction may be
considered. This proposition has the support of binding authority in this
country: see Taylor v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 462; Salamon v. The
Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 404; and Wright v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R.
335, where it was said, at p. 340:

 

While the character,
background, temperament, idiosyncracies, or the drunkenness of the accused are
matters to be considered in the second branch of the enquiry, they are excluded
from consideration in the first branch. A contrary view would denude of any sense
the objective test.

 

46.              The reason that the two tests, objective
and subjective, are separated in this defence is clear. The law fixes a
standard for all which must be met before reliance may be placed on the
provocation defence. Everyone, whatever his or her idiosyncracies, is expected
to observe that standard. It is not every insult or injury that will be
sufficient to relieve a person from what would otherwise be murder. The
""ordinary person"" standard is adopted to fix the degree of self‑control
and restraint expected of all in society. The law, however, does recognize
frailty when the threshold test is passed and a person is provided beyond the
level of tolerance of the ordinary person. Then the individual characteristics
of the accused may be considered and, where the other terms of s. 215  of the Criminal
Code  are met, the defence will apply.

 

47.              As I have said, I would allow the appeal. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

48.              Lamer
J. (dissenting in result)‑‑I agree with the Chief
Justice's exposition of the law in its entirety. As regards age, I therefore
agree that, when giving content to the ordinary person standard, as said by the
Chief Justice, ""age will be a relevant consideration when we are dealing
with a young accused person"", and that, ""For a jury to assess what an
ordinary person would have done if subjected to the same circumstances as the
accused, the young age of an accused will be an important contextual
consideration"".

 

49.              I am also of his view that it is not
mandatory that the judge instruct the jury ""that the ordinary person, for
the purposes of the objective test of provocation, is to be deemed to be of the
same age and sex as the accused"". But I should like to add that there
will, in my view, be cases where failure to do so, given the particular
circumstances of the case, would be unfair and constitute reversible error; but
not because of a special rule applicable to charges on provocation, but rather
under the general rule that the judge's charge to the jury must always be fair.

 

50.              Such is not the case here and the trial
judge did not err in failing to give such an instruction. But he erred, in my
respectful view, when he gave instructions to the jury tantamount to excluding
age as a relevant factor in their consideration of the ""first leg"" of
the provocation test. In his charge, he instructed the jury on the law of
provocation as follows.

 

51.              When commenting on the first phase of the
test, the objective test, he said:

 

                   First,
the actual words must be such as would deprive an ordinary person of self‑control.
In considering this part of the Defence you are not to consider the particular
mental make‑up of the accused; rather the standard is that of the
ordinary person. You will ask yourselves would the words or acts in this case
have caused an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

And, after referring to the facts of the case relevant to this first
determination, he went on to say:

 

                   You
will consider that evidence and you will decide whether the words and acts were
sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

And then, turning to the second phase, the subjective test, he said to
them:

 

                   If you
find that they were, you will then secondly consider whether the accused acted
on the provocation on the sudden before there was time for his passion to cool.
In deciding this question your are not restricted to the standard of
the ordinary person. You will take into account the mental, the emotional,
the physical characteristics and the age of this accused.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

And finally:

 

                   You
will also ask yourselves was the provocation such that it would have led a
person with the mental and physical condition and the age of the accused
to respond in this way.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

52.              Sharing the Chief Justice's confidence in
the level of intelligence and plain common sense of the average Canadian juror,
I cannot but conclude that, in all likelihood, the jury understood that the
objective test excluded consideration of age, while the subjective test no
longer restricted them and that they could, indeed should, at that latter stage
then consider the accused's age. It is on this narrow ground, the effect of the
trial judge's instructions upon the jury, that I disagree with the Chief Justice.

 

53.              The appeal should be dismissed and the
Court of Appeal's order for a new trial should stand. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

54.              Wilson
J. (dissenting)‑‑This case requires a consideration
of the defence of provocation under s. 215 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C‑34. The relevant portions of the section read as follows:

 

                   215. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to
manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

                   (2) A
wrongful act or insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive
an ordinary person of the power of self‑control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

The specific question the Court must address is whether the objective
standard of the ""ordinary person"" upon which the defence is premised
can take into account personal attributes of the accused such as his age and
sex.

 

1. The Facts

 

55.              The facts of the case are in some dispute,
different versions having been presented at trial by the Crown and the defence.
However, it would appear that the respondent, a sixteen‑year old youth,
was acquainted with the deceased, Verne Pegg, through Pegg's having acted as a
volunteer ""big brother"" to the respondent and his younger brother.
Pegg, who was thirty‑two years of age at the time of his death, had
befriended the respondent and the two had engaged in numerous social activities
together over a period of about a year.

 

56.              In the early morning of December 7, 1979 a
police officer was dispatched to Pegg's residence in Belleville, Ontario, where
he found Pegg's body lying in a pool of blood on the living room floor. Next to
the body were two blood‑stained steak knives which had apparently been
used to inflict several laceration and puncture wounds on the chest of the
deceased. On the floor in the bedroom the police discovered a hatchet covered
with the deceased's blood. It would appear that this hatchet had been used to
inflict a deep gash on the right side of the deceased's head. The walls and
floor of the bedroom and living room were splattered with blood, as were also
the sheets on the deceased's bed. 

 

57.              The discovery was made several hours after
the respondent had been arrested on Highway 401 while driving down the centre
of the highway in Pegg's automobile. A search of the vehicle turned up a number
of credit cards and other identification in Pegg's name. The respondent denied
knowing the deceased at first but eventually made a statement to the police
indicating that he had killed Pegg in the early morning hours after Pegg had
made uninvited sexual advances toward him.

 

58.              The theory presented by the Crown at trial
was that the respondent and Pegg were homosexual lovers and that Pegg's death
resulted from a violent quarrel between the two the previous night. The
respondent, however, testified in his own defence and presented a very
different picture. He stated that he had visited Pegg's apartment the previous
evening and had fallen asleep on Pegg's sofa. He was awakened at approximately
1:00 a.m. by Pegg's uninvited caressing of his chest and legs. It was the
respondent's contention that he was so shocked and enraged at Pegg's actions
that he unthinkingly grabbed a hatchet which was lying with some camping
equipment and swung it at Pegg striking him on the head. As Pegg staggered away
the respondent fled the apartment clad only in his underwear.

 

59.              Within minutes, according to the
respondent's testimony, he returned to the apartment to see if Pegg was all
right. On entering the apartment he saw Pegg standing with the telephone in his
hand. Pegg said he was going to kill him. The respondent thereupon grabbed two
knives from the kitchen counter and as the deceased slowly advanced towards him
stabbed him twice in the chest. The respondent could not recall stabbing Pegg a
third time, but he testified that between the first and second blows Pegg
struggled upright and, half sitting, threatened his life again. After the
stabbing the respondent took Pegg's keys and wallet from the bedroom, dressed
himself and fled the scene in Pegg's car. He testified that he was in a state
of shock while driving the car down the centre of Highway 401, haunted by the
terrifying spectre of Pegg's face as he advanced towards him in the apartment. 

 

2. The Courts Below

 

60.              The respondent was tried on a charge of
murder in the Supreme Court of Ontario before Walsh J. and a jury. The defences
of self‑defence and provocation were relied upon. The respondent was
convicted of the lesser offence of second degree murder.

 

61.              On the issue of provocation Walsh J.
charged the jury in the usual way, indicating that in the first part of their
analysis they must be satisfied that the respondent's act met the test of an
objective standard of behaviour which could be expected from an ""ordinary
person"" and that, if they were so satisfied, they could then go on to
consider as a subjective matter whether the respondent was in fact provoked and
in fact acted on the provocation before there was time for his passion to cool.
In instructing the jury as to the meaning of ""ordinary person"" in s.
215(2)  of the Criminal Code  Walsh J. stated:

 

                   First,
the actual words must be such as would deprive an ordinary person of self‑control.
In considering this part of the Defence you are not to consider the particular
mental make‑up of the accused; rather the standard is that of the
ordinary person. You will ask yourselves would the words or acts in this case
have caused an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

And later he said:

 

                   If you
find that they were, you will then secondly consider whether the accused acted
on the provocation on the sudden before there was time for his passion to cool.
In deciding this question you are not restricted to the standard of the
ordinary person. You will take into account the mental, the emotional, the
physical characteristics and the age of this accused.

 

62.              Counsel for the respondent challenged this
formulation of the first part of the defence of provocation on the basis that
it did not make clear to the jury that the ""ordinary person"" whose
reaction they were to consider was an ordinary person of the same age and sex
as the accused. Brooke J.A., in brief oral reasons on behalf of a unanimous
court, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. In his view, the failure of
the trial judge to charge the jury that the objective ""ordinary
person"" standard must take account of the age and sex of the accused was
misdirection. As the matter was left to the jury by the trial judge, the
respondent's age and sex could only be considered in the second stage of the
provocation defence after it had already been determined that the ordinary
person might have had a more mature and controlled reaction than the
respondent. This was seriously prejudicial to the defence and the conviction
could not be allowed to stand. 

 

3. The Objective Test

 

63.              The central question posed in this appeal
is how the objective test for the provocation defence is to be formulated and
the extent to which characteristics peculiar to the individual accused can be
taken into account. Section 215(2) of the Code provides merely that the
incident giving rise to the provocation must be ""of such a nature as to be
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control....""
This rather cryptic statutory language requires interpretation in order to
achieve the presumed purpose of the legislature in requiring the accused's
conduct to be measured against that of the ""ordinary person"". What is
the rationale underlying the objective test?

 

64.              Like the ""reasonable man""
standard in tort law, the reference to the ""ordinary person"" in s.
215(2)  embodies the notion that acts falling below the applicable standard are
considered wrongful whether or not the individual defendant (or accused) had
the capacity to meet the standard. Thus, in the classic negligence case of Vaughan
v. Menlove (1837), 3 Bing. N.C. 468 (C.P.), it was held that a defendant's
innate stupidity cannot be put forward as a tort defence since he owes his
neighbour a duty to take reasonable care regardless of his personal capacity
for reasonableness. Similarly in the context of criminal culpability, it was
held in the leading case of R. v. Lesbini (1914), 11 Cr. App. R. 7
(C.A.), that the mental deficiency of the accused cannot be taken into account
in analyzing the defence of provocation since, short of insanity, the law
imposes full responsibility for intentional injurious acts except in those
provocative situations where the ordinary person would not have acted any
differently.

 

65.              Stupidity, of course, is not the only
subjective character trait which cannot be taken into account in measuring the
accused's acts against the objective standard of behaviour. Almost the entire
spectrum of personality traits has been considered and rejected by English and
Canadian courts as factors pertinent to the provocation defence. Thus, in Salamon
v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 404, it was determined that the temperament of
the accused and his peculiar psychological make‑up are not relevant to
the question whether he has met the objective standard required of every
person. Similarly, the fact that the accused was unusually excitable or prone
to emotional outburts was disallowed as a factor which the jury could consider
in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1942] A.C. 1 (H.L.) And
a tendency toward fits of rage brought on by drunkenness was excluded as an
ingredient making up the standard of behav­iour of the ""ordinary
person"" in Wright v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 335. As Laycraft J.A.
has recently indicated in R. v. Daniels (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 542
(N.W.T.C.A.), at p. 551, such varying mental and emotional capacities or
personality traits, if attributed to the ""ordinary person"" and taken
into account by the jury in the first stage of the analysis of the provocation
defence, would ""denude the test of objectivity"". 

 

66.              The objective standard, therefore, may be
said to exist in order to ensure that in the evaluation of the provocation
defence there is no fluctuating standard of self‑control against which
accuseds are measured. The governing principles are those of equality and
individual responsibility, so that all persons are held to the same standard
notwithstanding their distinctive personality traits and varying capacities to
achieve the standard. The success of a provocation defence rests on
establishing the accused's act as one which any ordinary person might have done
in the circumstances and not upon eliciting the court's compassion for an
accused whose act was unjustified but who could not control himself in the way
expected of an ordinary person. It is evident that any deviation from this
objective standard against which an accused's level of self‑control is
measured necessarily introduces an element of inequality in the way in which
the actions of different persons are evaluated and must therefore be avoided if
the underlying principle that all persons are equally responsible for their
actions is to be maintained.

 

67.              A more difficult problem arises when the
question is whether the physical attributes of the accused can be considered
and incorporated into the objective standard. This has been a somewhat
vexatious question on which the English and Canadian authorities are divided.
In Bedder v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1119
(H.L.), it was held that purely physical peculiarities of the accused could not
be taken into account by the jury in applying the objective test to the
accused's behaviour. The accused in that case was a sexually impotent man who
was jeered at by a prostitute when he was unable to have sexual intercourse
with her. The House of Lords reasoned that sexual impotency was not an ailment
suffered by the ""ordinary person"" and that as such it could not be
considered in any objective assessment of the accused's reaction to the
victim's taunt. A similar line of reasoning was pursued by Culliton C.J.S. in R.
v. Parnerkar (1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 11 (Sask. C.A.), and affirmed by Fauteux
C.J. in Parnerkar v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449. In that case the
ethnic background of the accused was rejected as a factor that could be taken
into account in the objective stage of the provocation defence. The accused was
a black man who was subjected to a racial slur by a woman with whom he had a
long standing relationship and whom he desired to marry. Culliton C.J.S.
indicated (at p. 27) that although the derogatory use of the word
""black"" might have particular significance to the accused due to his
ethnic affiliation, it cannot be said that such an expression was one that
would deprive an ""ordinary person"" of the power of self‑control.


 

68.              These cases may be contrasted with the
decision of the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin,
[1978] A.C. 705, in which the age of the accused was held to be a factor that
could be taken into consideration. As in the case at bar, the accused Camplin
was a male youth who had been victimized by a homosexual assault. He was
subsequently laughed at by his assailant, at which point he lost his power of self‑control
and unleashed a mortal blow with a chapati pan. Lord Diplock indicated that the
age of the accused could be taken into account by the jury by attributing this
characteristic to the ""ordinary person"". In doing so, he expressly
indicated, at p. 717, that age could be considered by the jury for two distinct
purposes, namely (1) for the purpose of ""assessing the gravity of the
provocation addressed to the accused"" and (2) for the purpose of
""determining what is the degree of self‑control to be expected of
the ordinary person with whom the accused's conduct is to be compared"". In
other words, Camplin would allow a particular physical attribute such as
the accused's age to be taken into account for the purpose of evaluating the
gravity of the provocation. It would also allow particular mental attributes or
personality traits such as the accused's immaturity to be taken into account
for the purpose of determining the standard of self‑control against which
his conduct is to be measured. The former holding undermines the Bedder
and Parnerkar line of cases, whereas the latter reasoning tends to
undermine the objectivity of the ""ordinary person"" standard as
expressed in Lesbini, Salamon and Wright.

 

69.              The problem with the Bedder and Parnerkar
line of cases, as I see it, is that they seem to assume that provocative
insults occur in a vacuum and that therefore no facts pertinent to the
individual accused need be taken into account in assessing the reaction to an
insult. This, however, does not conform to reality since an insulting remark or
gesture has to be placed in context before the extent of its provocativeness
can be realistically assessed. As Lord Diplock expressed it in Camplin, supra,
at p. 717:

 

To taunt a person because
of his race, his physical infirmities or some shameful incident in his past may
well be considered by the jury to be more offensive to the person addressed,
however equable his temperament, if the facts on which the taunt is founded are
true than it would be if they were not. It would stultify much of the
mitigation of the previous harshness of the common law in ruling out verbal
provocation as capable of reducing murder to manslaughter if the jury could not
take into consideration all those factors which in their opinion would affect
the gravity of taunts or insults when applied to the person whom they are
addressed.

 

A racial insult directed at a member of the slandered group will
clearly sting much more than it would if directed at the ""ordinary
person"" who is not a member of the group. In Daniels, supra,
for example, where the accused was a woman who stabbed her husband's mistress
during a verbal altercation, the jury obviously must take into account the
factual context to the extent of recognizing that the accused's marriage had
been broken up by the victim even though, following the reasoning in Bedder
and Parnerkar, one could say that the ""ordinary person"" was
not married to Mr. Daniels and would therefore not be similarly affected by a
verbal slight from his mistress. 

 

70.              It seems apparent that certain attributes
of the accused and his or her circumstances must be taken into account, be they
features of the accused's life, elements of his culture or physical features to
which the particular insult was addressed. This use of the accused's attributes
does not, in my view, undermine the objective standard because it is done
purely for the purpose of putting the insult into context and assessing its
gravity. A certain type of jeer or derisive remark may mean something to a
teenager and be meaningless to an adult. The insult to the accused in Parnerkar
would only be perceived as an insult by a jury cognizant of the accused's race.
The objective standard and its underlying principles of equality and individual
responsibility are not, in my opinion, undermined when such factors are taken
into account only for the purpose of putting the provocative insult into
context.

 

71.              By way of contrast, it would certainly
undermine the principle of equality if the jury in Par­nerkar were
instructed to evaluate the accused in accordance with a standard of behaviour
peculiar to his race. Whereas it is permissible to take into account factors
such as the ethnic identity, language or physical infirmity of an accused for
the purpose of giving the insult context, it would violate the principle of
equality to assert that the reaction of a person of a certain ethnic or
linguistic group to an insulting remark must be measured against a different
standard from that applicable to others. Likewise, it would undermine the
principle of individual responsibility if the jury in Bedder were
instructed to fashion a special standard of behaviour against which to measure
the actions of a person with his particular physical disability. Thus, impotent
men are not excused for having a lower provocation threshold than that expected
of ""ordinary"" people but rather are measured against the standard of
an ordinary person similarly situated and similarly insulted. The objective
standard applies to mental states rather than to attributes which simply go to
placing the insult in its proper context. Accordingly, the most appropriate
formulation of the objective standard in the first stage of the provocation
defence is that of the ordinary person similarly situated and similarly
insulted. The jury must be instructed to put themselves, as the embodiment of
the ordinary person, in the accused's shoes to the extent that they perceive
themselves as confronted with a remark that has the same insulting effect on
them as the actual remark had on the accused. 

 

72.              This formulation, it will be noted,
represents a modified version of the Camplin rule. As indicated earlier,
Lord Diplock allowed the age of the accused to be incorporated as an attribute
of the ""ordinary person"" not only for the purpose of giving the
insult context but also for the purpose of establishing the standard of self‑control
against which the youthful defendant should be measured. He specifically
formulated this exception to the objective standard as an excuse premised on
the sympathy which the courts must show for an accused who cannot meet the
requisite standard of self‑control when the usual objective standard is
applied. In Lord Diplock's reknowned phraseology (at p. 717): ""But to
require old heads upon young shoulders is inconsistent with the law's
compassion to human infirmity...."" It is evident that this reasoning
cannot be stated as a universally applicable principle since the special
treatment accorded an accused who for some reason evokes the court's compassion
necessarily embodies a violation of the underlying principles of equality and
individual responsibility.

 

73.              The respondent in the case at bar urges
that the jury be permitted to take account of both his age and sex in assessing
his reaction to the deceased's unwanted sexual advances. The question to be
addressed, therefore, is whether these are physical factors going to the
context of the insult or factors going to the accused's subjective mental
state.

 

(a) Age

 

74.              I believe the respondent is arguing that
his age is directly related to his mental state in that his response to the
offensive sexual advances was that of an immature person. Thus, in effect, he
is stating that sixteen year olds cannot be held to the same level of self‑control
as can the ""ordinary person"" who is several years older. He is asking
that youthful accused persons be treated unequally and not be held responsible
for their actions in the same way as older accused persons. Is there any reason
in policy or principle to except age from the foregoing analysis and permit the
youth of an accused to govern the standard of self‑control expected of
him or her? 

 

75.              The policy of the law seems to be somewhat
equivocal on this question. Age is identified as a prohibited ground of
discrimination in s. 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
evidencing that in some fundamental sense persons of all ages enjoy the same
legal rights and have assumed the same legal responsibilities in society. On
the other hand, the legal system has traditionally differentiated between
children and adults to the extent that children may be denied the right to
vote, to drink alcoholic beverages, etc. Indeed, this Court has held that the
right to equality before the law in the Canadian Bill of Rights is not
violated by different penalties for criminal offences being imposed on youthful
offenders from those imposed on their adult counterparts: R. v. Burnshine,
[1975] 1 S.C.R. 693. This position may be contrasted with the interpretation
given to equality rights in R. v. Drybones, [1970] S.C.R. 282, where it
was held that such differentiations are impermissible as between different
ethnic groups.

 

76.              This legal recognition of only partial
rights and responsibilities invested in children is usually found in
legislation and can often be attributed to policy considerations designed to
ensure the protection of young people from their own actions and the actions of
others or to protect others from the actions of young people. Such statutory
measures as the prohibition of underage drinking, child labour laws establishing
minimum ages for full‑time employment, and licensing requirements
restricting the operation of motor vehicles to persons over a certain age may
be said to fit into this category. In addition, however, one finds indications
in the law that the attribution of only partial rights to children goes beyond
the legislative policy of the day and represents a principle upon which a great
deal of common law thinking has been based. For example, from very early times
the common law has deemed children as lacking the capacity to contract: Wittingham
v. Hill (1619), Cro. Jac. 494; 79 E.R. 421. Similarly, the standard of care
in negligence has been adjusted so that a child will not be measured against
the same objective standard as an adult: McEllistrum v. Etches, [1956]
S.C.R. 787. Thus, in a variety of different contexts, the law has recognized a
general incapacity in children to act in a fully rational and responsible
manner and has accordingly refrained from the rigorous application to them of
the principles of equality and individual responsibility applied to adults. 

 

77.              Concern over the legal responsibility of
children for their actions has to some extent been addressed by Parliament in
the Young Offenders Act, 1980‑81‑82‑83, (Can.), c.
110. Persons under certain specified ages who are charged with criminal
offences are removed from the usual adjudicative process and dealt with in
specially devised forums. The statute is silent, however, on how children are
to be treated who do not fall within its provisions for special procedures.
Specifically, it does not address the concern the law has always had over
holding young people, who for many purposes are not equal to adults in their
legal rights and responsibilities, to a standard of behaviour which embodies
this precise notion of equality of responsibility. Thus, the fact that some
children are by virtue of this legislation completely removed from the ordinary
processes of criminal justice does not answer the question how the actions of
young people who do come before the ordinary criminal courts are to be
evaluated.

 

78.              In my opinion, if the legal system is to
reflect accurately the view of children as being in the developmental stages en
route to full functioning capacity as adults, the standard against which
children's actions are measured must be such as can logically culminate in the
objective standard of the ordinary person upon their arrival at full adulthood.
In negligence law, for example, whereas an extremely young infant assumes
almost no legal liability for his or her actions (Walmsley v. Humenick, [1954]
2 D.L.R. 232 (B.C.S.C.)), older children are expected to conform to the
standard appropriate for ordinary children of the same age: see Fleming, The
Law of Torts (6th ed. 1983), pp. 107‑08. Accordingly, it has been
determined that the standard of care applicable to children is only partially
objective in that it must be adjusted incrementally in accordance with the age
of the child in question: McHale v. Watson (1966), 115 C.L.R. 199 (Aust.
H.C.) At some point, of course, there must be a cut‑off so that the fully
objective standard of the ordinary person can operate. Until this point is
reached it stands to reason that the reduced legal standard of responsibility
to which children are held is reflected in the semi‑objective standard of
the ordinary thirteen year old, fourteen year old, etc.

 

79.              Applying this reasoning to the case at
bar, the standard of the ordinary person applicable to adults raising the
provocation defence must be adjusted to an incremental scale reflecting the
reduced responsibility of the young accused. The measure of self‑control
properly applicable to the respondent, therefore, is that of the ordinary
sixteen year old. This is not, however, conceptually premised on what Lord
Diplock refers to as the law's ""compassion for human infirmity"" since
such compassion, in my view, finds its proper place only in the sentencing
process. Rather, the incorporation of the accused's age into the objective
""ordinary person"" standard is an attempt to reflect the extent of the
legal rights and responsibilities of children in the legal system. The law
treats all persons as equal members of society and holds them responsible on an
equal basis for their actions except to the extent that they are in a
developmental stage en route to achieving full adulthood and full legal rights
and duties. This process of maturation into fully responsible actors in the
legal system is reflected in the incrementally adjusted measure of legal
responsibility accorded to the actions of youthful accuseds. 

 

(b) Sex

 

80.              The submission based on the sex of the
accused is somewhat different. It is not argued that persons of different sex
should be held to different standards of self‑control. This would clearly
be unacceptable. The submission rather is that the sex of the accused may be
considered for the purpose of putting the wrongful act or insult into context
and, as Lord Diplock expressed it in Camplin, ""assessing the
gravity of the provocation addressed to the accused"". It seems to me that
if the objective test is, as I have concluded, the ""ordinary person""
similarly situated and similarly insulted, then the fact that the victim of the
sexual assault, the accused, is a male and that the attack is a homosexual one
may properly be considered.

 

4. Conclusions

 

81.              (1) In general, particular characteristics
of the individual accused and the circumstances in which the accused is found can
be taken into account in applying the objective ""ordinary person""
test at the first stage of the provocation defence only for the purpose of
placing the wrongful act or insult in its proper context with a view to
assessing its gravity. The underlying principles of equality and individual
responsibility cannot be undermined by importing the accused's subjective level
of self­control into the ""ordinary person"" test set out in s. 215(2) 
of the Criminal Code . The jury must be directed to consider any facts which
make the wrongful act or insult comprehensible to them in the same way as it
was comprehended by the accused and then, having appreciated the factual
context in which the wrongful act or insult took place, must measure the
accused's response to this insult against the objective standard of the
ordinary person similarly situated and similarly insulted.

 

82.              (2) The Ontario Court of Appeal was
correct in identifying the young age of the respondent as a special factor
which can be incorporated into the ""ordinary person"" standard. This
reduction in the standard against which young accused persons are measured
merely reflects the fact that the law does not attribute to individuals in the
developmental stage of their youth the same degree of responsibility as is
attributed to fully adult actors. This developmental process is properly
embodied in an incrementally adjusted formulation of the ""ordinary
person"" test in accordance with the age of the accused. In this way the
basic principles of equality and individual responsibility are embodied in the
test to an extent commensurate with the age and capacities of the accused.

 

83.              (3) The Court of Appeal was also correct
in holding that the sex of the respondent could be considered on the objective
test, not because different standards of self‑control are attributable to
the two sexes, but in order to put the wrongful act or insult into context for
purposes of assessing its gravity. In assessing the reaction of the ordinary
person to a sexual assault it is the ordinary person who is a male subjected to
a homosexual assault which must be considered.

 

84.              In summary, the appropriate formulation of
the objective standard against which the respondent's reaction to the wrongful
act must be measured in this case is the standard of the ordinary sixteen year
old male subjected to a homosexual assault. The jury may well, on the basis of
the judge's charge and having regard to the existing state of the jurisprudence
in Canada, have rejected the respondent's defence because they measured his
conduct against a higher standard. I agree with the Court of Appeal that in
these circumstances the conviction cannot be allowed to stand.

 

85.              I would dismiss the appeal. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

86.              Le
Dain J. (dissenting)‑‑I would dismiss the appeal on
the ground that the youth of the accused was relevant to the consideration by
the jury whether there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to
be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control
and that the trial judge's charge to the jury was calculated to lead the jury
to conclude that they should not consider the age of the accused with reference
to this requirement of s. 215(2)  of the Criminal Code  but only with reference
to the requirement that the accused acted upon the provocation on the sudden
and before there was time for his passion to cool.

 

87.              In my opinion the age of the accused is
relevant in a case such as this to the standard of self‑control of the
ordinary person rather than to the gravity of the provocation. With respect,
this appears to me to have been the view of Lord Diplock in Director of
Public Prosecutions v. Camplin, [1978] A.C. 705. I think this appears
clearly from Lord Diplock's use of the words ""power of self‑control""
and ""standard of self‑control"" in association with the age of
the accused on pp. 717‑18, and particularly from what he said on p. 718
should be the judge's direction to the jury: ""He should then explain to
them that the reasonable man referred to in the question is a person having the
power of self‑control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and
age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's
characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to
him..."". I am content, with great respect, to accept the rationale
or justification suggested by Lord Diplock for regarding the youth of an
accused as relevant to the standard of self‑control of the ordinary
person.

 

88.              I agree, however, with Wilson J. that sex
is not relevant to the standard of self­control of the ordinary person, but it
was obviously relevant in this case to the nature and gravity of the
provocation claimed by the accused. 

 

89.              My colleagues have quoted the relevant
passages in the trial judge's charge to the jury. The critical words for
purposes of the issue in the appeal are those which appear in the direction
with reference to the requirement that the accused must have acted upon the
provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool.
After telling the jury that they must first decide whether the words and acts
""were sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his self‑control"",
the trial judge said: ""If you find that they were, you will then secondly
consider whether the accused acted on the provocation on the sudden before
there was time for his passion to cool. In deciding this question you are not
restricted to the standard of the ordinary person. You will take into account
the mental, the emotional, the physical characteristics and the age of this
accused."" With great respect for what the Chief Justice has said with
reference to the common sense of the average jury, I have been unable to avoid
the conclusion that it was a clear implication of this direction that the age of
the accused should not be taken into consideration in deciding whether there
had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control. The further
reference to age in a later passage of the charge (which, because of what
preceded it, must be regarded as also related to the requirement that the
accused must have acted upon the provocation on the sudden and before there was
time for his passion to cool), could only serve to reinforce this impression,
or at the very least to leave the jury with some confusion as to the relevance
of age. This in my opinion is sufficient for the disposition of the appeal. It
is one thing to consider whether the trial judge was required to make any
reference to the relevance of the age of the accused in his charge to the jury;
it is another thing to consider whether the reference which he did in fact make
was misleading.

 

90.              As to what, if anything, the trial judge
was required to say concerning the age and sex of the accused, I am inclined on
the whole to agree with the Chief Justice, with some reservation concerning the
question of age. The sex of the accused and its relevance to the gravity of the
provocation claimed were, of course, obvious and did not require any
observation from the trial judge. The relative youth of the accused would also
presumably be obvious, but its relevance as a matter of law to the question
whether there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control
might be less obvious to a jury and should probably have been drawn to their
attention.

 

91.              For these reasons I would dismiss the
appeal.

offences ‑‑ Uttering forged document ‑‑ Charges not
proven ‑‑ Fictitious bills for fees not used as genuine documents ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, ss. 324(1), 326.

 

                   Ciment Québec Inc. obtained from the Provincial Bank
the financing needed to carry on its operation. To thank a Mr. Doyon, the Bank
employee who handled the matter, the president of the company decided to pay
him $3,000 annually for three years. The payments were made through respondent,
a lawyer and son‑in‑law of Doyon, who made up fictitious bills for
fees to the company. Respondent cashed the cheques issued by the company,
deducted a certain amount for income tax purposes and handed the remainder of
the money over to his father‑in‑law. Respondent was charged with
fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, forgery and uttering forged documents and
was acquitted on all the charges by a judge of the Court of Sessions of the
Peace. The appeal by the Crown on the three counts of uttering forged documents
was dismissed.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   Even assuming the bills prepared by respondent are
forged documents within the meaning of s. 326  of the Criminal Code ,
respondent did nothing beyond preparing or conspiring to utter them. Nothing in
the evidence showed that he uttered or dealt with the fictitious bills as
genuine documents. Acts in preparation for uttering do not constitute acts of
uttering.

J.‑‑Jean Valois was charged in Quebec City with a total of
twelve counts, namely, conspiracy to commit fraud, fraud, forgery and uttering
forged documents on the basis of the facts related below. He was acquitted of
all these charges by Lanctôt J. of the Court of Sessions of the Peace. The
Crown appealed the acquittal on only three of the counts, the three counts of
uttering forged documents. Though these three counts referred to three
transactions which occurred on different dates, the charges were essentially
the same, namely

 

[TRANSLATION]  ... knowing
that a document was forged, namely a bill for $3,000 ... addressed to Ciment
Québec Inc., did unlawfully use it as if it were genuine, thereby committing an
indictable offence under s. 326(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

The appeal was unanimously dismissed by the Quebec Court of Appeal (1983),

would dismiss this appeal.

 

Facts

 

2.                Bisson J.A., writing the reasons of the
Court of Appeal, summarized the facts as follows at pp. 168‑69:

 

                    [TRANSLATION] 
Ciment Québec Inc. experienced financial difficulties between 1965 and 1969 as
a result of the lack of working capital of one of its subsidiaries.

 

                    Ciment
Québec Inc. was dealing with the Provincial Bank, and Grégoire Doyon was one of
the latter's managers.

 

                    Grégoire
Doyon took an interest in their file and obtained financing from his bank which
put Ciment Québec back on its feet.

 

                    Gustave
Papillon, the president, directing mind and holder of the vast majority of
shares in Ciment Québec Inc., appreciated Doyon's help and decided to reward
him by paying him $3,000 a year for three years.

 

                    However,
it was preferable not to make the payments directly to Doyon by Ciment Québec,
and it was agreed that they would be made through the respondent, a young
lawyer admitted to the Bar in November 1975, and the son‑in‑law of
Doyon, who made up fictitious bills for fees to Ciment Québec.

 

                    Thus,
$3,000 was paid in each of the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.

 

                    As
respondent had to pay tax on this income, after cashing the cheques he kept
part to cover the additional tax he would have to pay and handed the remainder
over to his father‑in‑law.

 

                    Grégoire
Doyon of course received less than $9,000 as a result of these deductions, a
fact to which, noted the judge, no one raised any objection.

 

                    The
judge made another observation. The payments made to Grégoire Doyon were
legitimate and caused no prejudice to Ciment Québec. In addition, the three
participants were aware of the purpose of the lawyer's bills, and therefore no
one was misled into believing that they were genuine documents.

 

3.                Sections 324(1)  and 326(1)  of the Criminal
Code  are the applicable provisions in the case at bar:

 

                   324. (1) Every one commits forgery who makes a false document, knowing it
to be false, with intent

 

 (a) that it should
in any way be used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice of any one
whether within Canada or not, or

 

 (b) that some
person should be induced, by the belief that it is genuine, to do or to refrain
from doing anything, whether within Canada or not.

 

                   326. (1) Every one who, knowing that a document is forged,

 

(a) uses, deals
with, or acts upon it, or

 

(b) causes or
attempts to cause any person to use, deal with, or act upon it,

 

as if the document were
genuine, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
fourteen years.

 

Judgments

 

4.                The judgment of the Court of Appeal
dealt primarily with the question of whether, to be a forgery within the
meaning of s. 326 of the Code, a document must meet the substantive
requirements of s. 324(1) of the Code, or whether it need only be a
false document in the literal meaning of the word. The essence of the Court of
Appeal's judgment is to be found in the following passage from the reasons of
Bisson J.A., at p. 172:

 

                    [TRANSLATION] 
Appellant wanted us to interpret s. 326  as if it simply read ""false
document"" rather than ""forged document"".

 

                    I
cannot agree with appellant's proposition that simply because a document is
false it constitutes a forged document within the meaning of s. 326 .

 

                    For
the bills to be regarded as forged documents within the meaning of s. 326 , the
evidence must establish all the essential components of s. 324.

 

                    Thus,
although these were false documents which respondent knew to be
false, and which he intended to be acted upon as genuine, there was no proof of
an intention to cause prejudice.

 

                    In the
case at bar, since one of the essential components, namely the
""forged"" document as defined in s. 324 was absent, respondent was
properly acquitted.

 

5.                At trial Lanctôt J., after reviewing R.
v. Keshane (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 542 (Sask. C.A.) and R. v. Paquette
(1977), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 57 (Que. C.A.), rev'd [1979] 2 S.C.R. 168, regarding the
connection between ss. 324  and 326 , said:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
Despite the interest aroused by these two judgments, it is of very little
importance in the case at bar that the false bill has to be regarded as a false
document in the dictionary sense. We in fact know that it was not made to cause
prejudice. It was a false document nevertheless, and the accused was charged
with using it as if it were genuine.

 

                    But
what was the ultimate use of it?

 

                    It is
more realistic to think that this false bill was never used as if it were
genuine. On the contrary, it was used as if it were false. The three parties
principally involved in the matter deliberately decided to have it prepared and
used it as if it were false, not as if it were genuine. In this regard CIMENT
QUEBEC, a body corporate, acted through its representative Papillon.

 

                    Even
if by some stretch of the imagination it were to be regarded as having been
used as genuine, the fact remains that no one was injured by the deception.
Using a forgery as if it were an original assumes someone on whom the deception
is to be practised. There has to be a target. Who were the targets in this
case? ‑‑ the banking authorities? ‑‑ hardly, since with
respect to them the use of the false bill was latent. There was no evidence
that they ever saw the bill. The false bill was never seen by the Revenue
Department either, though the latter benefited from it.

 

                    While
it is true that there is nothing in s. 326  which expressly states that use of a
false document must cause prejudice to someone, the fact remains that someone,
even if not prejudiced, must be a witness to the deception, and it would be an
absurdity for such a witness to be one of the perpetrators of the forgery.

 

                    For
all these reasons, the Court finds that the accused did not make use of the
forgery, and he should be acquitted on all the counts relating to this charge.

 

6.                In my view Lanctôt J. was correct.
Though in different terms, he based his decision to acquit Valois on the counts
of uttering forged documents on the fact that, if indeed the bills were forged
within the meaning of s. 326 , the accused did nothing beyond preparing or
conspiring to utter them, and that there was nothing in the evidence to show
that he began uttering them or that he dealt with or acted upon them as genuine
documents in relation to anyone else.

 

7.                Indeed, the making of forged documents
by Valois (assuming for purposes of argument that these documents were in fact
forged), the fact of putting Mr. Papillon of Ciment Québec into possession, the
cashing and giving the money by the accused to his father‑in‑law in
the manner indicated, certainly all constitute substantive components of a conspiracy
to utter forged documents and to commit the offences on which the other charges
against the accused were based. However, in relation to the crime of uttering
or attempted uttering, these were only acts in preparation for uttering, and in
no way constitute acts of uttering or even incipient uttering. The accused, his
father‑in‑law and Papillon set up all that was necessary to use
these fictitious bills for fees as if they were genuine, if and when that
proved to be necessary. They did not have to do so; at least, the evidence did
not establish that they did. The acquittal by Lanctôt J. is therefore correct
and the appeal should be dismissed.

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Arrest without warrant ‑‑
Spatial limits ‑‑ Private home ‑‑ Extent of police
power to effect arrest without warrant in private home ‑‑ Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 450(1)(a).

 

                   A transit inspector saw two youths in a shopping
centre parking lot opening the driver's door of a truck and trying the doors of
cars. He called the police, gave them a description, and advised that they had
entered an apartment building. Two young men fitting the description were seen
by a constable through an apartment window. The constable stood at the doorway
of the apartment and subsequently tried to effect an arrest inside the
apartment in relation to an attempted car theft. An altercation occurred giving
rise to a charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty
contrary to s. 246(1)  of the Criminal Code . Respondent was acquitted, on
a directed verdict subsequently upheld by a majority of the Ontario Court of
Appeal because the arrest was found to be unlawful. At issue was whether a
peace officer, acting pursuant to s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal Code ,
can lawfully arrest a person on private premises.








 

                   Held (La Forest J.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Chouinard, Lamer and Wilson JJ.: If the criteria of s. 450(1)  of the Criminal
Code  and the standards enunciated in Eccles v. Bourque are met, a
police officer can make an arrest on private premises without a warrant in the
execution of his duty for the purposes of s. 450(1) (a). 

 

                   Section 450(1)  of the Criminal Code  does not
alter the common law principles with respect to spatial limits on arrest
without a warrant and the silence of the Code requires that the common
law apply. Eccles v. Bourque was not a case restricted to situations
where a warrant, albeit unendorsed, existed, but rather dealt with the power of
the police to arrest without warrant in private premises. The present case
falls to be decided by application of Eccles v. Bourque, just as Eccles
v. Bourque, on the view of the Court at that time, fell within the four
corners of the old common law authorities. The policy underlying the cases,
both older and more recent, is clear and compelling: there should be no place
which gives an offender sanctuary from arrest. Although the Criminal Code 
provides for warrants for the search of things, it does not provide for
the search of persons. Absent the power of police to arrest on private
premises, a criminal offender might therefore find complete and permanent
protection from the law in a private home.

 

                   Parliament took for granted the common law power of
forcible entry to effect an arrest. While the courts can decline to confer new
common law powers intruding on civil liberties‑‑and this Court has
been cautious in conferring those powers‑‑it is quite another thing
for the Court to abrogate powers recognized by the courts, particularly when
those powers descend from entrenched authorities of the 17th century.

 

                   The right of entry to search for an offender is not
unrestricted. This Court held in Eccles v. Bourque that entry could only
be made against the will of a householder if: (1) there were reasonable and
probable grounds for the belief that the person sought was within the premises,
and (2) if proper announcement was made prior to entry. Proper announcement
would ordinarily entail the police giving (i) notice of presence, (ii) notice
of authority by identifying themselves as police officers, and (iii) notice of
purpose by stating lawful reasons for entry. These requirements minimize the
invasiveness of arrest in a dwelling and permit the offender to maintain his
dignity and privacy by walking to the doorway and surrendering himself.

 

                   There is good reason to stand by the common law
authorities in lieu of adopting a new rule requiring the police to obtain an
arrest warrant in order to make an arrest in residential premises. If a police
officer is forced to obtain an arrest warrant before entering a residence, he
will first have to attempt to obtain the name of the offender from the
neighbours. In many cases the neighbours will be unable to supply this
information. Even if he obtains the offender's name, the police officer will
then have to seek a justice of the peace to execute a warrant. Valuable time‑‑and
probably the offender‑‑will be lost. 

 

                   The specific concerns relating to arrests within a dwelling
are met as fully as they can be, without unduly impinging an effective crime
control, by the special requirements imposed on peace officers who must make
arrests in a house or apartment.

 

                   An affirmative answer to all of the following
questions means the arrest is lawful:

 

(1)               Is
the offence in question indictable?

 

(2)               Has
the person who is the subject of arrest committed the offence or does the peace
officer believe on reasonable and probable grounds that that person has
committed or is about to commit the offence in question?

 

(3)               Are
there reasonable and probable grounds for belief that the person sought is
within the premises?

 

(4)               Was
proper announcement made before entry?

 

                   This case arose before the Charter was in
effect. Furthermore, no determination was made on the nature and scope of the
spatial limits of arrest without warrant under any section or subsection other
than s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey and
McIntyre JJ.: The ancient principle in Semayne's Case, ""That the
house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his
defence against injury and violence, as for his repose"", must yield to the
legitimate requirements of law enforcement. Eccles v. Bourque
established that a peace officer has authority at common law to enter private
premises to effect an arrest without warrant pursuant to s. 450(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code . The Court required that the peace officer must have
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an indictable offence has been
or is about to be committed and that the person sought is on the private
premises, and must make a proper announcement of his presence and purpose
before entering.

 

                   Per Le Dain J.: The
authority of a police officer to enter private premises without the consent of
the occupant in order to effect an arrest without warrant was affirmed, with
the conditions on which it may be exercised, in Eccles v. Bourque and there
are sound reasons for adhering to that decision. Notwithstanding concurrence
with Dickson C.J., the distinction drawn by him with reference to the judgments
of the majority in Wiretap Reference, Lyons v. The Queen and Dedman
v. The Queen, was not necessarily subscribed to. 

 

                   Per La Forest J., dissenting:
The principle that a man's home is his castle along with the demonstrably
justifiable exceptions developed under the old common law have constituted an
excellent balance between the security and privacy of the individual and the
needs of law enforcement since their enunciation in Semayne's Case. If
Parliament finds it necessary to adjust the balance, it can do so. It is in a
far better position to provide for the precise balance than the courts.

 

                   At common law, the better view has been until
recently that entry into private dwellings without a warrant was not permitted
to effect an arrest apart from hot pursuit and some narrow exceptions to
prevent the commission of an offence. Although the police power was extended to
include going on private property, other than dwellings, in the exercise of
their duty to preserve the peace and to conduct investigations into crimes, no
significant change in the common law right of a policeman to enter a home took
place until Eccles v. Bourque.

 

                   Eccles v. Bourque
constituted an extension of the law by ignoring some of the requirements for
the arrest of a person against whom a warrant has been issued. But these in the
context may have been looked upon by the Court as technical omissions. Eccles
v. Bourque simply gave a restricted power to police officers to enter a
person's home when they reasonably believe a person for whom a warrant of
arrest has been issued is there. It should not be broadly interpreted so as to
authorize entry into a dwelling whenever the police believe on reasonable
grounds that a person has committed an offence and that he is in that dwelling.
They should obtain a warrant to permit them to do so.

 

                   Apart from flagrant abuses, the courts cannot exercise
much control over police discretion to arrest. So far as arrests in public
places are concerned, the police' job of maintaining the peace and enforcing
the criminal law is difficult enough without fearing about being regularly
""second guessed"" about every mistake of judgment. Apart from the
compelling exceptions allowed by the common law, it is not reasonable for a
policeman to be permitted to enter a private home without consent unless he has
a warrant authorizing him to do so. Invasion of a person's home, in
circumstances like these, is too high a price to pay to prevent the possible
escape of some criminals, especially for non‑violent crimes. 

 

                   Allowing arrest without warrant on private premises
has serious disadvantages: not only is the owner's security and privacy
invaded, violence can result. Again notwithstanding reasonable and probable
belief on the part of police that an offence has occurred, no offence may have
been committed at all. Since it is essential for police to have the support of
the community, it would be unwise to place them in a situation where they are
called upon to breach the sanctity of the home in such circumstances. Moreover,
the grant of such a vague discretion is more likely to be used against the
economically or socially disadvantaged.

 

                   The grant of wide, vague and virtually
uncontrollable discretion to the police here would create a greater danger to
the sanctity of the home than the danger that criminals would otherwise escape.
It would amount to giving the police an almost unfettered discretion to break
into a home by day or night whenever they seriously suspect an indictable
offence has been committed and that the perpetrator is there. It is highly
unlikely that a house would become a permanent sanctuary for a criminal because
of the want of search warrants for persons, as opposed to things. Parliament,
however, can provide for search warrants for people if it thinks this
desirable. Finally, good police work can easily overcome resultant problems in
most cases. It is doubtful that law enforcement has suffered because the police
have not been authorized, the narrow common law exceptions apart, to enter a
private home. On the other hand, on the basis of limited experience with
entries into homes without warrant, mistakes are inevitable.

 

                   The police need the clearest possible rules in
situations like the present. The current rule is clear: absent well recognized
and widely supported exceptions, the police may not enter private homes. Their
authority ends at the door.

for the respondent. 

 

                   The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Chouinard, Lamer
and Wilson JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal of
Ontario which dismissed an appeal from a directed verdict at trial. The issue
is whether a peace officer, acting pursuant to s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code , can lawfully arrest a person on private premises.

 

Facts

 

2.                Paul Landry was charged with assaulting
a peace officer engaged in the execution of his duty, contrary to s. 246(1)  of
the Criminal Code . The following summary of the facts is based on the
testimony of the witnesses. No findings of fact were made at trial as the trial
judge directed a verdict of acquittal.

 

3.                On the evening of April 20, 1980 a
public transit inspector observed two youths opening the driver's side of a
parked truck and then trying to open car doors in a parking lot at the back of
a shopping centre. He called the police on his radio. When the police arrived
he gave them descriptions of the youths and advised them that he had seen the
youths enter an apartment building. One of the police officers, Constable
Handy, went to the front of the apartment building.

 

4.                Constable Handy testified that as he
approached the front door of the apartment building, he looked through the
window of the basement apartment and saw two male persons who matched the description
given to him by the transit inspector. He entered the building and walked down
the stairs to the basement apartment. According to his testimony, the door to
the apartment was open. The testimony of Landry and MacLaren (the second youth)
differs from that of Constable Handy on this point. Landry testified that the
door was closed and the officer knocked on it. Similarly, MacLaren testified
that the officer knocked on the door and the door was answered by Landry. It is
clear from the testimony of all three parties that Constable Handy stood in the
doorway of the apartment and asked Landry if he lived there. Constable Handy
testified that Landry replied in an offensive manner. 

 

5.                Constable Handy was in uniform at the
time. He testified that he told the two youths they were under arrest for
investigation of attempted auto theft. MacLaren testified that, initially,
Constable Handy said only ""you are under arrest"" and did not state
why until asked by MacLaren. Landry then indicated he did not want to go to the
police station and both youths stated they had not done anything. Constable
Handy walked into the room and stood quite close to them. When MacLaren took
some steps toward the open door, Constable Handy took physical control of him
by holding the sleeve of his jacket. Landry repeated several times that he was
not going anywhere, so Constable Handy grabbed him with the other hand. An
altercation ensued which gave rise to the present charge.

Judgments

 

(a) Trial

 

6.                Following the hearing of the evidence
and legal argument, the County Court judge ruled that an arrest without a
warrant in the home of the accused was unlawful, except in circumstances of hot
pursuit. Accordingly, he instructed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty,
and concluded:

 

...I have come to the
conclusion, based on the existing law, that when officer Handy entered the
home, the apartment, without permission and without a warrant, he was not in
the execution of his duty. He was exceeding his powers. He was exceeding his
right and therefore the accused had a right to resist and that, as you can see,
removes all necessity of making findings of fact as to who did what, who
started, what kind of force was used and so on.

 

                   The
plain fact of the matter is that the arrest was not lawful. It is not say that
the officer acted wrongly in a general sense, but in the legal sense, if he did
not have a warrant the arrest was not a lawful arrest and I must direct you
that it was unlawful and if it was unlawful the accused was not committing an
offence when he resisted.

 

Landry was accordingly acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace
officer in the execution of his duty.

 

(b) Court of Appeal

 

7.                The Crown appealed the decision of the
County Court and the appeal was dismissed by a majority in the Ontario Court of
Appeal. Houlden J.A., with Thorson J.A. concurring, found that, though s.
450(1)(a) of the Criminel Code empowers a peace officer to arrest
without warrant a person whom he believes, on reasonable and probable grounds,
has committed an indictable offence, there are certain spatial limits on this
power, imposed by common law and preserved by s. 7 of the Criminel Code.
According to the majority, there is no common law authority to render lawful an
arrest by a police officer without a warrant on private premises when the
officer enters the premises without permission. In the present case, Constable
Handy entered the premises without permission or even acquiescence. He was,
therefore, not in the execution of his duty. 

 

8.                Jessup J.A. would have allowed the
appeal. He found that at common law a citizen could deny entry to his home to a
peace officer without warrant and use any requisite force in doing so. If
Constable Handy was a trespasser, he would have been acting unlawfully at the
time of the arrest and, thus, could not be said to be in the execution of his
duty. On the facts, however, Jessup J.A. found that Constable Handy was not a
trespasser, but that he entered the apartment as a licensee. Though the assault
by Landry may have amounted to a retraction of the licence, by the time of the
assault the officer was in the execution of his duty.

 

                                                                   III

 

The Law

 

(a) Criminal Code 

 

9.                The power of a peace officer to arrest
without a warrant for an indictable offence is found in s. 450(1)  of the Criminal
Code :

 

                   450. (1) A peace officer may arrest without warrant 

 

(a) a person who
has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable and probable grounds,
he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence,

 

(b) a person whom
he finds committing a criminal offence, or

 

(c) a person for
whose arrest he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a warrant
is in force within the territorial jurisdiction in which the person is found.

 

The Ontario Court of Appeal was unanimous in finding that it would have
been open to a jury to conclude that Constable Handy had reasonable and
probable grounds to believe Landry and MacLaren had committed the indictable
offence of attempted theft for the purpose of s. 450(1) (a).

 

10.              What must be determined, however, is
whether, assuming that Constable Handy had reasonable and probable grounds,
there were any spatial limits on his power to arrest. Section 450(1) (a)
is silent on the matter of whether an arrest without a warrant is lawful on
private premises, and there are no other provisions which provide express
statutory authority on this matter. 

 

11.              I agree with Jessup J.A. in the Court of
Appeal that s. 450(1)  should not be taken to alter the common law principles
with respect to spatial limits on arrest without a warrant and that the silence
of the Code on this matter requires that we turn to the common law for
direction. As the Court stated in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R.
739, at p. 742, ""If they [the police constables] were authorized by law to
commit a trespass, the authority for it must be found in the common law for
there is nothing in the Criminal Code "".

 

(b) Eccles v. Bourque and Recent Related Cases

 

12.              Eccles v. Bourque though a civil
case, dealt with the powers of arrest without a warrant on private premises.
The case arose out of a claim by the appellant against three constables on the
Vancouver Police Force for damages for trespass. The constables had entered the
Vancouver apartment of Mr. Eccles in order to apprehend one Edmund Cheese, for
whom there were three outstanding Montreal warrants of arrest. These warrants
had not been endorsed in the Province of British Columbia. Furthermore, they
were not search warrants and, therefore, they did not provide a right to enter
premises. Cheese was not found in the apartment and the trial judge concluded
that either he had not been there, or he had successfully escaped just prior to
the arrival of the police officers. The trial judge awarded $300 damages and
costs. The judgment was reversed by a majority (Robertson and Taggart JJ.A.,
with Nemetz J.A. [as he then was] dissenting) of the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia.

 

13.              This Court was unanimous in dismissing the
appeal. Since the Montreal warrants had not been endorsed in the province of
British Columbia, pursuant to s. 461  of the Criminal Code, s. 450(1) (a)
was applied. The Court held that, had Cheese been found and arrested, the
requirements of s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  would have been
met (at pp. 741‑42):

 

There were reasonable and
probable grounds for believing that Cheese had committed a criminal offence and
had the respondents found him in the apartment or elsewhere there is no doubt
they would have been authorized by s. 450(1) (a) to arrest him.

 

Section 450(1) (a) did not, however, provide any guidance on the
question of whether a peace officer was justified in committing a trespass in
order to make an arrest, and that was the issue which had to be resolved. It
was thus necessary to turn to the principles of the common law. 

 

14.              The Court summarized the relevant
principles of the common law at pp. 742‑43:

 

For these principles, we
go back to vintage common law, to 1604, and Semayne’s Case, in which the
principle, so firmly entrenched in our jurisprudence, that every man's house is
his castle, was expressed in these words: ""That the house of every one is
to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and
violence, as for his repose ..."". That, then, is the basic principle, as
important today as in Biblical times (Deuteronomy 24:10) or in the 17th
century. But there are occasions when the interest of a private individual in
the security of his house must yield to the public interest, when the public at
large has an interest in the process to be executed. The criminal is not immune
from arrest in his own home nor in the home of one of his friends. So it is
that in Semayne's Case a limitation was put on the ""castle""
concept and the Court resolved that:

 

                   In all
cases when the King is party, the Sheriff (if the doors be not open) may break
the party's house, either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the K.'s
process, if otherwise he cannot enter. But before he breaks it, he ought to
signify the cause of his coming, and to make request to open doors ...

 

See also, a century later,
to the same effect, Hale, Pleas of the Crown (1736), 582; Foster, Crown
Law (1762), 320. Thus it will be seen that the broad basic principle of
sanctity of the home is subject to the exception that upon proper demand the
officials of the King may break down doors to arrest.

 

15.              The Court made it clear that the right of
entry in search of an offender was not unrestricted. Entry could be made
against the will of the householder only if (i) there were reasonable and
probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within the premises
and (ii) proper announcement is made prior to entry (at p. 744). With respect
to the latter of these, the Court said (at p. 747):

 

The traditional demand was
""Open in the name of the King"". In the ordinary case police officers,
before forcing entry, should give (i) notice of presence by knocking or ringing
the doorbell, (ii) notice of authority, by identifying themselves as law
enforcement officers and (iii) notice of purpose, by stating a lawful reason
for entry. Minimally they should request admission and have admission denied
although it is recognized there will be occasions on which, for example, to
save someone within the premises from death or injury or to prevent destruction
of evidence or if in hot pursuit notice may not be required.

 

On the facts of Eccles, the requirements were met and the appeal
was dismissed.

 

16.              In Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1
S.C.R. 2, the principles of Eccles were discussed. The appellant was
charged with attempted murder and attempting to cause bodily harm. He had
committed the alleged offences in response to what he deemed to be a wrongful
intrusion onto his property by police officers. The police officers had a
warrant to seize firearms issued under s. 105(1)  of the Criminal Code .
Ritchie J. at p. 9, speaking for the Court, found that ""the authority to
seize specified in that warrant [did not] carry with it the right to enter and
search"", and that ""it would ... be dangerous indeed to hold that the
private rights of the individual to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property
are to be subject to invasion by police officers whenever they can be said to be
acting in the furtherance of the enforcement of any section of the Criminal
Code  although they are not armed with express authority to justify their
action."" 

 

17.              Eccles v. Bourque was distinguished
on the ground that it related only to arrest and not to seizure of goods on
private premises. Ritchie J. said (at pp. 8‑9):

 

The common law principle
has been firmly engrafted in our law since Semayne’s case in 1604 where
it was said ""That the house of everyone is to him as his castle and
fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence, as for his
repose ..."". This famous dictum was cited by my brother Dickson in the
case of Eccles v. Bourque in which he made an extensive review of many
of the relevant authorities. He was there dealing with a case of police
officers entering private property for the purpose of effecting an arrest and
in so doing he made reference to the limitation of the extent of the general
application of Semayne’s case at p. 743 saying:

 

But there are occasions
when the interest of a private individual in the security of his house must
yield to the public interest, when the public at large has an interest in the
process to be executed. The criminal is not immune from arrest in his
own home nor in the home of one of his friends.

 

And later on the same page
he observed:

 

Thus it will be seen that
the broad basic principle of sanctity of the home is subject to the exception
that upon proper demand the officials of the King may break down doors to
arrest.

 

The italics in the last
two quotations are my own.

 

                   This
makes it clear that Mr. Justice Dickson was limiting his remarks to occasions
when the house of the individual is entered against his will by police officers
in search of a fugitive from justice whose arrest they consider to be
justified.

 

18.              Both Ritchie J.'s judgment in Colet
and my judgment in Eccles v. Bourque refer to the exception to the
principle of the sanctity of the home which was approved by this Court in Eccles
v. Bourque as a general limitation which permits the police to enter
forcibly a dwelling‑house in order to effect an arrest. There is no
suggestion whatsoever in either Eccles v. Bourque or Colet that
the power of forcible entry is limited to occasions when a warrant has been
issued. On the contrary, both the facts and the reasoning in Eccles v.
Bourque demonstrate that the case was not treated as a case of arrest with
a warrant. Although there were warrants outstanding for Cheese, the warrants were
not endorsed in British Columbia and were therefore of no legal effect in that
province. The existence of the warrants was thus relevant for one purpose only:
it afforded evidence of the reasonable and probable grounds for the police
officer's belief that Cheese had committed an indictable offence. The Court
expressly referred to s. 450(1) (a) as the source of authority to arrest
Cheese and at no time suggested that s. 450(1) (c) offered any
assistance. The existence of the warrants was not perceived by the Court to be
relevant to the scope of the common law police power of forcible entry to
effect an arrest. 

 

19.              The Court in Eccles v. Bourque did
not consider its decision in that case to be an extension, but rather an
application, of the old common law power first described in an authoritative
manner in Semayne’s Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91 a, 77 E.R. 194. It is
plain from the excerpt from Eccles v. Bourque at pp. 742‑43,
quoted above, that the Court was simply reaffirming common law principles of
some considerable antiquity. The plain language in Semayne’s Case
authorizes the sheriff, in all cases when the King is a party, ""to break
the party's house ... to arrest him"", if the doors be not open. If this
authority were restricted by the judges to occasions of arrest with a warrant,
one would have expected Lord Coke to have said so in his report of the case. He
did not; this lends support to the view that Semayne’s Case conferred a
power of forcible entry incidental to arrests in general and not just to
arrests with a warrant.

 

20.              The policy underlying the cases, older and
more recent, on this issue, is clear and compelling: there should be no place
which gives an offender sanctuary from arrest. While the Criminal Code 
empowers a justice to issue a warrant, on proper grounds being shown,
authorizing a search for things, there is no power to issue a warrant to
search for a person. If the police did not possess the power to arrest
on private premises, then a criminal offender might find complete and permanent
protection from the law in his or her own home or the home of another.

 

21.              This compelling policy consideration
suggests that Parliament took for granted the common law power of forcible
entry to effect an arrest as originally articulated in Semayne’s Case
and reaffirmed in Eccles v. Bourque. It is one thing for the courts to
decline to confer new common law powers which intrude on civil liberties; it is
another thing altogether to abrogate powers which have already been recognized
by the courts, particularly when, as in the present case, those powers descend
from entrenched authorities of the seventeenth century. This Court has
exhibited a cautious approach to the conferral on the police of new common law
powers or implied statutory powers, although there has been something less than
unanimity amongst the members of the Court on this point: Colet, supra;
the Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697; Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633; and Dedman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2. The
present case is markedly different, however, since it falls to be decided by
application of Eccles v. Bourque, just as Eccles v. Bourque, on
the view of the Court at that time, fell within the four corners of the old
common law authorities. 

 

22.              There is, moreover, good reason to stand
by these authorities in lieu of adopting a new rule requiring the police to
obtain an arrest warrant in order to make an arrest in residential premises.
Crime is often committed adjacent to residential premises. When a police
officer witnesses a crime or appears on the scene shortly thereafter, his
ability to apprehend the offender should not be capable of being foiled by an
offender ducking into a nearby house or apartment building. Our society is more
urban, more mobile, and more anonymous than ever before. If a police officer is
forced to obtain an arrest warrant before entering a residence, he will have to
attempt to obtain the name of the offender from the neighbours. In many cases
the offender may have slipped into someone else's dwelling and the neighbours
will be unable to supply this information. In other cases the offender may
indeed have taken refuge in his own dwelling, but the neighbours may not know
him. Even if the police officer is fortunate enough to obtain the offender's
name, he will have to seek a justice of the peace to execute an arrest warrant.
Valuable time‑‑and probably the offender‑‑will be lost
because, when the police officer finally returns with his warrant, the offender
will have sought refuge elsewhere.

 

23.              These serious limitations against
effective police work and public protection must be balanced against the
intrusiveness of arresting a person in a house or apartment. This intrusiveness
is carefully delineated and restricted by the requirement of reasonable and
probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within the premises,
and the requirements of notice of presence, notice of authority and notice of
purpose. These requirements minimize the invasiveness of arrest in a dwelling
and permit the offender to maintain his dignity and privacy by walking to the
doorway and surrendering himself.

 

24.              The risks associated with arresting on
reasonable and probable grounds, namely, that an innocent person may be
arrested, devolve from the power of arrest itself and not from the place where
the suspect is arrested. Similarly, the risk of increased resistance which is
associated with warrantless arrests derives from the power of arrest without a
warrant and not from the location of the arrest. The specific concerns relating
to arrests within a dwelling are met as fully as they can be, without unduly
impinging on effective crime control, by the special requirements imposed on
peace officers who must make arrests in a house or apartment. 

 

25.              I am unable, in any event, to fathom how a
warrant for arrest can be perceived as a solution to the question of police
authority to trespass incidental to arrest. The warrant is a judicial
authorization to arrest and contains no express power of trespass. The justice
of the peace must be given evidence as to the reasonable and probable grounds
for making an arrest, but hears no evidence as to the likelihood or otherwise
that the offender can be found at any particular location. There is no good
reason, therefore, why the presence or absence of a warrant of arrest should
have any bearing on the right to make an arrest in one particular place or
another.

 

(c) Recent Cases in the House of Lords

 

26.              The respondent has cited two recent House
of Lords cases in support of the proposition that s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  should not be interpreted to allow arrest on private premises. In Morris
v. Beardmore, [1980] 2 All E.R. 753 (H.L.), the accused was charged under
the Road Traffic Act 1972, 1972 (U.K.), c. 20, which provides that where
a person fails to comply with a request for a sample of breath, the constable
may arrest him without a warrant. Following an accident involving the accused,
uniformed police officers arrived at his house and were admitted by the
accused's son. The accused refused to come down from his bedroom to be
interviewed by the officers, and refused to provide a specimen of his breath
when the officers went up to his bedroom. The House of Lords found that the
officers were trespassers and that, in the absence of express provision in the Road
Traffic Act 1972, Parliament did not intend to authorize tortious conduct.
Accordingly, though the Act authorized the making of an arrest without a
warrant, it did not authorize such an arrest on private premises.

 

27.              The decision in Morris v. Beardmore
was confirmed in Finnigan v. Sandiford, [1981] 2 All E.R. 267 (H.L.),
where it was again stated that the Road Traffic Act 1972 did not
authorize police officers to enter private premises, without the permission of
the occupier, for the purpose of effecting an arrest. 

 

28.              The two House of Lords cases do not,
however, provide support for the position advanced by the respondent. The
United Kingdom is in a markedly different position than Canada with respect to
the question of arrest without a warrant on private premises. In the United
Kingdom, the power to make such an arrest is provided by statute. Section 2 of
the Criminal Law Act 1967, 1967 (U.K.), c. 58 provides that:

 

                   2.‑‑...

 

                   (4)
Where a constable, with reasonable cause, suspects that an arrestable offence
has been committed, he may arrest without warrant anyone whom he, with
reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (6) For
the purpose of arresting a person under any power conferred by this section a
constable may enter (if need be, by force) and search any place where that
person is or where the constable, with reasonable cause, suspects him to be.

 

29.              It was the explicit statutory demarcation
of the scope of arrest powers on private premises which prevented the House of
Lords from interpreting the Road Traffic Act 1972 as implying a power to
arrest on private premises. The Parliament of the United Kingdom in s. 2 of the
Criminal Law Act 1967 clearly stated that arrest without a warrant could
take place on private premises with respect to ""arrestable offences"".
It followed that arrest without a warrant for offences which were not
""arrestable offences"" for the purpose of the Act could not take place
on private premises.

 

30.              In Lord Diplock's words (Morris v.
Beardmore at p. 757):

 

...if Parliament intends
to authorise the doing of an act which would constitute a tort actionable at
the suit of the person to whom the act is done, this requires express provision
in the statute, as is exemplified by s 2(6) of the Criminal Law Act 1967....

 

Similarly, in Finnigan v. Sandiford, Lord Keith of Kinkel stated
(at p. 270):

 

                   It may
confidently be stated as a matter of general principle that the mere conferment
by statute of a power to arrest without warrant in given circumstances does not
carry with it any power to enter private premises without the permission of the
occupier, forcibly or otherwise. Section 2 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 creates
a category of `arrestable offence' in respect of which the power of arrest
without warrant may be exercised.... The proper inference, in my opinion, is
that, where Parliament considers it appropriate that a power of arrest without
warrant should be reinforced by a power to enter private premises, it is in the
habit of saying so specifically, and that the omission of any such specific
power is deliberate. It would rarely, if ever, be possible to conclude that the
power had been conferred by implication.

 

31.              In both Morris v. Beardmore and Finnigan
v. Sandiford the cautious attitude towards the question of arrest powers on
private premises without a warrant is compelled by the existence of clear
statutory regulation of the matter. In the United Kingdom, Parliament has dealt
with the issue and the House of Lords has refrained from going beyond what is
the clear intent of Parliament.

 

32.              In Canada, on the other hand, Parliament
has remained silent on the question of whether a police officer can arrest
without a warrant on private premises. It is for this reason that we must
interpret the text of s. 450(1) (a) with regard to the principles of the
common law; accordingly Morris v. Beardmore and Finnigan v. Sandiford
do not provide support for the respondent's position.

Conclusion

 

33.              A peace officer making an arrest on
private premises without a warrant is in the execution of his or her duty for
the purposes of s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  if the criteria
of that section and the standards enunciated in Eccles v. Bourque has
been satisfied. The proper questions to be asked are:

 

1.                Is the offence in question indictable?

 

2. Has the person who
is the subject of arrest committed the offence in question or does the peace
officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, believe he or she has committed or
is about to commit the offence in question?

 

3. Are there
reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within
the premises?

 

4.                Was proper announcement made before entry?

 

An affirmative answer to all of these questions will mean that the
arrest is lawful.

 

34.              Both Eccles v. Bourque and the
present case are concerned with the scope and nature of the spatial limits with
respect to the power of arrest under s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . I refrain from making any determination on the nature and scope of
the spatial limits of arrest without a warrant under any of the other sections
or subsections of the Code.

 

35.              I should also like to note that this case
arose before the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  came into
effect. 

 

36.              In the present case the trial judge and
the Court of Appeal erred in finding that an arrest pursuant to s. 450(1) (a)
would not be lawful if on private premises in any circumstances other than hot
pursuit.

 

37.              Accordingly, this appeal is allowed on the
point of law and a new trial is ordered.

38.              Estey
J.‑‑This appeal raises once again the question of the right
of the citizen to insist on the inviolability of his home from invasion in the
name of law enforcement. The facts are set forth fully in the judgment of the
Chief Justice; the issue arises because of the respondent's assault of a police
officer who entered an apartment in order to arrest the respondent without
warrant. The principles governing this appeal are contained in recent decisions
of this Court; Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, Wiretap
Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697, and Lyons v. The Queen, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 633. In all these decisions, this Court has acknowledged that the
ancient principle, ""That the house of every one is to him as his castle
and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence, as for his
repose"" (Semayne’s Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91 a, 77 E.R. 194), must
yield to the legitimate requirements of law enforcement. In Lyons, supra,
the majority wrote (at p. 657): 

 

The invasion here is of
privacy and this concerns both the personal aspects and the property aspects of
privacy. The inviolable nature of the private dwelling is a basic part of our
free society. This concept has long been a bulwark against tyranny of the state
be it organized as an absolute monarchy or as a democratic state under a
constitutional monarch. Indeed for three hundred years the concept that a
person's home is his castle has been the defence of the citizen in an endless
variety of challenges brought against him in the name of the state. Semayne
has been the shrine of his or her privacy. The concept recognizes an internal
security but also an external dependence. The home is not a castle in
isolation; it is a castle in a community and draws its support and security of
existence from the community. The law has long recognized many compromises and
outright intrusions on the literal sense of this concept: for example, the
right of the community to search on proper authorization; the right of pursuit;
the right of eminent domain; the right of the community in applying zoning
restrictions and safety standards; the compulsory participation in community
established health facilities including sewer and water systems; and many more.
Most of these intrusions carry inspection rights of varying modes and degrees.
As Dickson J. (as he then was) put it in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 739, at p. 743:

 

...there are occasions
when the interest of a private individual in the security of his house must
yield to the public interest, when the public at large has an interest in the
process to be executed.

 

39.              Eccles v. Bourque, supra,
establishes that a peace officer has authority at common law to enter private
premises to effect an arrest without warrant pursuant to s. 450(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code  if he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe
that an indictable offence has been committed or is about to be committed, and
if two further criteria are met. First, the peace officer must have reasonable
and probable grounds to believe that the person sought is on the private
premises, and secondly, he must make a proper announcement of his presence and
purpose before entering. The disposition of this appeal is governed by those
criteria, and I would accordingly agree with the Chief Justice that the appeal
should be allowed. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

40.              Le
Dain J.‑‑I agree with the Chief Justice that the authority
of a police officer to enter private premises without the consent of the
occupant in order to effect an arrest without warrant was affirmed, with the
conditions on which it may be exercised, in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 739, and that there are sound reasons of policy for adhering to that
decision. I do not wish, however, to be understood as necessarily subscribing
to the distinction which the Chief Justice draws with reference to the
judgments of the majority of the Court in Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 697, Lyons v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, and Dedman v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2. I agree that the appeal should be allowed and
a new trial ordered.

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

Forest J. (dissenting)‑‑

 

A Man's Home is His Castle

 

42.              The sanctity of the home is deeply rooted
in our traditions. It serves to protect the security of the person and
individual privacy. The same thought was expressed as early as 1604 in the
language of the day in the first proposition of the celebrated Semayne’s
Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91 a, at p. 91 b, 77 E.R. 194, at p. 195 as
follows:

 

                   1. That
the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his
defence against injury and violence, as for his repose....

 

Qualifications

 

43.              The judges in Semayne’s Case, of
course, realized that the principle that a man's home is his castle must be
subjected to certain limitations to secure the proper administration of
justice. Though it was a civil case, it discusses the limitations then
recognized by the common law in both civil and criminal matters. That
discussion makes clear that an arrest could be made by breaking into a house if
the arrestor was armed with a warrant, or again if he was in hot pursuit of an
offender. But some have argued that the third proposition in the case goes
further. So far as relevant, it reads as follows (5 Co. Rep. 91 b, 77 E.R.
195):

 

                   3. In
all cases when the King is party, the sheriff (if the doors be not open) may
break the party's house, either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the
K.'s process, if otherwise he cannot enter. But before he breaks it, he ought
to signify the cause of his coming, and to make request to open doors....

 

44.              There is some ambiguity in the first
sentence of this proposition which has led some to read it as permitting the
""breaking"" of a party's house even without a warrant. I do not,
however, think this interpretation does justice to the latter part of that
sentence. It should be remembered that in Semayne's Case, a legal
process had been issued. What is more, the sentence we are considering, after
mentioning arrest, immediately speaks of other execution of the King's
process, the ordinary meaning of which is a writ or other judicial order; see Black’s
Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), p. 1085; Jowitt’s Dictionary of English
Law, vol. 2 (2nd ed. 1977), at pp. 1438‑39. These two facts strongly
imply that the writer had in mind an arrest pursuant to process, in that
situation a warrant. A similar view has recently been expressed by Stevens J.,
giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Payton v.
New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980), at p. 593, as follows:

 

The context strongly
implies, however, that the court was describing the extent of authority in
executing the King's writ. This reading is confirmed by the phrase ""either
to arrest him, or to do other execution of the K.'s process"" and by
the further point that notice was necessary because the owner may ""not
know of the process.""

 

45.              Nor should the passage be read without
regard to the character of Coke's Reports or of the man who compiled
them. Plucknett in his A Concise History of the Common Law (5th ed.
1956), at p. 282 tells us that Coke's Reports were not like modern
reports containing verbatim accounts of what the judges had said but rather,
that along with his Institutes, they were used by Coke to set forth his
view of restatement of the law. Plucknett says this at p. 281: 

 

A case in Coke's Reports,
therefore, is an uncertain mingling of genuine report, commentary, criticism,
elementary instruction, and recondite legal history. The whole is dominated by
Coke's personality, and derives its authority from him.

 

That being so, it is useful to examine what Coke has said elsewhere to
determine the real meaning of the equivocal statement in the third proposition
in Semayne's Case. Now Coke in his Fourth Institute went so far
as to say that justices of the peace had no power to issue a warrant that would
permit the arrest of a man in his own house until he had been indicted; see
Coke, The Fourth Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England (London:
1817), pp. 176‑77. If in Coke's view a justice could not issue such a
warrant on the basis of real and probable cause, it follows that he would not
have countenanced a constable's breaking into a house without a warrant. The
majority judges in Payton v. New York, supra, at pp. 594‑95,
and seemingly the minority too (see p. 611), were of this view.

 

46.              If I am correct in my view that Semayne’s
Case is no authority for the proposition that a man can be arrested in his
own home without a warrant, (apart from hot pursuit and other narrow exceptions
to prevent the commission of an offence to be mentioned later), it follows that
the comments there made about informing the person sought to be arrested and
requesting entry were confined to arrest with a warrant.

 

47.              What speaks even more eloquently is the
silence of the law reports on the issue. For over two hundred years after Semayne’s
Case, there was not a single reported case holding that a constable may
enter a man's house to arrest him without a warrant on the basis of reasonable
and probable cause. Given the stout opposition Englishmen have traditionally
displayed in the face of even marginal intrusions by state authority, it seems
unlikely that the police purported to act on the basis of such power in those
years. Stevens J. in Payton v. New York, supra, at pp. 596‑98,
had this to say on the matter:

 

The zealous and frequent
repetition of the adage that a ""man's house is his castle,"" made it
abundantly clear that both in England and in the Colonies ""the freedom of
one's house"" was one of the most vital elements of English liberty. 

 

                   Thus,
our study of the relevant common law does not provide the same guidance that
was present in Watson. Whereas the rule concerning the validity of an
arrest in a public place was supported by cases directly in point and by the
unanimous views of the commentators, we have found no direct authority
supporting forcible entries into a home to make a routine arrest and the weight
of the scholarly opinion is somewhat to the contrary. Indeed, the absence of
any 17th‑ or 18th‑ century English cases directly in point,
together with the unequivocal endorsement of the tenet that ""a man's home
is his castle,"" strongly suggests that the prevailing practice was not to
make such arrests except in hot pursuit or when authorized by a warrant.

 

48.              There were, it is true, respected
commentators, some relying on an early Yearbook case, who took a different
view. As to this it is sufficient to cite Stevens J.'s view in Payton v. New
York, supra, at pp. 593‑97, which I make mine:

 

                   The
common‑law commentators disagreed sharply on the subject. Three distinct
views were expressed. Lord Coke, widely recognized by the American colonists
""as the greatest authority of his time on the laws of England,""
clearly viewed a warrantless entry for the purpose of arrest to be illegal.
Burn, Foster, and Hawkins agreed, as did East and Russell, though the latter
two qualified their opinions by stating that if an entry to arrest was made
without a warrant, the officer was perhaps immune from liability for the trespass
if the suspect was actually guilty. Blackstone, Chitty, and Stephen took the
opposite view, that entry to arrest without a warrant was legal, though Stephen
relied on Blackstone who, along with Chitty, in turn relied exclusively on
Hale. But Hale's view was not quite so unequivocally expressed. Further, Hale
appears to rely solely on a statement in an early Yearbook, quoted in Burdett
v. Abbot, 14 East 1, 155, 104 Eng. Rep. 501, 560 (K. B. 1811):

 

"" ‘that for felony,
or suspicion of felony, a man may break open the house to take the felon; for
it is for the commonweal to take them.’ "" 

 

Considering the diversity
of views just described, however, it is clear that the statement was never
deemed authoritative. Indeed, in Burdett, the statement was described as
an ""extrajudicial opinion.""

 

49.              The only case since Semayne’s Case
I have found in favour of the view that a policeman may without consent or a
warrant enter into a dwelling and arrest a person there solely on the basis
that he reasonably believes the person has committed an offence is Davis v.
Russell (1829), 5 Bing. 355, 130 E.R. 1098. There the plaintiff sued a
constable for false imprisonment. The constable had entered the plaintiff's
lodgings and taken her out of bed at night to prison. He had no warrant but was
acting on the information given by an informant to the effect that the
plaintiff had robbed the informant. Though the principal question appears to
have been whether the constable had reasonable cause, Best C.J., who gave the
major judgment, certainly made it clear (5 Bing. 365, 130 E.R. 1102) that,
""We cannot uphold the notion that a constable is not permitted to go into
a house at night to apprehend a person suspected.""

 

50.              The case, however, is not one calculated
to encourage granting the police power to enter into private dwellings without
a warrant. As it turned out the informant had lied to the constable. The
court's recognition of this fact, however, afforded cold comfort to the plaintiff,
described in the report as a respectable inhabitant of Cheltenham. The
constable was held to have had reasonable grounds for what he did and her
action against him consequently failed.

 

51.              The treatment accorded this case is interesting.
I have not found a single reference to it in any English criminal law text. Nor
is it to be found in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th ed., where in vol.
11, paragraph 122, the common law is set forth in this fashion:

 

A constable has no general
right of entry into private property for the purpose of obtaining evidence,
questioning persons or effecting an arrest; every invasion of private property,
however slight, is a trespass, and no person has the right to enter property
except by consent or strictly in accordance with some lawful authorisation. A
constable is in this regard in no better position than any member of the public
and is not entitled to enter premises merely because he suspects that something
is amiss even though a reasonable householder might not object to his doing so
if the entry were bona fide and no damage was caused. A constable may, however,
enter premises to prevent a breach of the peace, and probably to prevent the
commission of any offence which he believes to be imminent or likely to be
committed.

 

Davis v. Russell did appear in Halsbury’s
Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 10, paragraph 636f where it is
relegated to a footnote to support the proposition that a policeman, unlike a
private person, may arrest on reasonable suspicion of felony. It is not cited,
nor is the proposition it supports stated, in the part of that volume dealing
with entry on private property to effect arrest (paragraph 647). I would gather
the authors of that learned work did not think the case should be followed on
that point. Certainly they knew it existed.

 

52.              Halsbury’s account is in accord
with more recent interpretations of the common law. Thus even in Thomas v.
Sawkins, [1935] 2 K.B. 249 (Div. Ct.), itself strongly criticized (see, inter
alia, A. L. Goodhart (1936), 6 Camb. L.J. 22) for extending the law
to permit entry by police onto private premises other than a dwelling in cases
where they apprehend a breach of the peace, Avory J. at p. 256, carefully
distinguished that case from those where a breach of the peace was not
involved; the latter in his view requires express statutory authority to
empower the police to enter.

 

53.              How fully this view of the common law is
accepted in England today is evident from the concession in the recent case of Swales
v. Cox, [1981] 1 All E.R. 1115 (Q.B. Div.), regarding the limits of the
power of the police to enter private premises. Donaldson L.J., speaking for himself
and Hodgson L.J., thus put it, at p. 1118:

 

...there was power of
entry into premises at common law and, if necessary, power to break doors to do
so in four cases, but in four cases only, that is to say by a constable or a
citizen in order to prevent murder, by a constable or a citizen if a felony had
in fact been committed and the felon had been followed to a house, by a
constable or a citizen if a felony was about to be committed, and would be
committed, unless prevented, and by a constable following an offender running
away from an affray. In any other circumstances there was no power to enter
premises without a warrant, and, even in these four cases where there was power
not only to enter but to break in in order to do so, it was an essential precondition
that there should have been a demand and refusal by the occupier to allow entry
before the doors could be broken.

 

54.              Until recently, then, the better view, as
it seems to me, was that at common law entry into private dwellings without a
warrant was not permitted to effect an arrest apart from the instances I have
mentioned. Both in Canada and in England, however, there had been some
extensions to the right of constables to go on private property, other than
dwellings, in the exercise of their duty to preserve the peace and to conduct
investigations into crimes; see Thomas v. Sawkins, supra; R.
v. Stenning, [1970] S.C.R. 631.

 

55.              But no significant change in the common
law right of a policeman to enter into a home took place until Eccles v.
Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, to which I now turn.

 

The Recent Decisions

 

56.              Eccles v. Bourque was decided at a
time when the law in countries with traditions similar to our own was being modified
to accord greater police powers. In the United Kingdom, the Criminal Law Act
1967 significantly extended the powers of police officers to enter private
premises. In the United States, too, a footnote to Payton v. New York, supra,
p. 598, n. 46, tells us, no less than twenty‑three states,
including New York, had enacted statutes authorizing police entry into
dwellings without a warrant. I might note, however, that the New York statutes
were recently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United
States in Payton v. New York, supra, which held that under the
Constitution of that country entry into a private dwelling for the purpose of
arresting a person can only be effected by virtue of a warrant or in exigent
circumstances. As I will explain, however, I do not think Eccles v. Bourque
went as far as these statutory provisions.

 

57.              Eccles v. Bourque was a claim in
trespass. The circumstances there were thus described by Dickson J. (now
C.J.C.) at p. 741: 

 

The claim of the
appellant, Mr. Eccles, is against the respondents, three constables on the
Vancouver Police Force, for damages for trespass alleged to have been committed
when the police officers entered the apartment occupied by Mr. Eccles in the
City of Vancouver at about 4:00 p.m. on August 12, 1971. The constables were in
plain clothes but were armed. The purpose of the entry was to apprehend one
Edmund Cheese, also known as Billy Deans, for whom there were three outstanding
Montreal warrants. Cheese was not found in the apartment. The trial judge,
Wootton J., concluded he had not been there or had successfully made his
escape, by climbing to the roof of the building from one of the two balconies
adjoining the apartment, at the moment of or immediately after the police
officers entered. Mr. Eccles was successful at trial. Mr. Justice Wootton
awarded him $300 damages and costs. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia by
a majority (Robertson and Taggart JJ.A., with Nemetz J.A. dissenting) reversed.
Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

This Court dismissed the appeal, holding the constables' entry to be
justified.

 

58.              It must be observed that in that case
there were warrants for the arrest of the fugitive, a point that is repeatedly
made throughout the case. It is set forth at the very beginning of the judgment
in the statement of the facts already given. It is reiterated at p. 743, where
after stating the principle in Semayne’s Case that a man's house is his
castle, the qualifications to that principle are stated in the following words:

 

But there are occasions
when the interest of a private individual in the security of his house must
yield to the public interest, when the public at large has an interest in the
process to be executed. The criminal is not immune from arrest in his own
home nor in the home of one of his friends.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Again, at p. 745, the folowing passage appears:

 

If the police officer has
reasonable and probable cause to believe that the person named in the
warrant for arrest is in the home of a stranger he has the right, after
proper demand, to enter the home forcibly, to search and to arrest. In the
present case there can be no doubt the police officers believed and in my view
had reasonable and probable grounds for believing that Cheese, or Deans as he
was known to Mr. Eccles, was in the Eccles apartment.

 

(Emphasis added.) 

 

59.              This constant repetition of the existence
of a warrant indicates the importance of this fact to the coram that decided
the case. As I read it, then, the manner in which Eccles v. Bourque
really differs from other cases of entry on the basis of a warrant is that the
attempted arrest occurred in British Columbia but the warrants had been issued
in Montreal and were not endorsed for use in British Columbia as required by
the Criminal Code . As well, the warrants were not in the possession of
the constables when the entry was made.

 

60.              The case, therefore, undoubtely
constituted an extension of the law by ignoring some of the requirements for
the arrest of a person against whom a warrant has been issued. But these in the
context may have been looked upon by the court as technical omissions. It
anticipated in a sense the recent recommendation of the Law Reform Commission
of Canada that there should be Canada‑wide warrants; see Arrest,
Working Paper 41, p. 118, Recommendation 20. There was no question raised in
that case that an offence had been committed or that warrants has been issued.
The real question, as the last cited passage seems to denote, was whether there
were reasonable and probable grounds for believing the fugitive was in Mr.
Eccles' house.

 

61.              Justification for overlooking some of the
technical requirements of the Code may be found in the fact that, as the
judgement states on several occasions, the person sought was a fugitive.
Fugitives from justice are frequently treated differently from other offenders.
The most obvious example is arrest on hot pursuit. Reference may also be made
to extradition law where, in addition to the relaxation of rules required by
statutes regarding the form of evidence, the courts have frequently stated that
the technical rules of criminal law should apply only in a limited sense. This
approach has been followed in various areas seriously affecting the liberty of
the subject, including the more ready refusal to grant bail, among others. 

 

62.              Two Canadian Courts of Appeal have
understood the application of Eccles v. Bourque to be limited to arrest
by warrant. The majority of the Court of Appeal of Ontario obviously did so in
the present case. And in R. v. Custer, [1984] 4 W.W.R. 133, at p. 142,
Bayda C.J., giving the unanimous opinion of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, had
this to say:

 

                   It is
plain that the case does not fall within the common law exception applied by
the Supreme Court of Canada in Eccles, the ratio decidendi of which I
understand to be this: if a police officer has reasonable and probable cause to
believe that the person named in a warrant for arrest is in the home of a
stranger, the officer has the right, after proper demand, to enter the home
forcibly, to search and to arrest.

 

63.              I agree with the members of these courts
that Eccles v. Bourque simply gives a restricted power to police
officers to enter a person's home when they reasonably believe a person for
whom a warrant of arrest has been issued is there. I do not think it should be
broadly interpreted so as to authorize entry into a dwelling whenever the
police believe on reasonable grounds that a person has committed an offence and
that he is in that dwelling. Several cases decided in this Court underline that
the principle that a man's home is his castle remains solidly imbedded in the
law; see Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2; Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, esp. at p. 657; Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
697, esp. at pp. 707‑09. And, as I will attempt to demonstrate, if the
broad view of Eccles v. Bourque is taken, that principle is fatally
weakened.

 

64.              Of the cases just mentioned, only Colet
needs attention here. It highlights the importance we attach to the integrity
of the home in this country. There police officers were authorized by warrant
to seize certain weapons in the possession of Colet who had made it known that
he would forcefully resist entry by city employees to ""clean up"" his
property, including the destruction of a rudimentary shelter he called his
home. Armed with the warrant, the police attempted to enter his home but they
were met with strong resistance, which culminated in Colet's being charged with
five counts, including attempted murder and intending to cause bodily harm.
Colet was, however, acquitted. The Court, inspired by the principle in Semayne's
Case, interpreted the relevant provisions of the Code restrictively
to hold that the authorization to seize did not include the right to enter and
search Colet's home even though it was obvious from the facts that the firearms
sought were known to be there. 

 

65.              The case was not, of course, dealing with
precisely the same subject‑matter as Eccles v. Bourque but (if one
adopts a broad view of Eccles) one must agree with the comment of the
Law Reform Commission in Arrest, supra, at p. 114:

 

While the court was
dealing with very different factual situations and was applying different
sources of law in each case, allowing them to be distinguished for these
reasons, the approaches to the problem of the power of police forcibly to enter
private premises to carry out duties are based on widely diverging premises,
methods and values.

 

Indeed, as it further noted at p. 116:

 

Entry to effect an arrest
has potentially geater repercussions for the liberty of the individual than
does entry for the purposes of searching for evidence of offences, and it is
difficult to see how the protections surrounding the former should be less
stringent than those for the latter as is presently the case.

 

66.              The underlying values in the two judgments
become reconcilable and more coherent if one adopts the view of Eccles v.
Bourque I have advanced in the present case.

 

67.              The Colet case itself contains
statements that may conceivably be interpreted as supportive of a broad as well
as a restrictive view of Eccles. Thus the following passage at the top
of p. 9 may possibly be looked upon as supporting a broad approach:

 

                   This
makes it clear that Mr. Justice Dickson was limiting his remarks to occasions
when the house of the individual is entered against his will by police officers
in search of a fugitive from justice whose arrest they consider to be
justified.

 

But even here, it should be observed, Ritchie J. confined his remarks
to a fugitive from justice. And later on the same page, he adds the following
passage that denotes the restrictive attitude towards entry into a person's
home that prevailed in that case:

 

All sections of the Criminal
Code  are presumably enacted ""in the public interest"" and it would
in my view be dangerous indeed to hold that the private rights of the
individual to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property are to be subject to
invasion by police officers whenever they can be said to be acting in the
furtherance of the enforcement of any section of the Criminal Code 
although they are not armed with express authority to justify their action.

 

68.              That approach is, of course, relevant
here, given the vagueness of the Criminal Code  regarding the spatial
limits of the power to arrest. 

 

Policy Considerations

 

69.              As has been seen the common law sets a
high value on the security and privacy of the home. The situations where it
permitted entry by police without the consent of the owner or occupier were all
demonstrably compelling. For example, entry to prevent murder is obviously
justified. So too is entry on hot pursuit. Apart from the obvious practicality
of that approach, in the case of hot pursuit the police officer is himself
cognizant of the facts justifying entry; he acts on the basis of personal
knowledge. Obviously, too, entry on the basis of a warrant is essential to a
properly functioning system of criminal justice. The state must in the end have
power to prevent criminals from eluding justice by retreating to a private
home.

 

70.              The latter reasoning can, of course, be
used to support the thesis that a police officer may enter, break into and stay
in a private home uninvited and without warrant on the basis of reasonable and
probable cause. But it fails to consider the advantage of a warrant which
interposes a judicial officer‑‑a person not professionally
interested in law enforcement and not directly involved in the particular issue‑‑into
the process. The scrutiny exercised by the judicial officer may not be
extensive, but the mere fact that a police officer must attempt to persuade a
third party that he has a reasonable and probable cause to effect entry into a
private dwelling requires some reflection on the necessity of breaching such a
fundamental tenet of our society as the sanctity of the home.The warrant also
announces in a symbolic way, one traditionally recognized by the public, that
it is the state that authorizes entry under law. In Eccles v. Bourque, a
warrant for the fugitive had been issued even though it may not have met the
endorsement requirements of the Code.

 

71.              From the Eccles case, we are asked
to take a further step and hold that when a police officer has reasonable and
probable cause to believe a person has committed an indictable offence, he may
enter into a private home, apparently at any time of day or night, if he also
has reasonable and probable cause to believe a suspect is there. 

 

72.              Let me first say something about the
vagueness of the proposed test of ""reasonable and probable cause"" and
the consequential danger of giving the police power to enter into a private
dwelling on that basis. The expression, no doubt, comprises something more than
mere surmise, but determining with any useful measure of precision what it
means beyond that poses rather intractable problems both for the police and the
courts. If the principle in Eccles v. Bourque is to be extended to permit
forcible entry into private homes, for the purpose of making arrests simply on
the basis that a police officer has reasonable and probable cause, then as the
Law Reform Commission put it in its working paper on Arrest, supra,
at p. 115, it would allow him a ""wide latitude based on vague, sometimes
contradictory statements which provide police with few guidelines, individuals
with few definable rights, and courts with little means of control""; see
also John Manley's comment on Eccles v. Bourque in (1975), 7 Ottawa
L. Rev. 649, at p. 656. I have found nothing in the cases or in learned
commentaries that gives much assistance in giving more precision to the
concept, the situations being so various. Because of the vagueness of the
discretion it gives a police officer, that discretion is virtually
uncontrollable. Small wonder, then, that the Law Reform Commission recommended
the statutory reaffirmation of the traditional position.

 

73.              I shall attempt to underline the inherent
difficulties of the situation by reference to the facts of this case. The
police had no personal knowledge of the alleged crime. They received a phone
call from a public transit officer who had seen two youths enter a parked jeep,
one of whom the informant alleged was drunk. He later reported he saw them
walking through a parking lot, trying to open car doors. He parked his car,
called the police on his car radio and then saw the youths enter an apartment
building nearby. On arrival, the police found the jeep had backed down a hill
and was standing against a retaining wall with the lights on. 

 

74.              On the basis of this, how can a court at
third hand do anything but hold that there were reasonable and probable grounds
to believe the youths may have committed attempted theft? How can one second‑guess
the policemen on such matters, for example, as the reliability and credibility
of the informant? Informants can be unreliable; indeed as Davis v. Russell,
supra, shows, they can be relating false tales for their own purposes.

 

75.              Apart from flagrant cases, I seriously
doubt that the courts can exercise any effective control over the exercise of
police discretion in such cases. So far as arrests in public places are
concerned, I do not quarrel with the existence of this discretion. The police's
job of maintaining the peace and enforcing the criminal law is difficult enough
without fearing being regularly ""second‑guessed"" about every
mistake of judgment in such circumstances. But if I agree that a police officer
should be able on evidence such as existed here to arrest a suspect in a public
place, I do not think it reasonable that he should be permitted to enter a
private home without consent unless he has a warrant permitting him to do so.
Invasion of a person's home, in circumstances like these, is too high a price
to pay to prevent the possible escape of some criminals, especially for non‑violent
crimes like the one alleged in the present case. Not only would such a practice
invade the owner's security and privacy; it would often lead to violence as the
facts of this case attest. This can, in my view, be even more likely where the
owner of the home is not the suspected offender. All the more so if, as
happened in Eccles v. Bourque, the police are not in uniform.

 

76.              The danger is not lessened by the fact
that despite reasonable and probable belief on the part of the police that an
offence has been committed, there may not have been any offence committed at all,
a matter that may, if his home is broken into, make the homeowner all the more
irate. That police intrusion may occur when no offence has in fact been
committed is evident from Davis v. Russell, supra. Indeed, in the
present case it is far from clear that the accused had committed attempted
theft. The account by the two youths under oath that they were walking home
from an entertainment establishment and went into the jeep out of curiosity
while walking home is not implausible. They were quite close to home. They were
seventeen or eighteen, they had been drinking and, they said, they had never
seen a jeep like the one in question and wanted to see what it looked like.
They denied having attempted to open cars in the parking lot and said they were
merely walking between them through the parking lot. It is interesting that
they were never charged with the alleged attempted theft for which entry was
made into the apartment. 

 

77.              What of the identification of the accused
and the place where they were going? The informant had advised the police that
the accused had walked into an apartment building nearby, but did not identify
the apartment. One of the police, Constable Handy, testified that as he
approached the front door of the building, he saw two individuals matching the
description of the two youths in a basement apartment. And what was that
description? According to the informant, the persons concerned were about
eighteen, one was dark and was noticeably drunk (though the police testified
that this was not so), one wore a denim jacket and the other a dark one (the
police said it was red). I have no doubt from this that the police officer
could have reasonable grounds for believing that the youths were the suspects
and, as it turned out he was right. But with that description, the chances of a
mistake are not inconsiderable.

 

78.              Those chances are too great for one to
support the rule of law argued for in this case. From the vantage of a court,
which is supposed to exercise control over police discretion, the
identification is extremely vague. The number of youths who could answer that
description must be very high. Only those present at the time can really make
an assessment. Control by the courts under those circumstances, therefore,
becomes very limited.

 

79.              I draw no comfort from the fact that the
proposed extension of Eccles v. Bourque could be limited to indictable
offences. As anyone familiar with the criminal justice system knows, even
serious indictable offences can arise out of fact situations that are not
really that serious. So far as the crime alleged here, which is non‑violent,
the Code itself (s. 450(2)(a)) attempts to discourage arrest
without warrant by enjoining police officers not to do so unless the public
interest otherwise requires it. I might also add that a number of crimes can be
prosecuted by indictment or on summary conviction at the option of the
prosecutor. The choice could be made with a view to making a previous entry
into a private dwelling legal.

 

80.              Another type of problem has been suggested
by Professor Alan Grant in a comment on ""The Supreme Court of Canada and
the Police: 1970‑76"" (1978), 20 Crim. Law Q. 152, at p. 163.
If the decision is given a broad meaning, he states: 

 

...then it may herald an
end to the police ever seeking search warrants, for example, to look for stolen
property. There can be few cases where there are reasonable and probable
grounds to believe that stolen property is being kept at premises which will
not at the same time be capable of supporting a belief that someone on the
premises is reasonably and probably believed to be committing the offence of
being in possession of stolen property (Code ss. 312 and 313) for which there
will be a power of arrest under Cr. Code s. 450(1).

 

81.              The truth is that to extend the rule in Eccles
to a case like the present would amount to giving the police an almost
unfettered discretion to break into a home by day or night whenever they
seriously suspect an indictable offence has been committed and that the
perpetrator is there.

 

82.              But, it may be countered, the alternative
is that a house may become a permanent sanctuary for a criminal, since there
are no search warrants for persons as opposed to things. There are several
answers to this. To begin with, I doubt if there would be many cases where a
person would remain indefinitely in a house, thereby creating a prison of his
own making. And if there is need to have search warrants for persons, the
answer is simple: Parliament can provide for it as several commentators have suggested;
see, for example, Grant, supra, p. 164. Finally, good police work can
easily overcome the problems in most cases. In the present case, for example,
one of the youths was at home. It would not have required very sophisticated
police work to locate the other the next day, and their identification as the
persons who committed the alleged attempted theft could not have been more
unreliable than it is at present. Such an approach would obviate the temptation
that a suspected person and others may have to resist when disturbed at home;
the not unlikely violent consequences that can ensue would thus be avoided.

 

83.              In truth, though, there is a fallacy in
approaching the matter on the basis of a single case. Even if one concedes that
some suspects may escape owing to the principle that a man's home is his
castle, this has to be weighed against the danger of giving up a well‑known
and long recognized right devised for the protection of individual security and
privacy against state power. The wide, vague, and virtually uncontrollable
discretion one would be giving police officers creates a greater danger to the
sanctity of the home than the danger that criminals would otherwise escape. For
my part, I share the skepticism of the Supreme Court of the United States in Payton
v. New York, supra, at p. 602 that law enforcement has suffered
because the police have been unable to enter a home to effect arrest apart from
the narrow common law exceptions. No evidence to establish this point was forthcoming
in the Payton case, although it has long been the practice of the
Supreme Court of the United States to consider evidence of this nature. 

 

84.              On the other hand, on the basis of the
limited experience we have had with entries into homes without warrant, we know
that errors are inevitable. In Davis v. Russell, we saw, no crime had
been committed. That may well be so in the present case. Only in Eccles v.
Bourque can we be certain a crime had been committed before entry, but then
there was a warrant in that case. We daily permit accused who are almost
certainly guilty to go free in the interest of ensuring that no innocent person
shall be punished. The procedure argued for would inevitably result in some
people who are certainly innocent bearing the burden of a rule which it has yet
to be demonstrated would achieve any measurable improvement in law enforcement.

 

85.              I do not think we would be assisting the
police in the difficult task they are faced with by increasing their rights of
entry into private homes in the manner contended for here. We would be giving
them a very vague rule for action. In situations like this, they need the
clearest possible rules. At present the rule is clear. Absent well recognized
and widely supported exceptions, they may not enter private homes. These
exceptions apart, their authority ends at the door. That rule protects them and
the public from violence.

 

86.              Moreover, I do not think it is wise to
place the police in situations where they are called upon to breach such a
deeply cherished community value as the sanctity of the home. It is essential
for the police to have the support of the community. With the type of extension
argued for, mistakes are bound to happen and I can imagine few breaches of
community values more calculated to incense the public than this one; see in
this context W. F. Foster and Joseph E. Magnet, ""The Law of Forcible
Entry"" (1977), 15 Alta. Law Rev. 271, at pp. 290‑91.

 

87.              There is another cause for concern in
granting such a vague discretion. It is unlikely to be used as much against the
economically favoured or powerful as against the disadvantaged. It is
interesting that the home in Davis v. Russell, supra, was
described as lodgings, and those in Eccles v. Bourque and the present
case were apartments. As Professor Paul Weiler has stated, ""abuses of
police power will rarely affect respectable members of the middle
classes"", but will instead ""focus on the poor and on marginal,
minority groups"". See Weiler, ""The Control of Police Arrest
Practices: Reflections of a Tort Lawyer"" in Allen M. Linden, ed., Studies
in Canadian Tort Law, p. 416, at p. 448; John Manley, case comment on Eccles
v. Bourque, supra, at p. 656. 

 

88.              Finally, I have mentioned earlier that
Parliament may, if it wishes, amend the law of search warrants to permit
searches for persons as well as things. It might also wish, under well‑defined
circumstances, to extend police powers in respect of dangerous situations and
dangerous and elusive criminals (which is not the case here). I would now add
some general observations about the respective roles of Parliament and the
courts in situations like that in the present case. In my view, if incursions
are to be made upon a legal and political value so deeply inbred in our society
as the sanctity of the home, it is for Parliament to do so and not for the
courts. While the courts must attempt to give reasonable and practical effect to
attempts by Parliament to meet the challenge of widespread criminal activity,
the duty of the courts has always been to act as a brake against laws that
either directly or because of over‑zealous enforcement encroach upon the
liberty of the subject. It would be an ironic reversal of roles if Parliament
was required to act to protect the sanctity of the home from possible excesses
flowing from the application of a judicially created rule. Courts undoubtedly
have a creative role in developing the law, but they must be extremely wary of
widening the possibility of encroaching on our personal liberties; they are the
protectors of our rights. Parliament has the primary duty to respond to the
challenge of criminal activities. The courts should no doubt view their efforts
sympathetically but be forever diligent to prevent undue intrusions on our
liberty.

 

89.              It may in the past have been tempting at
times for courts to extend rules in flagrant circumstances to forestal more
general action by Parliament, then supreme, in response to a transient wave of
public opinion. But the constitutional environment has now changed. The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  clearly tells us that certain fundamental
rights, including the security of the person, fall within the constitutional
protection of the courts. That is, I think, the proper role of the courts.
Seemingly minor intrusions on fundamental principles of the type they might
have been tempted to make in the past are dangerous. Walter Gellhorn has said
it well: 

 

                   In
every society, in every age, and certainly in our own there are multitudes who,
in Archibald MacLeish's phrase, ""fear freedom or are frightened of the
loneliness it implies."" For the most part, however, inroads on freedom are
not initiated by those who prefer that others assume responsibility for
directing their lives; these flabby folk become the hordes that sustain
dictatorships, but they themselves are too inert to bring it to pass. We need
not worry, in my estimation, that freedom will be brought low upon their initiative.
Nor do I think that evilly motivated men will successfully trick us into
surrendering one after another bastion in a heedless quest for an unattainably
perfect security. The real danger lies among those of us who genuinely desire
to protect freedom, and who think that this can best be done by limiting it.
They propose to give a little here to protect a lot there. The motive is
admirable, but the judgment is unsound. The very amplitude of our American
brand of freedom sometimes seduces us into believing that a good deal of it can
be spent without anyone's really noticing the difference‑‑that we
can afford, as Carl Becker put it, ""to take liberties with our
liberty."" But the trouble is that small restrictions accumulate into large
restrictions and, in the process, may become as habitual as, before, freedom
was. Restrictions justified as necessary safeguards of freedom may in fact
safeguard freedom out of existence altogether.

 

See W. Gellhorn, Individual Freedom and Governmental Restraints
(1956), pp. 39‑40; quoted by Arthur Maloney, ""Law Enforcement and
The Citizen's Liberty"" (1966), 9 Can. Bar J. 168, at p. 170. 

 

Conclusion

 

90.              For my part, I am firm that the principle
that a man's home is his castle along with the demonstrably justifiable
exceptions developed under the old common law have together constituted an
excellent balance between the security and privacy of the individual and the
needs of law enforcement from their enunciation in Semayne's Case over
three hundred and eighty years ago. I am confident this arrangement can
continue to be an adequate balance for four hundred years after Semayne's
Case and beyond. If Parliament in its wisdom finds it necessary to adjust
the balance, it can do so. It is in a better position to provide for the
precise balance and has a far better access to the knowledge required to
achieve that balance than the courts. The courts can then perform their duty of
scrutinizing Parliament's laws both in their general tenor and in their
particular application to safeguard our traditional values. That as I
understand it is the role the courts in both Great Britain and the United
States, in their different constitutional environments, play; for Great Britain,
see Morris v. Beardmore, [1980] 2 All E.R. 753 (H.L.); Finnigan v.
Sandiford, [1981] 2 All E.R. 267 (H.L.); for the United States, see Payton
v. New York, supra.

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Presumption of innocence
‑‑ Reverse onus ‑‑ Accused presumed to be trafficker on
finding of possession of illicit drug ‑‑ Onus on accused to rebut
presumption ‑‑ Whether or not constitutional guarantee of
presumption of innocence (s. 11 (d) of the Charter ) violated.








 

                   Respondent was charged with unlawful possession of a
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act, but was convicted only of unlawful possession. After the trial
judge made a finding that it was beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent was
in possession of a narcotic, respondent brought a motion challenging the
constitutional validity of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act. That
section provides that if the Court finds the accused in possession of a
narcotic, the accused is presumed to be in possession for the purpose of
trafficking and that, absent the accused's establishing the contrary, he must
be convicted of trafficking. The Ontario Court of Appeal, on an appeal brought
by the Crown, found that this provision constituted a ""reverse onus""
clause and held it to be unconstitutional because it violated the presumption
of innocence now entrenched in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The Crown appealed and a constitutional question was
stated as to whether s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act violated s.
11 (d) of the Charter  and was therefore of no force and effect.
Inherent in this question, given a finding that s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
had been violated, was the issue of whether or not s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act was a reasonable limit prescribed by law and demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society for the purpose of s. 1  of the Charter .


 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed and the constitutional question answered in the affirmative.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Chouinard, Lamer, Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: Pursuant to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, the accused, upon a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of
possession of a narcotic, has the legal burden of proving on a balance of
probabilities that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking. On proof of possession, a mandatory presumption arises against the
accused that he intended to traffic and the accused will be found guilty unless
he can rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.

 

                   The presumption of innocence lies at the very heart
of the criminal law and is protected expressly by s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
and inferentially by the s. 7  right to life, liberty and security of the
person. This presumption has enjoyed longstanding recognition at common law and
has gained widespread acceptance as evidenced from its inclusion in major
international human rights documents. In light of these sources, the right to
be presumed innocent until proven guilty requires, at a minimum, that: (1) an
individual be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the State must bear
the burden of proof; and (3) criminal prosecutions must be carried out in
accordance with lawful procedures and fairness.

 

                   A provision which requires an accused to disprove on
a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an
important element of the offence in question, violates the presumption of
innocence in s. 11 (d). The fact that the standard required on rebuttal
is only a balance of probabilities does not render a reverse onus clause
constitutional.

 

                   Section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
infringes the presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
by requiring the accused to prove he is not guilty of trafficking once the
basic fact of possession is proven.

 

                   The rational connection test ‑‑ the
potential for a rational connection between the basic fact and the presumed
fact to justify a reverse onus provision ‑‑ does not apply to the
interpretation of s. 11 (d). A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a
presumed fact, but still not prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt,
which is an important aspect of the presumption of innocence. The appropriate
stage for invoking the rational connection test is under s. 1  of the Charter .


 

                   Section 1  of the Charter  has two functions:
First, it guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in the provisions which
follow it; and second, it states explicitly the exclusive justificatory
criteria (outside of s. 33 of the Constitutional Act, 1982) against
which limitations on those rights and freedoms may be measured.

 

                   The onus of proving that a limitation on any Charter 
right is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society
rests upon the party seeking to uphold the limitation. Limits on
constitutionally guaranteed rights are clearly exceptions to the general
guarantee. The presumption is that Charter  rights are guaranteed unless
the party invoking s. 1  can bring itself within the exceptional criteria
justifying their being limited.

 

                   The standard of proof under s. 1  is a preponderance
of probabilities. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt would be unduly onerous on
the party seeking to limit the right because concepts such as
""reasonableness"", ""justifiability"", and ""free and
democratic society"" are not amenable to such a standard. Nevertheless, the
preponderance of probability test must be applied rigorously.

 

                   Two central criteria must be satisfied to establish
that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. First, the objective to be served by the measures limiting a Charter 
right must be sufficiently important to warrant overriding a constitutionally
protected right or freedom. The standard must be high to ensure that trivial
objectives or those discordant with the principles of a free and democratic
society do not gain protection. At a minimum, an objective must relate to
societal concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic
society before it can be characterized as sufficiently important. Second, the
party invoking s. 1  must show the means to be reasonable and demonstrably
justified. This involves a form of proportionality test involving three
important components. To begin, the measures must be fair and not arbitrary,
carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally
connected to that objective. In addition, the means should impair the right in
question as little as possible. Lastly, there must be a proportion­ality
between the effects of the limiting measure and the objective ‑‑
the more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the more important the
objective must be. 

 

                   Parliament's concern that drug trafficking be
decreased was substantial and pressing. Its objective of protecting society
from the grave ills of drug trafficking was self‑evident, for the
purposes of s. 1 , and could potentially in certain cases warrant the overriding
of a constitutionally protected right. There was, however, no rational
connection between the basic fact of possession and the presumed fact of
possession for the purpose of trafficking. The possession of a small or
negligible quantity of narcotics would not support the inference of
trafficking.

 

                   Per Estey and McIntyre
JJ.: Concurred in the reasons of Dickson C.J. with respect to the relationship
between s. 11 (d) and s. 1  of the Charter  but the reasons of
Martin J.A. in the court below were adopted for the disposition of all other
issues.

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑This appeal concerns the constitutionality of
s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1. The section
provides, in brief, that if the Court finds the accused in possession of a
narcotic, he is presumed to be in possession for the purpose of trafficking.
Unless the accused can establish the contrary, he must be convicted of
trafficking. The Ontario Court of Appeal held that this provision constitutes a
""reverse onus"" clause and is unconstitutional because it violates one
of the core values of our criminal justice system, the presumption of
innocence, now entrenched in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The Crown has appealed.

Statutory and Constitutional Provisions

 

2.                Before reviewing the factual context, I
will set out the relevant legislative and constitutional provisions:

 

Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1.

 

                   3. (1) Except as authorized by this Act or the regulations, no person
shall have a narcotic in his possession.

 

                   (2) Every
person who violates subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable

 

(a) upon summary
conviction for a first offence, to a fine of one thousand dollars or to
imprisonment for six months or to both fine and imprisonment, and for a
subsequent offence, to a fine of two thousand dollars or to imprisonment for
one year or to both fine and imprisonment; or

 

(b) upon
conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for seven years.

 

                   4. (1) No person shall traffic in a narcotic or any substance represented
or held out by him to be a narcotic.

 

                   (2) No
person shall have in his possession a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.

 

                   (3) Every
person who violates subsection (1) or (2) is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for life.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   8. In any prosecution for a violation of subsection 4(2), if the
accused does not plead guilty, the trial shall proceed as if it were a
prosecution for an offence under section 3, and after the close of the case
for the prosecution and after the accused has had an opportunity to make full
answer and defence, the court shall make a finding as to whether or not the
accused was in possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3; if the
court finds that the accused was not in possession of the narcotic contrary to
section 3, he shall be acquitted but if the court finds that the accused was
in possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3, he shall be given an
opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for
the purpose of trafficking, and thereafter the prosecutor shall be given an
opportunity of adducing evidence to establish that the accused was in possession
of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking; if the accused establishes
that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking,
he shall be acquitted of the offence as charged but he shall be convicted
of an offence under section 3 and sentenced accordingly; and if the accused
fails to establish that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the
purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the offence as charged and
sentenced accordingly.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 

 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal.

 

                   1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the
rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society.

Facts

 

3.                The respondent, David Edwin Oakes, was
charged with unlawful possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking,
contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. He elected trial by
magistrate without a jury. At trial, the Crown adduced evidence to establish
that Mr. Oakes was found in possession of eight one gram vials of cannabis
resin in the form of hashish oil. Upon a further search conducted at the police
station, $619.45 was located. Mr. Oakes told the police that he had bought ten
vials of hashish oil for $150 for his own use, and that the $619.45 was from a
workers' compensation cheque. He elected not to call evidence as to possession
of the narcotic. Pursuant to the procedural provisions of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, the trial judge proceeded to make a finding that it was beyond
a reasonable doubt that Mr. Oakes was in possession of the narcotic. 

 

4.                Following this finding, Mr. Oakes
brought a motion to challenge the constitutional validity of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, which he maintained imposes a burden on an accused to prove
that he or she was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking. He argued
that s. 8 violates the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of
the Charter .

Judgments

 

(a) Ontario Provincial Court (R. v. Oakes (1982), 38
O.R. (2d) 598)

 

5.                At trial, Walker Prov. Ct. J. borrowed
the words of Laskin C.J. in R. v. Shelley, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 196, at p.
202, and found there was no rational or necessary connection between the fact
proved, i.e., possession of the drug, and the conclusion asked to be
drawn, namely, possession for the purpose of trafficking. Walker Prov. Ct. J.
held that, to the extent that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act requires
this presumption and the resultant conviction, it is inoperative as a violation
of the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

6.                Walker Prov. Ct. J. added that the
reverse onus in s. 8 would not be invalid if the Crown had adduced evidence of
possession as well as evidence from which it could be inferred beyond a
reasonable doubt that the possession was for the purpose of trafficking. If
this were done, there would be a sufficient rational connection between the
fact of possession and the presumed fact of trafficking.

 

(b)Ontario Court of Appeal (R. v. Oakes (1983), 145
D.L.R. (3d) 123)

 

7.                Martin J.A., writing for a unanimous
court, dismissed the appeal and held the reverse onus provision in s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act unconstitutional.

 

8.                Martin J.A. stated that, as a general
rule, a reverse onus clause which places a burden on the accused to disprove on
a balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence contravenes the
right to be presumed innocent. Nevertheless, he held that some reverse onus
provisions may be constitutionally valid provided they constitute reasonable
limitations on the right to be presumed innocent and are demonstrably justified
in a free and democratic society. 

 

9.                To determine whether a particular
reverse onus provision is legitimate, Martin J.A. outlined a two‑pronged
inquiry. First, it is necessary to pass a threshold test which he explained as
follows, at p. 146:

 

                   The
threshold question in determining the legitimacy of a particular reverse onus
provision is whether the reverse onus clause is justifiable in the sense that
it is reasonable for Parliament to place the burden of proof on the accused in
relation to an ingredient of the offence in question. In determining the
threshold question consideration should be given to a number of factors,
including such factors as: (a) the magnitude of the evil sought to be
suppressed, which may be measured by the gravity of the harm resulting from the
offence or by the frequency of the occurrence of the offence or by both
criteria; (b) the difficulty of the prosecution making proof of the presumed
fact, and (c) the relative ease with which the accused may prove or disprove
the presumed fact. Manifestly, a reverse onus provision placing the burden of
proof on the accused with respect to a fact which it is not rationally open to
him to prove or disprove cannot be justified.

 

10.              If the reverse onus provision meets these
criteria, due regard having been given to Parliament's assessment of the need
for the provision, a second test must then be satisfied. This second test was
described by Martin J.A. as the ""rational connection test"". According
to it, to be reasonable, the proven fact (e.g., possession) must
rationally tend to prove the presumed fact (e.g., an intention to
traffic). In other words, the proven fact must raise a probability that the
presumed fact exists.

 

11.              In considering s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, Martin J.A. focused primarily on the second test at p. 147:

 

                   I have
reached the conclusion that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is
constitutionally invalid because of the lack of a rational connection between
the proved fact (possession) and the presumed fact (an intention to
traffic).... Mere possession of a small quantity of a narcotic drug does not
support an inference of possession for the purpose of trafficking or even tend
to prove an intent to traffic. Moreover, upon proof of possession, s. 8 casts
upon the accused the burden of disproving not some formal element of the
offence but the burden of disproving the very essence of the offence.

 

12.              Martin J.A. added that it is not for
courts to attempt to rewrite s. 8 by applying it on a case by case basis.
Furthermore, where a rational connection does exist between possession and the
presumed intention to traffic, such as ""where the possession of a narcotic
drug is of such a nature as to be indicative of trafficking, the common sense
of a jury can ordinarily be relied upon to arrive at a proper conclusion"".
There would not, therefore, be any need for a statutory presumption.

 

13.              One final note should be made regarding
Martin J.A.'s judgment. In assessing whether or not s. 8 was a reasonable
limitation on the constitutional protection of the presumption of innocence,
Martin J.A. combined the analysis of s. 11 (d) with s. 1 . He held that
the requirements of s. 1 , that a limitation be reasonable and demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society, provided the standard for
interpreting the phrase ""according to law"" in s. 11 (d). 

 

                                                                   IV

 

The Issues

 

14.              The constitutional question in this appeal
is stated as follows:

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and thus of no force and effect?

 

Two specific questions are raised by this general question: (1) does s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act violate s. 11 (d) of the Charter ;
and, (2) if it does, is s. 8  a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society for the purpose of s. 1 
of the Charter ? If the answer to (1) is affirmative and the answer to
(2) negative, then the constitutional question must be answered in the
affirmative.

 

                                                                    V

 

Does s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act Violate s. 11(d)
of the Charter ?

 

(a) The Meaning of s. 8

 

15.              Before examining the presumption of
innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of the Charter , it is necessary
to clarify the meaning of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act. The
procedural steps contemplated by s. 8  were clearly outlined by Branca J.A. in R.
v. Babcock and Auld, [1967] 2 C.C.C. 235 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 247:

 

                   (A) The
accused is charged with possession of a forbidden drug for the purpose of
trafficking.

 

                   (B) The
trial of the accused on this charge then proceeds as if it was a prosecution
against the accused on a simple charge of possession of the forbidden drug....

 

                   (C)
When the Crown has adduced its evidence on the basis that the charge was a
prosecution for simple possession, the accused is then given the statutory
right or opportunity of making a full answer and defence to the charge of
simple possession....

 

                   (D)
When this has been done the Court must make a finding as to whether the accused
was in possession of narcotics contrary to s. 3 of the new Act. (Unlawful
possession of a forbidden narcotic drug).

 

                   (E)
Assuming that the Court so finds, it is then that an onus is placed upon the
accused in the sense that an opportunity must be given to the accused of
establishing that he was not in possession of a narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking.

 

                   (F)
When the accused has been given this opportunity the prosecutor may then
establish that the possession of the accused was for the purpose of
trafficking....

 

                   (G) It
is then that the Court must find whether or not the accused has discharged the
onus placed upon him under and by the said section.

 

                   (H) If
the Court so finds, the accused must be acquitted of the offence as charged,
namely, possession for the purpose of trafficking, but in that event the
accused must be convicted of the simple charge of unlawful possession of a
forbidden narcotic....

 

                   (I) If
the accused does not so establish he must then be convicted of the full offence
as charged. 

 

 

Mr. Justice Branca then added at pp. 247‑48:

 

                   It is
quite clear to me that under s. 8 of the new Act the trial must be divided into
two phases. In the first phase the sole issue to be determined is whether or
not the accused is guilty of simple possession of a narcotic. This issue is to
be determined upon evidence relevant only to the issue of possession. In the
second phase the question to be resolved is whether or not the possession
charged is for the purpose of trafficking.

 

16.              Against the backdrop of these procedural
steps, we must consider the nature of the statutory presumption contained in s.
8 and the type of burden it places on an accused. The relevant portions of
s. 8 read:

 

                   8. ...if the court finds that the accused was in possession of the
narcotic ... he shall be given an opportunity of establishing that he was not
in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking ... if the accused
fails to establish that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the
purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the offence as charged....

 

17.              In determining the meaning of these words,
it is helpful to consider in a general sense the nature of presumptions.
Presumptions can be classified into two general categories: presumptions without
basic facts and presumptions with basic facts. A presumption without a
basic fact is simply a conclusion which is to be drawn until the contrary is
proved. A presumption with a basic fact entails a conclusion to be drawn upon
proof of the basic fact (see Cross on Evidence, 5th ed., at pp. 122‑23).

 

18.              Basic fact presumptions can be further
categorized into permissive and mandatory presumptions. A permissive
presumption leaves it optional as to whether the inference of the presumed fact
is drawn following proof of the basic fact. A mandatory presumption requires
that the inference be made.

 

19.              Presumptions may also be either rebuttable
or irrebuttable. If a presumption is rebuttable, there are three potential ways
the presumed fact can be rebutted. First, the accused may be required merely to
raise a reasonable doubt as to its existence. Secondly, the accused may have an
evidentiary burden to adduce sufficient evidence to bring into question the
truth of the presumed fact. Thirdly, the accused may have a legal or persuasive
burden to prove on a balance of probabilities the non‑existence of the presumed
fact.

 

20.              Finally, presumptions are often referred
to as either presumptions of law or presumptions of fact. The latter entail
""frequently recurring examples of circumstantial evidence"" (Cross
on Evidence, supra, at p. 124) while the former involve actual legal
rules.

 

21.              To return to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, it is my view that, upon a finding beyond a reasonable doubt
of possession of a narcotic, the accused has the legal burden of proving on a
balance of probabilities that he or she was not in possession of the narcotic
for the purpose of trafficking. Once the basic fact of possession is proven, a
mandatory presumption of law arises against the accused that he or she had the
intention to traffic. Moreover, the accused will be found guilty of the offence
of trafficking unless he or she can rebut this presumption on a balance of
probabilities. This interpretation of s. 8 is supported by the courts in a
number of jurisdictions: R. v. Carroll (1983), 147 D.L.R. (3d) 92
(P.E.I.S.C. in banco); R. v. Cook (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 419
(N.S.C.A.); R. v. O’Day (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 227 (N.B.C.A.); R. v.
Landry (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 555 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Stanger (1983),
7 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (Alta. C.A.) 

 

22.              In some decisions it has been held that s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act is constitutional because it places only
an evidentiary burden rather than a legal burden on the accused. The ultimate
legal burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains with the Crown
and the presumption of innocence is not offended. (R. v. Therrien
(1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 31 (Ont. Co. Ct.); R. v. Fraser (1982), 138
D.L.R. (3d) 488 (Sask. Q.B.); R. v. Kupczyniski, (June 23, 1982,
unreported, Ont. Co. Ct.))

 

23.              This same approach was relied on in R.
v. Sharpe (1961), 131 C.C.C. 75 (Ont. C.A.), a Canadian Bill of Rights
decision on the presumption of innocence. In that case, a provision in the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, similar to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, was interpreted as shifting merely the secondary burden of
adducing evidence onto the accused. The primary onus remained with the Crown.
In R. v. Silk, [1970] 3 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (B.C.C.A.), the British Columbia
Court of Appeal held that s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
had not been infringed because s. 33  of the Food and Drugs Act , (now
R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑27, s. 35) required only that an accused raise a
reasonable doubt that the purpose of his or her possession was trafficking.
This decision, however, was not followed in R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R.
303, nor in R. v. Erdman (1971), 24 C.R.N.S. 216 (B.C.C.A.)

 

24.              Those decisions which have held that only
the secondary or evidentiary burden shifts are not persuasive with respect to
the Narcotic Control Act. As Ritchie J. found in R. v. Appleby, supra,
(though addressing a different statutory provision) the phrase ""to
establish"" is the equivalent of ""to prove"". The legislature, by using
the word ""establish"" in s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act,
intended to impose a legal burden on the accused. This is most apparent in the
words ""if the accused fails to establish that he was not in possession of
the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the
offence as charged"".

 

25.              In the Appleby case, Ritchie J.
also held that the accused is required to disprove the presumed fact according
to the civil standard of proof, on a balance of probabilities. He rejected the
criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, relying, inter alia,
upon the following passage from the House of Lords' decision in Public
Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj, [1970] 2 W.L.R. 226, at p. 232: 

 

                   Generally
speaking, no onus lies upon a defendant in criminal proceedings to prove or
disprove any fact: it is sufficient for his acquittal if any of the facts
which, if they existed, would constitute the offence with which he is charged
are ""not proved"". But exceptionally, as in the present case, an
enactment creating an offence expressly provides that if other facts are
proved, a particular fact, the existence of which is a necessary factual
ingredient of the offence, shall be presumed or deemed to exist ""unless
the contrary is proved"". In such a case the consequence of finding that
that particular fact is ""disproved"" will be an acquittal, whereas the
absence of such a finding will have the consequence of a conviction. Where this
is the consequence of a fact's being ""disproved"" there can be no
grounds in public policy for requiring that exceptional degree of certainty as
excludes all reasonable doubt that that fact does not exist. In their
Lordships' opinion the general rule applies in such a case and it is sufficient
if the court considers that upon the evidence before it it is more likely than
not that the fact does not exist. The test is the same as that applied in civil
proceedings: the balance of probabilities.

 

26.              I conclude that s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act contains a reverse onus provision imposing a legal burden on an
accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he or she was not in
possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. It is therefore
necessary to determine whether s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act offends
the right to be ""presumed innocent until proven guilty"" as guaranteed
by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

(b)               The Presumption of Innocence and s. 11 (d)
of the Charter 

 

27.              Section 11 (d) of the Charter 
constitutionally entrenches the presumption of innocence as part of the supreme
law of Canada. For ease of reference, I set out this provision again:

 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal.

 

28.              To interpret the meaning of s. 11 (d),
it is important to adopt a purposive approach. As this Court stated in R. v.
Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344:

 

The meaning of a right or
freedom guaranteed by the Charter  was to be ascertained by an analysis
of the purpose of such a guarantee; it was to be understood, in other
words, in the light of the interests it was meant to protect.

 

                   In my
view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom
in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the larger
objects of the Charter  itself, to the language chosen to articulate the
specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined,
and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights
and freedoms....

 

To identify the underlying purpose of the Charter  right in
question, therefore, it is important to begin by understanding the cardinal
values it embodies. 

 

29.              The presumption of innocence is a hallowed
principle lying at the very heart of criminal law. Although protected expressly
in s. 11 (d) of the Charter , the presumption of innocence is
referable and integral to the general protection of life, liberty and security
of the person contained in s. 7  of the Charter  (see Re B.C. Motor
Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, per Lamer J.) The presumption of
innocence protects the fundamental liberty and human dignity of any and every
person accused by the State of criminal conduct. An individual charged with a
criminal offence faces grave social and personal consequences, including
potential loss of physical liberty, subjection to social stigma and ostracism
from the community, as well as other social, psychological and economic harms.
In light of the gravity of these consequences, the presumption of innocence is
crucial. It ensures that until the State proves an accused's guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt, he or she is innocent. This is essential in a society
committed to fairness and social justice. The presumption of innocence confirms
our faith in humankind; it reflects our belief that individuals are decent and
law‑abiding members of the community until proven otherwise.

 

30.              The presumption of innocence has enjoyed
longstanding recognition at common law. In the leading case, Woolmington v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462 (H.L.), Viscount Sankey
wrote at pp. 481‑82:

 

Throughout the web of the
English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the
duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have
already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory
exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a
reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or
the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious
intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is
entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the
principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of
the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.

 

Subsequent Canadian cases have cited the Woolmington principle
with approval (see, for example, Manchuk v. The King, [1938] S.C.R. 341,
at p. 349; R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at p.
1316).

 

31.              Further evidence of the widespread
acceptance of the principle of the presumption of innocence is its inclusion in
the major international human rights documents. Article 11(I) of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted December 10, 1948 by the General
Assembly of the United Nations, provides:

 

                                                             Article 11 

 

I. Everyone charged with a
penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty
according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees
necessary for his defence.

 

In the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
1966, art. 14(2) states: 

 

                                                             Article 14

 

2. Everyone charged with a
criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved
guilty according to law.

 

Canada acceded to this Covenant, and the Optional Protocol which sets
up machinery for implementing the Covenant, on May 19, 1976. Both came into
effect on August 19, 1976.

 

32.              In light of the above, the right to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty requires that s. 11 (d) have, at a
minimum, the following content. First, an individual must be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, it is the State which must bear the burden
of proof. As Lamer J. stated in Dubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
350, at p. 357:

 

                   Section
11 (d) imposes upon the Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt as well as that of making out the case against the
accused before he or she need respond, either by testifying or calling other
evidence.

 

Third, criminal prosecutions must be carried out in accordance with
lawful procedures and fairness. The latter part of s. 11 (d), which
requires the proof of guilt ""according to law in a fair and public hearing
by an independent and impartial tribunal"", underlines the importance of
this procedural requirement.

 

(c)               Authorities on Reverse Onus Provisions and
the Presumption of Innocence

 

33.              Having considered the general meaning of
the presumption of innocence, it is now, I think, desirable to review briefly
the authorities on reverse onus clauses in Canada and other jurisdictions.

 

(i)                The
Canadian Bill of Rights Jurisprudence

 

34.              Section 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, which safeguards the presumption of innocence, provides:

 

                   2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act
of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian
Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of
the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no
law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 

(f) deprive a
person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an
independent and impartial tribunal....

 

The wording of this section closely parallels that of s. 11 (d).
For this reason, one of the Crown's primary contentions is that the Canadian
Bill of Rights jurisprudence should be determinative of the outcome of the
present appeal.

 

35.              The leading case decided under s. 2(f)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights and relied on by the Crown, is R. v.
Appleby, supra. In that case, the accused had challenged s. 224A(1)(a)
(now s. 237(1)(a)) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
which imposes a burden upon an accused to prove that he or she, though
occupying the driver's seat, did not enter the vehicle for the purpose of
setting it in motion and did not, therefore, have care and control. This Court
rejected the arguments of the accused that s. 2(f) had been violated; it
relied on the Woolmington case which held that the presumption of
innocence was subject to ""statutory exceptions"". As Ritchie J. stated
in his judgment for the majority at pp. 315‑16:

 

It seems to me, therefore,
that if Woolmington's case is to be accepted, the words ""presumed
innocent until proved guilty according to law ..."" as they appear in
s. 2(f) of the Bill of Rights, must be taken to envisage a
law which recognizes the existence of statutory exceptions reversing the onus
of proof with respect to one or more ingredients of an offence in cases where
certain specific facts have been proved by the Crown in relation to such
ingredients.

 

36.              In a concurring opinion, Laskin J. (as he
then was) put forward an alternative test. He chose not to follow Ritchie J.'s
approach of reading a statutory exception limitation into the phrase
""according to law"" in s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights, and said at p. 317:

 

                   I do
not construe s. 2(f) as self‑defeating because of the phrase
""according to law"" which appears therein. Hence, it would be
offensive to s. 2(f) for a federal criminal enactment to place upon the
accused the ultimate burden of establishing his innocence with respect to any
element of the offence charged. The ""right to be presumed innocent"",
of which s. 2(f) speaks, is, in popular terms, a way of expressing the
fact that the Crown has the ultimate burden of establishing guilt; if there is
any reasonable doubt at the conclusion of the case on any element of the
offence charged, an accused person must be acquitted. In a more refined sense,
the presumption of innocence gives an accused the initial benefit of a right of
silence and the ultimate benefit (after the Crown's evidence is in and as well
any evidence tendered on behalf of the accused) of any reasonable doubt: see Coffin
v. U.S. (1895), 156 U.S. 432 at 452.

 

Nevertheless, Laskin J. went on to hold that the presumption of
innocence is not violated by ""any statutory or non‑statutory burden
upon an accused to adduce evidence to neutralize, or counter on a balance of
probabilities, the effect of evidence presented by the Crown"" (p. 318).
The test, according to Laskin J., is whether the legislative provision calls
for a finding of guilt even though there is a reasonable doubt as to the
culpability of the accused. This would seem to prohibit the imposition of any
legal burden on the accused; however, Laskin J. upheld a statutory provision
which would appear to have done precisely that.

 

37.              In a subsequent case, R. v. Shelley,
supra, involving a reverse onus provision regarding unlawful
importation, Laskin C.J. discussed further the views he had articulated in Appleby
at p. 200:

 

                   This
Court held in R. v. Appleby that a reverse onus provision, which goes no
farther than to require an accused to offer proof on a balance of
probabilities, does not necessarily violate the presumption of innocence under
s. 2(f). It would, of course, be clearly incompatible with s. 2(f)
for a statute to put upon an accused a reverse onus of proving a fact in issue
beyond a reasonable doubt. In so far as the onus goes no farther than to
require an accused to prove as essential fact upon a balance of probabilities,
the essential fact must be one which is rationally open to the accused to prove
or disprove, as the case may be. If it is one which an accused cannot
reasonably be expected to prove, being beyond his knowledge or beyond what he
may reasonably be expected to know, it amounts to a requirement that is
impossible to meet. 

 

In addition, Laskin C.J. sowed the seeds for the development of a
""rational connection test"" for determining the validity of a reverse
onus provision when he stated at p. 202:

 

                   It is
evident to me in this case that there is on the record no rational or necessary
connection between the fact proved, i.e. possession of goods of foreign
origin, and the conclusion of unlawful importation which the accused under s.
248(1) must, to avoid conviction, disprove.

 

38.              Although there are important lessons to be
learned from the Canadian Bill of Rights jurisprudence, it does not
constitute binding authority in relation to the constitutional interpretation
of the Charter . As this Court held in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.,
supra, the Charter , as a constitutional document, is fundamentally
different from the statutory Canadian Bill of Rights, which was
interpreted as simply recognizing and declaring existing rights. (See also Singh
v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177 per
Wilson J.; R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, per Le Dain J.) In
rejecting the Canadian Bill of Rights religion cases as determinative of
the meaning of freedom of religion under the Charter  in R. v. Big M
Drug Mart Ltd., the Court had occasion to say at pp. 343‑44:

 

I agree with the submission
of the respondent that the Charter  is intended to set a standard upon
which present as well as future legislation is to be tested. Therefore
the meaning of the concept of freedom of conscience and religion is not to be
determined solely by the degree to which that right was enjoyed by Canadians
prior to the proclamation of the Charter . For this reason, Robertson
and Rosetanni, supra, cannot be determinative of the meaning of
""freedom of conscience and religion"" under the Charter . We
must look, rather, to the distinctive principles of constitutional
interpretation appropriate to expounding the supreme law of Canada.

 

39.              With this in mind, one cannot but question
the appropriateness of reading into the phrase ""according to law"" in
s. 11 (d) of the Charter  the statutory exceptions acknowledged in Woolmington
and in Appleby. The Woolmington case was decided in the context
of a legal system with no constitutionally entrenched human rights document. In
Canada, we have tempered parliamentary supremacy by entrenching important
rights and freedoms in the Constitution. Viscount Sankey's statutory exception
proviso is clearly not applicable in this context and would subvert the very
purpose of the entrenchment of the presumption of innocence in the Charter .
I do not, therefore, feel constrained in this case by the interpretation of s.
2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights presented in the majority
judgment in Appleby. Section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is not
rendered constitutionally valid simply by virtue of the fact that it is a
statutory provision.

 

(ii)               Canadian
Charter Jurisprudence

 

40.              In addition to the present case, there
have been a number of other provincial appellate level judgments addressing the
meaning of the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d). This
jurisprudence provides a comprehensive and persuasive source of insight into
the questions raised in this appeal. In particular, six appellate level courts,
in addition to the Ontario Court of Appeal, have held that s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act violates the Charter : R. v. Carroll, supra;
R. v. Cook, supra; R. v. O’Day, supra; R. v.
Stanger, supra; R. v. Landry, supra; R. v. Stock
(1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 319 (B.C.C.A.) 

 

41.              Following the decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in the present case, the Prince Edward Island Supreme Court (in
banco) rendered its decision in R. v. Carroll, supra.
Writing for the majority, MacDonald J. held at p. 105:

 

Unless a provision falls
within s. 1  of the Charter , there cannot be a requirement that an accused must
prove an essential positive element of the Crown's case other than by raising a
reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence cannot be said to exist if by
shifting the persuasive burden the court is required to convict even if a
reasonable doubt may be said to exist.

 

In a concurring judgment, Mitchell J. commented at pp. 107‑08:

 

                   Section
11 (d) gives an accused person the right to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty. It follows that if an accused is to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty, he must not be convicted unless and until the Crown has proven
each and all of the elements necessary to constitute the crime.

 

Applying these legal conclusions to s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act,
the Court held that s. 11 (d) had been violated. As Mitchell J. stated at
p. 108:

 

                   Under
s. 8 an accused is not presumed innocent until proven guilty. He is only
presumed innocent until found in possession. Once the Crown proves the accused had
possession of the narcotic, he is presumed to be guilty of an intention to
traffic until he proves otherwise.

 

42.              The Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appellate
Division, also concluded that s. 8 is an unconstitutional violation of the s.
11 (d) presumption of innocence in its decision in R. v. Cook, supra.
After reviewing R. v. Oakes, supra, and R. v. Carroll, supra,
Hart J.A. concluded at pp. 435‑36:

 

                   Section
8 of the Narcotic Control Act is a piece of legislation that attempts to
relieve the Crown of its normal burden of proof by use of what is known as a
reverse onus. Different types of reverse onus have been known to the law and
proof of a case with the aid of a reverse onus can in my opinion, fall into the
wording of s. 11 (d) of the Charter  as being proof ""according
to law"".... I know of no justification, however, for holding that it would
be ""according to law"" to allow use of a reverse onus clause which
permitted the Crown the assistance of a provision which relieved it from
calling any probative evidence to establish one of the essential elements of an
offence.

 

Although concurring in result, Jones J.A. maintained that the
reasonableness test should be applied with respect to s. 1  and not with respect
to the words ""according to law"" in s. 11 (d).

 

The test of reasonableness
should be available in considering the secondary question under s. 1  of the
Charter . It is important that the burden of proof should be on the Crown to
show that a statute which violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. (p. 439)

 

43.              In R. v. O’Day, supra, the
New Brunswick Court of Appeal struck down s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
and registered its agreement with the three earlier provincial appellate level
courts. 

 

44.              The Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.
Stanger, supra, also found s. 8 unconstitutional; however, the court
was not unanimous in this conclusion. On the meaning of s. 11 (d),
Stevenson J.A., writing for the majority, paraphrased Martin J.A.'s comment in Oakes
and stated at p. 351 that the presumption of innocence meant ""first, that
an accused is innocent until proven guilty in accordance with established procedure,
and secondly, that guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt"". Mr.
Justice Stevenson also cited MacDonald J.'s comment in Carroll that the
presumption of innocence is maintained ""as long as the prosecution has the
final burden of establishing guilt, on any element of the offence charged,
beyond a reasonable doubt"" (supra, p. 98).

 

45.              I should add that the majority, in Stanger,
correctly rejected the applicability of the Privy Council decision in Ong Ah
Chuan v. Public Prosecutor, [1981] A.C. 648. That case concerned
constitutional provisions of Singapore which are significantly different from
those of the Charter ; in particular, they do not contain an explicit
endorsement of the presumption of innocence. Moreover, the Privy Council did
not read this principle into the general due process protections of the
Constitution of Singapore.

 

46.              In R. v. Landry, supra, the
Quebec Court of Appeal invalidated s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act and
extended its conclusions to s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.
As Malouf J.A. stated at p. 561:

 

                   Both
the Bill of Rights and the Charter  recognize the right of an accused to
be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. I cannot accept that
such a basic and fundamental principle can be set aside by such a reverse onus
provision.

 

47.              Finally, in a very brief judgment, R.
v. Stock, supra, the British Columbia Court of Appeal concurred with
the Court of Appeal decisions reviewed above, endorsing in particular the
Ontario Court of Appeal decision in Oakes. An earlier British Columbia
Court of Appeal opinion, Re Anson and The Queen (1983), 146 D.L.R. (3d)
661 (B.C.C.A.), had dismissed an appeal from a ruling which had upheld the
constitutionality of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act; however, the
basis for the denial of the appeal was procedural. The court did not assess the
constitutionality of s. 8 in relation to the presumption of innocence.

 

48.              There have also been a number of cases in
which the meaning of s. 11 (d) has been considered in relation to other
legislative provisions; see, for example, R. v. Holmes (1983), 41 O.R.
(2d) 250 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Whyte (1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 277 (B.C.C.A.),
leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted; R. v. Lee’s Poultry Ltd. (1985), 17
C.C.C. 539 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. T. (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 125 (N.S.C.A.); R.
v. Kowalczuk (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 25 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Schwartz
(1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Man. C.A.); Re Boyle and The Queen (1983), 41
O.R. (2d) 713 (Ont. C.A.) 

 

49.              To summarize, the Canadian Charter 
jurisprudence on the presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d) and reverse
onus provisions appears to have solidly accorded a high degree of protection to
the presumption of innocence. Any infringements of this right are permissible
only when, in the words of s. 1  of the Charter , they are reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

(iii)               United
States Jurisprudence

 

50.              In the United States, protection of the
presumption of innocence is not explicit. Rather, it has been read into the
""due process"" provisions of the American Bill of Rights
contained in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the
United States of America. An extensive review of the United States case law
is provided in Martin J.A.'s judgment for the Ontario Court of Appeal. I will,
therefore, merely highlight the major jurisprudential developments.

 

51.              In Tot v. United States, 319 U.S.
463 (1943), Roberts J. outlined the following test at pp. 467‑68:

 

... a statutory
presumption cannot be sustained if there be no rational connection between the
fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, if the inference of the one from
proof of the other is arbitrary because of lack of connnection between the two
in common experience.

 

The comparative convenience of producing evidence was also acknowledged
as a corollary test. The case involved a presumption to be drawn, from the
possession of firearms by a person convicted of a previous crime of violence,
that the firearms were illegally obtained through interstate or foreign
commerce. Of note was Roberts J.'s comment that even if a rational connection
had been proved, the statutory presumption could not be sustained because of
the prejudical reliance on a past conviction as part of the basic fact. The
accused would be discredited in the eyes of the jury even before he attempted
to disprove the presumed fact.

 

52.              In Leary v. United States, 395 U.S.
6 (1969), Harlan J. articulated a more stringent test for invalidity at p. 36:

 

... a criminal statutory
presumption must be regarded as ""irrational"" or
""arbitrary"", and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be
said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not
to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.

 

Harlan J. also noted that since the statutory presumption was invalid
under the above test, ""we need not reach the question whether a criminal
presumption which passes muster when so judged must also satisfy the criminal
`reasonable doubt' standard if proof of the crime charged or an essential
element thereof depends upon its use"" (footnote 64). 

 

53.              The United States Supreme Court did answer
this question in County Court of Ulster County, New York v. Allen, 442
U.S. 140 (1979). It held that where a mandatory criminal presumption was
imposed by statute, the State may not ""rest its case entirely on a
presumption unless the fact proved is sufficient to support the inference of
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"" (p. 167). A mere rational connection is
insufficient. This case illustrates the high degree of constitutional
protection accorded the principle that an accused must be found guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. The rationale for this is well stated by Brennan J. in
In Re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970), at pp. 363‑64:

 

                   The
requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has this vital role in our
criminal procedure for cogent reasons. The accused during a criminal
prosecution has at stake interests of immense importance, both because of the
possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the
certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction. Accordingly, a
society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not
condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about
his guilt.

 

(iv)              European
Convention on Human Rights Jurisprudence

 

54.              As mentioned above, international
developments in human rights law have afforded protection to the principle of
the presumption of innocence. The jurisprudence on The European Convention
on Human Rights includes a consideration of the legitimacy of reverse onus
provisions. Section 6(2) of The European Convention on Human Rights
reads:

 

                                                              Article 6

 

2. Everyone charged with a
criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to
law.

 

The meaning of s. 6(2) was clarified in the Pfunders Case (Austria
v. Italy) (1963), 6 Yearbook E.C.H.R. 740, at p. 782 and p. 784:

 

                   This
text, according to which everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be
presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law, requires firstly that
court judges in fulfilling their duties should not start with the conviction or
assumption that the accused committed the act with which he is charged. In
other words, the onus to prove guilt falls upon the Prosecution, and any doubt
is to the benefit of the accused. Moreover, the judges must permit the latter
to produce evidence in rebuttal. In their judgment they can find him guilty
only on the basis of direct or indirect evidence sufficiently strong in the
eyes of the law to establish his guilt.

 

55.              Although the Commission has endorsed the
general importance of the requirement that the prosecution prove the accused's
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it has acknowledged the permissibility of certain
exceptions to this principle. For example, the Commission upheld a statutory
reverse onus provision in which a man living with or habitually in the company
of a prostitute is presumed to be knowingly living on the earnings of
prostitution unless he proves otherwise (X against the United Kingdom,
Appl'n. No. 5124/71, Collection of Decisions, E.C.H.R., 135). The Commission
noted the importance of examining the substance and effect of a statutory
reverse onus. It concluded, however, at p. 135: 

 

The statutory presumption
in the present case is restrictively worded. ... The presumption is neither
irrebuttable nor unreasonable. To oblige the prosecution to obtain direct
evidence of ""living on immoral earnings"" would in most cases make its
task impossible.

 

(See discussion in Francis Jacobs, The European Convention on Human
Rights (Oxford: 1975), pp. 113‑14.)

 

(d)               Conclusion Regarding s. 11(d) of the Charter 
and s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act

 

56.              This review of the authorities lays the
groundwork for formulating some general conclusions regarding reverse onus
provisions and the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d). We can then
proceed to apply these principles to the particulars of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act.

 

57.              In general one must, I think, conclude
that a provision which requires an accused to disprove on a balance of
probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an important element
of the offence in question, violates the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d).
If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance of probabilities an
essential element of an offence, it would be possible for a conviction to occur
despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. This would arise if the accused adduced
sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but
did not convince the jury on a balance of probabilities that the presumed fact
was untrue.

 

58.              The fact that the standard is only the
civil one does not render a reverse onus clause constitutional. As Sir Rupert
Cross commented in the Rede Lectures, ""The Golden Thread of the
English Criminal Law: The Burden of Proof"", delivered in 1976 at the
University of Toronto, at pp. 11‑13:

 

                   It is
sometimes said that exceptions to the Woolmington rule are acceptable because,
whenever the burden of proof on any issue in a criminal case is borne by the
accused, he only has to satisfy the jury on the balance of probabilities,
whereas on issues on which the Crown bears the burden of proof the jury must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.... The fact that the standard is
lower when the accused bears the burden of proof than it is when the burden of
proof is borne by the prosecution is no answer to my objection to the existence
of exceptions to the Woolmington rule as it does not alter the fact that a jury
or bench of magistrates may have to convict the accused although they are far
from sure of his guilt.

 

59.              As we have seen, the potential for a
rational connection between the basic fact and the presumed fact to justify a
reverse onus provision has been elaborated in some of the cases discussed above
and is now known as the ""rational connection test"". In the context of
s. 11(d), however, the following question arises: if we apply the
rational connection test to the consideration of whether s. 11(d) has
been violated, are we adequately protecting the constitutional principle of the
presumption of innocence? As Professors MacKay and Cromwell point out in their
article ""Oakes: A Bold Initiative Impeded by Old Ghosts"" (1983), 32
C.R. (3d) 221, at p. 233: 

 

The rational connection
test approves a provision that forces the trier to infer a fact that may
be simply rationally connected to the proved fact. Why does it follow that such
a provision does not offend the constitutional right to be proved guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt?

 

A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a presumed fact, but not
prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt. An accused person could thereby
be convicted despite the presence of a reasonable doubt. This would violate the
presumption of innocence.

 

60.              I should add that this questioning of the
constitutionality of the ""rational connection test"" as a guide to
interpreting s. 11(d) does not minimize its importance. The appropriate
stage for invoking the rational connection test, however, is under s. 1  of the Charter .
This consideration did not arise under the Canadian Bill of Rights
because of the absence of an equivalent to s. 1 . At the Court of Appeal level
in the present case, Martin J.A. sought to combine the analysis of s. 11 (d)
and s. 1  to overcome the limitations of the Canadian Bill of Rights
jurisprudence. To my mind, it is highly desirable to keep s. 1  and s. 11 (d)
analytically distinct. Separating the analysis into two components is
consistent with the approach this Court has taken to the Charter  to date
(see R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra; Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1
S.C.R. 357).

 

61.              To return to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, I am in no doubt whatsoever that it violates s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  by requiring the accused to prove on a balance of
probabilities that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking. Mr. Oakes is compelled by s. 8  to prove he is not guilty of
the offence of trafficking. He is thus denied his right to be presumed innocent
and subjected to the potential penalty of life imprisonment unless he can rebut
the presumption. This is radically and fundamentally inconsistent with the
societal values of human dignity and liberty which we espouse, and is directly
contrary to the presumption of innocence enshrined in s. 11 (d). Let us
turn now to s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                                                                    V

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act a Reasonable and
Demonstrably Justified Limit Pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

62.              The Crown submits that even if s. 8 of the
Narcotic Control Act violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter , it
can still be upheld as a reasonable limit under s. 1  which, as has been
mentioned, provides:

 

                   1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the
rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. 

 

The question whether the limit is ""prescribed by law"" is not
contentious in the present case since s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
is a duly enacted legislative provision. It is, however, necessary to determine
if the limit on Mr. Oakes' right, as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
is ""reasonable"" and ""demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society"" for the purpose of s. 1  of the Charter , and
thereby saved from inconsistency with the Constitution.

 

63.              It is important to observe at the outset
that s. 1  has two functions: first, it constitutionally guarantees the rights
and freedoms set out in the provisions which follow; and, second, it states
explicitly the exclusive justificatory criteria (outside of s. 33  of the Constitution
Act, 1982 ) against which limitations on those rights and freedoms must be
measured. Accordingly, any s. 1  inquiry must be premised on an understanding
that the impugned limit violates constitutional rights and freedoms‑‑rights
and freedoms which are part of the supreme law of Canada. As Wilson J. stated
in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, supra, at p.
218: ""... it is important to remember that the courts are conducting this
inquiry in light of a commitment to uphold the rights and freedoms set out in
the other sections of the Charter .""

 

64.              A second contextual element of
interpretation of s. 1  is provided by the words ""free and democratic
society"". Inclusion of these words as the final standard of justification
for limits on rights and freedoms refers the Court to the very purpose for
which the Charter  was originally entrenched in the Constitution:
Canadian society is to be free and democratic. The Court must be guided by the
values and principles essential to a free and democratic society which I
believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the
human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a
wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in
social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals
and groups in society. The underlying values and principles of a free and
democratic society are the genesis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the
Charter  and the ultimate standard against which a limit on a right or
freedom must be shown, despite its effect, to be reasonable and demonstrably
justified.

 

65.              The rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter 
are not, however, absolute. It may become necessary to limit rights and
freedoms in circumstances where their exercise would be inimical to the
realization of collective goals of fundamental importance. For this reason, s.
1  provides criteria of justification for limits on the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by the Charter . These criteria impose a stringent standard of
justification, especially when understood in terms of the two contextual
considerations discussed above, namely, the violation of a constitutionally
guaranteed right or freedom and the fundamental principles of a free and
democratic society. 

 

66.              The onus of proving that a limit on a
right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter  is reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society rests upon the party
seeking to uphold the limitation. It is clear from the text of s. 1  that limits
on the rights and freedoms enumerated in the Charter  are exceptions to
their general guarantee. The presumption is that the rights and freedoms are
guaranteed unless the party invoking s. 1  can bring itself within the
exceptional criteria which justify their being limited. This is further
substantiated by the use of the word ""demonstra­bly"" which clearly
indicates that the onus of justification is on the party seeking to limit: Hunter
v. Southam Inc., supra.

 

67.              The standard of proof under s. 1  is the
civil standard, namely, proof by a preponderance of probability. The
alternative criminal standard, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, would, in my
view, be unduly onerous on the party seeking to limit. Concepts such as ""reasonableness"",
""justifiability"" and ""free and democratic society"" are
simply not amenable to such a standard. Nevertheless, the preponderance of
probability test must be applied rigorously. Indeed, the phrase
""demonstrably justified"" in s. 1  of the Charter  supports this
conclusion. Within the broad category of the civil standard, there exist
different degrees of probability depending on the nature of the case: see
Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases (Toronto:
1974), at p. 385. As Lord Denning explained in Bater v. Bater, [1950] 2
All E.R. 458 (C.A.), at p. 459:

 

The case may be proved by
a preponderance of probability, but there may be degrees of probability within
that standard. The degree depends on the subject‑matter. A civil court, when
considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require a higher degree of
probability than that which it would require if considering whether negligence
were established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even
when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature, but still it does require
a degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion.

 

This passage was cited with approval in Hanes v. Wawanesa Mutual
Insurance Co., [1963] S.C.R. 154, at p. 161. A similar approach was put
forward by Cartwright J. in Smith v. Smith, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 312, at pp.
331‑32:

 

I wish, however, to
emphasize that in every civil action before the tribunal can safely find the
affirmative of an issue of fact required to be proved it must be reasonably
satisfied, and that whether or not it will be so satisfied must depend on the
totality of the circumstances on which its judgment is formed including the
gravity of the consequences....

 

68.              Having regard to the fact that s. 1  is
being invoked for the purpose of justifying a violation of the constitutional
rights and freedoms the Charter  was designed to protect, a very high
degree of probability will be, in the words of Lord Denning, ""commensurate
with the occasion"". Where evidence is required in order to prove the
constituent elements of a s. 1  inquiry, and this will generally be the case, it
should be cogent and persuasive and make clear to the Court the consequences of
imposing or not imposing the limit. See: Law Society of Upper Canada v.
Skapinker, supra, at p. 384; Singh v. Minister of Employment and
Immigration, supra, at p. 217. A court will also need to know what
alternative measures for implementing the objective were available to the
legislators when they made their decisions. I should add, however, that there
may be cases where certain elements of the s. 1  analysis are obvious or self‑evident.


 

69.              To establish that a limit is reasonable
and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, two central
criteria must be satisfied. First, the objective, which the measures
responsible for a limit on a Charter  right or freedom are designed to
serve, must be ""of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a
constitutionally protected right or freedom"": R. v. Big M Drug Mart
Ltd., supra, at p. 352. The standard must be high in order to ensure
that objectives which are trivial or discordant with the principles integral to
a free and democratic society do not gain s. 1  protection. It is necessary, at
a minimum, that an objective relate to concerns which are pressing and
substantial in a free and democratic society before it can be characterized as
sufficiently important.

 

70.              Second, once a sufficiently significant
objective is recognized, then the party invoking s. 1  must show that the means
chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified. This involves ""a form of
proportionality test"": R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at
p. 352. Although the nature of the proportionality test will vary depending on
the circumstances, in each case courts will be required to balance the
interests of society with those of individuals and groups. There are, in my
view, three important components of a proportionality test. First, the measures
adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They
must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. In short,
they must be rationally connected to the objective. Second, the means, even if
rationally connected to the objective in this first sense, should impair
""as little as possible"" the right or freedom in question: R. v.
Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p. 352. Third, there must be
a proportionality between the effects of the measures which are
responsible for limiting the Charter  right or freedom, and the objective
which has been identified as of ""sufficient importance"". 

 

71.              With respect to the third component, it is
clear that the general effect of any measure impugned under s. 1  will be the
infringement of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter ; this is
the reason why resort to s. 1  is necessary. The inquiry into effects must,
however, go further. A wide range of rights and freedoms are guaranteed by the Charter ,
and an almost infinite number of factual situations may arise in respect of
these. Some limits on rights and freedoms protected by the Charter  will
be more serious than others in terms of the nature of the right or freedom
violated, the extent of the violation, and the degree to which the measures
which impose the limit trench upon the integral principles of a free and
democratic society. Even if an objective is of sufficient importance, and the
first two elements of the proportionality test are satisfied, it is still
possible that, because of the severity of the deleterious effects of a measure
on individuals or groups, the measure will not be justified by the purposes it
is intended to serve. The more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the
more important the objective must be if the measure is to be reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

72.              Having outlined the general principles of
a s. 1  inquiry, we must apply them to s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act.
Is the reverse onus provision in s. 8 a reasonable limit on the right to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society?

 

73.              The starting point for formulating a
response to this question is, as stated above, the nature of Parliament's
interest or objective which accounts for the passage of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act. According to the Crown, s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
is aimed at curbing drug trafficking by facilitating the conviction of drug
traffickers. In my opinion, Parliament's concern that drug trafficking be
decreased can be characterized as substantial and pressing. The problem of drug
trafficking has been increasing since the 1950's at which time there was
already considerable concern. (See Report of the Special Committee on
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, Appendix to Debates of the Senate, Canada,
Session 1955, pp. 690‑700; see also Final Report of the Commission of
Inquiry into the Non‑Medical Use of Drugs (Ottawa, 1973).) Throughout
this period, numerous measures were adopted by free and democratic societies,
at both the international and national levels.

 

74.              At the international level, on June 23,
1953, the Protocol for Limiting and Regulating the Cultivation of the Poppy
Plant, the Production of, International and Wholesale Trade in, and Use of
Opium, to which Canada is a signatory, was adopted by the United Nations
Opium Conference held in New York. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,
1961, was acceded to in New York on March 30, 1961. This treaty was signed
by Canada on March 30, 1961. It entered into force on December 13, 1964. As
stated in the Preamble, ""addiction to narcotic drugs constitutes a serious
evil for the individual and is fraught with social and economic danger to
mankind,..."" 

 

75.              At the national level, statutory
provisions have been enacted by numerous countries which, inter alia,
attempt to deter drug trafficking by imposing criminal sanctions (see, for
example, Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, 1975 (N.Z.), No. 116; Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971, 1971 (U.K.), c. 38).

 

76.              The objective of protecting our society
from the grave ills associated with drug trafficking, is, in my view, one of
sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right
or freedom in certain cases. Moreover, the degree of seriousness of drug
trafficking makes its acknowledgement as a sufficiently important objective for
the purposes of s. 1 , to a large extent, self‑evident. The first
criterion of a s. 1  inquiry, therefore, has been satisfied by the Crown.

 

77.              The next stage of inquiry is a
consideration of the means chosen by Parliament to achieve its objective. The
means must be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. As outlined above, this proportionality test should begin with a
consideration of the rationality of the provision: is the reverse onus clause
in s. 8 rationally related to the objective of curbing drug trafficking? At a
minimum, this requires that s. 8 be internally rational; there must be a
rational connection between the basic fact of possession and the presumed fact
of possession for the purpose of trafficking. Otherwise, the reverse onus
clause could give rise to unjustified and erroneous convictions for drug
trafficking of persons guilty only of possession of narcotics.

 

78.              In my view, s. 8 does not survive this
rational connection test. As Martin J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal
concluded, possession of a small or negligible quantity of narcotics does not
support the inference of trafficking. In other words, it would be irrational to
infer that a person had an intent to traffic on the basis of his or her
possession of a very small quantity of narcotics. The presumption required
under s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is overinclusive and could lead
to results in certain cases which would defy both rationality and fairness. In
light of the seriousness of the offence in question, which carries with it the
possibility of imprisonment for life, I am further convinced that the first
component of the proportionality test has not been satisfied by the Crown.

 

79.              Having concluded that s. 8 does not
satisfy this first component of proportionality, it is unnecessary to consider
the other two components. 

 

                                                                   VI

 

Conclusion

 

80.              The Ontario Court of Appeal was correct in
holding that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act violates the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and is therefore of no force or effect.
Section 8  imposes a limit on the right guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
which is not reasonable and is not demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society for the purpose of s. 1 . Accordingly, the constitutional
question is answered as follows:

 

Question:

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and thus of no force and effect?

 

Answer: Yes.

 

81.              I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

82.              Estey

conclusions of the Chief Justice with reference to the relationship between s.
11 (d) and s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
For the disposition of all other issues arising in this appeal, I would adopt
the reasons given by Martin J.A. in the court below.

on appeal from the court of appeal for saskatchewan

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Jury verdict ‑‑
Validity ‑‑ Charge of attempted murder with lesser included
offences ‑‑ Jury foreman replying “not guilty” to clerk’s question ‑‑
Accused discharged and jury dismissed ‑‑ Foreman indicating
possible different verdict on lesser included offences ‑‑ Trial
judge finding himself functus ‑‑ Whether or not jury can be
reconvened to reconsider its verdict ‑‑ Whether or not jury can be
reconvened to complete or correct transmission and recording of verdict reached
prior to its dismissal.

 








                   Appellant was accused of attempted murder and tried
by judge and jury. The judge instructed the jury on a number of lesser included
offences, in addition to the charge on the indictment. After jury returned a
verdict of not guilty on the charge of attempted murder, the judge dismissed
them and discharged the accused. The foreman of the jury then indicated to the
judge that the jury may have found the accused guilty of a lesser included
offence. The judge had the jury reassemble in the body of the courtroom, heard
submissions, and then found that he was functus. The majority of the Court
of Appeal found that the doctrine of functus was not properly applied
here and was of the opinion that the jury verdict was not complete until all
possible verdicts had been dealt with and disposed of. The acquittal was set
aside and a new trial ordered on all of the lesser and included offences. At
issue here is whether the jury can be reconvened after being discharged (1) to
reconsider its verdict or (2) to complete or correct the transmission and
recording of a verdict it had arrived at prior to discharge.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Beetz, McIntyre, Chouinard, Wilson and La Forest JJ.: The nature of the
criminal process requires that the power or duty of the trial judge to
intervene when a jury verdict is returned and to inquire as to the true nature
of the verdict be exercised prior to the jury's discharge. 

 

                   The trial judge here could reasonably conclude that
the jury had considered the included offences and that its verdict was intended
to be a full acquittal on principal and included offences. The court was wholly
functus when the question arose as to verdict and the matter had passed
beyond any stage where any correction could be made.

 

                   Per Lamer J.: A jury,
even after discharge, can be reconvened to correct an improper or incomplete
transmission or registration of a verdict, but it cannot reconsider a verdict
or complete its deliberations with a view to handing down additional verdicts
on counts or on included offences that it had not finally determined prior to that
discharge; nor can anyone go behind the verdict and make inquiries as regards
the nature of the deliberations. The effect of adopting the rule, until now
applicable to civil matters, is to ensure that those found guilty by the jury
do not go free and, more importantly, that those found innocent by the jury are
not convicted.

 

                   The error here was in not ascertaining with
certainty the verdict on the lesser included offences. If that verdict were an
acquittal on all or any of the included offences, the accused should not be
deprived of that verdict because of error in its transmission or registration
but only if error of law was committed in the reaching of that verdict. The
ordering of a new trial is a remedy where the determination of guilt or
innocence by the trial court is vitiated by an error.

 

                   The logical disposition of the appeal would be to
allow the appeal, quash the order for a new trial, and order that the matter be
returned to the trial court so that the jury's verdict might be ascertained. In
view of the time elapsed since the jury's discharge, the ends of justice would
be better served by allowing the appeal, quashing the order for a new trial and
leaving the acquittal, as registered, undisturbed.

                   APPEAL from a judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 198, 34 Sask. R. 216, allowing an appeal from an
acquittal granted by Hrabinsky J., sitting with jury. Appeal allowed.

 

                   June Lancaster,
for the appellant.

 

                   Carol A. Snell,
for the respondent. 

 

                   The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre,
Chouinard, Wilson and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                McIntyre
J.‑‑I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for
judgment prepared by my colleague, Lamer J., in this appeal. I agree with him
that the acquittal recorded at trial should remain undisturbed. I arrive at
this conclusion on a somewhat narrower view of the trial judge's powers on the
return of a jury verdict in a criminal trial.

 

2.                The facts have been set out by Lamer J.
and I need not deal with them at great length. I would emphasize, however, that
during the course of his charge the trial judge instructed the jury on the
offence of attempted murder set out in the indictment, and upon certain
included offences on which the accused could be found guilty, depending upon
the view the jury took of the evidence. No issue has been raised as to the
adequacy of the charge. During the course of their deliberations, the jury
returned to the courtroom with a request for further instruction with respect
to included offences. The trial judge gave the requested direction and shortly
thereafter the jury returned with its verdict of not guilty. The trial judge,
having ascertained that the verdict was unanimous, discharged the prisoner,
discharged the jury, and adjourned the court until its next sitting day. No
question regarding the completeness of the jury's verdict arose until after the
prisoner and the jury had been discharged, and at least one member of the jury
left the others and entered the public part of the court.

 

3.                The law is well settled that a trial
judge, sitting with a jury, must instruct the jury on the principal offence or
offences charged in the indictment, as well as any included offences and the
verdicts that may be returned upon them. This principle emerges from R. v.
George, [1960] S.C.R. 871. The George case did not involve a jury
but the majority of the Court held that it was the duty of a trial judge, in
disposing of a criminal case, to consider all included offences of which there
is evidence, whether raised by counsel or not. It follows that when sitting
with a jury it is the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury with respect
to included offences. There are several cases which follow and apply this
principle: see R. v. Morehouse (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 231 (N.B.C.A.),
pp. 239‑40, where R. v. George, supra, was referred to, as
well as R. v. Longson (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 421 (B.C.C.A.)

 

4.                On the return of the jury if a clear and
unambiguous verdict is given, it is the judge's duty to accept the verdict and,
in accordance with the practice of his court, cause it to become a part of the
record of the court. Where the verdict is one of acquittal, the prisoner is
entitled to an immediate discharge unless subject to continued lawful detention
by reason of another cause or matter‑‑see: R. v. Blanchard,
[1941] 3 D.L.R. 467 (B.C.C.A.), and R. v. Hess (No. 2) (1949), 94 C.C.C.
57 (B.C.C.A.) In the Hess case, O'Halloran J.A., on a motion for bail by
an accused who had been acquitted in the Court of Appeal, but who had been held
pending a Crown appeal under the then s. 1025A  of the Criminal Code 
[enacted by S.C. 1938, c. 44, s. 49], said, at p. 63:

 

When the appeal court
quashes a conviction and does not order a new trial, and as here directs a
verdict of acquittal, the former convict is entitled to walk out of Court a
free man. 

 

This principle is so well grounded in law that further authority is
hardly necessary (but see: R. v. Lonar (1893), 25 N.S.R. 124 (N.S.C.A.),
and R. v. Smith (1893), 25 N.S.R. 138 (N.S.C.A.) The editors of Crankshaw's
Criminal Code (8th ed.) cite these cases for the proposition that upon
acquittal an accused is entitled to an immediate discharge from custody. Where
the verdict is one of guilt, the trial judge should proceed with the
appropriate sentencing procedures in order to complete the disposition of the
case.

 

5.                Where, on the other hand, there is
ambiguity in the verdict or where there is reason to doubt that the verdict is
unanimous, the trial judge should inquire into the matter to ascertain the true
position and, where necessary, he should give such further directions as may be
required and allow further deliberation by the jury to satisfy himself that any
verdict given will indeed be unanimous, complete and expressive of the actual
findings of the jury. The judge has the discretion in such a case to accept a
substituted or second verdict for the first one returned. This discretion,
however, is one which is to be exercised during the course of the trial, that
is, in the presence of the accused and his counsel, and prior to the
dissolution of the court by the discharge of the jury. In R. v. Ford
(1853), 3 U.C.C.P. 209, the jury returned a verdict and after it had been
discharged questions arose concerning the unanimity of the verdict. The court
refused to disturb the verdict and Macaulay C.J., with whom the other two
judges concurred, said, at p. 217‑18:

 

                   That a
jury may correct their verdict, or that any of them may withhold assent and
express dissent therefrom at any time before it is finally entered and
confirmed, is clear from numerous authorities; and the judge presiding over
a criminal court cannot be too cautious in being assured that, when a result so
serious to the party accused as a verdict of guilty is arrived at, all the jury
understand the effect and concur in the decision; and if at any moment, before
it is too late, anything occurs to excite suspicious on this subject, he
should carefully assure himself that there is no misapprehension in the matter.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Of interest on this point are Laforet v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
869, in this Court where the Ford case was referred to with approval and
discretionary powers of the trial judge were considered, and R. v. Thomas
(1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 464 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Bryan (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d)
342 (B.C.C.A.) It is clear, in my view, that the power or duty of the trial
judge to intervene when a jury verdict is returned and to make inquiries
relating to the true nature of the verdict is one to be exercised prior to the
discharge of the jury and, applying the words of Macaulay C.J. in Ford, supra,
""before it is too late"". It will be too late when the jury is
discharged and the court created for the trial of the accused has been
dissolved.

 

6.                It was argued that there is English
authority to the contrary. The respondent cited R. v. Carter, [1964] 1
All E.R. 187, 48 Cr. App. R. 122. In that case, the two appellants were
indicted on a single count, robbery with an offensive weapon. Though the
prosecutor referred to an alternate verdict of robbery with aggravation, it was
not left to the jury. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty of the offence
charged, whereupon the trial judge discharged the prisoners. The foreman of the
jury then raised the question of included offences and gave a verdict of guilty
of robbery with aggravation. The trial judge entered a conviction despite the
discharge of the prisoners. It was held in the Court of Appeal that the
conviction should stand. The jury was entitled to render the verdict on the
included offence without any direction by the judge. They had therefore not
completed their verdict when the prisoners were discharged and, accordingly,
the discharge was a nullity and the conviction could be recorded. 

 

7.                This is not our case. In Carter,
though the trial judge had discharged the prisoners, he had not discharged the
jury, and upon this basis it could be said, in the words of Lord Parker C.J.,
at p. 188:

 

...a verdict is not
complete until a jury has dealt with all the possible verdicts on the
indictment, and, if a judge discharges a prisoner before the jury have
completed their verdict, in the view of this court that discharge is a complete
nullity.

 

It will be observed that in the Carter case the prisoners were
discharged in the course of the trial while the court constituted for the trial
remained in existence. It was therefore open to the court to correct the
erroneous discharge and accept a verdict of guilt on the lesser offence. It had
not at that point become, in the words of Macaulay C.J. in Ford, supra,
""too late"" because of the discharge of the jury.

 

8.                Some support for the course of action
followed in Carter may be found in two early English cases: R. v.
Parkin (1824), 1 Mood. C.C. 45, and R. v. Vodden (1853), Dears. 229,
169 E.R. 706. They are cited in support of the statement in Halsbury’s Laws
of England (4th), vol. 11, p. 187, para. 321:

 

321. Correction of
verdict. If a verdict is entered which is not in accordance with
the intention of the jurors, the mistake may be corrected and a verdict entered
in accordance with their intention, or they may retire and reconsider the
question and bring in another verdict.

 

It is to be observed, however, that in neither of the two cases does it
appear that the jury had been discharged before it gave its corrected verdict
and these cases merely support the proposition, stated above, that prior to the
discharge of the jury corrections may be made.

 

9.                As has been noted by Lamer J., a wider
discretion has been accorded to judges presiding over civil trials than that
accorded in criminal trials. He has referred to authoritative cases where
judges, even after a discharge of the jury, have recalled jurors for the
purpose of rectifying error or for the clarification of recorded verdicts. I am
unable, however, to find any authority binding on this court which has ever
extended such a power to trial judges in criminal cases and I am of the opinion
that no such extension of the judicial control over juries should be allowed in
criminal cases. There is sound reason for this difference of approach to civil
matters. The civil trial results from a dispute between private parties. The
Crown is not involved. The state takes no part in the resolution of the dispute‑‑beyond
creating the forum for its settlement‑‑and the public generally has
no interest. The parties come to court and, if a jury has been chosen as a part
of the process, each party has a vital interest in securing its verdict in
order to bring to an end the expense and the asperities of litigation. It is in
pursuance of this objective that trial judges have been accorded the wider
discretion which is justifiable, since its purpose and effect is to resolve a
private dispute that is not otherwise of interest to the general public. The
criminal case is different. Here, the state and the general public have vital
interests in the administration of justice. The accused, of course, has a vital
interest in the outcome of his case. Accordingly, sound policy requires a
strict approach to the criminal process which will serve to recognize and
protect both the interests of the state and the public, and the particular interest
of the accused.

 

10.              Turning to the case at bar, it must be
accepted that the charge to the jury was adequate, both as to the principal
offence and as to the included offences. When the jury returned its verdict,
the foreman gave a clear anc completely unambiguous verdict of acquittal and it
was acknowledged, in accordance with accepted practice, by each member of the
jury. The jury had been charged once on included offences and had returned to
the courtroom after commencing deliberation for further instruction. It was
then in these circumstances a reasonable conclusion on the part of the trial
judge that the jury had considered the included offences and that the jury's
verdict was intended to be a full acquittal, including the principal and any
included offences. Even in these circumstances, it might have been wiser for
the trial judge to inquire from the foreman whether they had any verdict or
verdicts respecting the included offences, but I cannot say that it was
reversible error on his part to do as he did and discharge both the prisoner
and the jury. 

 

11.              I am aware that in Longson, supra,
I said, at p. 425, that it was the duty of the trial judge to tell the jury
that:

 

...if they are not
satisfied upon the guilt of the accused on the specific offence they must then
consider the included offence or offences of which they have been informed and
render a verdict upon them.

 

In the case at bar, however, where it was evident that the jury had
considered the included offences, and although to convict on one or more of the
included offences verdicts to that effect would be required, the clear verdict
of not guilty on the principal offence would justify the trial judge in
accepting the verdict as a complete acquittal and it would have that effect.

 

12.              This view finds support in Bower, The
Doctrine of Res Judicata (2nd ed. 1969), where the learned author, in
referring to the significance of a general acquittal when the offence charged
included other offences, said, at p. 273:

 

And there are other cases
in which the jury is authorized by statute, or the Common Law, to acquit the
accused of the offence of which he is charged, and to convict him of some other
offence of less degree. In such cases, if the jury return a verdict of
acquittal, the judgment following the verdict, whereby the accused is acquitted
of the major offence, is deemed to carry with it a judgment of acquittal on the
minor offence also.

 

The same proposition was expressed by Lord Morris of Borth‑y‑Gest
in Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1964] A.C. 1254, at p.
1305, in these words:

 

In my view, both principle
and authority establish: (1) that a man cannot be tried for a crime in respect
of which he has previously been acquitted or convicted; (2) that a man cannot
be tried for a crime in respect of which he could on some previous indictment
have been convicted....

 

and later, at p. 1312, he quoted:

 

Thus, an acquittal upon an
indictment for murder may be pleaded in bar of another indictment for
manslaughter: and an acquittal upon an indictment for burglary and larceny may
be pleaded to an indictment for the larceny of the same goods; because, in either
of these cases, the prisoner might, on the former trial, have been convicted of
the offence charged against him in the second indictment.

 

I am aware that Lord Morris was in the minority in the Connelly
case, but his views on this particular question were not out of harmony with
the majority. The same principle has found statutory expression in s. 537(2)  of
the Criminal Code .

 

13.              Lord Morris, Bower (2nd ed.), and s. 537
(2)  of the Criminal Code  all deal with the special plea of autrefois
acquit and that plea is not in issue in the case at bar, but the references
are helpful in that they illustrate the finality of a general acquittal and
support the position of the appellant.

 

14.              It follows from what I have said that the
accused is entitled to his acquittal. As described above, he was discharged and
the jury was discharged. The court was then adjourned. Accordingly, the court
which had jurisdiction to try the accused had been dissolved. It was wholly functus.
When the question arose as to the verdict, the matter had passed beyond the
stage where any correction could be made. I would therefore allow the appeal
and restore the acquittal. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

15.              Lamer
J.‑‑The issues in this case are the following: Once
discharged, can a jury be reconvened to, 1. reconsider its verdict; or 2.
complete or correct the transmission and recording of a verdict it had arrived
at prior to discharge?

 

The Facts

 

16.              The facts that gave rise to this appeal
are straightforward. The appellant was accused of attempted murder and was
tried by judge and jury. In his charge to the jury, Hrabinsky J., of the Court
of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan, informed the jury that ""in addition to
the charge on the Indictment, ... there are lesser included offences of which
you may find the accused guilty or not guilty"". He indicated that if the
jury found the accused not guilty of attempted murder, they would have to decide
whether or not the accused was guilty of, 1. causing bodily harm by discharging
a firearm with intent to wound, maim or disfigure; 2. causing bodily harm by
discharging a firearm with intent to endanger the life of any other person; 3.
unlawfully causing bodily harm, or; 4. assault causing bodily harm.

 

17.              After its deliberations the jury returned
to the court room and indicated that it had reached a verdict. The foreman
announced that the jurors had found the accused not guilty. It is, I think,
helpful to reproduce the relevant parts of the record of the events that took
place in the court room.

 

COURT CLERK: Ladies and
Gentlemen of the Jury, have you agreed upon your verdict.

 

FOREMAN: Yes, we have.

 

COURT CLERK: How say you,
is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?

 

FOREMAN: The prisoner is
not guilty.

 

COURT CLERK: Harken to
your verdict as the Court records it, you find the prisoner not guilty.

 

FOREMAN: Yes.

 

COURT CLERK: And so say
you all?

 

JURORS: Yes.

 

THE COURT: Ladies and
Gentlemen of the Jury, I thank you for your careful attention given to this
case and the care that you took in reaching your decision...You are free to
leave, but you must return on Monday, October seventeenth at ten a.m. Thank
you again. If you wish to stay in the court room, you may, if you want to move
into the court room.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

18.              The trial judge then turned to the accused
and told him that he had been found not guilty and that he was discharged. The
clerk of the court then said: ""Court is adjourned until ten o'clock Monday
morning"". The following conversation then took place between the judge and
the foreman of the jury:

 

 

 

THE COURT: Oh, just a
moment, the jury foreman, did you wish to say something?

 

FOREMAN: Well, when we
discussed this we thought we could find the Defendant not guilty of the charge
as laid, but guilty of a lesser charge, is that right?

 

THE COURT: Well, I believe
I'm functus officio. That means that I have nothing further. That is why I
spelled out very clearly to you the various things that you were to find.
However, I'll hear submissions from counsel.

 

19.              Counsel were then invited to make
submissions regarding what had occurred. It was revealed during the oral
submissions that by the time the foreman had spoken to the judge, one of the
jurors had gone past the bar and was in the body of the court room.

 

20.              Hrabinsky J. then made the following
comments: 

 

THE COURT: Sheriff, would
you call the jury in, but have them sit in the body of the court room.

 

JURY RETURN.

 

THE COURT: Now, what has
transpired here today is most unusual indeed, and it is very disappointing
after a number of days of jury trial to end in this manner. However, I have
concluded that because I discharged the jury before the jury spoke up and said,
""Oh, oh, wait, we have something else to say"", and I tried to be
cautious to give the jury lots of time to do this, nothing was said even while
I was saying that I will discharge you until October seventeenth and so on. The
jury even went so far as to go, most of them, back into the jury room, when the
foreman made a motion and said something to me and then indicated that although
they had found the accused not guilty of attempted murder they had a lesser
offence to deal with. Unfortunately they did not bring this to the attention of
the Court when they were asked, ""How say you?"". Under the
circumstances, I am of the opinion that I am functus, that is, without
jurisdiction once having discharged the jury and the accused. The Crown may
have a remedy, and I emphasize may have a remedy, by way of an appeal which
might, if successful, entail a new trial so that justice will be done. But
under the circumstances, as I have already stated, I feel that I am functus and
disappointing as it may be, it is my opinion that that is the law and if there
is any consolation in a situation such as this, I suppose it can be said it is
better to err in favour of the accused if one is to err.

 

The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan

 

21.              The majority of the Court of Appeal held
that the trial judge erred in applying ""the doctrine of"" functus
officio to the facts of the case. According to Tallis J.A., with whom
Vancise J.A. concurred, the jury verdict was not complete as the jury had not
dealt ""with all possible verdicts open to them on the indictment"".
Since the trial judge had instructed the jury on the lesser and included
offences, the majority of the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the jury
verdict was not complete until it was clear that all of the possible verdicts
had been dealt with and disposed of and held that in such a situation the trial
judge has an obligation to recall the jurors in order to take their complete
verdict. Tallis and Vancise JJ.A. set aside the acquittal and ordered a new
trial on all of the lesser and included offences.

 

22.              Hall J.A., in dissent, was of the opinion
that the record indicated that the accused was acquitted of the principal
charge and all of the included offences and to have him stand trial on any of
the included offences would place him in double jeopardy. He concluded his
brief reasons as follows:

 

                   In any
event, if a new trial should be ordered, in my opinion, it must be limited to
the least of the included offences.

 

                   Under
the circumstances, I would dismiss the Crown's appeal.

 

23.              The disagreement below appears to me to be
factual. Tallis and Vancise JJ.A. were of the view that the jury had not
completely transmitted its verdict to the court while Hall J.A. was of a
contrary view.

 

24.              They all agreed that until the jury had
given its full verdict the judge was not functus.

 

The Law

 

25.              It is generally accepted that a trial
judge sitting without a jury is not functus officio until he has finally
disposed of the case. Where the accused is acquitted the trial judge will have
exhausted his jurisdiction when the accused is discharged and the trial judge
cannot then reopen the case. Following a finding of guilt, however, the judge's
duties are not spent until after a sentence is imposed. The trial judge can, in
exceptional circumstances and before the imposition of the sentence, reopen the
case to permit the accused to tender further evidence. This principle, stated
over one hundred years ago in R. v. Clouter & Heath (1859), 8 Cox
C.C. 237, has recently been reaffirmed in Canada (see for example, R. v.
Lessard (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 70 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Hargraves
(1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 380 (Ont. C.A.); Re Regina and Bertucci (1984),
11 C.C.C. (3d) 83 (Sask. C.A.); and R. v. Mysko (1980), 2 Sask. R. 342
(C.A.)) If the judge, sitting alone, were functus as regards the
determination of guilt as of the moment of that determination, he would have no
jurisdiction to reopen the case.

 

26.              In cases where the trial is before a court
composed of a judge and a jury the rule cannot be the same. The jury, as the
trier of fact, decides whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. Even though
the verdict is unanimous, if it is unclear, the trial judge may refuse to
register it and may require that the jury reconsider its verdict. Up until the
time it is discharged, the jury may correct an error in its verdict, even if
the accused has been discharged (see R. v. Vodden (1853), Dears. 229,
169 E.R. 706; R. v. Carter, [1964] 1 All E.R. 187, 48 Cr. App. R. 122).
But once the jury verdict has been recorded and the jury has been discharged,
the assessment of guilt is, subject of course to an appeal, final. The judge,
by then sitting alone, cannot reopen the case. All that remains, where the accused
has been found guilty, is for the judge to sentence the accused. 

 

27.              Once the verdict has been registered and
the jury has been discharged, the jury cannot be recalled and sent back to
reconsider its verdict but, I hasten to interject, there is a difference
between reconsidering a verdict and correcting an error made in its conveyance
to, or registration by, the court. In Fletcher v. Thomas, [1931] 3
D.L.R. 142, the jury had been discharged after their verdict but still remained
in the court room. A few jurors approached counsel for the plaintiff and stated
that they had misunderstood two of the questions that had been put to them and
that the verdict did not reflect their intentions. Logie J. of the Ontario
Supreme Court refused to reconvene the jury. He stated, at p. 146:

 

                   I would
go further than this and say that to allow a jury functus officio to re‑assemble
and alter or purport to explain a verdict already given by them would be a
scandal on the administration of justice and cannot be permitted at any time
after they have given their verdict and been discharged. If a higher Court
should see fit to order a new trial, that is quite a different matter, and I
conceive that such a course would be taken only on the clearest proof of a
grave miscarriage of justice.

 

28.              In Watson v. Fitzpatrick (1967), 65
D.L.R. (2d) 729, after the jury had been discharged, Ruttan J. of the British
Columbia Supreme Court was asked to consider a motion by the plaintiffs to set
aside the jury verdict and to direct a new trial. The sole reason for the
motion was that the damage award was ""inordinately low"". Ruttan J.
refused to grant the motion stating that ""The jury has been discharged and
cannot now be recalled to consider their decision"". The error, if there
was one, was in the deliberations of the jury and it was held that that cannot
be grounds for recalling the jury to reconsider its decision. (See also Ellis
v. Deheer, [1922] 2 K.B. 113 (C.A.); Knowlton v. Hydro‑ Electric
Power Com'n., [1926] 1 D.L.R. 217 (Ont.); Ainey v. Regem (1930), 48
B.R. 488 (Que. K.B.); Barkhouse v. Vanderploet (1976), 16 N.S.R. (2d)
445 (C.A.); Salerno v. White (1982), 28 C.P.C. 165 (Ont. H.C.))

 

29.              Although the jury cannot be allowed to
reconsider its verdict after it has been discharged, it may be allowed to rectify
errors that were made in the transmission or recording of its verdict
notwithstanding the discharge and, indeed, even if the jury members have
interacted with the public. If it has become apparent, after the discharge of
the jury, that the foreman erred or, as in this case, might have erred in
delivering the verdict, and that, as a result, the record may well not reflect
the decision arrived at in the jury room, the jury is allowed to correct the
error.  Wigmore on Evidence (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8 explains at
paragraph 2355, that the reason for allowing the jury to correct the recording
of the verdict, after the jury has been discharged, is a practical one:

 

                   It has
occasionally been said that this correction must be claimed before the jury are
discharged, but this seems unsound because such errors are seldom ascertained
until after the jury have separated and conversed out of court, and if the
error is satisfactorily established, there can hardly be any fixed time to
limit its correction.

 

30.              At paragraph 2356, he emphasizes that the
statements of the jurors are inadmissible if being tendered for the purpose of
explaining or changing the substance of the verdict:

 

...after the verdict
has been pronounced by the jury and accepted by the judge and the jury has been
discharged, the verdict is final as regards its meaning and effect. Hence, no
statements by the jurors, either unanimously or individually, can be
resorted to for explaining or changing its meaning or legal effect.

 

31.              McCulloch v. Ottawa Transportation
Commission, [1954] 2 D.L.R. 443 (Ont. C.A.), illustrates this point. In
that case, which was an action for damages due to negligence arising from the
operation of motor vehicles, one of the tasks of the jury was to apportion
liability between the plaintiff and the defendant. The apportionment of the
degree of negligence was set forth by the jury as 80% to the plaintiff and 20%
to the defendant. The jury was then discharged. While the judge was discussing
the question of costs with counsel, a juryman, through a constable in
attendance in the court‑room, brought to the attention of the plaintiff's
counsel that there had been an error made in presenting the degrees of the
apportionment. The judge, despite being aware of the error, entered judgment in
accordance with the original findings. Citing Wigmore, Hope J.A., of the
Ontario Court of Appeal, allowed the appeal and corrected the judgment. In his
reasons for judgment, concurred in by both Hogg and F. G. MacKay JJ.A., he
stated, at p. 445:

 

                   I agree
thoroughly ... that no evidence can be received by way of affidavit or
otherwise after the delivery of the verdict to explain some error or mistake
which occurred during the deliberation of the members of the jury in the jury‑room
before arriving at a verdict. However, I think the cases are quite clear that
where a verdict has been reached by a jury, a unanimous verdict, as in this
case, and some clerical error has occurred either in recording that verdict in
the juryroom or by the jury in reporting it to Court, then affidavits may be
received, in the interest of justice, to disclose what the true verdict of the
jury was. 

 

32.              Similarly, in Dardarian v. Schneider
(1956), 3 D.L.R. (2d) 292 (Ont. H.C.), the jury's finding as to the percentage
degree of fault between the plaintiff and the defendant was reversed when it
was presented by the foreman to the court. The jury members were discharged,
left the jury box, and retired ""in a body as far as the outside of the
door leading from the court room"" where, in conferring amongst themselves,
they realized that an error had been made. Having spoken to no one except the
constable, and having taken only four minutes from the time of their discharge
to the time they returned to the jury box, they were allowed to correct the
error that was made in the transmission of the verdict.

 

33.              This Court has had occasion to address
this question but found, on the facts of the case before it, that the error was
not in the transmission of the verdict. In such a situation the affidavits of
the jurors could not be accepted. In Danis v. Saumure, [1956] S.C.R.
403, the appellant contended that the verdict arrived at by the jury was
perverse. The appellant also sought to file affidavits signed by nine members
of the jury purporting to show that the findings made by the jury were not the
findings intended to be made by them. This Court refused to admit the
affidavits and dismissed the appeal. Although he recognized that statements
made by jurors are admissible to show that the written answers do not
correspond to the actual decision arrived at by the jury, or to indicate that
there was an error in the transmission of the verdict, Kerwin C.J., with whom
Rand and Abbott JJ. concurred, was of the view that the affidavits that were
being submitted addressed the actual deliberations or intentions of the jurors.
Since a jury cannot be reconvened either to explain its verdict or to
reconsider the substance of its deliberations, the affidavits were not
receivable.

 

34.              Kellock and Locke JJ. also dismissed the
appeal. In their opinion, even assuming that they were entitled to look at the
affidavits, the affidavits did not suggest an error in the transmission of the
verdict. Since it was ""not a case of error arising between the verdict
which the jury had agreed upon and that which was actually rendered and formed
the basis for the judgment delivered"", the statements by the jurors were
inadmissible. See also McCready v. Scott (1967), 62 W.W.R. 563
(B.C.S.C.); R. v. Emkeit (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 309 (Alta. C.A.), aff'd
[1974] S.C.R. 133; Barkhouse v. Vanderploet, supra; Ralston
Purina (Canada) Ltd. v. Thompson View Fur Farms Ltd. (1984), 12 D.L.R.
(4th) 228 (P.E.I.C.A.)

 

35.              The state of the case law until now is as
follows. Even after discharge, a jury can be reconvened to correct an improper
or incomplete transmission or registration of a verdict, but cannot reconsider
a verdict or complete its deliberations with a view to handing down additional
verdicts on counts or on included offences it had not finally determined prior
to that discharge; nor can anyone go behind the verdict and make inquiries as
regards the nature of the deliberations.

 

36.              I should like to make a final observation
before disposing of this case. Given that the case law upon which I rely has
mainly developed in non‑criminal matters, I initially thought that the
rule governing criminal jury verdicts might preferably be different, and be as
follows: in criminal matters, as of the discharge of the jury, the judge and
jury would be functus even to correct an error in the transmission of
the verdict. The rationale for this rule could be to leave the error, subject
to appeal, to inure to the benefit of the accused. I had no difficulty with
this approach until I wondered what would happen if the error was the other
way, a verdict of guilty being erroneously entered against an accused who had,
in fact, been acquitted by the jury. Once functus the court could not
vary the registering of the verdict either way. This latter concern of mine is
not merely theoretical but has, since I wrote this judgment, been shown to be
justified by a recent decision of the Privy Council in Nanan v. The State,
[1986] 3 All E.R. 248, a case in which the accused's conviction for murder was
left undisturbed notwithstanding the fact that it was the result of the jury
foreman's not understanding the meaning of the word ""unanimous"" when
asked by the clerk of the court whether the verdict was unanimous. It is out of
concern for the really innocent that I have come to adopt the rule applicable
until now to civil matters. Its effect is to ensure that those found guilty by
the jury do not go free, which is not a bad result but, more important, that
those found innocent or not convicted by the jury not be convicted.

 

37.              Now to address the present appeal. I
should first say that I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that the trial
judge was faced with a situation where the applicable law was very uncertain.
Therefore, anything I say as regards what he should have done is with the
obvious advantage of hindsight, and the retrospective effect of the law once
stated. Given the very clear instructions by the judge regarding the possible
subsidiary verdicts, the blanket statement of ""not guilty"" by the
foreman would normally have ended the matter had it not been for the doubt cast
on its accuracy by the foreman's remarks, where he said: ""when we
discussed this we thought we could find the Defendant not guilty of the charge
as laid, but guilty of a lesser offence, is that right?"" What had until
then been rightly considered a complete and clear verdict became uncertain. As
of the moment of that statement the trial judge should have inquired further
into this comment by the foreman. He should have had all the jury members
recalled to the jury box and, with all of them present, he should have
addressed the jury with a view to ascertaining the precise nature of the
problem. 

 

38.              There are various ways of doing this. As
an example, he could have first ascertained whether they had, prior to their
being discharged, arrived at a verdict and wanted to correct or complete the
transmission of the verdict at which they had arrived. If such was the case he
could then have instructed the clerk of the court to register that verdict. If,
through questioning, he had found out that they had not come to a final verdict
prior to their discharge, then the trial judge could not permit them to reopen
their deliberations; for once they had recorded a verdict and had been
discharged, their jurisdiction to make findings was spent. The problem could
then only be dealt with in the Court of Appeal.

 

39.              As the trial judge did not inquire further
into the statement by the foreman, we do not know whether the jury wished to
continue their deliberations or whether the foreman was merely indicating that
the recorded verdict was not the one arrived at in the jury room, and that the
accused had been found guilty of an included offence.

 

The Remedy

 

40.              Not knowing what the situation is exactly,
though one might suspect that the verdict was incomplete, is the remedy a new
trial as was ordered by the majority in the Court of Appeal? I do not think
that a new trial should be ordered. Hall J.A. appears to be uneasy when
ordering a new trial and touches upon the problem when he says that in any
event he would have ordered a new trial on the lesser of the included offences.
The problem is that we now do not know with certainty what the verdict is on
the included offences. If that verdict is actually an acquittal on all or even
any of the included offences, the accused should not be deprived thereof
because of error in the transmission or registration of the verdict, but only
if error of law was committed in the reaching of that verdict. So the ordering
of a new trial was not the preferable course to follow. The ordering of a new
trial is a remedy where the determination of guilt or innocence by the court of
first instance is vitiated by an error. Here the error was in not ascertaining
with certainty what the verdict was.

 

41.              The logical disposition of this appeal
would be to allow the appeal, quash the order of the Court of Appeal for a new
trial, and order that the matter be returned to the trial court so that the
jury's verdict be ascertained, either in the manner I suggested by reconvening
the jurors, or in any other way that generally meets the purpose of that
endeavour. But logic is not always practical and occasionally will operate unfairly.

 

42.              A considerable amount of time has elapsed
since that jury was discharged. When considering all of the circumstances of
the case, I think that the ends of justice will best be served by allowing this
appeal, quashing the order of the Court of Appeal and leaving the acquittal, as
registered, undisturbed.

 

43.              I should add one final observation.
Fortunately, situations such as this will surely be few in future. Indeed,
since the events of this case took place, many jurisdictions throughout Canada
have, I am told, adopted a procedure long followed by some. The question put to
the jury now specifies each and every possible verdict the Court requested the
jury to consider and is not general, as was the question in this case.

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Obscenity ‑‑
Film ‑‑ Whether ""undue exploitation of sex” ‑‑
Community standards ‑‑ Criminal Code, s. 159(8) .

 

                   Evidence ‑‑ Evidence on charge of
obscenity ‑‑ Whether Crown must adduce evidence to establish
undueness.

 

                   Appellant, owner of an Edmonton theatre, was charged
with presenting an obscene motion picture contrary to s. 163  of the Criminal
Code . At trial, the defence adduced evidence indicating that the film had
been approved and classified by the Censor Board as a restricted adult movie
and that it had been previously shown in Alberta to a large audience with no
complaint being made to the Board. The evidence further showed that the film
had been similarly approved and classified by the other provincial censor
boards across the country. The trial judge found the film immoral, indecent and
obscene and convicted the appellant. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision.
This appeal is to determine whether the trial judge applied the proper test in
finding the appellant guilty of presenting an obscene entertainment.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Lamer and Le Dain JJ.: A film is obscene under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code  if it contains as a dominant characteristic the ""undue
exploitation of sex"". To determine ""undueness"" one of the tests
to be applied is whether the accepted standards of tolerance in the
contemporary Canadian community, taken as a whole, have been exceeded. In
applying the community standard of tolerance what matters is not what Canadians
think is right for themselves to see. What matters is what Canadians would not
abide other Canadians seeing because it would be beyond the contemporary
Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see it. Relevant to that
determination is, among other factors, the audience to which the film is
targeted since the community may tolerate different things for different groups
of people depending on the circumstances. 

 

                   The trier of fact must formulate an opinion of what
the contemporary Canadian community will tolerate in order to determine
""undueness"" by the community standards test. The community consensus
must be assessed and community level of tolerance objectively determined. While
evidence of the community standards of tolerance may well be useful in many
cases, it is not essential, for it is the opinion of the trier of fact about
the community standards of tolerance which is important. The judge does not
have to accept evidence, expert or otherwise, but he cannot reject it without
good reason. The trier of fact's personal views regarding the impugned film are
irrelevant.

 

                   In the case at bar, the trial judge applied his own
subjective standards of taste and not the community standards of tolerance. He
did not direct his mind to the question whether most people would tolerate
others seeing the film in question and he failed to consider the fact that the
film was restricted to adults only and that only those who chose to see it
would be exposed to it. Further, it was incumbent upon him to consider and
assess the weight, if any, to be given to the evidence adduced by the defence
indicative of community standards of tolerance. He should not have rejected it
without explanation.

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey and
McIntyre JJ.: The standard to determine ""undueness"" is that of
tolerance. What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to
see but what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because it would
be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see
it. The audience to which the film is exposed, however, is not relevant in the
determination of whether or not it is obscene.

 

                   Per Beetz and Estey
JJ.: The Crown is not required to adduce expert evidence as to community
standards of tolerance. 

 

                   Per McIntyre J.: In
formulating the community standard of tolerance some evidence must be adduced
by the Crown before the trier of fact.

 

                   Per Wilson J.: Under
s. 159(8) of the Criminal Code , a film is deemed to be obscene if
a dominant characteristic of the film is the ""undue exploitation of
sex"". ""Undue"" refers to the treatment of sex which in some
fundamental way dehumanizes the persons portrayed and, as a consequence, the
viewers themselves. The question whether there was ""undueness"" must
be determined according to the objective standard of the contemporary Canadian
community. What must be ascertained is the degree of exploitation of sex
Canadians at any given time will accept in their films. It is therefore not
open to the courts under s. 159(8)  to characterize a movie as obscene if shown
to one constituency but not if shown to another. A movie is either obscene
based on a national community standard of tolerance or it is not.

 

                   There is an onus on the Crown to put evidence before
the court on the issue of ""undueness"". The community standard against
which the allegedly obscene matter must be measured cannot be identified
without it. Indeed, it is naive to think that a judge, drawing on his own
experience alone, can determine the objective standard against which impugned
conduct is to be measured. Moreover, it is wrong in principle. It leaves the
accused with no way of knowing the case to be met, or the level of
acceptability imposed by any particular judge.

 

                   In the case at bar, there is no indication that the
trial judge took into consideration the uncontested evidence adduced by the
defence of the unanimous approval of the film by the censor boards. He did not
address his mind to the issue of the significance of the approvals as evidence
of the community standard of acceptance. Considering that the business of these
boards is to assess films on an ongoing basis for the very purpose of
determining their acceptability for viewing by the community, it is difficult
to think that a judge would be better informed as to what was acceptable to
Canadians across the country. The trial judge, applying an objective test and
giving proper consideration to that evidence, could not have reached the result
he did. The judge clearly saw his role, not as applying the community standard
but as raising it if he personally thought it was too low. In this respect he
erred.

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑The question is whether the trial judge
applied the proper test in finding Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd. guilty of
presenting an obscene entertainment. The indictment reads:

 

That The Towne Cinema
Theatres Ltd., at Edmonton, in the Judicial District of Edmonton, Alberta, on
or about the 27th day of January, A.D. 1980, being the person in charge of a
theatre, namely: Jasper Cinema (Blue) at 10120 ‑ 156 Street,
did unlawfully present to an audience an entertainment, namely: a motion
picture entitled ""Dracula Sucks"" which entertainment was immoral,
indecent or obscene, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

I The Facts and the Trial Judgment

 

2.                In January, 1980, the accused company
was owner and manager of a theatre, known as Jasper Cinema (Blue), located in
the City of Edmonton. The cinema was a typical picture theatre showing motion
picture films to members of the public who paid an admission fee. On January 25
to 27, 1980 the accused was regularly presenting showings of a motion picture
called Dracula Sucks. The film had been given a ""Restricted""
rating by the Alberta Motion Picture Censor Board. A copy of the motion picture
was seized by the Edmonton City Police on January 27, 1980, after the public
showing on that date and before the scheduled second public showing. The
accused was charged and tried before a justice of the Court of Queen's Bench of
Alberta. Three witnesses testified.

 

3.                Staff Sergeant Ashworth of the Edmonton
City Police said he had attended and observed the film and it was he who had
taken possession of the film. The Court then adjourned to the Censor Board film
theatre where the trial judge viewed the film. At the resumption of the trial,
Ashworth testified that on January 21, 1980, the film had been showing at the
Capitol Square Cinema, before being transferred to the Jasper Cinema. While at
the former theatre Ashworth had received about five phone calls from persons
complaining about the film. In cross‑examination he was asked:

 

                   Did you
find the movie very offensive to yourself?

 

He replied: 

 

                   Yeah, I
thought it was disgusting. That's only my personal...

 

The film itself and the evidence of Staff Sergeant Ashworth constituted
the case for the Crown.

 

4.                The defence called two witnesses. The
first was Terrance Yushchyshyn, Director of Operations for the theatres
operated by the accused company in the five westerly provinces. His evidence in
summary was as follows. Prior to being booked into his theatre in Edmonton, the
film, the subject of the present charge, had been shown at two Famous Players'
Theatres, one in Edmonton, where it had been seen by 4065 persons and one in
Calgary, where it had been seen by 4075 persons. The film was then moved to the
Jasper Cinema where it was seen, before seizure, by 555 people, without
complaints. In Mr. Yushchyshyn's opinion the impugned film was ""very passé"",
""boring and dull"". Other films such as Last Tango in Paris,
had far greater emphasis on sexual gratification.

 

5.                Owen Garland Hooper is Chairman of the
Alberta Motion Picture Censor Board. The Board views every film seen in
Alberta. The Board allowed Dracula Sucks to be shown in the province as
a restricted adult movie, no one under the age of eighteen being admitted. The
film was approved in the restricted adult category or equivalent by all of the
provincial censor boards or classification boards across Canada. Mr. Hooper
said that his Board had not made any deletions to the film. Most movies are
""pretty extensively cut when we get them"". This one had been edited
in Toronto. The Board arrives at appropriate classification for a movie
consistent with the Board's interpretation of current community standards of
acceptance. Compared to other movies he had seen, Mr. Hooper described Dracula
Sucks as ""pretty forgettable"". The Board had received no
complaints regarding this particular film. During the preceding year, the Board
viewed 750 films and rejected twelve, because it was felt that adult Albertans
would generally repudiate them. The basis for the Board's assessment of
community standards has shifted during the preceding ten years: now, ""it's
contemporary, it's modern, it must be Canadian"". Mr. Hooper succinctly
described Dracula Sucks: ""Well, it has nudity in it, it has
violence in it, it has simulated sex encounters in it."" 

 

6.                The trial judge found the film to be
immoral, indecent and obscene. It possessed ""absolutely no artistic merit
whatsoever""; ""most of the film was devoted to extreme, tasteless
violence and explicit, unnecessary sex"".

 

7.                The accused company was convicted and fined
$1500.

 

II On Appeal

 

8.                In a brief judgment, the Court of Appeal
of Alberta dismissed the appeal. The Court noted it was not its function to
judge the merits of the film, and it had not found it necessary to see the
film; its sole function was to review the propriety of the trial. The judgment
continued:

 

                   We have
reviewed the reasons for judgment given in support of this conviction. Those
reasons are blunt and impactive. The trial judge, sitting as a jury, was
obliged to determine in an objective way what was tolerable in accordance with
the contemporary standards of the Canadian community. As a trier of fact he was
entitled to draw on his experience in the community. He had to consider the
expert evidence but was entitled to reject it and obviously did. In this we are
paraphrasing the remarks of Howland, C.J.O., in Regina v. Sudbury News
Service 1978 39 C.C.C. (2d) 1 at p. 7.

 

The judgment concluded thus:

 

                   The
reasons of the trial judge challenged in this appeal must be considered in the
context of his whole judgment and the argument which immediately preceded it.
The trial judge found that the only theme of the film ""Dracula
Sucks"", was sex and violence, extreme and explicit. He found no plot. He
asked himself what are contemporary community standards and considered all the
evidence led. He cautioned himself on the dangers of slipping into subjective
standards and concluded that the film did not meet the objective test. We see
no grounds, in law, to disturb this conviction and dismiss the appeal.

 

III Issues

 

9.                In his factum, counsel for Towne Cinema
raised five grounds of appeal. At the hearing oral argument was presented on
only two of these grounds, both alleging errors in the trial judge's
determination of the community standard of tolerance.

 

10.              In view of the importance of the issues
raised in this appeal, the Court felt that it would be proper to request a re‑hearing
before a full bench.

 

11.              The Court requested counsel to address the
following four questions:

 

1. Assuming that for
purposes of s. 159, undue exploitation of sex is to be assessed on the basis of
community standards, do these standards refer to what one would find acceptable
for oneself to see or read, or to what one would tolerate others seeing or
reading?

 

2. How is this standard to
be ascertained by the trier of fact?

 

3. How is an impugned film
to be measured against it? 

 

4. What is the relevance,
if any, of the audience to which a film is geared in determining whether it is
obscene under s. 159(8)?

 

12.              In my view the following issues arise from
the two grounds argued on the appeal and the four questions addressed at the re‑hearing:

 

1.                What is the proper interpretation of the word
""undue"" in s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

2.                Must the Crown adduce evidence to establish
undueness?

 

IV Undueness and the Community Standards Test

 

13.              In 1959 Parliament amended the provisions
of s. 150 (now s. 159) of the Criminal Code  dealing with obscenity by
adding subs. (8) (1959 (Can.), c. 41, s. 11) which reads:

 

                   (8) For
the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is
the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following
subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be
obscene.

 

14.              Any doubt that might previously have
existed on the question of whether s. 159(8)  embodied the proper or the
exclusive test for obscenity in relation to a film was implicitly resolved by
this Court in Dechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951. A number of decisions
in various jurisdictions had previously concluded that films were
""publications"" and therefore properly dealt with under s. 159(8)  (see
R. v. Fraser, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 110 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Goldberg and
Reitman, [1971] 3 O.R. 323 (C.A.); and Daylight Theatre Co. v. The Queen
(1973), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 451 (Sask. Dist. Ct.))

 

15.              Dechow dealt with an allegation of
obscenity with regard to an exhibition of sex stimulators. Using language and
reasoning easily extendible to motion pictures, Ritchie J., writing for the
majority, held that the objects in question, accompanied as they were by
printed instructions for their use, were ""publications"" within the
meaning of that term in s. 159. They were therefore to be judged by the
standard laid down in s. 159(8) , which was the sole test of obscenity in
relation to publications. Chief Justice Laskin, speaking for a minority of the
Court, preferred the view that the articles in question were not publications.
He was, however, of the opinion that the Court should apply exclusively the
test in s. 159(8)  in respect of allegations of obscenity whether such
allegations are made under s. 159 (which deals with publications) or one of the
other sections of the Code, such as s. 163  (under which the charge
against Towne Cinema was laid) or s. 164. 

 

16.              The practical effect of the two judgments,
though they differ widely in approach, is, for present purposes, the same: s.
159(8)  embodies the sole test of obscenity in relation to motion pictures. It
supersedes rather than supplements the much‑criticized test enunciated by
Cockburn C.J. in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360.

 

17.              In Canada, the notion of ""community
standards"", as relevant to the determination of obscenity, has its origins
in the judgment of Judson J. (speaking also for Abbott and Martland JJ.) in Brodie
v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681, the Lady Chatterley’s Lover case. Brodie
was the first obscenity appeal to come before this Court following the
introduction of s. 159(8)  and Judson J.'s explication of this section reveals a
very clear awareness of the criticism that had been leveled against the Hicklin
test and an intention to avoid its pitfalls in the future. In Hicklin
Cockburn C.J. had said:

 

...I think the test of
obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is
to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences,
and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.

 

18.              This definition had been criticized for
its focus on the reactions of the weakest and least capable members of society,
for its disregard of serious purpose or artistic merit in the impugned material
and for its excessive dependence on subjective conjecture on the part of the
trier of fact. In Brodie, Judson J. expressed the view that by the
enactment of s. 159(8)  ""all the jurisprudence under the Hicklin
definition is rendered obsolete"" (p. 701) and that the new definition gave
the Court ""an opportunity to apply tests which have some certainty of
meaning and are capable of objective application, which do not so much depend
as before upon the idiosyncrasies and sensitivities of the tribunal of fact,
whether judge or jury"" (p. 702). Henceforth, the standard for obscenity
would be an ""undue exploitation of sex"" and Judson J. proposed two
tests which he regarded as capable of objective application to determine such
""undueness"".

 

19.              The first test focussed on the
""internal necessities"" of the work in question. In the American case
of United States v. Kennerley, 209 F. 119 (1913), Judge Learned Hand had
reluctantly felt bound to apply the Hicklin test, but said, at pp. 120‑21:
""I question whether in the end men will regard that as obscene which is
honestly relevant to the adequate expression of innocent ideas."" In Brodie,
at pp. 704‑05, Judson J. applied this principle to the newly‑enacted
statutory definition: 

 

...I do not think that
there is undue exploitation if there is no more emphasis on the theme than is
required in the serious treatment of the theme of a novel with honesty and
uprightness.... The section recognizes that the serious‑minded author
must have freedom in the production of a work of genuine artistic and literary
merit and the quality of the work, as the witnesses point out and common sense
indicates, must have real relevance in determining not only a dominant
characteristic but also whether there is undue exploitation.

 

20.              Judson J.'s second test for
""undueness"" looked to the standards of the community. The concept of
""community standards"" had previously been applied by courts in
Australia and New Zealand as a measure of whether a work exhibited an
""undue emphasis"" on sex. Judson J. regarded this reading of undue as
meaning ""what the community regards as excessive"" to be preferable to
what he saw as the only alternative (at p. 706):

 

Surely the choice of
courses is clear‑cut. Either the judge instructs himself or the jury that
undueness is to be measured by his or their personal opinion‑‑and
even that must be subject to some influence from contemporary standards‑‑or
the instruction must be that the tribunal of fact should consciously attempt to
apply these standards. Of the two, I think that the second is the better
choice.

 

21.              Judson J. made no attempt to harmonize or
integrate his two tests. He simply concluded that whether the question was
approached on the basis of the internal necessities of the novel itself or on
the basis of an offence against community standards, undue exploitation of sex
was not a dominant characteristic of Lady Chatterley’s Lover.

 

22.              In the present case, no argument was
addressed to the ""artistic merit"" or ""serious purpose"" of Dracula
Sucks‑‑nor, I should think, could such an argument plausibly be
made. This Court is not, therefore, called upon to expound the relationship
between Judson J.'s two tests. We need only consider the issue of obscenity
from the point of view of community standards.

 

23.              Nevertheless, as will presently appear, it
is important to remember that from the very beginning of this Court's
consideration of s. 159(8)  ""community standards"" have been viewed as one
measure of ""undueness"" in the exploitation of sex. They have never
been seen as the only measure of such undueness; still less has a breach
of community standards been treated as in itself a criminal offence. 

 

24.              There are other ways in which exploitation
of sex might be ""undue"". Ours is not a perfect society and it is
unfortunate but true that the community may tolerate publications that cause
harm to members of society and therefore to society as a whole. Even if, at
certain times, there is a coincidence between what is not tolerated and what is
harmful to society, there is no necessary connection between these two
concepts. Thus, a legal definition of ""undue"" must also encompass
publications harmful to members of society and, therefore, to society as a
whole.

 

25.              Sex related publications which portray
persons in a degrading manner as objects of violence, cruelty or other forms of
dehumanizing treatment, may be ""undue"" for the purpose of s. 159(8) .
No one should be subject to the degradation and humiliation inherent in publications
which link sex with violence, cruelty, and other forms of dehumanizing
treatment. It is not likely that at a given moment in a society's history, such
publications will be tolerated. See R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (1983), 36
C.R. (3d) 154 (Ont. Co. Ct.) at p. 173; R. v. Wagner, Alta. Q.B.,
January 16, 1985 (unreported); R. v. Chin, Ont. Prov. Ct., February 22,
1983 (unreported, but summarized at 9 W.C.B. 249).

 

26.              However, as I have noted above, there is
no necessary coincidence between the undueness of publications which
degrade people by linking violence, cruelty or other forms of dehumanizing
treatment with sex, and the community standard of tolerance. Even if certain
sex related materials were found to be within the standard of tolerance of the
community, it would still be necessary to ensure that they were not
""undue"" in some other sense, for example in the sense that they
portray persons in a degrading manner as objects of violence, cruelty, or other
forms of dehumanizing treatment.

 

27.              In the present case, however, only the
community standard of tolerance is directly in issue. The rest of this decision
will be concerned with the community standard of tolerance. 

 

28.              Two years after the Brodie case
this Court, in Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd. v. The Queen,
[1964] S.C.R. 251, adopted in toto the dissenting reasons delivered in
the Court of Appeal of Manitoba by Freedman J.A., [1963] 2 C.C.C. 103. In that
case, as in this, the allegedly obscene material had no discernible serious
purpose or artistic merit. Freedman J.A.'s discussion of whether or not it
unduly exploited sex was therefore focussed on its relationship to community
standards. Applying Judson J.'s observation in Brodie about the need to
test undueness by objective criteria, Freedman J.A. elaborated on several
requisite characteristics of the community standards to be applied. He held
that the standards must be Canadian standards, not those prevailing
elsewhere, and that they must be contemporary standards reflecting the
current level of candour with regard to sexual matters not the level of the
past. On the question of which contemporary Canadians are to be the touchstone
of ""community standards"" Freedman J.A. said at p. 116:

 

Those standards are not
set by those of lowest taste or interest. Nor are they set exclusively by those
of rigid, austere, conservative, or puritan taste and habit of mind. Something
approaching a general average of community thinking and feeling has to be discovered.
Obviously this is no easy task, for we are seeking a quantity that is elusive.
Yet the effort must be made if we are to have a fair objective standard in
relation to which a publication can be tested as to whether it is obscene or
not. The alternative would mean a subjective approach, with the result
dependent upon and varying with the personal tastes and predilections of the
particular Judge who happens to be trying the case.

 

29.              In 1974, in R. v. Odeon Morton Theatres
Ltd. (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 185, Freedman C.J.M. had much the same to say
with regard to the appropriate community standard to apply in determining
whether the film Last Tango in Paris was obscene at p. 188:

 

The learned trial Judge
made it abundantly clear that his obligation was to consider the film not
according to his own subjective views but according to the objective test
furnished by contemporary community standards in Canada. Indeed he expressly
stated in his reasons for judgment that his personal views were adverse to the
acceptability of the film but that he was setting aside those views. That of
course was the correct and judicial thing to do.

 

30.              I said earlier that the undue exploitation
of sex is the touchstone of obscenity under s. 159(8) , and that a breach of
community standards is simply one measure of such undueness. It is harm to
society from undue exploitation that is aimed at by the section, not simply
lapses in propriety or good taste. In R. v. Prairie Schooner News Ltd. and
Powers (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 251 (Man. C.A.), Monnin J.A. and I considered
this point at p. 269: 

 

The Court was urged to
define ""community standards"" as community standards of acceptance, i.e.,
tolerance. I would accept this definition. In the Brodie case Judson J.,
referred, p. 181, to ""standards of acceptance prevailing in the
community"". In the Great West News case, we referred to
contemporary standards of tolerance. I have no doubt, as Dr. Rich testified,
and as the Judge agreed, a distinction can be made between private taste and
standard of tolerance. It can hardly be questioned that many people would find
personally offensive, material which they would permit others to read.
Parliament, through its legislation on obscenity, could hardly have wished to
proscribe as criminal that which was acceptable or tolerable according to
current standards of the Canadian community.

 

31.              A similar point was made by Weatherston
J.A., delivering the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Penthouse International Ltd. (1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 111 (leave to appeal
refused, [1979] 1 S.C.R. xi) at pp. 114‑15:

 

It is neither helpful nor
accurate to say that the standard of tolerance is synonymous with the moral
standards of the community...the words ""moral standards of the
community"" mean no more than a consensus of what is right and what is
wrong.... The question, in any event, is not whether the content of the
publication goes beyond what the contemporary Canadian community thinks is
right, but rather whether it goes beyond what the contemporary Canadian
community is prepared to tolerate.

 

32.              R. v. Sudbury News Service Ltd.
(1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), was concerned with the distribution to
certain confectionary stores of magazines alleged to be obscene, including Penthouse
and Oui. Howland C.J.O., speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal,
reviewed the relevant authorities and then, in a number of propositions
distilled from those authorities expressed, in my view admirably, the present
state of Canadian law as applied to the question presently before the Court.

 

33.              I have taken the liberty of extracting the
following propositions from various places in the judgment: (i) in determining
what is undue exploitation within s. 159(8), one of the tests to be applied is
whether the accepted standards of tolerance in the contemporary Canadian community
have been exceeded; (ii) the standards must be contemporary as times change and
ideas change with them, one manifestation being the relative freedom with which
the whole question of sex is discussed; (iii) it is the standards of the
community as a whole which must be considered and not the standards of a small
segment of that community such as the university community where a film was
shown; (iv) the decision whether the publication is tolerable according to
Canadian community standards rests with the court; (v) the task is to determine
in an objective way what is tolerable in accordance with the contemporary
standards of the Canadian community, and not merely to project one's own
personal ideas of what is tolerable. 

 

34.              The cases all emphasize that it is a
standard of tolerance, not taste, that is relevant. What matters is not
what Canadians think is right for themselves to see. What matters is what
Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because it would be beyond the
contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see it.

 

35.              Since the standard is tolerance, I think
the audience to which the allegedly obscene material is targeted must be
relevant. The operative standards are those of the Canadian community as a
whole, but since what matters is what other people may see, it is quite
conceivable that the Canadian community would tolerate varying degrees of
explicitness depending upon the audience and the circumstances. I would adopt
the following passage of Howland C.J.O. in Sudbury News Service Ltd. (supra)
at p. 8:

 

                   The
next question which arises is the extent to which the manner and circumstances
of distribution are relevant in determining whether or not a publication is
obscene. There are some publications which are so blatantly indecent that they
would not be tolerable by the Canadian community under any circumstances. Some
pictures are offensive to the majority of people to the point that the Canadian
community would not tolerate them on a billboard, or on the cover of a
magazine, or on a television screen where persons of all ages and sensibilities
would be exposed to them, but would be prepared to tolerate them being viewed
by persons who wished to view them. Some pictures would not be acceptable by
Canadian community standards in a children's bedtime story‑book or primer
but would be in a magazine for general distribution. The Canadian community
might be prepared to tolerate the exhibition of a motion picture to an adult
audience, but would consider the exhibition of the same motion picture to a
general audience, which included children, to be an undue exploitation of sex.
Similarly, the general distribution of certain magazines to a neighbourhood
store accessible to all ages would not be tolerable, whereas the distribution
of such magazines to ""adult"" bookstores to which children under a
certain age were not admitted might not be objectionable. The packaging and
pricing of a publication may also be relevant in considering whether Canadian
community standards have been exceeded. The distribution of magazines in plastic
covers marked ""adult"" in some respects might act as an attraction
rather than a deterrent unless the price was high enough to place it beyond the
reach of most children.

 

In endorsing this view I am modifying the position I had adopted in the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Great West News Ltd., [1970] 4 C.C.C.
307, at p. 317 (leave to appeal denied, [1970] S.C.R. ix). 

 

36.              With that review of the cases, I turn now
to the trial judgment in the present case. The appellant submits that the trial
judge misdirected himself in holding that his assessment of the local
community's feeling of ""revulsion"" was determinative of the Canadian
community standard of tolerance, and in thereby employing a subjective and
regional rather than objective and national test. According to the appellant
the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the film would not be
tolerated by the Canadian community in the sense that those who do not wish to
view it will not accept or tolerate the fact that others do and will see it.

 

37.              In delivering judgment the trial judge
said:

 

                   I do
not have the benefit of a jury. In making the remarks I have made, I do not
feel that I am imposing my own standards completely, although how can one help
but be subjective in a case like this. None of us live on an island, we all
live in a world which, as evidence has suggested today, is becoming more
tolerant of explicit sex in films and more tolerant of violence. Somebody has
got to draw the line and I don't know how far community standards are prepared
to be stretched before somebody does draw the line on the type of garbage that
I saw this morning.

 

                   I am
satisfied that this film is a long way from meeting the contemporary community
standards. It may satisfy a certain element of a community, it may gratify
them, but I am prepared to say that the majority of the community would feel
the same revulsion for this show that I felt when I left there this morning.

 

                   When I
say the dominant theme of this film was sex and violence, I am not being
entirely correct, it is the only theme. There is no plot, there is no story
whatsoever, unless it is hidden in such a way that I couldn't find it. I was
making notes at the time the show was on, but I was able to watch it in its
entirety.

 

38.              In the present case I think, with respect,
that the trial judge applied a standard of taste, not tolerance, as reflected
in these words:

 

...I am prepared to say
that the majority of the community would feel the same revulsion for this show
that I felt when I left there this morning.

 

In my view this statement can only be interpreted as saying that most
people would be personally offended. The judge did not direct his mind to the
question whether most people would tolerate others seeing the film in question.
In that I think he erred.

 

39.              It should also be noted that the trial
judge gave no consideration to the fact that Dracula Sucks was
restricted to adults only, and that only those who chose to see it would be
exposed to it. As I have said, these factors are important considerations in
applying a test of tolerance. 

 

40.              The appellant argues, as I have indicated,
that the trial judge applied a subjective and local standard rather than a
national objective test. In Brodie, Judson J. makes it clear that the
trier of fact is not supposed simply to apply his own subjective standard but
rather to assess the community standard. The statement of the trial judge,
""I do not feel that I am imposing my own standards completely"" seems
to imply that he is imposing his own standards primarily and lends support to
the submission of the appellant that the test applied was subjective and not
objective. In particular, the sentence reading: ""Somebody has got to draw
the line and I don't know how far community standards are prepared to be
stretched before somebody does draw the line on the type of garbage that I saw
this morning"" suggests that the judge is imposing his own standard‑‑somebody
has to draw the line and he is going to be the one to do it.

 

41.              Reading his comments as a whole, I can
reach no conclusion other than the trial judge applied his own subjective
standards of taste and not community standards of tolerance.

 

V The Evidentiary Issue

 

42.              The appellant's second ground is that the
judge failed to have regard to the unrebutted evidence of the Chairman of the
Censor Board that the film did not fall below contemporary community standards.
Counsel for the appellant does not contend that censor board approval is a bar
to a criminal prosecution. He readily concedes that it is for the courts to
decide whether a publication is obscene (Daylight Theatre Co. v. The Queen
(supra); R. v. McFall (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 181 (B.C.C.A.)

 

43.              Counsel does, however, take the point that
in light of the evidence, not disputed, of the approval of the allegedly
obscene film by all of the censor boards or classification boards across the
country there was an additional onus on the Crown to adduce evidence to
establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the film went beyond what the
contemporary Canadian community is prepared to tolerate. In support of this
argument counsel cited several passages on the subject of expert evidence from
the dissenting judgment of Laskin J.A., as he then was, in R. v. Cameron
(1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 486 (Ont. C.A.) and urged us to accept them as correct
statements of the evidentiary requirements in obscenity cases. 

 

44.              The issue of who must place evidence of what
before the trier of fact in obscenity cases is a vexing and recurring problem.
Under the Hicklin rule expert evidence was in general held to be
irrelevant. As Laidlaw J.A. explained in R. v. American News Co. (1957),
118 C.C.C. 152 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 157, since, under the Hicklin test, the
gravamen of the offence was a tendency to deprave or corrupt, evidence
as to artistic merit‑‑no matter how reliable‑‑was held
to be irrelevant to the issue of obscenity. And as for evidence tending to show
that the material in question had no tendency to deprave or corrupt, Laidlaw
J.A.'s discussion, at p. 161, illustrates that the prevailing rules of evidence
held such testimony to be inadmissible opinion evidence going to the very
question to be determined by the trier of fact.

 

45.              With the inception of the new statutory
definition in s. 159(8)  this rigid inflexibility was considerably relaxed. In Brodie
(supra), at p. 703, Judson J. made it clear that expert evidence as to
the seriousness of the artist's purpose and the artistic merit of the material
in question was certainly admissible, and, in his view, very helpful:

 

I can read and understand,
but at the same time I recognize that my training and experience have been, not
in literature but in law and I readily acknowledge that the evidence of the
witnesses who gave evidence in this case is of real assistance to me in
reaching a conclusion.

 

46.              In the Prairie Schooner case one
issue was the admissibility of expert evidence (in the form of public opinion
polls) on the question of the actual state of contemporary community standards.
At page 266 of the report of that case there appears the following passage in
the judgment of Monnin J.A. and myself:

 

...it would seem to me
that when it becomes necessary to determine the true nature of community
opinion and to find a single normative standard, the Court should not be denied
the benefit of evidence, scientifically obtained in accordance with accepted
sampling procedure, by those who are expert in the field of opinion research.
Such evidence can properly be accorded the status of expert testimony.
The state of mind or attitude of a community is as much a fact as the state of
one's health: it would seem therefore as proper to admit the opinion of experts
on the one subject as on the other.

 

(Emphasis added.) 

 

47.              To hold expert evidence admissible
with regard to the factual underpinnings of the community standard test for
""undueness"" is, of course, not the same as holding such evidence to
be mandatory. In R. v. Great West News Ltd. (supra), the
appellants attempted to impose precisely that obligation on the Crown. It was
argued that the Crown must fail because no evidence had been put before the
court from which the court could objectively determine prevailing community
standards. Counsel submitted that the court must determine from evidence placed
before it by the Crown: (i) what is the community standard, that is to say,
what is the standard of tolerance of Canadians as a whole to material of the
nature of that impugned? (ii) does the material impugned so far transcend that
standard as to be branded as criminal? After a review of the cases, and
speaking also for Smith C.J.M., I had occasion to say, at pp. 314‑15:

 

                   The
authorities would seem to ascribe to the Judge a much more important role in
the assessment of contemporary community standards than counsel for the
appellants would accord him. I do not find in Brodie or elsewhere in the
Commonwealth, any majority opinion that expert evidence of community standards
is an essential ingredient to a finding of guilt. If any inference can be drawn
from Brodie it is that the Judge must, in the final analysis, endeavour
to apply what he, in the light of his experience, regards as contemporary
standards of the Canadian community. In so doing he must be at pains to avoid
having his decision simply reflect or project his own notions of what is
tolerable.

 

48.              I am unaware of any majority opinion,
since the Great West News Ltd. judgment, in Canada or elsewhere in the
Commonwealth, which has made expert evidence of community standards mandatory.
To impose on the Crown a positive requirement to adduce expert evidence as to
community standards would be unrealistic. Expert evidence is always expensive,
sometimes simply not available and frequently unreliable. The American
experience‑‑based, to be sure on a somewhat different test for
obscenity‑‑has been summarized in Paris Adult Theatre I v.
Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 (1973) at p. 56, Note 6. Obscenity, it is said,
""is not a subject that lends itself to the traditional use of expert
testimony...indeed the `expert witness' practices employed in these cases have
often made a mockery out of the otherwise sound concept of expert
testimony"". United States v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise,
709 F.2d 132 (2d Cir. 1983) at p. 135, a recently reported American obscenity
decision, confirms that although the government bears the burden of proving
each element of obscenity (including a breach of community standards) to the
satisfaction of the trier of fact, expert evidence of community standards is
not constitutionally required, and that absent (or even in the face of) such
evidence, the impugned materials may ""speak for themselves"" so as to
ground a conviction for obscenity. 

 

49.              This is essentially the situation that
obtains in Canada. In R. v. Cameron (supra), in the judgment
cited by the appellant, Laskin J.A. distills from the case law five
propositions regarding the law of obscenity. The fifth, at p. 513, is:

 

Expert evidence is
admissible on the issue of ""undueness"" but it must be weighed by the
Court even when it is all one way and stands uncontradicted.

 

50.              With respect, I agree that this is an
accurate statement of the law. If later passages in Laskin J.A.'s dissent do in
fact retreat from this position, so as to suggest that expert evidence, whether
in chief or in rebuttal, is a legal prerequisite for a finding of obscenity,
then with great respect I cannot agree. I consider as accurate the following
statement of evidentiary requirements enunciated in the recent decision of
Borins J. in R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (supra), at pp. 171‑72:

 

It is well established
that if the material itself is introduced into evidence, expert evidence as to
obscenity or community standards is not required. Indeed, even if it is
presented, the trier of fact is not bound to accept it. There is no necessity
for the judge or jury to rely on evidence introduced in court as the basis for
identifying community standards. Therefore, the trier of fact may determine for
himself or herself (or themselves, in cases tried by a jury) the content of the
community standard which is to be applied in determining whether the material
in issue exceeds that standard. It is an objective test which applies. The test
is not based on the level of tolerance of the judge or the jury. It is what the
judge or jury believe the national level of tolerance to be.

 

51.              Although, with great respect, I would not
subscribe to any suggestion in Laskin J.A.'s dissent in R. v. Cameron (supra)
that expert evidence is mandatory, I would nonetheless adopt his comment at p.
515 of that judgment:

 

Of course, that ultimate
issue was for him [the judge], but even the most knowledgeable adjudicator
should hesitate to rely on his own taste, his subjective appreciation, to
condemn art. He does not advance the situation by invoking his right to apply
the law and satisfying it by a formulary advertence to the factors which must
be canvassed in order to register a conviction. 

 

52.              What is essential to a determination of
undueness by means of the community standards test is that the trier of fact
formulate an opinion of what the contemporary Canadian community will tolerate.
In forming this opinion, the trier of fact must assess the community consensus.
This assessment will inevitably involve judgments about values since it is one
that touches the very fundamental mores and viewpoints of the Canadian
community.

 

53.              I would repeat, however, that this inquiry,
though involving judgments about values, must be distinguished from the
application of the trier of fact's subjective opinions about the tastelessness
or impropriety of certain publications. The decision must focus on an objective
determination of the community's level of tolerance and whether the publication
exceeds such level of tolerance, not the trier of fact's personal views
regarding the impugned publication. Thus, the role of an appellate court on an
appeal from a determination of the community standard is to ensure that the
trier of fact's decision is based on an opinion on the community standard of
tolerance, not on his or her opinion about the tastelessness or impropriety of
the impugned publication.

 

54.              Evidence of the community's standard of
tolerance may well be useful and indeed desirable in many cases. Nonetheless, I
do not consider that there must be evidence, expert or otherwise, which the
trier of fact accepts before a particular publication can be determined to violate
the community standard. It is the opinion of the trier of fact on the community
standard of tolerance with which we are concerned. It ought not to be stated as
a matter of law that the trier of fact must have evidence, expert or otherwise,
to be able to form an opinion on the community standard of tolerance.

 

55.              As I have indicated, the defence did lead
evidence of Mr. Hooper, the Chairman of the Alberta Censor Board for the
purpose of showing that the film did not fall below contemporary community
standards. The trial judge made only one reference to this evidence:

 

                   Now,
whether or not the film was approved by the Censor Board, as far as I am
concerned, has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not the Crown can
prefer an indictment against it for providing an immoral, indecent or obscene
performance. The Court is the one that has to decide that. 

 

56.              The law is clear that a trier of fact does
not have to accept testimony, whether expert or otherwise. He can reject it, in
whole or in part. He cannot, however, reject it without good reason. In this
case, it was incumbent on the trial judge to consider and assess the weight, if
any, to be given to the evidence, indicative of community standards of tolerance,
afforded by the approval of the film by censor boards or classification boards
as well as the fact that no complaints had been received by the Board in
Alberta although more than 8,500 people had viewed the film. He might, for
instance, have considered the following assessment of similar evidence with
regard to Last Tango in Paris by Freedman C.J.M. in R. v. Odeon
Morton Theatres Ltd. (supra), at p. 196:

 

[The issue of obscenity]
must be determined according to contemporary community standards in Canada.
Relevant to that determination are many factors. One is the testimony of the
experts, to be judicially assessed and weighed. Another is the circumstance
that the film is adult fare only, as it has been given the classification
""Restricted Adult"", thereby becoming unavailable to persons under 18
years of age. A third is the fact that the film is being shown in New
Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia, in all of which Provinces it
was given clearance by censor boards who made no deletions in it. (The film is
of course being shown in many other countries in the world as well.) The record
does not disclose a single Province that has banned ""Last Tango"". I
am loath to believe that Manitobans are less tolerant, less sophisticated, or more
in need of protective shelter than other Canadians.

 

In the present case the trial judge should certainly not have rejected
the evidence before him without explanation.

 

57.              It must also be kept in mind that the
Crown must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. If at the end of the case
the trial judge, whether on the basis of the defence evidence or otherwise, has
a reasonable doubt that the material falls below community standards, he must
acquit. There is no onus on the accused to show that community standards have
been met.

 

58.              In my view the trial judge erred in
failing to have regard to the unrebutted evidence of the Chairman of the Censor
Board of Alberta.

 

59.              Both the points advanced by the appellant
are well taken. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgments at
trial and on appeal, and order a new trial. 

 

                   The reasons of Beetz and Estey JJ. were delivered by

 

60.              Beetz
J.‑‑I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for
judgment written by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice McIntyre and Madame Justice
Wilson.

 

61.              Like Mr. Justice McIntyre, I agree with
the Chief Justice that the standard we seek is that of tolerance and that:
""What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to see.
What matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because
it would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow
them to see it."" I agree, however, with the Chief Justice that the Crown
is not required to adduce expert evidence as to community standards.

 

62.              Again like Mr. Justice McIntyre, I agree
with Madame Justice Wilson that the audience to which a film or other
publication is exposed is not relevant to a consideration of whether it is
obscene.

 

63.              I would dispose of the appeal as do the
Chief Justice and Madame Justice Wilson. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

64.              McIntyre
J.‑‑I have read the reasons for judgment prepared for
delivery by the Chief Justice and Madame Justice Wilson. I am in agreement with
the Chief Justice that the standard we seek is that of tolerance and that:
""What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to see.
What matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because
it would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow
them to see it."" I agree, however, with Madame Justice Wilson that the
audience to which a film or other publication is exposed is not relevant to a
consideration of whether it is obscene, and also share her view that to
formulate the community standard, which is an element of the proof required
from the Crown in a criminal case, some evidence, expert or otherwise, must be
adduced by the Crown before the trier of fact. I would dispose of the appeal as
do the Chief Justice and Madame Justice Wilson. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

65.              Wilson
J.‑‑I concur in the result reached by the Chief Justice. I
wish, however, to express my own view as to what the trial judge did in this
case that constituted error in law. In so doing I have found it necessary to
some extent to revert to first principles. I start with the wording of s.
159(8) of the Criminal Code which reads:

 

                   (8) For
the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is
the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following
subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be
obscene.

 

It seems to me that the question which the section poses is: is the
undue exploitation of sex a dominant characteristic of this movie? The narrower
question is: is the exploitation of sex in this movie ""undue""? If the
exploitation of sex in the movie is not ""undue"", then it matters not
that the exploitation of sex is a dominant characteristic of the movie; it
cannot be obscene under the section. The primary question then to which all
others are subordinate is: is the exploitation of sex in the movie
""undue""?

 

66.              I turn to the test of
""undueness"". How is ""undueness"" to be measured? Clearly it
postulates a standard which cannot be exceeded and that standard has been
stated by the courts to be an objective one, the contemporary community
standard in Canada. The problem then becomes one of how to identify that
contemporary community standard in order to decide whether or not it has been
exceeded.

 

67.              The standard we are concerned with, it seems
to me, is the degree of exploitation of sex which the Canadian community at any
given point of time is prepared to accept in its movies. This is sometimes
referred to as the Canadian standard of tolerance. I take no issue with the
word tolerance. In my view there is no difference in meaning between acceptance
by the community and tolerance by the community. I do not find it helpful,
however, to refine further on that standard by identifying it as the degree of
exploitation of sex to which Canadians are prepared to have other Canadians
exposed. I think this is a different standard, a much more difficult one to
identify and one not mandated by the section. 

 

68.              The test by which the trier of fact must
assess the community standard is an objective one. The community standard
itself, however, necessarily contains an element of subjectivity since what
must be objectified are the subjective views of the entire community as to what
degree of exploitation of sex is acceptable. To identify the community standard
in terms of the degree of exploitation of sex to which Canadians are prepared
to have other Canadians exposed has the effect, however, of introducing an even
greater degree of subjectivity into the community standard. I believe this is
so because what Canadians consider to be acceptable for other Canadians is
likely to depend heavily on which other Canadians they have in mind. The
community may feel that the degree of exploitation of sex in a particular film
would be unacceptable if the film were shown to an audience of young people or
senior citizens but nevertheless feel that it would be acceptable if the film
were shown to a university group. In determining this community standard the
trier of fact would be forced to speculate not only on what the community
considers to be acceptable but on which particular constituency the community
has in mind in setting the standard of acceptability.

 

69.              I think we have to approach the question
more directly and ask: do Canadians today accept this degree of exploitation of
sex in their movies? If they do, then the movie is not obscene. If they don't,
then the exploitation is ""undue"" and, if it is a dominant
characteristic of the movie, the movie is deemed to be obscene under the
section. It is not, in my opinion, open to the courts under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code  to characterize a movie as obscene if shown to one constituency but
not if shown to another. I do not doubt that it is desirable to regulate the
movies that can be shown to different constituencies. A movie which is not
obscene within the meaning of the Criminal Code  may still not be
desirable viewing material for persons under the age of 18. Such regulation, as
will be mentioned later in these reasons, is authorized in various provincial
jurisdictions but it is the regulation of material which is not obscene under
the Code. I do not think the Court should, by segregating the community
into different groups for purposes of ascertaining the standard of tolerance the
community would adopt for each group, inject into s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code  a series of different tests of obscenity. In my view, a movie is
either obscene under the Code based on a national community standard of
tolerance or it is not. If it is not, it may still be the subject of provincial
regulatory control. 

 

70.              ""Undueness"", however, is not
purely a matter of degree. It must have reference to the total context of the
movie. As Judson J. said in Brodie v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681 at p.
702, in discussing obscenity in literature:

 

It is not the particular
passages and words in a certain context that are before the Court for judgment
but the book as a complete work. The question is whether the book as a whole is
obscene not whether certain passages and certain words, part of a larger work,
are obscene.

 

The same point was made by Chief Justice Freedman in R. v. Odeon
Morton Theatres Ltd. (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 185 (Man. C.A.), when, in
speaking of the film Last Tango in Paris, he said at p. 193:

 

It must be judged as a
whole. It should not be condemned as obscene merely by reference to its sexual
episodes or to its occasional gross and earthy language. Both the episodes and
the language must be assessed in the context of and in their relationship to
the entire film.

 

71.              Coming back then to the determination of
the community standard in the terms I have described, namely the standard the
community at any given time is prepared to accept or tolerate, how is this
moral consensus to be ascertained? I describe it as a ""moral""
consensus because I agree with the Chief Justice that we are not concerned here
with matters of ""taste"". To use the standard accepted by members of
the community for themselves does not, in my view, substitute ""taste""
for moral acceptability. I think it is incorrect to say that when I am deciding
whether or not I myself am prepared to be shown a certain type of movie I am
making a decision merely on the basis of taste but when I am deciding
whether or not I am prepared to have that same movie shown to others I am
making a decision on the basis of tolerance. This, in my view, is a
false distinction. In either case tolerance in the sense of moral acceptability
is the issue‑‑in the former case moral acceptability to myself and
in the latter moral acceptability to others. People may, of course, refuse to
patronize certain movies on grounds of taste but this is not at all what we are
concerned with under the Criminal Code . 

 

72.              The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary
defines  ""toleration"" as ""the action or practice of tolerating
or allowing what is not actually approved"". It is apparent from this
definition that there is a distinction between that which is not approved and
that which is not to be tolerated. In R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (1983), 36
C.R. (3d) 154 (Ont.) at p. 173, Borins Co. Ct. J. made the following assessment
of community standards of tolerance in relation to what may be described as
""sex films"":

 

In my opinion,
contemporary community standards would tolerate the distribution of films which
consist substantially of scenes of people engaged in sexual intercourse.
Contemporary community standards would also tolerate the distribution of films
which consist of scenes of group sex, lesbianism, fellatio, cunnilingus, and
anal sex. However, films which consist substantially or partially of scenes
which portray violence and cruelty in conjunction with sex, particularly where
the performance of indignities degrades and dehumanizes the people upon whom
they are performed, exceed the level of community tolerance.

 

In drawing this distinction I do not think that Borins Co. Ct. J. was
suggesting that the average Canadian finds the former type of film to his or
her taste or that such films are inoffensive to most Canadians. Rather, I think
that Borins Co. Ct. J. recognized that whether or not Canadians found the
former type of films distasteful, they were prepared to tolerate their being
shown.

 

73.              It seems to me that the undue exploitation
of sex at which s. 159(8)  is aimed is the treatment of sex which in some
fundamental way dehumanizes the persons portrayed and, as a consequence, the
viewers themselves. There is nothing wrong in the treatment of sex per se
but there may be something wrong in the manner of its treatment. It may be
presented brutally, salaciously and in a degrading manner, and would thus be
dehumanizing and intolerable not only to the individuals or groups who are
victimized by it but to society at large. On the other hand, it may be
presented in a way which harms no one in that it depicts nothing more than non‑violent
sexual activity in a manner which neither degrades nor dehumanizes any
particular individuals or groups. It is this line between the mere portrayal of
human sexual acts and the dehumanization of people that must be reflected in
the definition of ""undueness"".

 

74.              How is the Court to determine where the
line is drawn? By guidelines read into the definition as a matter of
interpretation of the word ""undue""? By consideration of the presumed
social ills sought to be avoided by restrictions on freedom of publication? By
statistics showing what people are prepared to look at and what they are not?
The courts have said that the test is an objective one and clearly that must be
so. But objectivity requires criteria and the courts have not been too
successful in evolving them. Yet this is a criminal offence and it is basic to
our system of criminal justice that the public know what conduct is criminal
and what is not.     

 

75.              This, it seems to me, militates very
strongly against a community standard test of undueness which varies with
""the targetted group"". I believe it is important to the publishing
industry to have some degree of certainty as to when they may be exposing
themselves to a criminal charge. The only way to provide that degree of
certainty is, in my opinion, to have a uniform community standard test of
""undueness"" under the Code. With great respect to those who
think otherwise, I see nothing in s. 159(8)  which would permit something to be
obscene under the section when shown to X but not obscene when shown to Y.
Moreover, it seems to me that this approach would inevitably lead to problems
where a publication targetted to one group by the accused fell into the hands
of others.

 

76.              As I see it, the essential difficulty with
the definition of obscenity is that ""undueness"" must presumably be
assessed in relation to consequences. It is implicit in the definition that at
some point the exploitation of sex becomes harmful to the public or at least
the public believes that to be so. It is therefore necessary for the protection
of the public to put limits on the degree of exploitation and, through the
application of the community standard test, the public is made the arbiter of
what is harmful to it and what is not. The problem is that we know so little of
the consequences we are seeking to avoid. Do obscene movies spawn immoral
conduct? Do they degrade women? Do they promote violence? The most that can be
said, I think, is that the public has concluded that exposure to material which
degrades the human dimensions of life to a subhuman or merely physical
dimension and thereby contributes to a process of moral desensitization must be
harmful in some way. It must therefore be controlled when it gets out of hand,
when it becomes ""undue"".

 

77.              Addressing the problem of
""undueness"" in the context of agreements which ""prevent or
lessen, unduly, competition"" in a product, Mr. Justice Idington said in Weidman
v. Shragge (1912), 46 S.C.R. 1 at pp. 20‑21: 

 

                   This
being a criminal statute we must try to find the vicious purpose aimed at in
order to bring parties within its prohibitions.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   Crimes
usually imply something all right‑minded men condemn.... The test must in
each case be the true purpose and its relation to the activities specified in
and by the words of the statute and a finding of an evil or vice answering to
the descriptive word ""unduly"".

 

He found the vicious purpose in the context of combines legislation to
be the destruction of all competition. What is the vicious purpose aimed at in
the case of obscenity legislation? The statutory definition does not provide an
answer nor, with respect, does the existing jurisprudence.

 

78.              The test of the community standard is
helpful to the extent that it provides a norm against which impugned material
may be assessed but it does little to elucidate the underlying question as to
why some exploitation of sex falls on the permitted side of the line under s.
159(8)  and some on the prohibited side. No doubt this question will have to be
addressed when the validity of the obscenity provisions of the Code is
subjected to attack as an infringement on freedom of speech and the
infringement is sought to be justified as reasonable. Suffice it to say, that
clearly some fairly basic values are designed to be protected by the obscenity
provisions and the community standards test is premised on the assumption that
these values are held in common by the contemporary Canadian community.

 

79.              The community standard test in Canada, I
believe, had its origin in Brodie (supra), the Lady Chatterley’s
Lover case, in which four members of this Court concluded that the
definition of obscenity introduced into the Code in 1957 made the test
in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, obsolete. In their view it was
no longer necessary to show a tendency to corrupt and deprave if the dominant
characteristic of the publication was an exploitation of sex which was
""undue"". The test of ""undueness"", said Mr. Justice Fauteux
at p. 697, was whether the exploitation was shocking and disgusting
""having regard to the existing standards of decency in the
community...."" Mr. Justice Judson agreed at pp. 705‑06 that the
standards of acceptance prevailing in the community provided the test of
""undueness"" for purposes of the definition. The statutory definition,
he felt, could not be superimposed upon the Hicklin test without leaving
the citizen in the position of not knowing whether he was committing a criminal
act or not. 

 

80.              The community standard test was applied
the same year (1962) in Manitoba by Freedman J.A. (as he then was) dissenting
in R. v. Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd., [1963] 2 C.C.C. 103. The
learned justice said he would have judged the magazines by the standards of the
community and this Court, in reversing the decision of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal ([1964] S.C.R. 251), unanimously approved and adopted his reasons. I
quote the relevant passage in full from pp. 116‑17 of Mr. Justice
Freedman's reasons:

 

The case for the Crown
stands or falls on the applicability or otherwise of the first part of the
definition‑‑namely, that a dominant characteristic of these
magazines was ""the undue exploitation of sex"".

 

                   Can it
fairly be said that this was a dominant characteristic of either Dude or
Escapade? I have examined them both with care. That they do not qualify as
reading matter which I would personally select for myself even in an idle hour
is undoubtedly the case. But that does not make them obscene. In this area of
the law one must be especially vigilant against erecting personal tastes or
prejudices into legal principles. Many persons quite evidently desire to read
these magazines, even though I do not. I recognize, of course, that the mere
numerical support which a publication is able to attract is not determinative
of the issue whether it is obscene or not. Let a publication be sufficiently
pornographic and it will be bound to appeal, in the hundreds or thousands, to
the prurient, the lascivious, the ignorant, the simple, or even the merely
curious. Admitting, therefore, that a large readership is not the test, I must
yet add that it is not always an entirely irrelevant factor. For it may have to
be taken into account when one seeks to ascertain or identify the standards of
the community in these matters. Those standards are not set by those of lowest
taste or interest. Nor are they set exclusively by those of rigid, austere,
conservative, or puritan taste and habit of mind. Something approaching a
general average of community thinking and feeling has to be discovered.
Obviously this is no easy task, for we are seeking a quantity that is elusive.
Yet the effort must be made if we are to have a fair objective standard in
relation to which a publication can be tested as to whether it is obscene or
not. The alternative would mean a subjective approach, with the result
dependent upon and varying with the personal tastes and predilections of the
particular Judge who happens to be trying the case.

 

                   Community
standards must be contemporary. Times change, and ideas change with them.
Compared to the Victorian era this is a liberal age in which we live. One
manifestation of it is the relative freedom with which the whole question of
sex is discussed. In books, magazines, movies, television, and sometimes even
in parlour conversation, various aspects of sex are made the subject of
comment, with a candour that in an earlier day would have been regarded as
indecent and intolerable. We cannot and should not ignore these present‑day
attitudes when we face the question whether Dude and Escapade are obscene
according to our criminal law.

 

                   Community
standards must also be local. In other words, they must be Canadian. In
applying the definition in the Criminal Code  we must determine what is
obscene by Canadian standards, regardless of attitudes which may prevail
elsewhere, be they more liberal or less so.

 

                   I think
I should add my view that, in cases close to the border line, tolerance is to
be preferred to proscription. To strike at a publication which is not clearly
obscene may have repercussions and implications beyond what is immediately
visible. To suppress the bad is one thing; to suppress the not so bad, or even
the possibly good is quite another. Unless it is confined to clear cases,
suppression may tend to inhibit those creative impulses and endeavours which
ought to be encouraged in a free society. 

 

81.              In reversing the Manitoba Court of Appeal
Taschereau C.J. said at p. 251:

 

                   We are
all of opinion that the appeals should be allowed. We agree with the reasons
given by Freedman J.A. in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. We wish to adopt
those reasons in their entirety and do not find it necessary to add anything to
them.

 

I would respectfully adopt ""the Freedman approach"" as the law
applicable to this case.

 

82.              If I am correct as to how the community
standard in Canada is to be identified, namely with reference to what Canadians
at any given point of time will accept in their movies, then what is the
significance of the evidence of the unanimous approval of this film by the
censor boards of all the provinces having such boards?

 

83.              I believe that there is an onus on the
Crown to put evidence before the court on the issue of ""undueness"". I
cannot see how the community standard against which the allegedly obscene
matter has to be measured can be identified without it. In R. v. Cameron
(1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 486 (Ont.), Laskin J.A. (as he then was) pointed out in
dissent that because a judge or jury may be limited in the geographical range
of his exposure, which in turn might result in ""a limitation of
opportunity of appreciation and understanding"" of the particular subject‑matter‑‑in
that case artists' drawings‑‑expert evidence was indispensable. He
said at p. 515:

 

I think that such evidence
would always be necessary to support the case for the Crown as well as to
support the defence, especially where, as here, pictures by artists of repute
are seized from a reputable gallery. Holding this view, I cannot but be
surprised that the Crown in the case at bar produced no expert evidence and
relied on the pictures themselves to convey obscenity to the Magistrate. Of
course, that ultimate issue was for him, but even the most knowledgeable
adjudicator should hesitate to rely on his own taste, his subjective
appreciation, to condemn art. He does not advance the situation by invoking his
right to apply the law and satisfying it by a formulary advertence to the
factors which must be canvassed in order to register a conviction.

 

84.              Laskin J.A. was, of course, speaking of
expert evidence in the context of that case but it seems to me that the point
is well made with respect to non‑expert evidence as well. Having regard
to the fact that the onus is on the Crown to establish obscenity beyond a
reasonable doubt, it seems to me that the onus is on it to establish both what
the community standard of acceptability is and that the accused has gone beyond
it. The accused may counter the Crown's evidence of the community standard with
evidence of its own and the judge may reach his decision on the evidence in the
usual way. In my view it is naive to think that a judge, drawing on his own
experience alone, can determine the objective standard against which impugned
conduct is to be measured. As Borins Co. Ct. J. said in R. v. Doug Rankine
Co. (supra) the legislature cannot credibly expect a trier of fact to have
his finger on the ""pornographic pulse of the nation"". Moreover, it is
wrong in principle. It leaves the accused with no way of knowing the case it
has to meet, at what level of acceptability the line will be drawn by any
particular judge. There is no certainty. It is the length of the Chancellor's
foot imported into the criminal law. 

 

85.              The result feared by Laskin J.A. when no
evidence is presented to the trial judge is precisely what happened here. The
trial judge made ""a formulary advertence to the factors that had to be
canvassed"". He indicated that he knew that the test of
""undueness"" was an objective one, that he had to decide whether or
not the film exceeded the standard of acceptability to the community as a whole
but he then proceeded to attribute the sense of revulsion which he experienced
on viewing the film to the community as a whole. He gave no indication of the
basis on which he felt able to make that leap and there is no suggestion that
he took into consideration the evidence of censor board approval which was
before him. That evidence was not contested and, having regard to the statutory
purpose for which these boards were created, I think it was relevant evidence
and evidence which he was obliged to consider.

 

86.              The legislation creating these boards
varies from province to province but the role of the boards, generally
speaking, is to approve, prohibit or regulate the exhibition of films within
their respective provinces. The boards are not only empowered to approve or
disapprove films in toto. In some provinces the legislation also
authorizes the boards to ""remove by cutting or otherwise"" parts of
films. Most provinces have a film classification system, the classes, generally
speaking, being ""general"", ""adult"" and
""restricted"".

 

87.              Since the business of these boards is to
assess films on an ongoing basis for the very purpose of determining their
acceptability for viewing by the community as a whole or a segment of the
community depending upon classification, they must be regarded as tribunals
with expertise at least on the community standard within their own province. It
is hard to think that a judge, or even a jury, sitting in or drawn from a local
area would be better informed as to what was acceptable to Canadians across the
country. Moreover, in this case at least, the boards' assessments disclose a
remarkable degree of uniformity. I do not see how the learned trial judge,
applying an objective test and giving proper consideration to that evidence,
could have reached the result he did. I believe it is clear from his reasons
that he saw his role, not as applying the community standard, but as raising
the standard if he personally thought it was too low. I think he was clearly in
error in this regard. 

 

88.              The Court of Appeal on this aspect of the
case stated:

 

The trial judge, sitting
as a jury, was obliged to determine in an objective way what was tolerable in
accordance with the contemporary standards of the Canadian community. As a
trier of fact he was entitled to draw on his experience in the community. He
had to consider the expert evidence but was entitled to reject it and obviously
did.

 

With respect, I think it is far from obvious that the trial judge
rejected the expert evidence. The only comment he made on it was:

 

                   Now,
whether or not the film was approved by the Censor Board, as far as I am
concerned, has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not the Crown can
prefer an indictment against it for providing an immoral, indecent or obscene
performance. The Court is the one that has to decide that.

 

There is no question that the approval of the censor board does not
preclude the preferring of an indictment. The issue the judge had to decide was
the significance of the approvals as evidence of the community standard of
acceptance. It seems to me that he never addressed his mind to that issue.

 

89.              In my view, the practice of allowing the
trier of fact to rely exclusively on his or her personal experience of
community standards of tolerance (see R. v. Great West News Ltd., [1970]
4 C.C.C. 307 (Man. C.A.) at pp. 314‑15) is an invitation to the type of
error committed by the trial judge in this case. The problem can be readily
avoided by requiring the Crown to adduce evidence of the community standard.
The trier of fact would then determine the community standard on the basis of
the evidence before him in the same way as he determines the factual issues in
any other kind of criminal case. 

 

90.              I cannot see how such a requirement would,
as has been suggested, frustrate the Crown's ability to secure a conviction in
a meritorious case. At present the trier of fact in an obscenity case can be
faced with the unenviable task of deciding the level of tolerance of a
community of 24 million people on the basis of nothing more than his or her own
personal experience. In effect, what the trier of fact does in the absence of
evidence is attribute by inference his or her own perception to the entire
Canadian community. I would think that requiring the trier of fact to make the
determination on the basis of evidence adduced would render the task easier
rather than more difficult. It would also, in my view, inspire greater public
confidence in the result. Moreover, it might well have the very desirable
effect of enhancing uniformity in the application of the law of obscenity since
evidence of community standards which is relevant to one prosecution will
commonly be relevant to others.

appeal must be allowed, the judgments at trial and on appeal set aside and a

                   The appellants are Roman Catholics who were charged,
pursuant to s. 172(3)  of the Criminal Code , with wilfully disturbing the
order or solemnity of an assemblage of persons met for religious worship. The
appellants opposed a change in the liturgy, approved by the Bishop, requiring
communion to be received by parishioners while standing rather than kneeling as
had been the previous practice. As a result of this liturgical change, there
had been an ongoing dispute between appellants and their parish priest and
other members of the congregation. A diocesan directive, describing in
particular the manner communion was to be administered and received, was
regularly read at services and twice during mass on the day in question.
However, appellants attempted to receive communion in a kneeling position. Each
was told by the priest to stand if he wished to receive it. After a few
seconds, each one stood and, without having received communion, returned to his
seat in an orderly manner. The trial judge convicted the accused, finding their
actions hampered the spirituality of this part of the service, held up the
communion lines briefly and created a degree of anxiety and tension which
distracted the priests and some members of the congregation. Both the County
Court and the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appellate Division, upheld the conviction.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson, Beetz,
McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: Subsection 172(3)  of the Criminal
Code  is valid federal legislation pursuant to s. 91(27)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 . This subsection is a prohibition which, by means of
summary conviction penalty, protects people, who have gathered to pursue any
kind of socially beneficial activity, from being purposefully disturbed or
interrupted. This prohibition, with its consequent penal sanctions, serves the
needs of public morality by precluding conduct potentially injurious to the
public interest. It therefore bears the essential characteristics by which
matters falling within the criminal law power of Parliament are commonly
identified.

 

                   The conduct of the appellants did not violate s.
172(3)  of the Criminal Code . Appellants' conduct was undoubtedly wilful
and took place at an assemblage of persons met for religious purposes. Conduct
producing annoyance, anxiety or emotional upset in the members of the
assemblage met for religious worship is not sufficient, however, to found a
conviction under the subsection. Where the impugned acts are brief, essentially
passive in nature and are voluntarily desisted from, upon request, then there
is no crime. Some activity in the nature of a disorder must occur as a result
of this type of conduct before a trial judge would be entitled to find the
order or solemnity of a meeting had been disturbed. 

 

                   To found criminal liability under this subsection,
the actions must meet a definition of the word ""disturbs"" suitable in
law to the context of the section and the offence thereby enacted. Not all
conduct capable of being described as disturbing or creating a disturbance will
fall within s. 172(3) . The use of the all‑encompassing term ""anything"",
to describe the type of acts that can be the cause of the disturbance, is an
indication of the need to restrict the meaning of the word
""disturbs"". Parliament could not have intended that s. 172(3)  could
be triggered by conduct which is not disorderly in itself or productive of
disorder. The heading of ss. 169‑175 of the Code‑‑Disorderly
Conduct‑‑supports this conclusion. There was no identifiable
disorder in this case. A brief holdup of the lines and a heightening of the
existing atmosphere of tension discerned by some of those present is not
evidence of a disorder. The trial judge erred in law in his interpretation of
s. 172(3)  and wrongly convicted the appellants.

 

                   Per Lamer and Wilson
JJ.: The trial judge erred in holding that kneeling instead of standing to
receive communion fell within the meaning of the word ""anything"" when
properly interpreted in light of the legislative context and legislative
history of s. 172(3)  of the Criminal Code . The appellants should not
have been convicted.

 

                   The legislative context and history of the provision
dictates that the word ""anything"" should be given a restricted
interpretation consonant with the purpose of the statute. Prior to 1954, a
disturbance, interruption or disquiet of a religious assembly was only punishable
if it took place ""by profane discourse, by rude or indecent behaviour or
by making noise"". In amending the section in the 1953‑54 Code
to its present form, Parliament did not intend to expand its scope to cover
peaceful acts of defiance of religious authority. This view is reinforced by
the fact that s. 161 of the 1953‑54 Code (like s. 172 of the
present Code) is one of a series of offences falling under the heading
""Disorderly Conduct"". Accordingly, although the trial judge found on
proper evidence that the appellants' conduct disturbed the order and solemnity
of the service, no offence was committed.

 

                   Section 172(3)  of the Criminal Code  is
properly characterized as criminal law since, in substance, it is an enactment
to prevent breaches of the public peace and to enable citizens to conduct
services of worship without fear of disturbance. Although, as a matter of
statutory interpretation, the appellants' conduct is not caught by the section,
this does not mean that the Criminal Code  could not, if clear and
unambiguous language were used for the purpose, characterize such conduct as
criminal where the result of it was to disturb the solemnity of a religious
service.

Part I‑‑Introduction

 

2.                The six appellants are Roman Catholics
who were charged, pursuant to s. 172(3)  of the Criminal Code , with
wilfully doing an act that disturbed the order or solemnity of an assemblage of
persons met for religious worship. The charge was laid following their attempt
to receive holy communion in a kneeling position, contrary to a diocesan
directive that communion would only be given to parishioners who stood to
receive it. The accused were convicted at trial. Their convictions were
affirmed on appeal by both the Nova Scotia County Court and the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court, Appellate Division. This case calls for consideration of the
proper interpretation in law to be given s. 172(3)  as well as the
constitutional validity of this subsection in light of s. 91(27)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 .

 

Part II‑‑Background and Facts

 

3.                The facts of the case are
straightforward and undisputed. The six appellants are practising members of
the Roman Catholic faith. They have for many years attended Our Lady of Lourdes
Parish Church in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. Our Lady of Lourdes is one of ninety‑three
parishes which make up the Diocese of Antigonish.

 

4.                It has become the custom in this diocese
for communion to be received standing by those able to do so. This custom is a
relatively recent development. The previous practice had been for communion to
be received kneeling. This change has been accepted and approved by the Bishop
responsible for the diocese. 

 

5.                Nonetheless, the appellants continued to
oppose this change in the liturgy. As a result of their opposition, there has
been what has been characterized before us as an ongoing dispute between the
appellants on the one hand and the priests and other members of this church, on
the other hand.

 

6.                To aid in the resolution of this
dispute, the parish priest and his assistant drew up a directive concerning the
procedures to be followed during mass. This directive dealt in particular with
the manner in which communion was to be administered and received. This
directive was regularly read during services to the parishioners prior to the
day of the alleged offence.

 

7.                On that day as well, this directive was
read to the assembled congregation, among whom were then present most, if not
all, of the appellants. The directive was again read shortly before communion
was administered by which time all appellants were present.

 

8.                When the point in the mass had been
reached when communion was to be taken, the appellants, with the other members
of the congregation who desired to receive communion, made their way to the
back of the church. From there, two lines formed and made their way down the
centre aisle towards the three communion stations at or near the altar. The two
lines spread into three as they approached these communion stations.

 

9.                As each accused arrived at a communion
station, he or she knelt before the priest. They were each told to stand if
they wished to receive communion. After a few seconds, each one stood and,
without receiving communion, moved off in an orderly manner to the sides of the
church and returned to his or her seat.

 

Part III‑‑Courts Below

 

10.              The appellants were all charged upon
informations dated June 30, 1982, alleging that each of the appellants, at the
time and place set forth, ""did unlawfully at or near a meeting of
Religious Worship at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish, did wilfully disturb the order
or solemnity of that Religious Worship and Meeting, contrary to section 172(3) 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada"".

 

11.              Section 172  of the Criminal Code 
reads:

 

                   172. (1) Every one who 

 

(a) by threats or
force, unlawfully obstructs or prevents or endeavours to obstruct or prevent a
clergyman or minister from celebrating divine service or performing any other
function in connection with his calling, or

 

(b) knowing that a
clergyman or minister is about to perform, is on his way to perform, or is
returning from the performance of any of the duties or functions mentioned in
paragraph (a)

 

(i) assaults or offers any
violence to him, or

 

(ii) arrests him upon a
civil process, or under the pretence of executing a civil process,

 

is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

 

                   (2)
Every one who wilfully disturbs or interrupts an assemblage of persons met for
religious worship or for a moral, social or benevolent purpose is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   (3)
Every one who, at or near a meeting referred to in subsection (2), wilfully
does anything that disturbs the order or solemnity of the meeting is guilty of
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

12.              A motion for particulars was granted by
Judge R. MacEwan of Provincial Magistrate's Court on July 5, 1982. The Crown
filed the following reply to this order:

 

...the defendants failed
to take Communion in a manner that was directed and accepted by Our Lady of
Lourdes Parish; in that the Defendants kneeled rather than stood for the
purpose of receiving Communion, as is the accepted practice, and which kneeling
did interfere, and or distract other parishioners who were taking Communion as
was directed and accepted for the purpose of enabling said parishioners to
celebrate the Mass.

 

On August 18, 1982, Judge MacEwan convicted the appellants. Sentence
was suspended and each of the appellants was placed upon six months probation.

 

13.              The trial judge was of the view that the
appellants' refusal to take communion in the manner accepted in the parish
amounted to a violation of s. 172(3)  because it hampered the spirituality of
this part of the service. He concluded that both the order and the solemnity of
the meeting had been disturbed because the open defiance of the legitimate
authority of the priests was a disruptive act. In his view, it created a degree
of anxiety and tension which distracted the priests and the congregation from
one of the holiest moments in the mass. In reaching this conclusion, he
accepted and relied upon the uncontradicted evidence of the two priests
administering mass and three parishioners present during the service as to
their reaction to the appellants' attempts to receive communion while kneeling.

 

14.              An appeal against conviction and sentence
to the Nova Scotia County Court was dismissed by MacLellan J. He summarized his
reasons for denying the appeal against conviction in the following terms: 

 

                   In the
result then I am of the view that the appeal has no merit whatsoever. I think
the learned trial Judge, as I have indicated, had ample evidence to support the
conclusions that he reached. I see no failure of the evidence to support his
finding. I don't consider that his conclusion is unreasonable and in my view
there has been no miscarriage of justice. The appeal against conviction is
therefore dismissed.

 

15.              A further appeal to the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court, Appellate Division, sub nom. R. v. Hafey (1983), 4 C.C.C.
(3d) 344, 32 C.R. (3d) 285, 57 N.S.R. (2d) 100, 120 A.P.R. 100, brought with
the leave of that court, was also dismissed. Hart J.A., wrote for the unanimous
three member panel. I reproduce here the body of his reasoning:

 

                   The Criminal
Code  makes it an offence punishable on summary conviction for anyone to
disturb the order or solemnity of a religious meeting, and the trial judge
after hearing all of the evidence and arguments of counsel reached the
conclusion that the actions of the appellants under all of the circumstances
showed a defiance of the authority of their church and constituted a wilful
disturbance of the service. There was ample evidence, in my opinion, upon which
he could have reached that conclusion, and I have here to consider only whether
in law the offence contemplated by the Criminal Code  was in fact
committed.

 

                   Counsel
for the appellants argues that the bishop of the parish did not have the
authority to change the form of liturgy and insist upon the celebration of
communion in the new fashion, and that therefore the directive given by the
parish priest was not valid. She claims that her clients had the right to
receive communion in the kneeling position and had not therefore committed any
offence against the Criminal Code . She suggests strongly that the matter
is one for determination within the church and that a criminal prosecution
should not have been taken, as the acts committed by the appellants were not of
a criminal nature of the kind envisioned by the Code as an offence
against s. 172 .

 

                   In my
opinion there is no merit to the position taken by counsel for the appellants.
It is a criminal offence to disturb the order or solemnity of a religious
meeting, and that is exactly what the trial judge found as a fact the appellants
had done. If several persons disagree with the form of the religious service
they may have the right to withdraw but not to insist upon their procedures
against the will of the hierarchy of the church. The actions of the appellants
although relatively passive were conducted during the course of a bitter
dispute within the church and it was open to the trial judge to find that in
these circumstances their actions constituted a disturbance, and, in my
opinion, this type of disturbance is the very type of conduct intended to be
prohibited by the provisions of the Criminal Code . Feelings were
obviously running high among the parishioners and emotions were near the point
of explosion. The actions of the appellants could do nothing but disturb the
solemnity of the service.

 

16.              Leave to appeal was granted by this Court
[1983] 1 S.C.R. xiv. The appeals of all the appellants were treated as one
cause, as they had been in the courts below. The Attorney General of Canada
intervened in support of the position advanced by the Attorney General of Nova
Scotia. 

 

Part IV‑‑Issues

 

17.              The proper resolution of this case
necessitates consideration of the following two issues:

 

1. Whether s. 172(3) is intra
vires Parliament of Canada pursuant to s. 91(27)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 ;

 

2. Whether the courts
below have applied the proper legal standard in determining whether the
appellant's conduct violated s. 172(3)?

 

Part V‑‑Constitution Act,
1867 : s. 91(27) 

 

18.              The first issue then is whether s. 172(3) 
of the Criminal Code  is intra vires the Parliament of Canada. I
think it plainly is. The ""matter"" in relation to which this
subsection has been enacted comes within the power granted to Parliament by s.
91(27)  of the Constitution Act, 1867  to legislate upon criminal law.

 

19.              Subsection 172(3) , much like subs. 172(2),
is a prohibition which, by means of summary conviction penalty, protects
people, who have gathered to pursue any kind of socially beneficial activity,
from being purposefully disturbed or interrupted. The subsection is designed to
safeguard the rights of groups of people to meet freely and to prevent the
breaches of the peace which could result if these types of meetings were
disrupted. Vide R. v. Reed (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 153 (B.C.Co.Ct.), at p.
166, aff'd (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 573 (B.C.C.A.)

 

20.              There is no difficulty in concluding that
this prohibition, with its consequent penal sanctions, serves the needs of
public morality by precluding conduct potentially injurious to the public
interest. It therefore bears the essential characteristics by which matters
falling within the criminal law power of Parliament are commonly identified: Canadian
Federation of Agriculture v. Attorney‑General for Quebec, [1951] A.C.
179 (P.C.) approving Rand J. in sub nom. Reference re Validity of Section
5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act, [1949] S.C.R. 1, at pp. 49‑50.

 

21.              The appellants' argument upon this
division of powers question began with the submission that subs. 172(3) was not
competent to either Parliament or the provincial legislature in so far as it
dealt with religious matters. The argument, framed in this manner, is obviously
inapposite to any analysis of which body in the Canadian federal system is
empowered to legislate. It will not be competent to either legislative body to
enact legislation which contravenes the rights and freedoms guaranteed under
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The Charter  does
not, however, alter the distribution of powers between the provinces and the
federal parliament which continues to be governed by ss. 91  and 92  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 . 

 

22.              It is thus my opinion that s. 172(3)  is intra
vires the Parliament of Canada.

 

Part VI‑‑Interpretation of s.
172(3) 

 

23.              The next issue is whether the courts below
have applied the proper legal standard in determining whether the appellants'
conduct violated s. 172(3) . With due respect to the judges in the courts below,
it is my view that the conduct of the appellants did not violate s. 172(3)  when
that subsection is properly interpreted.

 

24.              Although s. 172(3) of the Code has
a long legislative history it has received little judicial consideration. In R.
v. Lavoie (1902), 6 C.C.C. 39 (Que. Rec. Ct.) the accused was charged with
having unlawfully and wilfully disturbed, by rude behaviour and by making
noise, an assemblage of persons met for a social purpose, to wit, the holding
of a meeting in a hall on Bonsecours Street in the City of Montréal. He was
acquitted on the ground that s. 173 of the 1892 Criminal Code  did not
apply to a meeting of electors of a city ward called in aid of a candidate for
election. In the view of the recorder, the section was not intended for the
preservation of order at political or municipal meetings.

 

25.              In R. v. Gauthier (1905), 11 C.C.C.
263 (Que. K.B.), the accused was convicted on appeal of disturbing the order or
solemnity of a meeting for religious worship. The accused entered a meeting of
the Salvation Army in a rented hall in the Municipality of St. Louis du Mile
End. The meeting was already in progress. He moved to the front, turned and
asked all French speaking people to rise, and when the majority arose, he
invited them to leave on the basis that the meeting was no place for French
Roman Catholics like himself. Most of the people in the room began to leave,
alarming the chairman of the meeting who attempted to prevent them.

 

26.              The presence of the Salvation Army in the
community had raised some hostile feelings and there was a large crowd of some
1200 people gathered outside. As the people began to leave the meeting, the
crowd began to throw objects through the windows of the hall, one of which hit
the chairman in the face. The crowd eventually dispersed. The accused,
acquitted at trial, was convicted on appeal to the King's Bench. Hall J.
concluded that ""...the members of the [Salvation] Army had the right to
the audience they had secured and no man had a right to go there and by a
peremptory command or even by personal influence to interfere with that
audience and take them away"". 

 

27.              See also Chaput v. Romain, [1955]
S.C.R. 834, per Taschereau J. at p. 842; R. v. Reed, supra;
R. v. Cardinal (1969), 8 C.R.N.S. 325 (Alta. Mag. Ct.); R. v. Wasyl
Kapij (1905), 9 C.C.C. 186 (Man. C.A.)

 

28.              To be guilty of an offence under s. 172(3) 
the following elements must be present:

 

(1) A person must wilfully
do ""anything"";

 

(2) at or near ""an
assemblage of persons met for religious worship or a moral, social or
benevolent purpose"";

 

(3) that ""disturbs
the order or solemnity of the meeting"".

 

29.              There can be no dispute, as the trial
judge concluded, that the appellants' conduct was wilful. They deliberately and
purposefully knelt to receive communion in acknowledged defiance of the
priest's direction that they stand.

 

30.              It is equally plain that the appellants'
actions took place at an assemblage of persons met for religious worship. They
were in church during the celebration of mass at which some 100 to 200 persons
were in attendance.

 

31.              I am not persuaded, however, that the
appellants' conduct could be said in law to have disturbed the order or
solemnity of the meeting. I have come to the conclusion that the trial judge
erred in law in his interpretation of the subsection and that he was wrong in
convicting the appellants. I have done so on the basis of the description given
at trial of the appellants' conduct and the reaction to it.

 

32.              The following are the facts, the only
facts, upon which the trial judge found a disturbance: (i) the appellants held
up the communion lines briefly and inconvenienced, to some degree, one or two
handicapped people who were behind them in line, (ii) their actions created
some anxiety or tension in the priests administering the communion as well as
those communicants who observed what took place. 

 

33.              In my opinion, it is not sufficient to
found a conviction under s. 172(3)  that an accused's conduct produce annoyance,
anxiety or emotional upset in the members of the assemblage met for religious
worship. Where the impugned acts are brief, essentially passive and peaceful in
nature and are voluntarily desisted from, upon request, as they were in this
case, then there is no crime. There must be some activity in the nature of a
disorder which occurs as a result of this conduct before a trial judge would be
entitled to find the order or solemnity of a meeting had been disturbed. Where,
on the other hand, the impugned actions are not passive nor peaceful in nature,
they may in themselves constitute activity in the nature of a disorder
sufficient to found a conviction under this subsection.

 

34.              There was no identifiable disorder in this
case. A brief holdup of the lines and a heightening of the existing atmosphere
of tension discerned by some of those present is not evidence of a disorder.

 

35.              The trial judge, however, accepted the
definitions of ""disturb"" and ""disturbance"" given in the Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary and Black’s Law Dictionary. The Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary defines ""disturb"" as, inter alia:

 

3. To interfere with the settled course or operation of; to interrupt,
hinder, frustrate...

 

Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979)
defines ""disturbance"" as:

 

Any act causing annoyance,
disquiet, agitation, or derangement to another, or interrupting his peace, or
interfering with him in the pursuit of a lawful and appropriate occupation or
contrary to the usages of a sort of meeting and class of persons assembled that
interferes with its due progress or irritates the assembly in whole or in part.

 

36.              I recognize that the appellants' conduct
could fall within the ordinary meaning of the word ""disturb"".
Equally, it could be embraced by the definition of ""disturbance""
given in Black’s Law Dictionary. (I would point out that the American
context from which the Black’s Law Dictionary definition appears to be
drawn is markedly different from the Canadian one, particularly, s. 172(3) : see
12 Am. Jur. 2d 661 ""Breach of Peace and Disorderly Conduct"".) Not all
conduct capable of being described as disturbing or creating a disturbance will
fall within s. 172(3) . To found criminal liability under this subsection, the
actions must meet a definition of the term ""disturbs"" suitable in law
to the context of the section and the offence thereby enacted. It is necessary
for the conduct to be disorderly in itself or productive of disorder to be rendered
criminal. Conduct which falls below this threshold will not be caught by the
subsection. 

 

37.              Parliament could not have intended that s.
172(3)  of the Criminal Code  could be triggered by conduct which is not
disorderly in itself or productive of disorder. The use of the all‑encompassing
term ""anything"" to describe the type of acts that can be the cause of
the disturbance is an indication of the need to restrict the meaning of the
word ""disturb"". If ""disturb"" in the context of s. 172(3)  is
taken to encompass annoyance, anxiety or emotional upset, then
""anything"", no matter how trivial, which would lead to such
annoyance, anxiety or emotional upset would be caught by the provision: a man
might be convicted under the section for failing to take his hat off in a
church, or failing to keep it on in a synagogue.

 

38.              This interpretation of the word is
strengthened by the context in which s. 172(3) of the Code is found. The
heading for ss. 169‑175 of the Code is ""Disorderly
Conduct"". Some assistance in interpreting the word ""disturb"" may
be gained from the use of the words ""disorderly conduct"" in the
heading.

 

39.              The role of headings in statutory
construction has been thoroughly canvassed by Mr. Justice Estey in Law
Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357. Estey J. noted
that neither the Canadian, English, nor American jurisprudence expresses any
definite canon of construction applicable to statute headings.

 

40.              Estey J. states at p. 376:

 

                   The
question of the role of the heading in the interpretation of statutes appears
to be open.

 

He then continues, with reference to the Charter , at p. 377:

 

                   At a
minimum the heading must be examined and some attempt made to discern the
intent of the makers of the document from the language of the heading. It is at
best one step in the constitutional interpretation process. It is difficult to
foresee a situation where the heading will be of controlling importance. It is,
on the other hand, almost as difficult to contemplate a situation where the
heading could be cursorily rejected although, in some situations, such as, in
the case of ""Legal Rights"", which in the Charter  is at the
head of eight disparate sections, the heading will likely be seen as being only
an announcement of the obvious. 

 

41.              The principles stated by Estey J. with
reference to headings in constitutional provisions are equally applicable to
enactments of Parliament such as the Criminal Code . Kellock J. in Attorney‑General
of Canada v. Jackson, [1946] S.C.R. 489, in a concurring opinion on a point
not discussed by the majority, stated (at pp. 495‑96):

 

                   Where
the language of a section is ambiguous, the title and the headings of the
statute in which it is found may be resorted to to restrain or extend its
meaning as best suits the intention of the statute, but neither the title nor
the headings may be used to control the meaning of enacting words in themselves
clear and unambiguous.

 

It should be noted that the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
I‑23, refers only to marginal notes and preambles and therefore does not
preclude the use of headings as an aid for statutory construction (see ss. 12
and 13).

 

42.              In my opinion, reliance may be placed upon
the heading of ss. 169‑175 of the Code as an aid in interpreting
the word ""disturb"" in s. 172(3) . The heading supports the conclusion
that Parliament intended only to proscribe conduct which is either disorderly
in itself or productive of disorder.

 

43.              It is therefore my view that the trial
judge incorrectly interpreted the kind of conduct which is capable in law of
amounting to a disturbance of the order or solemnity of an assemblage of
persons met for religious worship. Applying the interpretation of the
subsection I have outlined above, there was clearly no evidence available to
the trial judge upon which the appellants could have been convicted.

 

Part VII‑‑The Constitutional
Questions

 

44.              Prior to the hearing of the appeal, the
late Chief Justice Laskin granted an order stating the following constitutional
questions for the purpose of serving notice upon the Attorney General of Canada
and upon the Attorneys General of the Provinces:

 

(a)  Is Section
172(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada, as adopted by the Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal, in this decision, intra vires the Criminal Code 
of Canada? 

 

(b)  Was the subject
matter of the offence of which the Applicants were convicted, within the scope
of the criminal law power or was it in any event an offence known to law; and
did the decision constitute a breach of the Applicants rights as guaranteed
under Section 11 (g) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
(Constitution Act, 1982 )?

 

(c)  Did the Decision
infringe the Applicants religious rights and freedoms as declared in the Canadian
Bill of Rights; and did this infringement render Section 172(3)  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada inoperable?

 

(d)  Did the Decision
infringe the Applicants religious rights and freedoms as guaranteed under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (Constitution Act, 1982 ); and did
this infringement render Section 172(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada
inoperable?

 

45.              As Mr. Justice Beetz has recently noted in
Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60 at p. 71, this Court is not
bound to answer constitutional questions when it may dispose of the appeal
without doing so. In view of my conclusion that the appellants' conduct did not
violate s. 172(3)  when that section is properly interpreted, it is not
necessary to deal with the other constitutional issues this case may raise.

 

Part VIII‑‑Conclusion

 

46.              I would allow the appeal, quash the
convictions and acquit the appellants. I would order the restoration to the
appellants of the $150 awarded as costs to the Crown by Judge MacLellan. 

 

                   The reasons of Lamer and Wilson JJ. were delivered
by

 

47.              Wilson
J.‑‑The appellants were charged on informations dated June
30, l982 that on or about June 27, l982 they ""unlawfully at or near a
meeting of Religious Worship at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish did wilfully disturb
the order or solemnity of that Religious Worship and meeting, contrary to
section 172(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada"". They were convicted on
August 18, 1982 in the Provincial Magistrate's Court and given suspended
sentences. An appeal was taken to the County Court and dismissed by His Honour
Judge R. F. MacLellan. A further appeal to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court,
Appellate Division, was likewise dismissed. Leave to appeal to this Court was
granted on April 27, 1983.

 

1. The Facts

 

48.              The appellants are Roman Catholics and for
many years have attended Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Church in Stellarton, a
small town in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. In recent years the manner in which
communion is administered has been changed by the parish priests with the
approval of the Bishop. Members of the congregation must now stand to receive
communion rather than kneel as was the prior custom and, although the
parishioners are given a choice whether to accept the host in the hand or on
the tongue, they are not given a choice whether to stand or kneel.

 

49.              The appellants have opposed this change in
liturgy and have apparently been quite obstinate in their opposition. This
dispute between the appellants and the priests and other members of the
congregation had been going on for at least two years when, in an attempt to
end it, a directive was drawn up by the priest and his assistant and approved
by the Bishop of the Diocese. This directive made it clear that from then on
communicants were to stand for communion. The directive was made known to the
parishioners. 

 

50.              On the day of the offence under appeal the
directive was read before the commencement of mass and persons who were
unwilling to comply were instructed either to remain in their seats during
communion or to leave when communion was being served. The directive was read
again just before the parishioners were summoned to take communion. The
appellants proceeded to the front of the church along with the other
parishioners but, when they presented themselves to receive communion, they knelt.
They were informed that they were causing a disturbance and that they would not
receive communion in that position. They were instructed to return to their
seats and they did so.

 

51.              The evidence revealed that the acts of the
appellants, although peaceful in nature, upset the parish priest and his
assistant and upset some members of the congregation as well. There was some
suggestion also that the conduct of the appellants disturbed the order of the
service by slowing the progress of the lines of communicants. However, I think
it is fair to say that the principal disturbance was to the solemnity rather
than to the order of the service. This stemmed from the fact that the
appellants' defiance of the priest's directive caused a certain amount of
unease and tension on the part of other participants in the service. The
appellants' conduct did not, on the other hand, produce any overt reaction on
the part of other participants either in word or conduct.

 

52.              Several brief observations may be made
about these facts. The first is that reasonableness and a spirit of
accommodation do not appear to have been features of either side's conduct in
this liturgical dispute. The church has three aisles and, if traffic management
were the real reason for the liturgical change, one would have thought it
possible to accommodate those who wanted to kneel for communion by having them
use only one of the three aisles. On a perusal of the evidence one is left with
the suspicion that the contest of standing versus kneeling represents only the
tip of an iceberg in the dispute between the appellants and church authorities.


 

53.              This suspicion would appear to be
confirmed by the manner in which the informations were laid. The incidents in
question took place on June 27, 1982 and six informations were sworn out by one
Ken Francis of Stellarton on June 30, 1982. In his testimony at trial one of
the parishioners, Mr. Gregory MacDonald, testified that he had been asked to
observe the order of mass on the day in question. Mr. DiPersio gave a rather
evasive answer when he was asked whether he had been requested to take note of
the proceedings. While one cannot say so with certainty, it does appear that
the appellants' defiance of the directive was something that had been
anticipated and that some members of the congregation at least had hit upon the
idea of making use of s. 172  of the Criminal Code  before the incident in
question ever took place. If this is in fact the case, it lends some credence
to the appellants' contention that the essence of what is being done here is
the use of the Criminal Code  to sanction the appellants for their
obstinacy in refusing to obey the directive.

 

54.              At a more concrete level I think it is
important to note that the appellants' act of defiance of the priest's
directive was done deliberately with the knowledge that it would, or at least
was likely to, produce an adverse reaction in the priest, his assistant and
other members of the congregation. This seems to be the way in which the
Provincial Court Judge interpreted the concept of wilfulness in his factual
finding that the appellants' acts were wilful within the meaning of s. 172(3)
of the Code. On the other hand, I do not think that there is any finding
that the sole or primary intent of the appellants was to disturb the service.
At most the disturbing of the service was a natural and foreseeable consequence
of their conduct.

 

55.              Finally, I would make particular note of
the existence of concurrent findings of fact in the courts below on the issue
of whether or not the service was disturbed. The Provincial Court Judge
reviewed the evidence in some detail and I think it is implicit in his findings
that he found all the witnesses to be credible. After instructing himself on
the dictionary definition of ""disturb"" and ""disturbance"" he
found that the order and solemnity of the service had been disturbed. He made
particular reference to the existence of tension and anxiety as a result of the
appellants' acts and concluded that the spirituality of the service had been
impaired and that the priest and the people had been distracted. County Court
Judge MacLellan commended the trial judge on these findings. They were accepted
also in the Appellate Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (1983), 4
C.C.C. (3d) 344, 32 C.R. (3d) 285, 57 N.S.R. (2d) 100, 120 A.P.R. 100. 

 

2. The Issues

 

56.              The issues in this case may be
conveniently addressed under two headings namely (1) statutory interpretation
and (2) constitutional aspects.

 

(1) Statutory interpretation

 

57.              The appellants rely on two general
propositions with respect to the interpretation of criminal statutes. They are:

 

(a) the subject is
entitled to rely on the strict words of the statute i.e. even if the
statute was arguably intended to prohibit the conduct engaged in by the
accused, if the conduct is not prohibited by the express words of the statute,
criminal liability will not ensue; and

 

(b) the subject is
entitled to argue that even though the conduct engaged in might be prohibited
by the express words of the statute, it does not fall within the spirit of the
enactment and the statute should be construed accordingly.

 

For these propositions the appellants rely upon the case of R. v.
Thompson (1913), 14, D.L.R. 175 (S.C. Alta.) The Crown does not appear to
contest these propositions and I think they are sufficiently well established
in our criminal law that no further authority need be cited in support of them.
The question is: how do they apply to s. 172(3)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

58.              Section 172 of the Code is one of a
group of seven sections, ss. 169 to 175, placed under the heading
""Disorderly Conduct"". The section in its entirety reads as follows: 

 

                   172. (1) Every one who

 

(a) by threats or
force, unlawfully obstructs or prevents or endeavours to obstruct or prevent a
clergyman or minister from celebrating divine service or performing any other
function in connection with his calling, or

 

(b) knowing that a
clergyman or minister is about to perform, is on his way to perform, or is
returning from the performance of any of the duties or functions mentioned in
paragraph (a)

 

(i) assaults or offers any
violence to him, or

 

(ii) arrests him upon a
civil process, or under the pretence of executing a civil process,

 

is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

 

                   (2)
Every one who wilfully disturbs or interrupts an assemblage of persons met for
religious worship or for a moral, social or benevolent purpose is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   (3)
Every one who, at or near a meeting referred to in subsection (2), wilfully
does anything that disturbs the order or solemnity of the meeting is guilty of
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

For present purposes there are three elements to an offence under s.
172(3)  namely (i) wilfulness; (ii) doing ""anything""; and (iii)
disturbing the order or solemnity of a religious service. I propose to examine
each of these elements in turn.

 

(i) Wilfulness

 

59.              There are in this case concurrent findings
of fact in the courts below that the appellants' acts were wilful. These
findings do not, however, preclude this Court from allowing the appeal if the
courts below misdirected themselves as to the legal test for wilfulness under
the subsection.

 

60.              It might be argued that to constitute a
wilful disturbance the acts done by the appellants would have to have been done
for the specific purpose of causing a disturbance. There is no finding in the
courts below to this effect. Accordingly, if the element of wilfulness is
construed in this fashion the appellants' convictions could not stand. I do not
believe, however, that such a construction can be supported either in light of
s. 172(2) or in light of the authorities. The difference between s. 172(2)  and
s. 172(3)  is immediately apparent: in the former, the disturbance or
interruption of the assembly must be wilful; in the latter, only the act
which disturbs the order or solemnity of the meeting need be wilful. It appears
to me, however, that wilfulness in the latter context must imply both
deliberation and knowledge that the act would, or was likely to, disturb the
service. Thus, as MacLellan Co. Ct. J. pointed out, s. 172(3)  cannot apply
to involuntary acts such as coughing or sneezing. Equally, in my view, the
subsection cannot apply to voluntary acts which are done in ignorance of the
fact that they are likely to disturb the service. Thus a person who was
ignorant of a particular religious custom could not be convicted for violation
of the custom even if this caused a disturbance unless he persisted in
violating the custom after he had been informed of the offensive nature of his
behaviour. In the present case the appellants' act satisfies both the test of
voluntariness and the test of knowledge of its likelihood to disturb the
service. In my view, therefore, the courts below quite properly interpreted the
section in this respect. 

 

61.              The authorities, such as they are, seem to
support this conclusion. In R. v. Gauthier (1905), 11 C.C.C. 263 (Que.
K.B.), the accused was a French Canadian Roman Catholic who interrupted a
Salvation Army meeting by addressing the other French Canadians and Roman
Catholics in the meeting hall and telling them that they ought to leave with
the result that the meeting was broken up. The accused argued that his
intention was not to break up the meeting but merely to withdraw from the
meeting those whom he thought were his co‑religionists and particularly
young people whom he feared might be subjected to violence if they stayed. Hall
J. had some doubts about this version of the facts but, even giving the accused
the benefit of the doubt, he found that he had disturbed the order and
solemnity of the meeting. Although this prosecution took place under s. 173 of
the 1892 Code and this provision was worded somewhat differently from
the present section, the element of wilfulness must, in my view, be construed
in the same way under s. 172(3) of the present Code.

 

(ii) Doing ""anything"" that disturbs

 

62.              Under s. 172(3) the accused must do
something that disturbs the service. His mere presence would not, it seems,
be sufficient even although this was disturbing to the meeting. On the other
hand the appellants here did something which the trial judge found
disturbed the service, namely kneeling to take communion contrary to express
instructions not to do so. The word ""anything"" is certainly
sufficiently broad on its face to cover these acts. Indeed, nothing could be
broader than ""anything"". On the other hand, as I have already
indicated, an accused is entitled to argue that the intendment of the Act is
narrower than the words construed in their ordinary sense might indicate. If the
entire context raises a doubt as to the meaning of the section the courts are
entitled to adopt a narrower construction more consonant with the purpose of
the statute.

 

63.              It seems to me that there are strong
policy reasons for concluding that passive or trivial acts are not encompassed
by the word ""anything"" as used in the section. I believe also that
the legislative history of s. 172(3) affords a basis for a narrower
construction of the word ""anything"".

 

64.              The Crown has conveniently set out the
legislative history of the section on pp. 6 and 7 of its factum and I reproduce
them here. The emphasis is my own. 

 

A.                An
Act Respecting Offences Against The Person S.C. 1869, c. 20, s. 37 (Note: a
similar provision was found in the English Statute Offences Against The
Person Act 1861, s. 36 (11 Halsbury 4th Ed. Para. 1010)):

 

37. Whosoever wilfully disturbs, interrupts, or disquiets any
assemblage of persons met for religious worship, or for any moral, social or
benevolent purpose, by profane discourse, by rude, or indecent behaviour, or
by making a noise, either within the place of such meeting or so near it as
to disturb the order or solemnity of the meeting, may be arrested on view by
any peace officer present at such meeting or by any other person present
thereto verbally authorized by any Justice of the Peace present thereat, and
detained until he can be brought before a Justice of the Peace; and such
offender shall, upon conviction thereof before a Justice of the Peace, on the
oath of one or more credible witnesses, forfeit and pay such sum of money, not
exceeding twenty dollars, as the said Justice may think fit, and costs, within
the period specified for the payment thereof, by the convicting Justice at the
time of the conviction‑‑and in default of payment, such Justice
shall issue his warrant to a constable to levy such fine and costs within a
time to be specified in the warrant, and if no sufficient distress can be
found, such Justice shall commit the offender to the common gaol of the
District, County or place wherein the offence was committed, for any term not
exceeding one month, unless the fine and costs be sooner paid.

 

B.                An
Act Respecting Offences Against Religion, R.S.C. 1886, c. 156, s. 2:

 

2. Every one who wilfully disturbs, interrupts or disquiets any
assemblage of persons met for religious worship, or for any moral, social or
benevolent purpose, by profane discourse, by rude or indecent behavior, or
by making a noise, either within the place of such meeting or so near it as
to disturb the order or solemnity of the meeting, is guilty of a misdemeanor
and liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding twenty dollars
and costs, and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
one month,‑‑and may be arrested on view by any peace officer
present at such meeting, or by any other person present, verbally authorized
thereto by any justice of the peace present thereat, and detained until he can
be brought before a justice of the peace. 32‑33 V., c. 20,
s. 37.

 

C.                Criminal
Code, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 173:

 

173. Every one is guilty of an offence and liable, on summary conviction,
to a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars and costs, and in default of payment
to one month's imprisonment, who wilfully disturbs, interrupts or disquiets
any assemblage of persons met for religious worship, or for any moral, social
or benevolent purpose, by profane discourse, by rude or indecent behaviour,
or by making a noise, either within the place of such meeting or so near it
as to disturb the order or solemnity of the meeting. R.S.C., c. 156, s. 2.

 

D.                R.S.C.
1906, c. 146, s. 201 (Same as 1892, s. 173).

 

E.                R.S.C.
1927, c. 36, s. 20l (Same as 1892, s. 173).

 

F.                S.C.
1953‑54, c. 51, s. 161(2) and (3):

 

                   s. 161(2) Every
one who wilfully disturbs or interrupts an assemblage of persons met for
religious worship or for a moral, social or benevolent purpose is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   s. 161(3) Every
one who, at or near a meeting referred to in subsection (2), wilfully does
anything that disturbs the order or solemnity of the meeting is guilty of
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

G.                R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, s. 172(2) and (3) (Same as 1953‑54). 

 

65.              It is noteworthy that in legislation
dating from 1869 disturbance, interruption or disquiet of a religious assembly
was only punishable if it took place ""by profane discourse, by rude or
indecent behaviour, or by making a noise"". The Crown argues that the 1953‑54
amendment to the section, as part of a major revision to the Criminal Code ,
broadened the section and such restrictions are no longer applicable. This does
not, however, appear to have been Parliament's intention.

 

66.              It seems to me that all Parliament
intended to do in enacting s. 161(3) of the 1953‑54 Code was to
use general rather than specific words to cover the types of things which were
considered capable of disturbing the order or solemnity of a meeting. I do not
believe they were seeking to expand the scope of the provision to cover
peaceful acts of defiance of religious authority. I am reinforced in this view
by the fact that s. 161 of the 1953‑54 Code (like s. 172 of the
present Code) is one of a series of offences falling under the heading
""Disorderly Conduct"". I believe, therefore, that the word
""anything"" must be read down so as to extend only to things in the
nature of profane discourse, rude or indecent behaviour or making a noise.
Where, as in this case, the appellants' acts were peaceful and orderly I would
be reluctant to find that an offence had been committed even if the acts did
disturb the order or solemnity of the service to the minimal extent found by
the trial judge.

 

(iii)               Disturbance of the order or solemnity of a
meeting

 

67.              There has been a fair measure of judicial
debate as to the nature and extent of the disturbance which must be caused by
an accused charged under one of the ""Disorderly Conduct"" provisions
of the Criminal Code . By way of illustration s. 171 of the Code
which deals with causing a disturbance in a public place or a dwelling house
has been interpreted in New Brunswick as requiring some externally manifested
disturbance on the part of observers or passersby (R. v. C.D. (1973), 13
C.C.C. (2d) 206 (N.B.C.A.)), but has been perceived in Nova Scotia as requiring
only that the accused's act cause an emotional disturbance in the mind of
observers (R. v. Swinimer (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 432 (N.S.C.A.)). Given
that s. 171  is aimed at acts creating disturbances in public places or dwelling
houses without reference to any specific context in which the observer is
disturbed, the reasoning of Hughes C.J.N.B. in R. v. C.D., supra,
is probably correct in its assessment that in the absence of any actual
""activities in the nature of a disorder"" on the part of observers the
act cannot be said to be the type of disorderly conduct at which the provision
is aimed. Otherwise, anyone in any given situation would act at the risk of
causing some unmanifested emotional upset or ""disturbance"" to another
person. 

 

68.              When considering s. 172(3), however, this
reasoning does not appear to be appropriate. This subsection expressly provides
a context in which the disturbance takes place (i.e. a religious
service) and makes explicit the fact that the act may be offensive if it
disturbs the ""solemnity"" of the meeting. Thus, it is not confined, as
is s. 171, to the causing of an actual physical disturbance. Rather, the
disruption might well be to the emotional state of the observers or other
participants in the service since emotional upset would certainly serve to
break the solemn mood of a religious service. Accordingly, it would seem that
the reasoning pursued by Chief Justice Hughes in R. v. C.D., supra,
is not persuasive when applied to s. 172(3), as the two statutory contexts are
not analogous. Indeed, one might even say that the fact that s. 171 is
restricted in application to acts which cause, in the words of Hughes C.J.N.B.,
""... a tumult, an uproar, a commotion and any other disorder"", leads
one to the conclusion that s. 172(3) is not so restricted. By specifying that
the proscribed act is one which either disturbs the order or the
solemnity of a religious meeting, Parliament has made it clear that the offence
might either cause the same type of disruption in a religious place as that
described in s. 171 with regard to public places and dwelling houses or it
might cause a silent, emotional disturbance to the solemnity of the moment in a
way specific to religious services.

 

69.              As I have indicated above, MacEwan Prov.
Ct. J. made factual findings that both the order and the solemnity of the
service were disturbed by the appellants' actions. The disturbing of the order
flowed from the slowing down of the lines and the disturbing of the solemnity
from the upsetting and distracting effect of the appellants' conduct on the
priests and other worshippers. I have already referred to the minor delay in
the serving of the other communicants which occurred as a result of the
kneeling. The trial judge found that this disturbed the order of the service.
The disturbing of the solemnity of the service must presumably be assessed in
terms that are subjective, solemnity itself being in significant measure a
subjective concept. It seems to me that the trial judge's finding that the
solemnity and spirituality of the service were disturbed in the eyes of the
priest and parishioners cannot be contested. Since they are the persons whose
notions of solemnity are protected by the section it would seem to follow that
the courts below correctly focused on the question whether their sense of the
solemnity of the occasion had been disturbed. 

 

70.              However, accepting these findings of the
trial judge that the order and solemnity of the service were, as a factual
matter, disturbed, it does not in my opinion follow that the acts in question
are the type of acts prohibited by the section. I believe that this is a proper
case for the application of the principle relied on by the appellants, namely
that while their conduct falls within the strict wording of the subsection when
read in the broadest way possible in that it was conduct which disturbed the
order or solemnity of the service, it does not fall within the narrower meaning
intended by Parliament. I rely for this conclusion partly on the legislative
context and legislative history of the statutory provision as already discussed
but partly also on the factual context of the events.

 

71.              These appellants may have been violating a
new form of liturgical practice and flouting the authority of their Church.
They may be obstinate, insubordinate and disobedient parishioners but I find it
difficult to see them as criminals. I may say that I find it equally difficult
to see their fellow parishioners as informants instigating criminal proceedings
against them but such is the case.

 

72.              I have no doubt that the insistence of the
appellants in kneeling to receive communion, because it was an overt act of
disobedience and defiance of church authority, disturbed the solemnity of the
service and disturbed some of the worshippers as the learned trial judge found.
It is also clear, however, that their conduct was intended as a formal
expression of their convictions and not as a means of disrupting the service.
The physical disruption was negligible. They responded immediately and silently
to the priest's refusal of communion and instruction to return to their seats.
As for the disturbing of the worshipful atmosphere in the church, one might
well wonder, in light of the evidence of some of the witnesses and the fact
that the informations were laid so precipitously thereafter, just how worshipful
it was. But be that as it may, I do not believe that kneeling to receive
communion as a result of firmly‑held convictions is within the spirit of
s. 172(3) of the Code even if it is within its literal wording.

 

73.              I expressed the view earlier that there
were strong policy grounds for limiting the scope of the word
""anything"" in s. 172(3). I think such a limitation is required in
order to avoid a weakening of the authority of the criminal law by its application
to trifles. While it may be true that the only acceptable definition we can
give of a crime is an act which is prohibited by the legislature with penal
consequences, when the legislature employs language as broad as it has here, I
think it is open to the Court to refine it in light of what it perceives to be
the degree of public condemnation any impugned conduct would be likely to
attract. I believe also that an interpretation of ""anything"" which
would make the criminal law available as a tool for the enforcement of
liturgical practice or the settlement of liturgical disputes may represent an
extension of the arm of the law into areas which a substantial segment of the
public (although apparently not the informants) would find unacceptable. For
these policy reasons, therefore, as well as for reasons arising from the
legislative context and history of s. 172(3), I find that the conduct impugned
here is not caught by the subsection.  

 

(2) Constitutional aspects

 

74.              The constitutional aspects of this case
are reflected in the questions stated by the late Chief Justice Laskin:

 

a)                Is
Section 172(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada, as adopted by the Nova
Scotia Court of Appeal, in this decision, intra vires the Criminal
Code  of Canada?

 

b)                Was
the subject matter of the offence of which the Applicants were convicted,
within the scope of the criminal law power or was it in any event an offence
known to law; and did the decision constitute a breach of the Applicants rights
as guaranteed under Section 11 (g) of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  (Constitution Act, 1982 )?

 

c)                Did
the Decision infringe the Applicants religious rights and freedoms, as declared
in the Canadian Bill of Rights; and did this infringement render Section
172(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada inoperable?

 

d) Did the Decision
infringe the Applicants religious rights and freedoms as guaranteed under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (Constitution Act, 1982 ); and did this
infringement render Section 172(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada
inoperable?

 

Notice of these questions was given to the Attorney General of Canada
and to the Attorneys General of the Provinces. The Attorney General of Canada
chose to intervene and was heard in support of the submissions of the
respondent that s. 172(3)  was valid and enforceable criminal legislation and
that the appeal should be dismissed.

 

75.              I do not find it necessary to deal with
the questions raised under the Canadian Bill of Rights or the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  since I have already found that the word
""anything"" must be given a restricted interpretation and that, in
light of that restricted interpretation, the subsection does not apply to this
case. It may be appropriate, however, to say a brief word about question (a)
and the first part of (b) in order to highlight the important distinction that
needs to be made in this case between interpretation and constitutional
validity.  

 

76.              The argument of the appellants is that
certain acts are not criminal in nature and that the mere provision of penal
consequences for the doing of such acts does not render them criminal and thus
bring them within the legislative competence of Parliament under s. 91(27)  of the
Constitution Act, 1867 .

 

77.              For division of powers purposes it has
certainly been recognized that the mere labelling of something as criminal does
not entitle Parliament to assert legislative jurisdiction over it. As with all
questions of characterization for constitutional purposes it is a matter of
ascertaining the ""pith and substance"" of the legislation. However, it
seems to me that the Crown's submission that s. 172  is properly characterized
as criminal law is correct since in substance it is an enactment to prevent
breaches of the public peace and to enable citizens to conduct services of
worship without fear of disturbance.

 

78.              The appellants argue that they have been
convicted of the act of kneeling in church and that such an act is not capable
of being the subject of a criminal offence. I agree, however, with His Honour
Judge MacLellan that the actus reus here is not the act of kneeling but
doing so in a certain context i.e. where it was known that to do so
would disturb the solemnity of a religious service. Just as an act which is
guilty in one context may be quite innocent in another, so also an act which is
innocent in one context may be guilty in another. To use a simple example, it
may be an offence to use foul and abusive language in a courtroom but it may be
inoffensive to do the same thing in a noisy tavern or in the privacy of one's
own home. While it is, in my view, sound to interpret the Criminal Code 
in such a way that the appellants' conduct is not characterized as criminal, it
is a much more radical step to assert that the Criminal Code  could
not characterize the appellants' conduct as criminal where the result of
such conduct is to disturb the carrying on by their fellow parishioners of their
religious services. I would be hesitant, indeed, to accept such a submission.

 

79.              I would allow the appeal and quash the
convictions against the appellants on the ground that s. 172(3)  of the Criminal
Code  does not extend to the conduct alleged against the appellants. I would
order the restoration to the appellants of the $150 awarded as costs to the
Crown by His Honour Judge MacLellan. Otherwise I would make no order as to
costs. If it is necessary to make an order to this effect, I would order that
the criminal record of the appellants be expunged.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Cross‑examination ‑‑
Disagreement in Court of Appeal regarding the effect of accused’s improper
cross‑examination ‑‑ Cross‑examination not prejudicial
to accused ‑‑ No miscarriage of justice.

 

                   Appellants were charged with rape and tried jointly
by a judge sitting without a jury. In his testimony, Murphy contradicted the
evidence given by the complainant. Brown did not testify but a statement he
made to the police supported the evidence of his co‑accused. At trial,
the Crown conducted an overly‑aggressive cross‑examination of
Murphy which exceeded the limits of permissible cross‑examination. The
trial judge found both appellants guilty. His conclusion was based on findings
of credibility not on the impugned cross‑examination. On appeal, the
majority of the Court of Appeal did not find the cross‑examination
prejudicial to the appellants and dismissed their appeals acting on the power
contained in s. 613(1) (b)(ii) of the Criminal Code . The
dissenting judge took the view that it was prejudicial and that, in any event,
it was of such nature as to bring the system of justice into disrepute. Hence
this appeal.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed. 

 

                   Assuming that a disagreement as to the existence of
prejudice could amount to a question of law which would give jurisdiction to
this Court to entertain the appeal, the Court of Appeal made no error in
finding that the improper cross‑examination was not prejudicial to the
accused. As to the suggestion that in the absence of prejudice the appeal
should be allowed lest the system of justice be brought into disrepute, it is
evident that in dismissing the appeal the majority rejected any such suggestion
and they made no error in that respect.

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                McIntyre
J.‑‑The appellants were jointly charged and jointly tried
for rape. They were convicted by Foisy J., of the Court of Queen's Bench of
Alberta, sitting without a jury. Their appeals to the Court of Appeal (McClung,
Stevenson and Harradence JJ.A.) were dismissed, Harradence J.A. dissenting.
This appeal is taken pursuant to leave granted March 24, 1983. A motion by the
Crown to quash the appeal for the reason that no question of law was raised was
abandoned at the commencement of the hearing in this Court.

 

2.                At trial, the evidence of the
complainant was flatly contradicted by Murphy. Brown did not give evidence, but
a statement he made to the police supported the evidence of Murphy. The
complainant swore that shortly after midnight on July 30, 1979, when returning
to her apartment after making a telephone call at a nearby public telephone,
the appellant, Brown, followed her and forced his way into her apartment. He
was followed by Murphy who on entry locked the door behind him. Murphy seized
her, took her down the hall to a bedroom and had intercourse with her without
her consent. Later Brown entered the room and the performance was repeated. She
gave many details of the events that occurred which need not be repeated here.
Murphy, on the other hand, swore that the complain­ant invited him and Brown
into the apartment to wait until a friend arrived with some marijuana. He
admitted intercourse but said that it was with the complainant's consent and
cooperation. Brown denied intercourse. The principal issue then was one of
credibility.

 

3.                During the trial counsel for the Crown
conducted what might be termed an overly‑aggressive and improper cross‑examination
of Murphy. There can be no doubt that the cross‑examination in many ways
was objectionable and exceeded the limits which should bind Crown counsel in
cross‑examination. The trial judge did not restrict Crown counsel
sufficiently. In the Court of Appeal other grounds were advanced by the
appellants, but the sole ground upon which the court called for argument by the
Crown was the cross‑examination point. It was also the principal point
raised in this Court. 

 

4.                The trial judge on conflicting evidence
found that the appellants were guilty. In doing so he based his conclusion on
findings of credibility. He believed the complainant and he disbelieved the
appellants. In his reasons for judgment he reviewed her evidence. He recognized
certain inconsistencies in her testimony, and he noted as well corroborative
facts which supported it. He found significant corroboration of her evidence in
the medical testimony which included observations by the examining physician of
abrasions upon her back that were consistent with her account of events. He
weighed and balanced her evidence against that of the appellants and made his
finding of credibility upon that comparison. There was evidence before him upon
which he could reach his conclusion, and it is evident from his reasons that he
did not base his conclusion on the impugned cross‑examination but upon
the conflicting evidence which was before him and after considering the various
factors which ought to affect the approach of a trial judge to a case where the
conviction will depend essentially upon the evidence of one person.

 

5.                The majority of the Court of Appeal
expressed disapproval of the cross‑examination, but they did not find it
prejudiced the appellants. In dismissing the appeal, they were, of course,
acting on the powers contained in s. 613(1) (b)(ii). This means that they
decided that the appeal could not be allowed on any grounds set out in s.
613(1) (a). In other words, they concluded that the appeal could not
succeed on the ground that the conviction was unreasonable or could not be
supported on the evidence; that the trial judgment should not be set aside on
the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law; and that there was no
miscarriage of justice. Harradence J.A., in dissent, agreed that the cross‑examination
was improper. He considered, however, that prejudice had been caused to the
appellants and that, even if it had not resulted in prejudice, it was of such
nature that it would bring the system of justice into disrepute. He concluded
that the prejudice resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

 

6.                It will be seen that the only difference
between the majority and the minority in the Court of Appeal turns on the
effect of the cross‑examination. The majority takes the view that it was
not prejudicial to the appellant and is not a ground upon which the appeal
should be allowed. The dissenting judge takes the view that it was prejudicial
and should have been effective to allow the appeal and that, in any event, it
was of such nature as to bring the system of justice into disrepute. Assuming,
without deciding, that a disagreement as to the existence of prejudice could
amount to a question of law which would give jurisdiction to this Court to
entertain the appeal, it is my opinion that the majority of the Court of Appeal
made no error. As to the suggestion that in the absence of prejudice the appeal
should be allowed lest the system of justice be brought into disrepute, it is
evident that in dismissing the appeal the majority rejected any such suggestion
and, in my view, they made no error in that respect.

 

7.                I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

                   Appellant, a non‑treaty Indian member of the
Alkali Lake Band, was charged with the killing of a deer out of season without
being the holder of a permit, contrary to s. 3(1) of the British Columbia Wildlife
Act. Appellant killed the deer for food on the traditional hunting grounds
of the Alkali Lake Band outside the reserve. Appellant was convicted and his
appeals to the County Court and the Court of Appeal were dismissed. This appeal
raises several issues: (1) whether the Wildlife Act impairs the status
and capacity of Indians, an invasion of the federal field under s. 91(24)  of
the Constitution Act, 1867 ; (2) if so, whether the Wildlife Act
is a law of general application referentially incorporated into federal law by
s. 88  of the Indian Act ; and (3) whether this appeal raises a question
of law alone for the purpose of s. 114 of the Offence Act of British
Columbia. 

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The Wildlife Act of British Columbia is a law
of general application and it applies to the appellant either by its own force
or, assuming that the Wildlife Act has the effect of regulating him qua
Indian, by referential incorporation under s. 88  of the Indian Act .

 

                   (a) Laws of general application: To
determine whether a provincial enactment is not a law of general application,
it must be shown that the intent, purpose or policy of the legislation was to
impair the status or capacities of a particular group. While it is assumed in
this case that the Wildlife Act impairs the status or capacity of
Indians, it has not been demonstrated that the provincial legislator intended
this particular impact nor has it been established that the legislative policy
of the Wildlife Act singles out Indians for special treatment or that it
discriminates against them in any way.

 

                   (b) Referential incorporation: Section
88  of the Indian Act  does not incorporate, as part of federal
legislation in respect to Indians, all provincial laws of general application.
On one hand, s. 88  refers to the provincial laws which cannot apply to Indians
without regulating them qua Indians, i.e., provincial legislation
which, per se, would not apply to Indians under the Indian Act 
unless given force by federal reference. On the other hand, provincial laws of
general application which can apply to Indians without touching their
Indianness apply to them ex proprio vigore.

 

                   Finally, this Court entertains grave doubts as to
whether the first two issues on which an appeal was taken to the Court of
Appeal were founded ""on any ground that involves a question of law
alone"". Indeed, it does not appear possible to resolve these issues
without weighing the evidence adduced by the parties. However, since the appeal
should be dismissed, there is no need to decide that question.

I The facts

 

2.                The facts are not in dispute. They are
summarized by Lambert J.A., dissenting in the British Columbia Court of Appeal
whose reasons for judgment are reported: R v. Dick (1982), 3 C.C.C. (3d)
481. At pages 484‑85, Lambert J.A. related the facts:

 

                   Arthur
Dick is a member of the Alkali Lake Band of the Shuswap people. He lives on the
Alkali Lake Reserve in the Chilcotin District of the County of Cariboo. He is a
non‑treaty Indian.

 

                   The
Alkali Lake Band is comprised of about 10 families, or approximately 350
people, all told. They subsist in large measure by foraging. They catch fish
for food and they kill deer and moose for food and other uses.

 

                   The
Shuswap word for May is ""Pellcwewlemten"". It means ""time to go
fishing"". In response to this imperative Arthur Dick and two other band
members, with two members of the Canoe Creek Band, set off on May 4, 1980, for
Gustafsen Creek, where they intended to catch fish. On the way they passed
Holdon Lake. There Arthur Dick killed a deer with a rifle. His purpose was to
provide food for the members of the foraging party and for other band members.
The carcass, cut up in pieces, was taken on to Gustafsen Creek where a
provincial conservation officer and four R.C.M.P. constables found the five
Indians in possession of dip nets, a number of rainbow trout, and the deer
meat.

 

3.                One precision should perhaps be added.
The killing of the deer occurred in the traditional hunting grounds of the
Alkali Lake Band but outside a reserve. I now return to the recital of the
facts by Lambert J.A.:

 

                   The
Wildlife Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, said it was a
closed season for hunting for deer. So Arthur Dick was charged under the Act
with two counts; first, with killing wildlife, to wit; one deer, at a time not
within the open season, contrary to s. 3(1); and, secondly, with possession of
wildlife that was dead, to wit: parts of one deer, during a closed season,
contrary to s. 8. It was also a closed season for fishing in Gustafsen Creek.
All five Indians were charged with respect to the fishing, and those charges
are the subject‑matter of a separate appeal by the Crown, raising quite
different issues from those raised in this appeal.

 

                   The
trial took place before His Honour Judge Gilmour, a judge of the provincial
court. The evidence was extensive. The accused was convicted on the first count
and sentenced to a fine of $50. No conviction was entered on the second count.
The accused appealed. His appeal was heard by His Honour Judge Andrews, sitting
as a judge of the County Court of the County of Cariboo. The appeal was
dismissed. Both Judge Gilmour and Judge Andrews reserved judgment and each of
them prepared full and carefully considered written reasons.

 

                   An
application has now been made to this court, under s. 114 of the Offence Act,
R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 305, for leave to appeal on a ground or grounds involving a
question or questions of law alone.

 

4.                Leave to appeal was granted by the Court
of Appeal but the appeal was dismissed, Lambert J.A. dissenting.

 

5.                Appellant further appealed to this Court
by leave of this Court.

 

II The issues

 

6.                Appellant and respondent appear to agree
in substance as to the issues raised by this appeal, save one. But they express
them differently and I find it preferable to rephrase them as follows: 

 

1. Is the practice of
year‑round foraging for food so central to the Indian way of life of the
Alkali Lake Shuswap that it cannot be restricted by ss. 3(1) and 8(1) of the Wildlife
Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, without impairment of their status and capacity
as Indians, and invasion of the federal field under s. 91 (24)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 ?

 

2 If the answer to the
first question is in the affirmative and, consequently, the Wildlife Act
cannot apply ex proprio vigore to the appellant, then is this Act a law
of general application referentially incorporated into federal law by s. 88 of
the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑6, which provides:

 

88. Subject to the terms of any treaty and any other Act of the Parliament
of Canada, all laws of general application from time to time in force in any
province are applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province, except to
the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act or any order, rule,
regulation or by‑law made thereunder, and except to the extent that such
laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made by or under this
Act.

 

3. Does this appeal
raise a question of law alone for the purpose of s. 114 of the Offence Act,
R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 305?

 

7.                The third issue was raised only by
respondent.

 

8.                In addition, a constitutional question
was stated by the Chief Justice:

 

Are ss. 3(1)(c) and
8(1) of the Wildlife Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, constitutionally
inapplicable in the circumstances of this case on the ground that the
restriction imposed by such sections affects the appellant qua Indian
and therefore may only be enacted by the Parliament of Canada pursuant to s.
91(24)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 ?

 

9.                The Attorney General of Canada and the
Attorney General of Nova Scotia intervened in support of respondent.

 

10.              Another issue had been raised by appellant
in the Court of Appeal, namely whether the County Court Judge had erred in holding
that the manner of administration of the Wildlife Act by provincial
officials‑‑somewhat misleadingly referred to as the policy of the
Act‑‑had not significantly changed since the judgment of this Court
in Kruger v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 104. But the Court of Appeal,
following R. v. Haines (1981), 34 B.C.L.R. 148, unanimously held that
this issue was not a ""ground that involves a question of law alone"".
While appellant referred in his factum to the policy of the provincial
government not to issue sustenance permits for out of season hunting by Indians
who regularly depend on hunting for their food, I did not understand him to
press this matter in this Court as a distinct issue. 

 

11.              One issue that does not arise is that of Aboriginal
Title or Rights. In its factum, the appellant expressly states that he has
""not sought to prove or rely on the Aboriginal Title or Rights in the case
at bar"". As in the Kruger case, the issue will accordingly not be
dealt with any more than the related or included question whether the Indians'
right to hunt is a personal right or, as has been suggested by some learned
authors, is a right in the nature of a profit à prendre or some other
interest in land covered by the expression ""Lands reserved for the
Indians"", rather than the word ""Indians"" in s. 91(24)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 . (See Kenneth Lysyk, ""The Unique Constitutional Position of
the Canadian Indian"" (1967), 45 Can. Bar Rev. 513, at pp. 518‑19;
Anthony Jordan, ""Government, Two‑‑Indians, One"" (1978),
16 Osgoode Hall L.J. 709, at p. 719.) No submission was made on this
last point and in this Court, as well apparently as in the courts below, the
case has been argued as if the Indians' right to hunt were a personal one.

 

III The first issue

 

12.              Appellant's main submission which was
apparently presented in the Court of Appeal as an alternative argument, is that
the Wildlife Act strikes at the core of Indianness, that the question
stated in the first issue should accordingly be answered in the affirmative and
that the Wildlife Act, while valid legislation, should be read down so
as not to apply to appellant in the circumstances of the case at bar.

 

13.              As was noted by Andrews Co. Ct. J., whose
reasons for judgment are reported sub nom. R. v. Tenale (1982), 66
C.C.C. (2d) 180, at pp. 182‑83:

 

                   A
considerable volume of evidence was called at trial as to Indian culture,
habits, history, the significance of hunting and fishing as part of that
culture, and specifically as to provincial conservation objectives and methods,
sustenance permits, food requirements, traditional claims and so on. This
testimony was supported by various maps as to alleged historic hunting areas,
policy statements and lengthy opinion evidence of a Dr. M. Asch, an
anthropologist who is the author of numerous papers dealing with, inter alia,
aboriginal rights. 

 

14.              Provincial Court Judge Gilmour stated, in
his reasons for judgment:

 

                   I have
reviewed the evidence in the case at bar and I am not convinced that the policy
of either the Fishing or Game legislation as presently expounded by the
Provincial and Federal Governments and under review in this case, is such that
it was intended to, or does in fact, ""impair the status or capacities of
Indians"".

 

15.              At page 191 of his reasons, Andrews Co.
Ct. J. wrote:

 

                   I have
reviewed this material and the substantial testimony of trial witnesses. It is
apparent therefrom that hunting and fishing forms a significant part of the
Indian culture. I do not conclude however, that the trial Judge was in error. I
do not find in all of that evidence anything from which I might have reasonably
concluded that the policy of the Wildlife Act was such as to impair, at
least in any substantial way, the status and capacity of the appellants. I do
not find in all that evidence anything from which I can reasonably conclude
that status and capacity of the appellant was impaired to any greater degree
than those Indians involved in the Kruger and Manuel and Haines
cases, supra.

 

                   As to
the argument that the Wildlife Act affects this appellant qua
Indian and thus cannot apply to him because the federal authorities have
exclusive jurisdiction over Indians, I do not agree.

 

16.              In the Court of Appeal, Seaton J.A.
concluded as follows at p. 484:

 

                   The
decisions under attack were primarily decisions of fact. To the extent that
there were questions of law alone, I am not persuaded that error has been
shown. I would grant leave, but dismiss the appeal.

 

17.              Macdonald J.A. refrained from expressing
any views on the merits of the three issues raised in the Court of Appeal. At
page 496 he concluded:

 

My opinion is that none of
the three issues involves a question of law alone. I would therefore dismiss
the appeal.

 

18.              The reasons of Lambert J.A., dissenting,
are quite elaborate. For the greater part, they expound the similarities and
differences between the case at bar and Kruger and his understanding of
the tests adopted in the latter case to determine whether a law is one of
general application, a matter to which I will return in dealing with the second
issue. But he used the same tests to answer the question stated in the first
issue, namely whether the application of the Wildlife Act to appellant
would regulate him qua Indian. Here is what he wrote at p. 492:

 

... it seems to me that
the same tests as are applied to determine whether the application of a
provincial law to a particular group of Indians in a particular activity is the
application of a law of general application, should also be applied to
determine whether the application of a provincial law to a particular group of
Indians in a particular activity is legislation in relation to Indians in their
Indianness.

 

                   So,
subject to the question of referential incorporation, which I will come to
next, it is my opinion that the evidence and argument which I have set out in
Part III of these reasons require the conclusion that the Wildlife Act
should be ""read down"" in order to preserve its constitutionality.
That ""reading down"" would prevent it from applying to Arthur Dick in
his activity in this case. 

 

19.              It is well worth quoting substantial parts
of the evidence and argument set out in Part III of the reasons of Lambert
J.A., which, as I just said, were also relied upon by him to resolve the first
issue. He wrote, at pages 487, and 489‑91:

 

                   In Kruger
and Manuel v. The Queen, supra, the two accused were members of the
Penticton Indian Band. They shot four deer for food on unoccupied Crown land on
the traditional hunting grounds of the Penticton Indian Band. It was the closed
season under the Wildlife Act and Kruger and Manuel did not have a
sustenance permit which would have allowed them to shoot a deer during the
closed season. They were convicted. Their appeal to Judge Washington took the
form of a trial de novo. It was allowed. The Crown appealed to this
court. That appeal was aso allowed and the convictions were restored: 24 C.C.C.
(2d) 120, 60 D.L.R. (3d) 144, [1975] 5 W.W.R. 167. Kruger and Manuel appealed
to the Supreme Court of Canada. Their appeal was dismissed. Mr. Justice
Dickson's reasons were the reasons of the full court of nine.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
evidence in this appeal goes much further than the agreed facts in Kruger
and Manuel v. The Queen. Here there is evidence which indicates that the
line demarking laws of general application from other enactments has been
crossed. In Kruger and Manuel v. The Queen the only relevant evidence
was the statement in the agreed facts that the accused had hunted deer during
the closed season on land that was the traditional hunting grounds of the
Penticton Indian Band. There was no evidence that the statutory restrictions on
the right to hunt impaired the status and capacities of Kruger and Manuel as
Indians. There was no evidence that the Penticton Indian Band depended on
hunting for their supply of meat. There was no evidence that it would be
impracticable to hunt sufficient meat during the open season. There was no
evidence as to the amount of meat obtained through hunting, the amount of meat
needed to feed an Indian family for a year, or the amount of meat allowed to
Indians under the prevailing hunting quotas. Finally, there was no evidence to
indicate that hunting was central to the way of life of the Penticton Indian
Band. There was, in the words of Mr. Justice Dickson, an ""absence of clear
evidence"" that the provisions in the Wildlife Act crossed the line
demarking laws of general application from other enactments. 

 

                   The
situation is entirely different in the present appeal where, in my opinion, the
evidence indicates that the line has been crossed.

 

                   Nine
members of the Alkali Lake Band and three members of the Canoe Creek Band gave
evidence. They described their lives and the significance of the rituals of
food gathering. They told of their dependence on moose and deer for food and
for traditional and valued items of daily clothing and ceremonial clothing.
Their evidence was placed in its cultural framework by Dr. Michael Asch, an
anthropologist.

 

                   In
1980, the year in which Arthur Dick shot the deer at Holdon Lake, there were 45
active hunters in the Alkali Lake Band. They took 117 deer and 48 moose in the
year. That provided a yield of 65 to 70 pounds of meat for every man, woman and
child in the Band. The meat was shared out among band members in accordance
with the institutional practices of the Shuswap people.

 

                   The
times of year for hunting animals and for fishing, the places to hunt, and the
techniques of hunting are taught to young male members of the band by their
fathers and grandfathers.

 

                   Some of
the meat is smoked, some is salted, some is frozen, and some is eaten fresh.
The preservation of the meat and the preparation of food is largely done by the
women of the band. Women also tan and treat the hides and make the traditional
clothing. The skills and techniques for preserving food and making clothing are
handed down from one generation to the next.

 

                   When
the meat supply runs out the hunters go out for more. They go when it is
needed. That happens every spring when the supply of preserved meat, from
animals killed in the fall, comes to an end.

 

                   The
hunters in the Alkali Lake Band do not hunt for trophies; they do not hunt for
recreation, nor do they look on hunting as recreation; they do not leave the
carcasses of the animals they kill in the woods. If they work for wages it is
not as an alternative to hunting but in order to acquire the means to hunt for
food.

 

                   Ricky
Dick, a member of the Alkali Lake Band, and one of the foraging party on May 4,
1980, gave evidence that his own family needs four or five deer each year for
food. But the evidence of the conservation officer at 100 Mile House is that
the limit for one hunter in one year from Region 5 is one deer. Of course, if
you travel from one region to another, as recreational hunters do, then you can
shoot deer in other regions to a total kill of three deer in one year. But, for
the hunters of the Alkali Lake Band, the Wildlife Act and regulations,
if they were to apply, would provide a limit of one deer for each hunter in
each year within their hunting grounds. 

 

                   Dr.
Asch drew the relationship between the testimony of the Indian witnesses and
the institutions and practices of the traditional way of life of the Alkali
Lake Band of the Shuswap people.

 

                   In my
opinion, it is impossible to read the evidence without realizing that killing
fish and animals for food and other uses gives shape and meaning to the lives
of the members of the Alkali Lake Band. It is at the centre of what they do and
what they are.

 

                   In my
opinion, this case is distinguishable from Kruger and Manuel v. The Queen,
(1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 377, 75 D.L.R. (3d) 434, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 104, because
here the appellant has led evidence which, in my opinion, establishes that the Wildlife
Act in its application to hunting for food impairs the status and
capacities of the Alkali Lake Band members and crosses the line demarking laws
of general application from other enactments.

 

20.              And, before concluding at p. 495, Lambert
J.A. wrote:

 

Indeed, I would add that
if the facts in this case do not place the killing of the deer within the
central core of Indianness, if there is one, or within the boundary that
outlines the status and capacities of the Alkali Lake Band, then it is
difficult to imagine other facts that would do so.

 

21.              In Cardinal v. Attorney General of
Alberta, [1974] S.C.R. 695 at p. 706, it had already been held, apart from
any evidence, that provincial game laws do not relate to Indians qua
Indians. In the case at bar, there was considerable evidence capable of
supporting the conclusions of Lambert J.A. to the effect that the Wildlife
Act did impair the Indianness of the Alkali Lake Band, as well as the
opposite conclusions of the courts below.

 

22.              I am prepared to assume, without deciding,
that Lambert J.A. was right on this point and that appellant's submission on
the first issue is well taken.

 

23.              I must confess at being strenghtened in
this assumption by what Lambert J.A. said at p. 493:

 

                   The question
of whether provincial legislation affects Indians as Indians, or Indians in
their Indianness, to put it another way, is at the root of both arguments that
I have considered in this appeal. I think it is worth adding that I have
derived some sense of the nature of Indianness from the fact that the Indians
in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have the right to hunt and fish for food
at all seasons of the year (see the Natural Resources Agreements and the Constitution
Act, 1930, R.S.C. 1970, Appendix No. 25), and the treaty Indians in British
Columbia also have that right: see R. v. White and Bob (1965), 52 D.L.R.
(2d) 481 n., [1965] S.C.R. vi. I think that those rights are
characteristic of Indianness, at least for those Indians, and if for those
Indians, why not for the Alkali Lake Band of the Shuswap people?

 

24.              On the basis of this assumption and
subject to the question of referential incorporation which will be dealt with
in the next chapter, it follows that the Wildlife Act could not apply to
the appellant ex proprio vigore, and, in order to preserve its
constitutionality, it would be necessary to read it down to prevent its
applying to appellant in the circumstances of this case.

 

IV The second issue

 

25.              In holding that the tests adopted by this
Court in Kruger to determine whether a law is one of general application
are the same tests which should be applied to determine whether the application
of the Wildlife Act to appellant would regulate him in his Indianness,
Lambert J.A. fell into error, in my respectful opinion. And this error resulted
from a misapprehension of what was decided in Kruger as to the nature of
a law of general application. 

 

26.              The tests which Lambert J.A. applied in
reviewing the evidence in his above quoted reasons are perfectly suitable to
determine whether the application of the Wildlife Act to the appellant
would have the effect of regulating him qua Indian, with the
consequential necessity of a reading down if it did; but, apart from
legislative intent and colourability, they have nothing to do with the question
whether the Wildlife Act is a law of general application. On the
contrary, it is precisely because the Wildlife Act is a law of general
application that it would have to be read down were it not for s. 88  of the Indian
Act . If the special impact of the Wildlife Act on Indians had been
the very result contemplated by the Legislature and pursued by it as a matter
of policy, the Act could not be read down because it would be in relation to
Indians and clearly ultra vires.

 

27.              The Wildlife Act does not differ in
this respect from a great many provincial labour laws which are couched in
general terms and which, taken literally, would apply to federal works and
undertakings. So to apply them however would make them regulate such works and
undertaking under some essentially federal aspects. They are accordingly read
down so as not to apply to federal works and undertakings: Reference re
Minimum Wage Act of Saskatchewan, [1948] S.C.R. 248; Commission du
Salaire minimum v. Bell Telephone Co. of Canada, [1966] S.C.R. 767; Letter
Carriers' Union of Canada v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, [1975] 1
S.C.R. 178. But it has never been suggested, so far as I know, that, by the
same token, those provincial labour laws cease to be laws of general application.

 

28.              In his reasons for judgment, Lambert J.A.
relied on two passages of Kruger which he quoted and commented. The
first passage is to be found at p. 110 of the Supreme Court Reports:

 

If the law does extend
uniformly throughout the jurisdiction the intention and effects of the
enactment need to be considered. The law must not be ""in relation to""
one class of citizens in object and purpose. But the fact that a law may have
graver consequence to one person than to another does not, on that account
alone, make the law other than one of general application. There are few laws
which have a uniform impact. The line is crossed, however, when an enactment,
though in relation to another matter, by its effect, impairs the status or
capacity of a particular group.

 

29.              The second passage of Kruger quoted
by Lambert J.A. is at p. 112 of the Supreme Court Reports: 

 

                   Game
conservation laws have as their policy the maintenance of wildlife resources.
It might be argued that without some conservation measures the ability of
Indians or others to hunt for food would become a moot issue in consequence of
the destruction of the resource. The presumption is for the validity of a
legislative enactment and in this case the presumption has to mean that in the
absence of evidence to the contrary the measures taken by the British Columbia
Legislature were taken to maintain an effective resource in the Province for
its citizens and not to oppose the interests of conservationists and Indians in
such a way as to favour the claims of the former. If, of course, it can be
shown in future litigation that the Province has acted in such a way as to
oppose conservation and Indian claims to the detriment of the latter‑‑to
""preserve moose before Indians"" in the words of Gordon J.A. in R.
v. Strongquill (1953), 8 W.W.R. (N.S.) 247‑‑it might very well
be concluded that the effect of the legislation is to cross the line demarking
laws of general application from other enactments. It would have to be shown
that the policy of such an Act was to impair the status and capacities of
Indians. Were that so, s. 88  would not operate to make the Act applicable to
Indians. But that has not been done here and in the absence of clear evidence
the Court cannot so presume.

 

30.              Lambert J.A. then emphasized the
importance of the effect of the legislation as opposed to its purpose. At page
489 of his reasons he wrote:

 

... evidence about the
motives of individual members of the Legislature or even about the more
abstract ""intention of the legislature"" or ""legislative purpose
of the enactment"" is not relevant. What is relevant is evidence about the
effect of the legislation. In fact, evidence about its ""application"".

 

31.              With all due deference, it seems to me
that the correct view is the reverse one and that what Dickson J., as he then
was, referred to in Kruger when he mentioned laws which had crossed the
line of general application were laws which, either overtly or colourably,
single out Indians for special treatment and impair their status as Indians.
Effect and intent are both relevant. Effect can evidence intent. But in order
to determine whether a law is not one of general application, the intent,
purpose or policy of the legislation can certainly not be ignored: they form an
essential ingredient of a law which discriminates between various classes of
persons, as opposed to a law of general application. This in my view is what
Dickson J. meant when in the above quoted passage, he wrote: 

 

It would have to be shown
that the policy of such an Act was to impair the status and capacities of
Indians.

 

32.              I am reinforced in this view by the fact
that at p. 113, Dickson J. quoted with approval the following passage of Davey
J.A. in R. v. White and Bob (1965), 52 W.W.R. 193, at p. 198:

 

                   Secs. 8
and 15 of the Game Act specifically exempt Indians from the operation of
certain provisions of the Act, and from that I think it clear that the other
provisions are intended to be of general application and to include Indians. If
these general sections are sufficiently clear to show an intention to abrogate
or qualify the contractual rights of hunting notoriously reserved to Indians by
agreements such as Ex. 8, they would, in my opinion, fail in that purpose
because that would be legislation in relation to Indians that falls within
parliament's exclusive legislative authority under sec. 91(24) of the B.N.A.
Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict., ch. 3 , and also because that would conflict
with sec. 87  of the Indian Act  passed under that authority.

 

33.              I am further confirmed in this view by one
of the examples chosen by Dickson J. to illustrate, with an analogy, when a law
is not one of general application. At page 110, he mentioned the case of Great
West Saddlery Co. v. The King, [1921] 2 A.C. 91, where Ontario, Manitoba
and Saskatchewan statutory provisions were held ultra vires so far as
they paralysed the status and capacities of federal companies. Those provisions
generally discriminated between provincially incorporated companies and extra‑provincial
companies including federal ones. They were clearly not laws of general application
and on that ground they were prima facie suspicious from a
constitutional point of view. I find it significant that Dickson J. abstained
from referring to another ""company case"", that of Attorney‑General
for Manitoba v. Attorney‑General for Canada, [1929] A.C. 260, where
two Manitoba statutes prohibiting companies from selling their own shares
within the province without the consent of a provincial commissioner or board
were held not to apply to federal companies. Unlike the provisions considered in
the Great West Saddlery Co. case, these two Manitoba statutes were
clearly laws of general application and they were in fact ""read down""
although this is not what was explicitly said since the expression does not
seem to have then been in use and the case was a reference stating a specific
constitutional question.

 

34.              Reference should also be made to a later
""company case"", Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2
S.C.R. 161, where it was held, inter alia that ss. 113 and 114 of The
Securities Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1970, c. 426, applied to federally
incorporated companies. Dickson J. as he then was, delivered the reasons of the
majority. (But there was no division on this point.) At page 183 Dickson J.
wrote:

 

It is well established
that the provinces have the power, as a matter of property and civil rights, to
regulate the trade in corporate securities in the province, provided the
statute does not single out federal companies for special treatment or
discriminate against them in any way. There must be no impairment of status or
of the essential power to raise capital for corporate purpose. But federal
incorporation does not render a company immune from securities regulation of
general application in a province. 

 

35.              It has already been held in Kruger
that on its face, and in form, the Wildlife Act is a law of general
application. In the previous chapter, I have assumed that its application to
appellant would have the effect of regulating the latter qua Indian.
However, it has not been demonstrated, in my view, that this particular impact
has been intended by the provincial legislator. While it is assumed that the Wildlife
Act impairs the status or capacity of appellant, it has not been
established that the legislative policy of the Wildlife Act singles out
Indians for special treatment or discriminates against them in any way.

 

36.              I accordingly conclude that the Wildlife
Act is a law of general application within the meaning of s. 88  of the Indian
Act .

 

37.              It remains to decide whether the Wildlife
Act has been referentially incorporated to federal laws by s. 88  of the Indian
Act .

 

38.              In Kruger, Dickson J. wrote at p.
115:

 

                   There
is in the legal literature a juridical controversy respecting whether s. 88 
referentially incorporates provincial laws of general application or whether
such laws apply to Indians ex proprio vigore. The issue was considered
by this Court in Natural Parents v. Superintendent of Child Welfare
(1975), 60 D.L.R. (3d) 148, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 751.

 

This controversy has so far remained unresolved in this Court.

 

39.              I believe that a distinction should be
drawn between two categories of provincial laws. There are, on the one hand,
provincial laws which can be applied to Indians without touching their
Indianness, like traffic legislation; there are on the other hand, provincial
laws which cannot apply to Indians without regulating them qua Indians.

 

40.              Laws of the first category, in my opinion,
continue to apply to Indians ex proprio vigore as they always did before
the enactment of s. 88  in 1951‑‑then numbered s. 87  (1951 (Can.),
c. 29)‑‑and quite apart from s. 88 . (Vide R. v. Hill (1908),
15 O.L.R. 406, where an Indian was convicted of unlawful practice of medecine
contrary to a provincial medical act, and R. v. Martin (1917), 41 O.L.R.
79, where an Indian was convicted of unlawful possession of intoxicating
liquor, contrary to a provincial temperance act.)

 

41.              I have come to the view that it is to the
laws of the second category that s. 88  refers. I agree with what Laskin C.J.
wrote in Natural Parents v. Superintendent of Child Welfare, [1976] 2
S.C.R. 751, at p. 763:

 

When s. 88 refers to
""all laws of general application from time to time in force in any
province"" it cannot be assumed to have legislated a nullity but, rather,
to have in mind provincial legislation which, per se, would not apply to
Indians under the Indian Act  unless given force by federal reference. 

 

                   I am
fully aware of the contention that it is enough to give force to the several
opening provisions of s. 88, which, respectively, make the
""provincial"" reference subject to the terms of any treaty and any
other federal Act and subject also to inconsistency with the Indian Act
and orders, rules, regulations or by‑laws thereunder. That contention
would have it that s. 88  is otherwise declaratory. On this view, however, it is
wholly declaratory save perhaps in its reference to ""the terms of any
treaty"", a strange reason, in my view, to explain all the other provisions
of s. 88 . I think too that the concluding words of s. 88 , ""except to the
extent that such laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made
by or under this Act"" indicate clearly that Parliament is indeed effecting
incorporation by reference.

 

42.              I also adopt the suggestion expressed by
Professor Lysyk, as he then was, op. cit., at p. 552:

 

                   Provincial
laws of general application will extend to Indians whether on or off reserves.
It has been suggested that the constitution permits this result without the
assistance of section 87  of the Indian Act , and that the only significant
result of that section is, by expressly embracing all laws of general
application (subject to the exceptions stated in the section), to contemplate
extension of particular laws which otherwise might have been held to be so
intimately bound up with the essential capacities and rights inherent in Indian
status as to have otherwise required a conclusion that the provincial
legislation amounted to an inadmissible encroachment upon section 91(24) of the
British North America Act.

 

43.              The word ""all"" in s. 88 is
telling but, as was noticed by the late Chief Justice, the concluding words of
s. 88 are practically decisive: it would not be open to Parliament in my view
to make the Indian Act  paramount over provincial laws simply because the
Indian Act  occupied the field. Operational conflict would be required to
this end. But Parliament could validly provide for any type of paramountcy of
the Indian Act  over other provisions which it alone could enact,
referentially or otherwise. (It is true that the paramountcy doctrine may not
have been as precise in 1951 as it has become, at a later date, but it is
desirable to adopt a construction of s. 88  which accords with established
constitutional principles.)

 

44.              In a supplementary factum, appellant
argues that a prospective incorporation into the Indian Act  of future
provincial laws which would regulate the appellant qua Indian, involves
interdelegation of powers of a type held unconstitutional in Attorney
General of Nova Scotia v. Attorney General of Canada, [1951] S.C.R. 31. In
my opinion Attorney General for Ontario v. Scott, [1956] S.C.R. 137, and
Coughlin v. Ontario Highway Transport Board, [1968] S.C.R. 569, provide
a complete answer to this objection.

 

45.              I accordingly conclude that, in view of s.
88  of the Indian Act , the Wildlife Act applies to appellant even
if, as I have assumed, it has the effect of regulating him qua Indian.

 

V The third issue

 

46.              I entertain grave doubts as to whether the
first two issues on which an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal were
founded ""on any ground that involves a question of law alone"". 

 

47.              The first issue was whether the Wildlife
Act affects appellant qua Indian. The same issue arose on an
alternative basis in R. v. Jack and Charlie (1982), 139 D.L.R. (3d) 25
and, at p. 41, Craig J.A. like Macdonald J.A., and, semble, also like Seaton
J.A. in the case at bar, held that it did not involve a question of law alone.
It does not appear possible to resolve that issue without weighing the abundant
evidence adduced by the parties. To quote Dickson J., as he then was, speaking
for the majority in Poitras v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 649 at p. 653,
it does seem to be a question which

 

... can be asked, and
answered, without reference to the detail of the particular case.

 

                   The
first issue would appear to raise a question of mixed law and fact.

 

48.              The second issue comprises two questions
namely whether the Wildlife Act is a law of general application and
whether s. 88  of the Indian Act  referentially incorporates provincial
laws of general application. The second question is probably one of law alone
but it constitutes only one half of the problem. The other half cannot be
resolved without a consideration of whether it has been established that, in
enacting the Wildlife Act, the legislator intended to single out Indians
for special treatment, again a matter of evidence, at least in part.

 

49.              Even the constitutional question,
referring as it does to ""the circumstances of this case"", sounds like
a question of mixed law and fact, which is not unusual for constitutional
questions: see for instance Northern Telecom Canada Ltd. v. Communication
Workers of Canada, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 733.

 

50.              The matter is further complicated by s.
41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S‑19 and
amendments, which must be read in the context of s. 41(1):

 

                   41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court
from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a
province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular
case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal
to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court, where, with respect
to the particular case sought to be appealed, the Supreme Court is of the
opinion that any question involved therein is, by reason of its public
importance or the importance of any issue of law or any issue of mixed law and
fact involved in such question, one that ought to be decided by the Supreme
Court or is, for any other reason, of such a nature or significance as to
warrant decision by it, and leave to appeal from such judgment is accordingly
granted by the Supreme Court.

 

                                                                    ...


 

                   (3) No
appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any
court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or
acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law
or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.

 

51.              If the issues on which the appeal was
taken to the Court of Appeal do not involve questions of law alone, it is
arguable that the Court of Appeal exceeded its jurisdiction in entertaining the
appeal, in which case we could have granted leave to appeal on this question of
jurisdiction, while being precluded from reviewing the merits. But since the
Court of Appeal and the County Court have reached the same result, it becomes
unnecessary to decide whether the Court of Appeal has exceeded its
jurisdiction.

 

52.              It may seem anomalous that this Court and
even a Court of Appeal be cut off from a constitutional question of some
importance, but it is not unheard of: thus, Reference re Minimum Wage Act of
Saskatchewan, supra, was a reference ordered because, in that case,
no appeal lay to this Court from a decision of the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal.

 

53.              These doubts, I would have to resolve if I
thought that, on the merits, the appeal should succeed. But since I have
reached the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed in any event, I
believe I can leave my doubts unresolved.

 

VI The constitutional question

 

54.              I would answer the constitutional question
as follows:

 

Sections 3(1) and 8(1) of
the Wildlife Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, being laws of general
application in the Province of British Columbia, are applicable to the
appellant either by referential incorporation under s. 88 of the Indian Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑6, or of their own force.

 

VII Conclusions

 

55.              I would dismiss the appeal and make no
order as to costs.

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Trial by jury ‑‑

                   Appellant and five other persons were charged with
conspiracy to traffic in a narcotic and with trafficking in a narcotic, namely
P.C.P. After the preliminary inquiry, the charge laid against the caretaker of
the building where the P.C.P. was made was withdrawn. At his trial before a
jury appellant was convicted, and his appeal to the Court of Appeal was
dismissed. The appeal at bar was based on three grounds: did the Court of
Appeal err in law (1) in affirming the judgment of the trial judge which
dismissed a motion for a mistrial made as a result of certain comments
contained in the argument of counsel for the Crown regarding alleged prior
acts; (2) in finding that the trial judge did not err in refusing to delete
from recorded conversations passages referring to appellant's criminal past;
and (3) in finding that the authorization to intercept the private
conversations was legal? Appellant argued that this authorization was not in
keeping with the provisions of the Code since, first, the person named
in the authorization, the building caretaker, was only a ""straw man""
whose name was used as a pretext for obtaining authorization to intercept the
private communications of any person using the building where the P.C.P. was made,
and second, the authorization was too wide and did not have the necessary
limitations as to the persons whose communications could be intercepted and the
place where this could be done. 

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The trial judge did not err in dismissing the motion
for a mistrial made by appellant. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge
was able to remove any prejudice which the comments of counsel for the Crown
may have caused him. The trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that they
were not to take into account the comments by the Crown regarding the alleged
prior acts committed by appellant.

 

                   The effect of this direction was also to remove any
prejudice which the passages not deleted from the recorded conversations may
have caused appellant. The comments of the Crown were based on one of the three
passages not deleted. The jury was certainly able to understand from the trial
judge's direction that any evidence as to appellant's criminal past must be
disregarded.

 

                   There is no basis for finding the authorization
unlawful. The mere fact that the charge against the building caretaker was
withdrawn does not establish that the use of his name in the application for an
authorization was a fiction. The record as it stands does not support this
conclusion. It might as well be said that in view of his function as a
caretaker and the extent of the activities suspected, and which in fact
occurred in the building, the signatory of the sworn statement could believe in
good faith, at the time of the application for an authorization, that he was in
league with the others.

 

                   Finally, when there is a clear dividing line between
the good and bad parts of an authorization, and they are not so interwoven that
they cannot be separated but are actually separate authorizations given in the
same order, the court can divide the order and preserve the valid portion,
which then forms the authorization. In such a case interceptions made under the
valid authorization are admissible. In the case at bar, without the offending
paragraph the authorization is perfectly valid. Since this paragraph was not
used, it can be excluded and all the conversations intercepted by authority of
an otherwise valid authorization are admissible.

delivered by 

 

1.                Chouinard
J.‑‑At his trial before a jury, appellant was convicted of
the following indictable offences:

 

                   1.
Between April 1st, 1980 and April 28, 1980, did unlawfully conspire together
with WILLIAM BRADLEY and with other unknown persons, to commit an indictable
offence not included in paragraphs a, b or c of Section 423(1) of the Criminal
Code , to wit: trafficking in a narcotic, that is, P.C.P. (phenyl cyclohexyl
piperidine), contrary to Section 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. N‑1, committing thereby an indictable offence pursuant to Section
423(1) (d) of the Criminal Code ;

 

                    2.
Between April 1st, 1980 and April 28, 1980, did unlawfully traffic in a
narcotic, to wit: approximately 7.58 pounds of P.C.P. (phenyl cyclohexyl
piperidine), contrary to Section 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. N‑1, committing thereby an indictable offence pursuant to Section 4(3)
of the said Narcotic Control Act.

 

2.                His appeal to the Court of Appeal was
dismissed unanimously: (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 78.

 

3.                Appellant summarized the facts as
follows:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
Appellant was arrested on April 28, 1980 with the co‑accused MARUSKA, DI
SALVO, THOMAS and BRADLEY, at 620 rue St‑Jacques, Montréal.

 

                    This
is a vacant commercial building. In the basement there is a garage and storage
rooms. The caretaker is one Wayne Murphy; he was arrested and charged with the
others; however, at the preliminary inquiry he was called as a witness by the
Crown, which withdrew the charges against him.

 

                    The
building was searched immediately after the arrests. Certain objects were
seized and later produced at the trial. Two tanks containing P.C.P. were found,
one of them behind the caretaker's desk and containing 7.58 pounds of P.C.P.,
the other in the first floor ceiling and containing 42 grams of P.C.P. 

 

                    Traces
of P.C.P. were found on various articles (a barrel, a mixer and the clothes of
certain of the accused, including appellant).

 

                    The
evidence presented by the Crown against appellant and his co‑accused at
the trial rested primarily on the testimony of police officers who observed the
searched building and on the entering in evidence of the material and articles
connected with P.C.P. that were seized at 620 rue St‑Jacques.

 

                    The
police observation evidence established that one of the accused, MARUSKA, was
seen at 620 rue St‑Jacques on April 25, 1980. The latter confirmed this
in his testimony, explaining that he had indeed gone to the aforementioned
location with two of the co‑accused (DI SALVO and THOMAS) to discuss
renting the empty premises with the caretaker. Maruska testified that he also
saw chemicals and various kinds of equipment: so far as he knew, these items
were to be sold following a bankruptcy. He got this information from the
caretaker.

 

                    However,
the Crown's argument is that the most overwhelming evidence against appellant
rests on the latter's conversations with the co‑accused. These
conversations established, in the view of the Crown, knowledge and production
of P.C.P. by the accused. Cpl. Bell, who was in charge of the investigation,
identified the voices of each of the accused, except Di Salvo.

 

                    Only
the accused MARUSKA entered a defence.

 

                    Maruska
testified that he did not participate in producing the P.C.P., and believed
that Bradley was making a perfectly legal product. This belief was based on
research which he did with Bradley at McGill University Library. Bradley denied
any participation in the final manufacture of P.C.P. He admitted having made
certain tests, but said he was unaware that the product was illegal.

 

                    Appellant
Grabowski did not testify and called no witnesses. 

 

4.                In this summary by appellant, respondent
only disputed the statement that [TRANSLATION]  ""the most overwhelming
evidence against appellant rests on the latter's conversations with the co‑accused"".
Instead, respondent argued, the offences were established by all the evidence
which she presented to the jury. Respondent further made the following
additional points, not disputed by appellant:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Appellant
was arrested at 1 a.m. on Monday, April 28, 1980, as he was about to leave the
rear door of an office building located in the heart of the financial district
of Montréal, at 620 St‑Jacques West.

 

 The building in question
was an office building most of which was tenanted.

 

 Appellant and his
accomplices had no right of access to the building.

 

 Appellant was seen at
about 9:55 a.m. on Sunday, April 27, as he was leaving the building; he
returned a few minutes later and it was not until he was arrested that he was
about to leave with his accomplices.

 

 Appellant fled inside the
building when the police arrived.

 

 The very strong smell of
chemicals noticeable inside the building.

 

 In the part of the
basement containing the lockers in which the equipment and chemicals used to
manufacture P.C.P. were stored, the floor was wet and had recently been washed.

 

 The lower part of
appellant's trousers was wet.

 

 The keys to the building
were found on the ground a few feet from where appellant was finally stopped by
the police, near the entrance at the front of the building.

 

 Radio equipment of the
""walkie‑talkie"" type was found on the accomplices, Thomas, Di
Salvo and Bradley, when they were arrested.

 

 These three items of
radio equipment operated on the same frequency as a fourth item found in one of
the basement lockers.

 

 Radio equipment of the
""scanner"" type was seized: inter alia, it could get three
radio frequencies of the RCMP and one radio frequency of the M.U.C. Police.

 

 Phencyclidine (P.C.P.)
was found on the clothing of appellant and the other accomplices arrested with
him.

 

 P.C.P. was found in the
basement in a barrel used as a tank and on a mixer placed in the barrel.

 

 A preliminary product,
piperidine cyclohexane carbonitrite (P.C.C.), was found in the basement and on
the ground floor. 

 

 Maruska had bought
heating strips identical to those found in the basement of the building and
those shown on a diagram found on him when he was arrested.

 

 The instructions for use
of the heating strips were found on appellant Thomas when he was arrested.

 

 The products necessary
for the manufacture of P.C.P. were found in two of the lockers in the basement
at 620 St‑Jacques West, where appellant and his accomplices were
arrested.

 

 Certain liquid products
used to manufacture P.C.P. found at the location were replaced by water in
their containers, so that the containers appeared to be full.

 

5.                Appellant raised three grounds, stated
in the form of questions.

 

6.                The first question is as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Did the
Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in upholding the validity of the judgment of
the learned trial judge who dismissed a motion for a mistrial made as a result
of certain comments contained in the argument of counsel for the Crown?

 

7.                Appellant alleged that counsel for the
respondent, during his argument, had referred to alleged prior offences. The
passage of the argument giving rise to this complaint is as follows:

 

He was talking about 80
pounds of P.C.P. I am submitting to you that it wasn't the first time they made
P.C.P. there. So I'm telling you that it's not the first time. But you're not
being asked to convict the accused on those previous times. You're being asked
to convict the accused of only what is in the Indictment.

 

8.                This statement by counsel for the
respondent was based on the following passage from the conversations
intercepted:

 

(KG) I'm out and now
I got to get the council man to mix it now.

 

(UM) Yeah.

 

(KG) I got about
eighty pounds there already so, be enough for the first batch.

 

9.                However, the Court was persuaded that
the reference to 80 pounds did not concern the earlier production of P.C.P.,
but the chemical ingredients present in the makeshift laboratory which were to
be used in preparing 7.49 pounds of P.C.P. 

 

10.              In his elaborate judgment dismissing the
motion for a mistrial, the judge reviewed the intercepted conversations as a
whole, and in particular all the quantities mentioned at various points. He
made many calculations in arriving at his conclusion.

 

11.              The judge said:

 

                    Those
calculations and the above analysis confirm me in my interpretation of that
passage at the end of the third conversation, as referring to ingredient
products and not to finished P.C.P.

 

The judge later went on to pose the following question:

 

                    Hence,
Crown counsel should not have made the above‑cited comment. Having done
so has caused a prejudice to the four accused. The question I must now consider
and resolve is: Is that prejudice irreparable or can it be remedied by
appropriate comments and directives to the Jury in my Charge?

 

12.              The judge cited Beetz J.:

 

                    In the
unreported judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. vs. Boka,
rendered on April 11th, 1974 in Case No. 10‑000151‑72, Mr. Justice
Beetz (as he then was) wrote:

 

[TRANSLATION]  ""It
must be assumed that jurors have average intelligence and are capable, provided
they are given legally admissible evidence and adequate directions on the law,
of sufficient abstraction to be judges of fact.""

 

                    On
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, that dictum was approved.

 

13.              (On the last point, it would be more
correct to say that an application for leave to appeal was dismissed by this
Court: [1975] 1 S.C.R. vii.)

 

14.              Finally, the judge said he was persuaded
that he would be able, by his charge to the jury, to remedy the damage caused
the accused by the comments of counsel for the respondent and, exercising his
discretion, he dismissed the motion.

 

15.              In his charge to the jury, the judge
restated his analysis of the intercepted conversations as a whole and the
detailed calculation of the various quantities. He told them he was persuaded
that the reference to 80 pounds concerned ingredients to be used in preparing
P.C.P., not P.C.P. that may have been produced on some other occasion. The
judge then gave the jury the following charge: 

 

 Now I suggest to you, but
that is my opinion, that Bélanger was wrong in giving you his assessment of
that eighty (80) pounds as referring to previous PCP, but you're not bound by
what I tell you. You are free to apply to that your own opinion, your own
conclusions on the evidence. It should be more than opinion. It should be
conclusions.

 

                    Now,
if, notwithstanding everything I have just told you, which would surprise me
very much, but I've been surprised before, you agree with Bélanger's
interpretation of that passage, then I tell you as a matter and directive of
law that, if you agree with Bélanger that that refers to eighty (80) pounds of
PCP, which you don't have in evidence here, that in law you cannot and must not
construe that as constituting similar fact evidence in relation to any one of
the accused here. You've heard me discuss similar fact evidence...if you choose
to agree with Mr. Bélanger's interpretation of the eighty (80) pounds, you must
not and you shall not in any way apply that conclusion or that opinion to any
of the accused here, if you so agree with Mr. Bélanger, which again would
surprise me. You must disregard entirely what he said. Put it out of your
minds. It bears no relationship to this case. It is not evidence in this case,
and it is not evidence in any way of the commission by any of the ...accused
here of any of the... counts in the present indictment of which they stand
charged.

 

16.              McCarthy J.A., after citing the same
passage, dismissed this argument by appellant. He wrote, on behalf of the Court
of Appeal (at p. 81): 

 

 In my view, the trial
judge thus removed any prejudice that Mtre Bélanger's comments may have caused
the accused. The fact that the trial judge charged the jury eight days after
Mtre Bélanger made his comments is not, as the appellants argue, significant.
The charge was quite clear and there is no reason to assume that the jurors
were not sufficiently intelligent to understand and act on it.

 

17.              I agree.

 

18.              Appellant's second ground was presented as
follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Did the
Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in finding that the learned judge did not err
in law in refusing to delete from the recorded conversations passages referring
to applicant's criminal past?

 

19.              A number of passages from the intercepted
conversations were deleted by the judge. Appellant is here referring to three
passages which were not deleted, including the one already mentioned.

 

20.              In dismissing this argument the Court of
Appeal relied on the judge's charge to the jury, cited above. I concur in the opinion
of the Court of Appeal and adopt the following passage of McCarthy J.A. (at pp.
81‑82):

 

 However, here again, I
think that the trial judge's instructions quoted above removed any prejudice
that may have been caused the accused. Those instructions were occasioned by
Mtre Bélanger's comments on one particular extract but any intelligent listener
would, I think, have understood from them that any evidence of past
similar criminal conduct was to be disregarded.

 

21.              The third ground, which was the principal
focus of the pleading in this Court, concerned the admissibility in evidence of
the intercepted conversations. Appellant stated it as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Did the
Court of Appeal err in law in finding that the authorization to intercept
private conversations was legal and in accordance with the provisions of the
Criminal Code ?

 

22.              Appellant disputed the legality of the
authorization.

 

23.              The rules on the interception of
communications are contained in Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code , headed
""Invasion of Privacy"".

 

24.              The first rule is stated in s. 178.11(1) : 

 

                    178.11
(1) Every one who, by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or
other device, wilfully intercepts a private communication is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for five years.

 

25.              Subsection (2)  of s. 178.11 lists the
exceptions, including:

 

                    (2)
Subsection (1) does not apply to

 

                                                                    ...

 

 (b) a person who
intercepts  a private communication in  accordance with an  authorization or
any person  who in good faith aids in any  way a person whom he has  reasonable
and probable  grounds to believe is acting  with any such authorization;

 

26.              Under s. 178.12(1) an authorization may be
obtained by an application accompanied by an

 

 ...affidavit which may be
sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer or public officer
deposing to the following matters, namely:

 

 (c) the facts
relied upon to  justify the belief that an  authorization should be given 
together with particulars of  the offence;

 

 (d) the type of
private  communication proposed to be  intercepted;

 

 (e) the names,
addresses and  occupations, if known, of all  persons, the interception of 
whose private communications  there are reasonable and  probable grounds to
believe  may assist the investigation  of the offence, a general  description
of the nature and  location of the place, if  known, at which private 
communications are proposed  to be intercepted and a  general description of
the  manner of interception  proposed to be used;

 

 (e.1) the number
of  instances, if any, on which  an application has been made  under this
section in  relation to the offence and  a person named in the  affidavit
pursuant to  paragraph (e) and on which  the application was  withdrawn
or no  authorization was given, the  date on which each such  application was
made and the  name of the judge to whom  each such application was  made;

 

 (f) the period for
which the  authorization is requested;  and

 

 (g) whether other 
investigative procedures have  been  tried and have failed or why  it appears
they are unlikely  to succeed or that the  urgency of the matter is such  that
it would be impractical  to carry out the  investigation of the offence  using
only other  investigative procedures.

 

27.              Section 178.13(2)  governs the content and
limitation of the authorization: 

 

                    178.13
(1) . . .

 

                    (2) An
authorization shall

 

 (a) state the
offence in respect of which private communications may be intercepted;

 

 (b) state the type
of private communication that may be intercepted;

 

 (c) state the
identity of the persons, if known, whose private communications are to be
intercepted, generally describe the place at which private communications may
be intercepted, if a general description of that place can be given, and
generally describe the manner of  interception that may be used;

 

 (d) contain such
terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable in the public interest;
and;

 

 (e) be valid for
the period, not exceeding sixty days, set forth therein.

 

28.              It is apparent from para. (c)
above, and the courts have consistently held, that an authorization must
contain limitations on the persons whose communications may be intercepted, the
place where they may be intercepted and the method of interception.

 

29.              The relevant portion of the authorization
in the case at bar states:

 

[TRANSLATION]  3. The
persons whose communications may be intercepted are:

 

 (a) William MURPHY
(building caretaker); and

 

 (b) certain other
persons whose identity is at present unknown, but who have acted, are acting or
may act in concert or in collusion with a person named in subparagraph (a) or
with a person found in one of the places named in paragraph 4, and whose
private communications may be intercepted by means of this authorization.

 

 4. The places or
localities where the private communications of the persons mentioned in
paragraph 3 may be intercepted are:

 

 (a) 620 St‑Jacques
West, Montréal, Que. (underground garage); and/or

 

 (b) any other place
or locality, stationary or mobile, where the persons named in paragraph 3 could
be found, but the nature and location of which are at present impossible to
specify.

 

30.              Appellant submitted that the authorization
was not in keeping with the provisions of the Code because it amounted
to a ""blank"" authorization. He challenged it on two grounds.

 

31.              First, he said that the person named,
William Murphy, was a ""straw man"". His name was used as a pretext for
obtaining authorization to intercept the private communications of any person
using the commercial building in question. 

 

32.              Second, because of paragraph 4(b), the
authorization was too wide and did not have the necessary limitations as to the
persons whose communications could be intercepted and the place where this
could be done. The authorization allowed [TRANSLATION]  ""interception of
almost any conversation of anyone"".

 

33.              On the first point, counsel for the
appellant wrote:

 

[TRANSLATION]  WILLIAM
MURPHY was arrested at the same time, but at his place of residence, and at
the preliminary inquiry the Crown withdrew the charge against him. WILLIAM
MURPHY then testified that he was only the caretaker of the building and had no
knowledge of the suspicious acts of the accused.

 

34.              The mere fact that the charge against
Murphy was withdrawn does not establish that the use of his name in the
application for authorization was a fiction. It might as well be said that, in
view of his function as a caretaker and the extent of the activities suspected,
and which in fact occurred in the building, the signatory of the sworn
statement could believe in good faith, at the time of the application for an
authorization, that he was in league with the others. The record as it stands
does not support the conclusion that appellant suggested, based on the
withdrawal of the charge.

 

35.              On the second point, in my opinion ‑‑
and I say so with respect for the contrary view ‑‑ paragraph 3(b),
read with paragraph 4(b), means that this authorization allowed the
conversations of anyone to be intercepted anywhere.

 

36.              The persons whose communications can be
intercepted are William Murphy and certain other persons whose identity is
unknown at present, provided the latter are in collusion with Murphy or in
collusion with someone at one of the places mentioned in paragraph 4. According
to paragraph 4(b), this includes anywhere that a person mentioned in paragraph
3 may be found, thus including persons whose identity is unknown.

 

37.              In my opinion, the authorization
consequently contains no limitation as to persons or place. 

 

38.              In R. v. Ritch (1982), 69 C.C.C.
(2d) 289, an authorization was ruled invalid and the communications intercepted
inadmissible in evidence for this reason. The judgment of the Alberta Court of
Appeal was affirmed by this Court sub nom. R. v. Brese, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 333. The Court stated ""We are in substantial agreement with the
majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal"". In Ritch, the relevant
portion of the authorization read as follows:

 

2.                The
types of communication that may be intercepted are:

 

 (a) any
telecommunication made by GARRY GORDON BRESE;

 

 (b) Any
telecommunication in respect of telephone number 468‑1421 located at
Suite #9, 6920‑101 Ave., Edmonton, Alta.  (walk‑up apartment
building) or any subsequent number as a result of change of address or
telephone number; and

 

 (c) any oral
communication made by GARRY GORDON BRESE and/or another person or persons at
Ste #9, 6920‑101 Ave.,  Edmonton, Alta. or at such other public or
private places within the jurisdiction of this Court as may be resorted to by
GARRY GORDON BRESE.

 

39.              The police had intercepted all calls
through the telephone number mentioned in paragraph (b), regardless of the
identity of the persons speaking, and the prosecution had entered some 120
telephone conversations in evidence. The question was whether paragraphs (a)
and (b) could be read together, so that the authorization in (a) was limited by
(b) as to place and that in (b) was limited by (a) as to persons. The Alberta
Court of Appeal held that, in view of the semi‑colon placed at the end of
paragraph (a), they could not be read with each other. The effect of this
punctuation mark was to make paragraphs (a) and (b) two separate authorizations
which did not contain the limitations, as to place in (a) and as to persons in
(b), required by s. 178.13(2) (c). All the conversations intercepted were
accordingly found to be inadmissible.

 

40.              At pages 294‑95, the Court said:

 

 If para. 2(a) and (b) are
to be read together the semicolon following the name ""Brese"" in para.
2(a) must be deleted, the letter ""(b)"", denoting the subparagraph,
must be deleted and, finally, the words ""any telecommunication"" where
they appear in para. 2(b) become redundant and must be deleted.

 

                    In our
view para. 2(c) is significant in that it demonstrates that when the framers of
the order wanted to combine name and location they did so in one paragraph.
True it is that para. 2(c) is concerned with oral communications, but that, in
our opinion, is irrelevant. Paragraph 2(c) adds further strength to the
argument that para. 2(a) and (b) cannot be read together. 

 

                    We
conclude that the investigating officers wanted a ""basket clause"",
they obtained what they thought was a ""basket clause"", and they acted
upon the authorization as if it was a ""basket clause"". They installed
a ""dead"" monitor and they intercepted all calls to and from the
telephone number specified in para. 2(b) without regard to the identity of the
persons involved. Certainly they treated that paragraph as separate and apart
from para. 2(a). Crown counsel now concede that para. 2(b) cannot stand alone.

 

                    It is
clear that para. 2(a) is unlawful. It has no limitation as to place and
purports to authorize a tap anywhere in Canada. As stated by counsel for Ritch
and Andrews it is ""like a search warrant without any limitation as to
place"".

 

41.              I note that the foregoing passage appears
to suggest that paragraph 2(c) was valid, as in concluding that paragraphs (a)
and (b) were invalid the Court emphasized the difference in wording between
them and paragraph (c); but the case was not concerned with paragraph 2(c).

 

42.              I therefore consider that if that were all
appellant should succeed.

 

43.              However, respondent submitted
alternatively that the authorization in the case at bar is severable and that
if paragraph 4(b) is excluded, it is perfectly valid. Accordingly, the
interceptions made under paragraphs 3(b) and 4(a) are admissible. All the
conversations at issue were intercepted at 620 St‑Jacques West, as coming
from the makeshift laboratory used by the accomplices.

 

44.              In Ritch paragraphs (a) and (b)
were considered separately, and were found to be invalid separately. On the
other hand, it would appear that paragraph (c) would probably have been found
to be valid. However, the question as presented in the case at bar, namely
whether an authorization may be severed into valid and invalid parts, was not
directly raised in Ritch.

 

45.              Nevertheless, in Ritch the Alberta
Court of Appeal relied essentially on a judgment of McQuaid J. of the Supreme
Court of Prince Edward Island, R. v. Blacquiere (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d)
330. In that case, McQuaid J. upheld certain parts of the impugned
authorizations and invalidated others. He ruled that certain intercepted
communications were admissible in respect of certain of the accused and
inadmissible in respect of another. 

 

46.              At page 332, McQuaid J. wrote:

 

                    The
above‑named accused, together with seven others, stands charged with
conspiracy to traffic in narcotics contrary to s. 423(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code . The trial of the matter commenced with a voir dire respecting
the admissibility of a large number of tapes of intercepted telephone
communications as between the several accused, together with the typed
transcript of selected portions of those tapes, all allegedly secured pursuant
to s. 178.1  (am. 1976‑77, c. 53, s. 7) of the Code. Before the
trial can proceed further, if indeed it can, it is necessary to rule on a
number of points respecting admissibility raised in argument both by the Crown
and the several counsel representing the accused.

 

47.              In that case the applicable portion of the
authorization read as follows:

 

 Wayne Ernest Blacquiere
of Summerside, in Prince County in the Province of Prince Edward Island,
labourer, and in respect of other persons whose identities are not known a
general description of the place at which private communications to and from
such persons may be intercepted is: 21 Heckbert Street, Apartment #3,
Summerside, Prince Edward Island and any other premises in the Province of
Prince Edward Island resorted to or used by the said Wayne Ernest Blacquiere or
any such person who is found to be in communication with the said Wayne Ernest
Blacquiere.

 

48.              For greater clarity, McQuaid J. divided
this paragraph into three, at p. 337:

 

                    The
first authorization was issued on December 4, 1978, effective from that date to
January 31, 1979, and contained the wording above quoted, which may be broken
down into three components:

 

 (a) Wayne Ernest
Blacquiere of Summerside, in Prince County in the Province of Prince Edward
Island, labourer;

 

 (b) and in respect
of other persons whose identities are not now known, a general description of
the place at which private  communications may be intercepted is: 21 Heckbert
St., Apartment No. 3, Summerside, Prince Edward Island;

 

 (c) (and in respect
to other persons whose identities are not now known), any other premises in the
Province of Prince Edward Island resorted to or used by the said Wayne Ernest
Blacquiere or any such person who is found to be in contact with the said Wayne
Ernest Blacquiere.

 

49.              Regarding the limitations on place and
persons which an authorization must contain as the legislation stands at
present, McQuaid J. said the following at p. 335: 

 

                    In the
present amended legislation, what is to be included is:

 

 (a) if the person
whose private communication is to be intercepted is known, the name of that
person together with the general identification of the place at which such
interception is to take place;

 

 (b) if the person
whose private communication is to be intercepted is not known the order must
contain the general identification of the place at which such interception is
to take place.

 

50.              McQuaid J. found part (a) of the
authorization invalid, because it contained no limitation as to place, and part
(c) invalid as well because it contained no limitation as to persons or place.
However, he found part (b) valid. At page 338, he wrote:

 

                    In my
view, since the authorization was defective, and thus ineffective, with respect
to Wayne Blacquiere, since it did not conform to the statutory requirement, and
since it would be illogical to sweep him into the basket clause if he was
precluded from being caught directly, the interception could not be said to be
a lawful one in so far as he was concerned. On the other hand, the same
interception was a lawful one in so far as the unknown was concerned under the
provisions of the basket clause. The answer, I think, is to take the position,
which I do, that any communication either to or from either 21 Heckbert St., or
384 North Market St., codes ""Blackie"" or ""Keli"", are not
admissible as against Blacquiere, but are admissible as against whomever is the
other party to any such communication. The same reasoning will apply to John
McLean respecting communications to or from 215 Linden St., and to Brian Perry
respecting communications to or from 1 Hillside Ave.

 

                    As to
segment (c) of the authorization, I would hold this to be a nullity, in as much
as it contains two unknowns, the identity of the person, and the location of
the telephone service. While this might have been permissible under the pre‑1977
legislation, it does not appear to be what is contemplated under the present
legislation.

 

                    Since
the legislation is primarily directed at the protection of privacy, it is
encumbent upon the Crown to bring itself clearly within the exceptions. I am of
the opinion that it has not done so in respect to segment (a) or (c) of the
authorization, but has done so in respect to segment (b), and to this extent I
would hold the authorization to be valid, and that all interceptions made which
fall under that category to have been lawfully made, subject to what has been
stated immediately above respecting those communications.

 

51.              In Ritch, affirmed by this Court,
the Alberta Court of Appeal cited several passages from the McQuaid judgment,
including the following at p. 294. It is the beginning of the preceding
passage, and I reproduce it again:

 

                    In my
view, since the authorization was defective, and thus ineffective, with respect
to Wayne Blacquiere, since it did not conform to the statutory requirement, and
since it would be illogical to sweep him into the basket clause if he was
precluded from being caught directly, the interception could not be said to be
a lawful one in so far as he was concerned. On the other hand, the same
interception was a lawful one in so far as the unknown was concerned under the
provisions of the basket clause. 

 

52.              Immediately following this, still at p.
294 of Ritch, there is the following passage by the Alberta Court of
Appeal:

 

                    Even
though in R. v. Blacquiere the authorization in issue did not divide the
telecommunications to be intercepted into subsections in the manner of the
authorizations before us the court there held that because the mandatory
requirement of s. 178.13 (2) (c) was not met the authorization was
unlawful as it affected the accused Blacquiere. The court refused to read the
operative part of the authorization as one.

 

                    With
respect we agree with the reasoning of McQuaid J. . . .

 

53.              In R. v. Paterson, Ackworth and Kovach
(1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 137, rendered on February 5, 1985, the Ontario Court of
Appeal unanimously held that an authorization was severable and that
interceptions made on the basis of the valid portions of the authorizations
were admissible.

 

54.              Among other clauses the authorization in
that case contained the following:

 

 (3)(b) Authorization is
also hereby given to intercept the private communications of persons whose
identities are presently unknown, in accordance with the terms of this
Authorization, provided that there are reasonable and probable grounds to
believe that the interception of such private communications may assist the
investigation of any of the offences stated in paragraph 1 above, whether or
not any such person described in paragraph 3(a) above is party to such private
communications.

 

55.              About this clause Martin J.A. wrote for
the Court at p. 148:

 

                    Paragraph
3(b) of the authorization granted by Judge McCart does not restrict the
interception of private communications of unknown persons to persons at
particular premises as in R. v. Samson et al. (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d)
194....Nor does the authorization restrict the interception of private
communications of unknown persons to persons who are associating with, dealing
with or in contact with the named persons in respect of which the authorization
is granted. In my view, the ""basket clause"" is invalid.

 

56.              Martin J.A. further wrote, at p. 149:

 

                    The
invalidity of the ""basket clause"" is, however, of no assistance to
the respondents in the present case, since it is clear that it was never used.
All private communications intercepted under Judge McCart's authorization took
place at 124 Cantley Cres. in London, the residence of Brian Daley. Brian Daley
was a party to each of the communications, save in an interception on June 28,
1982 between Daley and the respondent Paterson when Daley broke off the
conversation temporarily and apparently requested his wife, Helen Daley, to talk
to Paterson, while he went to the bathroom. On Brian Daley's return he resumed
his conversation with Paterson. The brief conversation between Helen Daley and
Paterson, even if inadmissible, was of little consequence in light of the other
evidence. 

 

57.              He went on:

 

                    Further,
I am of the opinion that the ""basket clause"" is severable and does
not affect the validity of the balance of the authorization.

 

58.              Martin J.A. concluded on this point, at
pp. 149‑50:

 

                    In the
present case, there is a clear line of demarcation between the good and the bad
parts of the authorization; they are not interwoven. The offending paragraph is
not vital to the part of the authorization relating to the interception of the
private communications of named persons and its excision in the circumstances
of this case does not subvert the policy of the legislation. In the present
case, since all the interceptions were made pursuant to the valid part of the
authorization, the necessity for separating evidence flowing from the valid and
invalid parts does not arise. The ""basket clause"" was never resorted
to, it generated no evidence, nor any derivative evidence.

 

59.              The Alberta Court of Appeal relied on this
case in R. v. Munroe (1985), 38 Alta. L.R. (2d) 189. Kerans J.A.,
speaking for the Court, separated the objectionable part from the valid part of
an authorization the remainder of which was in accordance with the law.

 

60.              I adopt the passages cited above from
Martin J.A.

 

61.              When there is a clear dividing line
between the good and bad parts of an authorization, and they are not so
interwoven that they cannot be separated but are actually separate
authorizations given in the same order, the Court in my opinion can divide the
order and preserve the valid portion, which then forms the authorization. In
such a case interceptions made under the valid authorization are admissible.

 

62.              If paragraph 4(b) is excluded in the case
at bar, the authorization is perfectly valid. As in Paterson and Munroe,
the offending paragraph was not used in any way. All the interceptions were
made at 620 St‑Jacques West. I consider that paragraph 4(b) can be
excluded and that the conversations intercepted by authority of an otherwise
valid authorization are admissible.

 

63.              For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 

                   Constitutional law ‑‑ Charter of Rights  ‑‑
Self‑incrimination ‑‑ Retrial ‑‑ First trial
taking place prior to proclamation of Charter  ‑‑ Incriminating evidence
given by accused at first trial not admissible against him at second trial ‑‑
Protection against self‑incrimination guaranteed by s. 13  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑
Admissibility ‑‑ Self‑incrimination ‑‑ Retrial ‑‑
Accused's evidence at first trial not admissible against him at second trial ‑‑
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 13 .

 








                   Appellant was convicted by a jury of second degree
murder but the Court of Appeal granted a new trial on grounds of misdirection
to the jury. At the second trial, held after the proclamation of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Crown introduced as evidence
appellant's testimony given voluntarily at his first trial. Defence counsel objected
arguing that it was contrary to s. 13  of the Charter  which provided that
""A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have any
incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any other
proceedings...."" The trial judge ruled that the protection against self‑incrimination
guaranteed by s. 13  did not apply as the Charter  came into force after
appellant had testified in his first trial. Appellant was again convicted. His
appeal, on the sole ground that his first trial testimony should have been
excluded, was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that the second trial was not
""any other proceedings"" within the meaning of the section and
therefore appellant could not invoke s. 13  under these circumstances. 

 

                   Held (McIntyre J.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Estey, Chouinard, Lamer, Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: Section 13  of the Charter 
precludes the admission at the second trial of the evidence given by the appellant
at his first trial. The purpose of s. 13 , when the section is viewed in the
context of s. 11 (c) and (d) ‑‑ the right of non‑compellability
and the presumption of innocence ‑‑ is to protect individuals from
being indirectly compelled to incriminate themselves. This protection inures to
an individual at the moment an attempt is made to utilize previous testimony to
incriminate him. The time at which the previous testimony is given is
irrelevant. Thus, no issue of retrospectivity arises in this case since the
attempt to use appellant's testimony occurred after the coming into force of
the Charter .

 

                   The fact that s. 13  is framed in the present tense,
does not preclude it from applying in a situation where the witness in question
was the accused and when the testimony in issue had been given previously. The
phrase ""A witness who testifies..."" merely clarifies that the word
""witness"" includes a voluntary witness.

 

                   Although s. 13 refers twice to the notion of
incrimination, the evidence in issue need not be incriminating in the first
proceeding in which it was given and in the second where the Crown attempts to
use it. The purpose of the section clearly indicates that the incriminating
nature of the evidence must be evaluated only in the second proceeding. Any
evidence the Crown tenders as part of its case against the accused is, for the
purpose of s. 13, incriminating evidence.

 

                   A retrial of the same offence falls within the
meaning of the words ""any other proceedings"". The courts must
interpret each section of the Charter  in relation to the others. Here,
to allow the Crown to use, as part of its case, the accused's previous
testimony would in effect allow the Crown to do indirectly what it is estopped
from doing directly by s. 11 (c), i.e., to compel the accused to
testify. It would also permit an indirect violation of the right of the accused
to be presumed innocent and remain silent until proven guilty by the Crown, as
guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter . Such a result should be
avoided.

 

                   Finally, assuming that s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code  can apply to a Charter  violation and to a
remedy under s. 24 , given the nature of the evidence, this would not be a
proper case for applying the proviso. 

 

                   Per McIntyre J., dissenting:
Where a court of appeal quashes a conviction and orders a new trial, s. 13  of
the Charter  does not preclude the admission at the second trial of the
evidence given by the accused at his first trial. A new trial cannot, on a fair
reading of s. 13 , be considered as another proceeding. The word
""proceedings"" in s. 13 , means, in a criminal case, all judicial steps
taken upon one charge to resolve and reach a final conclusion of the issue
therein raised between the same party and the Crown. This would include the
preliminary hearing, the trial, and an appeal and a new trial. Therefore, while
s. 13  provides a wider protection against self‑incrimination than that
provided by s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act , the section does not
apply to evidence voluntarily given at a different stage in the same
proceedings.

 

                   Although appellant cannot be compelled to give
evidence at his second trial, this protection, provided by s. 11 (c) of
the Charter , does not extend to bar the use in evidence of earlier
voluntarily statements that he has made which are clearly relevant to the
issues.

                   Peter Lamont,
for the appellant.

 

                   Bruce Duncan,
for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Estey, Chouinard,
Lamer, Wilson and Le Dain JJ. was delivered by 

 

1.                Lamer
J.‑‑When a new trial is ordered on the same charge or on an
included offence by a court of appeal, can the Crown adduce as evidence‑in‑chief
the testimony given by an accused at the former trial? That question was
addressed by this Court prior to the coming into force of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (Constitution Act, 1982 , as enacted
by the Canada Act 1982, 1982 (U.K.), c. 11), in a different legal
setting, in R. v. Brown (No. 2) (1963), 40 C.R. 105, and answered
affirmatively. It now comes back to us because of s. 13  of the Charter .

 

The Facts

 

2.                The appellant was charged in Alberta
with second degree murder. At his trial before Rowbotham J. sitting with a
jury, the appellant gave evidence in his defence, admitting that he had killed
the deceased but also alleging certain circumstances of justification. The
appellant did not invoke the protection of s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10. The appellant was convicted, but successfully
appealed the conviction to the Alberta Court of Appeal and was granted a new
trial on grounds of misdirection to the jury: (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 494. At
the new trial, the Crown read in the appellant's testimony from the first trial
over the objection of appellant's counsel, such objection based on s. 13  of the
Charter . The appellant chose not to testify nor did he call any
evidence. He was again convicted. He appealed again to the Alberta Court of
Appeal on the sole ground that the trial judge erred in admitting into
evidence, as part of the Crown's case, the testimony of the appellant from his
former trial. The appeal was dismissed: (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 453, 9 C.R.R.
61, 39 C.R. (3d) 281, 31 Alta. L.R. (2d) 16, 8 D.L.R. (4th) 589, 51 A.R. 210,
[1984] 3 W.W.R. 594. The accused now comes to this Court.

 

3.                The Charter  had not come into
force at the time the appellant testified in his first trial but was in force
when Crown counsel adduced his evidence‑in‑chief in the second
trial. 

 

The Statutes

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 

 

                   13. A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have
any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any
other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of
contradictory evidence.

 

                   13. Chacun a droit à ce qu'aucun témoignage incriminant qu'il donne ne
soit utilisé pour l'incriminer dans d'autres procédures, sauf lors de
poursuites pour parjure ou pour témoignages contradictoires.

 

Canada Evidence Act 

 

                   5. (1) No witness shall be excused from answering any question upon the
ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate him, or may tend
to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown
or of any person.

 

                   (2)
Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground
that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his
liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person,
and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness
would therefore have been excused from answering such question, then although
the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial Act,
compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in
evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding
against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in
the giving of such evidence.

 

The Judgments

 

Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench

 

4.                Moshansky J. admitted into evidence the
appellant's previous testimony, holding that s. 13  of the Charter  did
not apply as the Charter  did not come into force until after the
appellant had testified in his first trial: (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 273, 6 C.R.R.
125. He stated that since s. 13  is framed in the present tense, it is intended
to apply to a witness who testifies rather than to one who has testified on
some previous occasion.

 

5.                The trial judge then went on to say that
regardless of the retrospectivity question, s. 13  would still not apply as the
section is intended to apply to a witness rather than to an accused. He did not
find it necessary to deal with the argument concerning the meaning of the words
""other proceedings"" in s. 13 . 

 

Alberta Court of Appeal

 

6.                The court ruled that the evidence was
admissible, although it disagreed with the trial judge's finding that s. 13  did
not apply because of the retrospectivity argument. The court held that s. 13 
did apply in a situation where the witness in question was the accused and when
the testimony in question had been given previously. The court stated that s.
13  in effect sets forth ""the right to have the testimony not used"".
However, the court ruled that the second trial is not ""any other
proceedings"" and therefore the accused could not invoke s. 13  under these
circumstances.

 

7.                Respondent Crown takes the view that s.
13  could not be invoked by the accused at his second trial because it applied
only to testimony given after the advent of the Charter , that in any
event the evidence in this case when given was not ""incriminating"",
and furthermore, that a retrial is not ""any other proceedings"".
Finally, the respondent invokes, as a subsidiary argument, s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

 

8.                As I am of the view that this appeal
should succeed, I will address all of the issues raised by the respondent in
support of the Court of Appeal's conclusion to dismiss the accused's appeal.

 

Nature and Purpose of s. 13 

 

9.                A plain reading of s. 13  indicates that
the guarantee it provides is directed against self‑incrimination through
the use of one's previous testimony. It is a very specific form of protection
against self‑incrimination and must therefore be viewed in the light of
two closely related rights, the right of non‑compellability and the
presumption of innocence, set forth in s. 11 (c) and (d) of the Charter :


 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(c) not to be
compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the
offence;

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

10.              Section 11 (d) imposes upon the
Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as
well as that of making out the case against the accused before he or she need
respond, either by testifying or by calling other evidence. As Laskin J. (as he
then was) wrote in R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R. 303, at p. 317:

 

The ""right to be
presumed innocent"" ...is, in popular terms, a way of expressing the fact
that the Crown has the ultimate burden of establishing guilt; if there is any
reasonable doubt at the conclusion of the case on any element of the offence
charged, an accused person must be acquitted. In a more refined sense, the
presumption of innocence gives an accused the initial benefit of a right of
silence and the ultimate benefit (after the Crown's evidence is in and as well
any evidence tendered on behalf of the accused) of any reasonable doubt: see Coffin
v. U.S. (1895), 156 U.S. 432 at 452.

 

11.              The Crown's ""burden of establishing
guilt"" and the ""right of silence"", i.e., the concept of a
""case to meet"", which are essential elements of the presumption of
innocence, also underlie the non‑compellability right. For, as Professor
Ratushny has written,

 

                   In many
ways, it is the principle of a `case to meet' which is the real underlying
protection which the `non‑compellability' rule seeks to promote. The
important protection is not that the accused need not testify, but that the
Crown must prove its case before there can be any expectation that he will
respond, whether by testifying himself, or by calling other evidence. However,
even where a `case to meet' has been presented, the burden of proof remains
upon the Crown to the end.

 

12.              (""The Role of the Accused in the
Criminal Process"", in Tarnopolsky and Beaudoin (eds.), The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (1982), at pp. 358‑59.)

 

The accused need only
respond once. The Crown must present its evidence at an open trial. The accused
is entitled to test and to attack it. If it does not reach a certain standard,
the accused is entitled to an acquittal. If it does reach that standard, then
and only then is the accused required to respond or to stand convicted.

 

13.              (Self‑incrimination in the
Canadian Criminal Process (1979), at p. 180.) 

 

14.              As such, the concept of the ""case to
meet"" is common to ss. 11 (c), (d) and 13 . In the context of
ss. 11 (c) and 13 , it means specifically that the accused enjoys
""the initial benefit of a right of silence"" (R. v. Appleby, supra)
and its corollary, protection against self‑incrimination. Section 13 ,
like s. 11 (c), is a recognition of the principle that,

 

...the individual is
sovereign and that proper rules of battle between government and individual
require that the individual not be bothered for less than good reason and not
be conscripted by his opponent to defeat himself.

 

15.              (Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 8
(McNaughton rev. 1961), para. 2251, at p. 318.)

 

16.              Hence, the purpose of s. 13 , when the
section is viewed in the context of s. 11 (c) and (d), is to
protect individuals from being indirectly compelled to incriminate themselves,
to ensure that the Crown will not be able to do indirectly that which s. 11 (c)
prohibits. It guarantees the right not to have a person's previous testimony
used to incriminate him or her in other proceedings.

 

17.              The consequences which flow from the
nature and purpose of the right enunciated in s. 13  touch upon the following
issues:

 

1. Whether the
section applies to a witness who testifies or to a person who has testified on
a previous occasion, that is, the determination of the beneficiary of the
right;

 

2. the interpretation
of the terms ""incriminating evidence"" and ""used to
incriminate"";

 

3.                the interpretation of the terms ""any other
proceedings"".

 

18.              For reasons hereinafter stated, while s.
11 (c) and (d) both have a bearing on the determination of these
three issues, s. 11 (c) (non‑compellability) is determinative as
regards the first two, whilst s. 11 (d) (the burden of proof and the
concept of the case to meet) is determinative of the third question, the
meaning of ""any other proceedings"".

 

19.              I shall address each in turn. 

 

The Beneficiary of the Right

 

20.              In my view, s. 13  is not being given in
this case a retrospective effect. As I have indicated earlier, s. 13 
guarantees the right not to have a person's previous testimony used to
incriminate him or her in other proceedings. That right came into force on
April 17, 1982, the date of the coming into force of the Charter .
However, given the nature and purpose of the right, it inures to an individual
at the moment an attempt is made to utilize previous testimony to incriminate
him or her. The time at which the previous testimony was given is irrelevant
for the purpose of determining who may or may not claim the benefit of s. 13 .
As of April 17, 1982, all persons acquired the right not to have evidence
previously given used to incriminate them. The protection accorded by the right
is related not to the moment the testimony is given, but to the moment at which
an attempt is made to use that evidence in an incriminating fashion.

 

21.              The fact of having given previous
testimony is no more than a requisite for the operation of s. 13 . To quote
Martin J.A. in R. v. Antoine (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at pp. 102‑03:

 

An enactment does not,
however, operate retrospectively because a part of the requisites for its
operation is drawn from a time antecedent to its coming into force, nor because
it takes into account past events: see R. v. Johnston (1977), 34 C.C.C.
(2d) 325, [1977] 2 W.W.R. 613, 37 C.R.N.S. 234; affirmed [1978] 2 S.C.R. 391,
39 C.C.C. (2d) 479n, [1978] 2 W.W.R. 478 (S.C.C.); R. v. Negridge
(1980), 54 C.C.C. (2d) 304, 17 C.R. (3d) 14, 6 M.V.R. 255 (Ont. C.A.).

 

22.              As section 13 guarantees the right of a
person against self‑incrimination, rather than the rights of a witness
giving testimony, it inures to an individual only at the moment an attempt is
made to use previous testimony to incriminate its author. Since in this case
the attempt to use Dubois' previous testimony occurred after the coming into
force of the Charter , there arises here no issue of retrospectivity.

 

23.              The Crown has argued that the right
expressed in s. 13 accrues only to an individual who is a ""witness"",
that the right is given ""to an individual qua witness and not qua
accused"". The Crown seeks support for this position in the fact that the
section speaks in the present tense. The protection, it is argued, is given to
""a witness who testifies and not to a witness who has testified"".
That argument was answered in part by Kerans J.A. of the Alberta Court of
Appeal in the present case reported at (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 453 where he
stated at p. 455: 

 

It is argued correctly for
the Crown that, on the day on which the Charter  came into force, the accused
was a witness who had testified, and not a witness who was yet to testify. But
the expression `a witness who testifies' was inserted in the Charter  in
substitution of the draft words `a witness...when compelled to testify' in
order to remove doubt whether a technically voluntary witness, such as an
accused, can assert the protection of the section. The words `who testifies'
merely clarify that `witness' includes a voluntary witness: see the analysis by
Grotsky J. in R. v. Staranchuk (1982), 3 C.C.C. (3d) 138, [1983] 2
W.W.R. 145, 45 C.B.R. (N.S.) 200 (overruled on other grounds 8 C.C.C. (3d) 150,
3 D.L.R. (4th) 574, [1983] 6 W.W.R. 729). I therefore accept the contention for
the accused that the right to prevent incriminating use of previous testimony
extends to all witnesses, and whenever they testify.

 

24.              Section 13, unlike s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , does not require any objection on the part of the person
giving the testimony, nor does it refer to any compulsion to answer. Indeed, as
noted by Kerans J.A. in the passage quoted above, the ""compulsion to
answer"" requirement, which was set forth in a previous draft of s. 13 , was
ultimately removed from the final version of the section. Thus, the legislative
history of the provision indicates that "" `witness' includes a
voluntary witness"".

 

25.              Moreover, given the nature and purpose of
the right, which is essentially protection against self‑incrimination,
the issue of whether the testimony was compulsory or voluntary at the moment it
was given is largely irrelevant. The focus of the right is on the second proceedings,
the time at which the previous testimony is sought to be used, rather than the
time at which it is given.

 

26.              For these reasons, s. 13, in my view,
applies as much to testimony voluntarily given by an accused as to testimony given
by a witness under compulsion.

 

27.              The Crown has relied upon the case of Marcoux
v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 763, in support of its position. In that
case, Dickson J., (as he then was), speaking for the Court, stated that the
privilege against self‑incrimination extended to the accused ""qua
witness and not qua accused"". However, in that case Dickson J. was
delineating the scope of the privilege in relation to a refusal by a suspect to
participate in an identification line‑up and thus contrasting testimonial
compulsion with other forms of compulsion. He stated, at pp. 768‑69:


 

The privilege,
historically and comprehensively analyzed in 8 Wigmore on Evidence
(McNaughton revision 1961) art. 2250, pp. 284 et seq., developed in revulsion
from the system of interrogation practised in the old ecclesiastical courts and
the Star Chamber, i.e. summoning a person, without giving him warning of
the charge against him, and examining him on oath. The general rule evolved
that no one was bound to answer any question if the answer would tend to expose
him to a criminal charge. As applied to witnesses generally, the privilege must
be expressly claimed by the witness when the question is put to him in the
witness box, Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10, s. 5. As
applied to an accused, the privilege is the right to stand mute. An accused
cannot be asked, much less compelled, to enter the witness box or to answer
incriminating questions. If he chooses to testify, the protective shield, of course,
disappears. In short, the privilege extends to the accused qua witness
and not qua accused, it is concerned with testimonial compulsion
specifically and not with compulsion generally ....

 

28.              Marcoux thus stands for the proposition
that the protection against self‑incrimination is not functionally
operative at the pre‑trial stage of a police line‑up. It in no way
shores up the argument advanced by the Crown.

 

29.              My view, therefore, is that the protection
of s. 13  operates at the second proceedings; consequently the time at
which the previous testimony was given and the question of whether it was given
voluntarily or under compulsion are irrelevant. I am strengthened in this view
by a brief analysis of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  in relation to
s. 13  of the Charter . 

 

30.              At common law, a witness had the privilege
of refusing to answer a question where the answer would tend to criminate him
or her. That common law privilege has been abolished by s. 5(1)  of the Canada
Evidence Act . Section 5(2) of the Act provides, however, that:

 

                   (2)
Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer ... although the
witness is ... compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or
receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal
proceeding against him thereafter taking place ....

 

31.              This limited form of protection against
self‑incrimination clearly has no application to the proceedings in which
the testimony is taken and applies only to subsequent proceedings (Di Iorio
v. Warden of the Montreal Jail, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 152 at pp. 219‑20).
It applies, in other words, in subsequent proceedings in which the former
witness has become the accused. Hence section 5(2) has to some extent shifted
the focus of the protection against self‑incrimination from the
proceedings in which the testimony is given to subsequent proceedings in which
the witness has become the accused.

 

32.              The focus on the subsequent proceedings is
even more pronounced in s. 13  of the Charter , which does not refer to
any compulsion to answer at the time of the testimony nor to any objection to
answer on the part of the accused. Consequently, although s. 13  refers to
""A witness who testifies"", it is, like its predecessor, designed to
be operative and to protect the interests of the person in the subsequent
proceedings. Indeed, it is even clearer in s. 13  that the right functions at
the level of the ""other proceedings"".

 

33.              For these reasons, the Crown cannot, in my
view, succeed in this portion of its argument.

 

Incriminating Evidence

 

34.              The wording of the section refers twice to
the notion of incrimination. According to the Crown, this means that the
evidence in issue must, (1) have been incriminating in the first proceedings in
which it was given, and (2) be incriminating in the second proceedings where the
Crown attempts to use it. 

 

35.              Although a literal reading of the section
supports the position of the Crown, I am nevertheless of the view that s. 13 
does not require that the incriminating character of the evidence be evaluated in
the first proceedings as well as in the second. Indeed, the literal approach
defeats the nature and purpose of the section and furthermore leads to
absurdity. When such is the case, the literal approach should not prevail
unless the language used is of ""absolute intractability"", which is
not the case here. The comments of Anglin J. in Regina Public School
District v. Gratton Separate School District (1915), 50 S.C.R. 589, at p.
624 are, in my view, appropriate to the Charter  context:

 

Only `absolute
intractability of the language used' can justify a construction which defeats
what is clearly the main object of a statute.

 

                                                                    ...

 

It would be contrary to
sound construction to permit the use of a term not altogether apt to defeat the
intention of the legislature, which must not be assumed to have foreseen every
result that may accrue from the use of a particular word.

 

This Court has already adopted a purposive approach in the context of
the Charter 's interpretation: see Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984]
2 S.C.R. 145; R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295. As
elaborated in the preceding pages of this judgment, the purpose of the section
indicates that the only moment in time which is relevant to the assessment of
the incriminating nature of the evidence is the second proceedings.

 

36.              As regards absurdity, in a great many
cases, whether evidence is incriminating or not can only be properly assessed
at the time it is being used in the subsequent proceedings, at the time when
the Crown seeks to make use of the evidence. How, for example, could one assess
the incriminating nature of evidence at the first proceedings, when the witness
is not necessarily the accused and when the crime for which the witness may
subsequently be charged may not even yet have been committed.

 

37.              The decision of this Court in Piché v.
The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 23, presents additional support for the view that
the incriminating nature of the evidence must be evaluated in the second
proceedings. In that case, a majority of this Court held that the admission in
evidence of statements made by an accused to persons in authority, whether
inculpatory or exculpatory at the time they were made, was governed by the same
considerations that is, by reference to the use which the Crown sought to make
of it rather than by its content. 

 

38.              In the context of s. 13 , the use which the
Crown seeks to make of the evidence can only be ascertained at the time of the
second proceedings.

 

39.              For all of these reasons, I would reject
the Crown's argument that the evidence in issue must be incriminating in both
the first and second proceedings.

 

40.              I am also of the view that any evidence
the Crown tenders as part of its case against an accused is, for the purpose of
s. 13 , incriminating evidence. The Crown tenders evidence to support its case
and obtain a conviction; it knows best what is incriminating. In a sense, the
Crown could be said to be estopped from arguing that the evidence it tenders to
that end is not incriminating. Since in this case, the Crown is tendering the
evidence as part of its case, which clearly comes within the meaning of
""used to incriminate"", we need not here address the question of
whether those words include resort to the previous testimony for the purpose of
cross‑examining the accused, were the latter to choose to take the stand
again in his or her own defence.

 

Any Other Proceedings

 

41.              Having established that s. 13  is a form of
protection against self‑incrimination, it is still necessary to consider
whether this implies that an accused who has chosen to testify should be
protected in a retrial of the same offence or one included therein.

 

42.              I do not see how the evidence given by the
accused to meet the case as it was in the first trial could become part of the
Crown's case against the accused in the second trial, without being in
violation of s. 11 (d), and to a lesser extent of s. 11 (c). For,
the accused is being conscripted to help the Crown in discharging its
burden of a case to meet, and is thereby denied his or her right to
stand mute until a case has been made out. 

 

43.              To allow the prosecution to use, as part
of its case, the accused's previous testimony would, in effect, allow the Crown
to do indirectly what it is estopped from doing directly by s. 11 (c), i.e.
to compel the accused to testify. It would also permit an indirect violation of
the right of the accused to be presumed innocent and remain silent until proven
guilty by the prosecution, as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .
Our constitutional Charter  must be construed as a system where
""Every component contributes to the meaning as a whole, and the whole
gives meaning to its parts"" (P. A. Côté writing about statutory
interpretation in The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (1984), at
p. 236). The courts must interpret each section of the Charter  in
relation to the others (see, for example, R. v. Carson (1983), 20 M.V.R.
54 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Konechny, [1984] 2 W.W.R. 481 (B.C.C.A.); Reference
re Education Act of Ontario and Minority Language Education Rights (1984),
47 O.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.); R. v. Antoine, supra). To hold that a new
trial is not ""any other proceedings"" within the meaning of s. 13 
would in fact authorize an interpretation of a Charter  right which would
imply a violation of another Charter  right. Such a result should be
avoided.

 

44.              A retrial of the same offence or one
included therein, ordered by a court of appeal, is therefore ""other
proceedings"" within the meaning of s. 13 .

 

45.              Concern has been expressed as regards the
logical extension of this reasoning to the admissibility of evidence given by
an accused at the preliminary inquiry under s. 469  of the Criminal Code .
The matter is not raised on this appeal. But, even assuming without deciding
that a preliminary inquiry is another proceeding, the question then to be
addressed is whether s. 469  would be, under s. 1  of the Charter , an
unreasonable limit to the protections afforded by s. 13 . Relevant to this
determination would, amongst other considerations, be the nature of the
jeopardy in which an accused is placed, at that stage, if he chooses not to
testify at the preliminary to rebut the ""prima facie case"". 

 

46.              Because of the Crown's great reliance on
this Court's endorsement of Johnson J.A.'s remarks in R. v. Brown (No. 2),
supra, I feel something must be said on the matter before concluding.
That was a case where the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal (1963), 40 C.R.
90 had found that when a new trial is ordered because the first trial was a
mistrial, the accused's evidence given at the first trial is not admissible in
evidence against him at the second trial. Johnson J.A. dissented, and said that
it was admissible. This Court reversed the Court of Appeal and adopted Johnson
J.A.'s reasons. With respect, Johnson J.A.'s ratio decidendi is
uncertain. It is difficult to ascertain to what extent the judge's dissent is
dependent upon the fact that the accused did not object to answer, assuming he
could have under the law, thereby bringing himself within the protection
afforded by s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act . The decision in Brown
would not be an impediment to what I find is the proper construction of s. 13 
of the Charter  were it not for the following passage in Johnson J.A.'s
reasons, at p. 101:

 

This privilege may be
waived, and, of course, waiver takes place when a witness voluntarily enters
the witness‑box and, without claiming the protection afforded by s. 5(2) 
of the Canada Evidence Act , gives evidence of a criminating nature. In Chambers
v. Chambers (No. 2), [(1960), 31 W.W.R. 399], the court held that the
privilege once waived could be reclaimed in the second trial between the same
parties. Applying that rule to the present case, it is obvious that, because
the appellant had waived the privilege of testifying at his first trial, he
cannot be compelled by the Crown to enter the witness‑box and give the
same evidence at the second. But it is said that admitting this evidence in
the way it was done here amounts to calling the accused as a Crown witness without
allowing him the right of refusing to testify. This argument is best answered
in the words of Lord Campbell C.J. in the Regina v. Scott case, supra,
p. 59. Referring to the accused, his Lordship says:

 

                   ""The
accusation of himself was an accomplished fact, and at the trial he was not
called upon to accuse himself. The maxim relied upon (nemo tenetur seipsum
accusare) applies to the time when the question is put, not to the use
which the prosecutor seeks to make of the answer when the answer has been given.""

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

47.              The Scott case (R. v. Scott
(1856), Dears. & B. 47, 169 E.R. 909) concerns a bankrupt who was, under
the laws of England, bound by statute to answer all questions touching matters
relating to his trade dealings. He did so and was subsequently prosecuted under
the same statute for having mutilated his business book and records. This was a
clear statutory exception to the protection given under the common law maxim
""nemo tenetur seipsum accusare"". In his judgment, Lord
Campbell C.J. said, at p. 59: 

 

Finally, the defendant's
counsel relies upon the great maxim of English law ""nemo tenetur se
ipsum accusare."" So undoubtedly says the common law of England. But
Parliament may take away this privilege, and enact that a party may be bound to
accuse himself; that is, that he must answer questions by answering which he
may be criminated. This Act of Parliament, 12 & 13 Vict. c. 106, creates
felonies and misdemeanors, and compels the bankrupt to answer questions which
may shew that he has been guilty of some of those felonies or misdemeanors. The
maxim of the common law therefore has been overruled by the Legislature, and
the defendant has been actually compelled to give and has given answers,
shewing that he is guilty of the misdemeanor with which he is charged. The
accusation of himself was an accomplished fact, and at the trial he was not
called upon to accuse himself.

 

It is immediately after having said this, that his Lordship added the
passage later quoted by Johnson J.A.,

 

The maxim relied upon
applies to the time when the question is put, not to the use which the
prosecutor seeks to make of the answer when the answer has been given.

 

48.              Of no little importance when considering
the meaning of those words, are those immediately following:

 

If the party has been
unlawfully compelled to answer the question, he shall be protected against any
prejudice from the answer thus illegally extorted; but a similar protection
cannot be demanded where the question was lawful and the party examined was
bound by law to answer it.

 

49.              Therefore, the reference by Lord Campbell
C.J. to the time the maxim applies, is in relation to the legality of
compelling the answer. It has, with respect, nothing to do with, and is not an
answer, let alone the best answer, to the question phrased by Johnson J.A., i.e.,
whether admitting the evidence in the Brown case in the way it was being
done then amounts to calling the accused as a Crown witness without allowing
him or her the right of refusing to testify.

 

50.              In any event, whatever may have been the
ultimate ratio decidendi of the decision of this Court in R. v. Brown
(No. 2), supra, that decision can be distinguished from the present
case on many grounds. First, Brown was rendered prior to the coming into
force of the Charter  and the new right which it sets forth in s. 13 .
Secondly, it is difficult to ascertain to what extent Johnson J.A.'s dissent,
adopted ""in substance"" by this Court, is dependent upon the fact that
the accused did not object to answer, thereby failing to bring himself within
the protection afforded by s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act , assuming
of course that the protection of the section is available to an accused
testifying in his own defence. 

 

51.              In any event, had the common law maxim of
""nemo tenetur seipsum accusare"" and s. 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act  been interpreted in the light of the Charter , as they
now must be, I would venture to suggest that a different result may well have
ensued in R. v. Brown (No. 2), supra.

 

52.              Although the constitutionality of s. 5(2) 
of the Canada Evidence Act  was not in issue in the case at bar, it is
clear that it must now be interpreted in the light of the Charter  and,
if it is found to be inconsistent therewith, it will be of no force or effect
to the extent of the inconsistency.

 

53.              For these reasons, the protection of s.
13 , in my view, covers a retrial.

 

Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 

 

54.              Both parties to this appeal, when
addressing the applicability of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , dealt with the adduction of the testimony as if it were an ordinary
error of law and argued pro and con the issue as to whether or not it caused a
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. No one addressed the question of
the relationship, if any, between a Charter  violation and the available
remedy under s. 24  of the Charter  on the one hand, and the proviso of s.
613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  on the other. This important
question should be left to be decided in another case. Assuming without
deciding that s. 613(1) (b)(iii) can apply to a Charter  violation
and to a remedy under s. 24 , given the nature of the evidence, I am of the view
that this would not, in any event, be a proper case for applying the proviso.

 

55.              I would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and order a new trial. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

56.              McIntyre
J. (dissenting)‑‑This appeal in‑ volves, for
the first time in this Court, consideration of the effect of s. 13  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . It is the sole issue raised before us.

 

57.              The facts may be simply stated. The
appellant was charged in an indictment which charged that he:

 

...at Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, on or about the 6th
day of March, A.D. 1980, did unlawfully kill Bruno Williams and did thereby
commit second degree murder, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

The appellant gave evidence at his trial and was convicted. Although he
was represented by counsel he did not in giving his evidence, nor in the cross‑examination,
object to any questions. Accordingly, the provisions of s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  did not come into play to protect him against any later use of
his evidence in a criminal trial. He appealed his conviction. The Court of
Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial: (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d)
494. The Court of Appeal allowed the appellant's appeal on the basis of
misdirection or non‑ direction on the defences raised by the appellant's
evidence. At the new trial, the Crown read in as part of its case the evidence
the appellant had given at his earlier trial. This evidence consisted of sixty
pages of transcript and contained an admission that he, the appellant, had
killed the deceased, alleging certain circumstances in justification. The
appellant objected to this evidence being received. He based his objection on
s. 13  of the Charter . The appellant called no evidence at his second
trial and was convicted. A further appeal was taken. The Court of Appeal
(Laycraft C.J.A., Harradence and Kerans JJ.A.) unanimously dismissed the
appeal: (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 453, 9 C.R.R. 61, 39 C.R. (3d) 281, 31 Alta.
L.R. (2d) 16, 8 D.L.R. (4th) 589, 51 A.R. 210, [1984] 3 W.W.R. 594.

 

58.              The appellant alleges that the Court of
Appeal erred in holding the evidence given by the appellant at his earlier
trial was receivable at the second trial as part of the Crown's case. The issue
before the Court may be stated in these terms: Where a court of appeal quashes
a conviction and orders a new trial, does s. 13  of the Charter  preclude
the admission at the second trial of the evidence given by the accused at his
first trial? 

 

59.              Kerans J.A., for the unanimous Court of
Appeal, held inter alia: the appellant was at the time of the second
trial a witness who had testified in a proceeding and therefore s. 13  of the Charter 
was applicable to the accused; the evidence of the accused on his first trial
was used to incriminate him on the second; no question of retrospectivity was
involved in applying s. 13  to this case. He concluded, however, that s. 13  of
the Charter  could provide no protection to the appellant because the
second trial was not ""any other proceedings"" within the meaning of
the section. I am in agreement with the conclusion reached by Kerans J.A. and
in general terms with his reasons. I am led to this conclusion, however, by a
different approach.

 

60.              The appellant contended that the second
trial was another proceeding under s. 13  of the Charter . The effect of
the section would therefore be to exclude the evidence from the second trial.
The principal argument advanced for the Crown was that s. 13  had no application
in the case at bar because the second trial was not another proceeding. It could
not therefore be applied to alter the law which has heretofore provided for the
admissibility of such evidence.

 

61.              It has long been settled that relevant out
of court statements made by a party to the proceedings would be received in
evidence against him but not generally for him. A qualification to this rule
required that if the statement had been made to a person in authority it would
be admitted only if shown to be voluntary. To protect against self‑incrimination,
the common law recognized a right to object to incriminating questions in
judicial and quasi‑judicial matters. This common law right was abolished
by s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10. This
section provides that, where a witness objects to a question upon the ground
that the answer might tend to incriminate him or to establish liability in a
civil proceeding and if it is a question which but for the passage of s. 5  of
the Canada Evidence Act  he would not have been compellable to answer,
the answer which he was required to make could not be used or received in
evidence against him in any criminal trial or other criminal proceedings. 

 

62.              Prior to the adoption of the new Canadian
constitution which included the Charter  the evidence given by the
appellant on his first trial would have been receivable as part of the Crown's
case in the second trial. Any doubts on this point were settled in this Court
in R. v. Brown (No. 2) (1963), 40 C.R. 105. This case involved an appeal
from the Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories (1963), 40 C.R. 90 (Smith
C.J., Porter, Johnson, Parker and Kane JJ.A.) Smith C.J. writing for the
majority (Smith C.J., Porter and Kane JJ.A.), had held that when a new trial is
ordered because the first trial was a mistrial the evidence of the accused
given at the first trial is not admissible against him at his second trial. He
recognized that there was much authority for the admission in judicial
proceedings of a prior statement by an accused made under oath. He noted,
however, that none of the authorities dealt with the precise question before
us, that is, the admissibility against an accused at his second trial of the
evidence he had given at his first trial. He said, at pp. 96‑97:

 

                   A new
trial in the facts of this case to me means a fresh trial and not a trial at
which the evidence before the judge and jury consists, in part, of oral
evidence and, in part, the evidence of the accused given at the first trial.

 

                   The
evidence of the appellant given at the first trial was given when he was
charged with murder. He saw fit at that time to enter the witness‑box and
be examined and cross‑examined. He did not give evidence at the second
trial when he was charged with manslaughter. He was not a compellable witness either
at the first trial or the second trial but, nevertheless, he found admitted
against him in the second trial upon the charge of manslaughter the evidence he
had voluntarily given at the first trial when he was charged with murder. The
result, it appears to me, is that the Crown has accomplished indirectly what it
cannot do directly, namely, to compel the accused person to give evidence
against himself. I appreciate that this argument was put forth unsuccessfully
in cases such as Regina v. Erdheim, [[1896] 2 Q.B. 260]; Regina v.
Bird, [(1898), 79 L.T. 359], and Rex v. Boyle, [(1904), 20 T.L.R.
192]. But in none of these cases was the trial a new trial. 

 

He concluded that the evidence could not be received on a new trial.

 

63.              Johnson J.A., with whom Parker J.A.
agreed, dissented on this point. He considered that evidence given by an
accused upon a former occasion is admissible against him. He relied for this
proposition on Tass v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 103, and R. v. Coote
(1873), L.R. 4 P.C. 599, and he quoted the words of Sir Robert Collier giving
judgment of the Privy Council, at p. 607, in the Coote case, where he
stated the governing rule in these terms:

 

                   From
these cases, to which others might be added, it results, in their Lordships'
opinion, that the depositions on Oath of a Witness legally taken are evidence
against him, should he be subsequently tried on a criminal charge, except so
much of them as consist of answers to questions to which he has objected as
tending to criminate him, but which he has been improperly compelled to answer.
The exception depends upon the principle `nemo tenetur seipsum accusare,'
but does not apply to answers given without objection, which are to be deemed
voluntary.

 

Johnson J.A., referring to the words quoted above, then stated the
ground of his dissent in these terms (at p. 100):

 

                   That
case, and others referred to, deal with evidence given either in other
proceedings or in proceedings prior to trial, and it is argued that those cases
do not apply where the evidence taken at a first trial is sought to be used at
a second trial of the same offence.

 

Reviewing the authorities dealing with the point, he expressed the view
that the privilege against self‑incrimination could be waived and that
when a witness voluntarily gave evidence in circumstances which did not invoke
the provisions of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  he had waived the
privilege. Recognizing that the waived privilege could be reclaimed on his
second trial, he found it obvious that the appellant could not be compelled to
give evidence at the second trial. However, to the argument that admitting the
evidence from the first trial amounted to compelling the accused to testify, he
cited the words of Lord Campbell C.J. in R. v. Scott (1856), Dears.
& B. 47, 169 E.R. 909, at p. 59:

 

The accusation of himself
was an accomplished fact, and at the trial he was not called upon to accuse
himself. The maxim relied upon [nemo tenetur seipsum accusare] applies
to the time when the question is put, not to the use which the prosecutor seeks
to make of the answer when the answer has been given.

 

He rejected the argument that the evidence given at the first trial was
not voluntary insofar as it consisted of answers adduced in cross‑examination,
and he relied on R. v. Erdheim, [1896] 2 Q.B. 260, at p. 267, where Lord
Russell C.J. said:

 

As to the objection that
the statements were not voluntary, it was held that such an objection does not
apply to a lawful examination in the course of a judicial proceeding... 

 

 

and added (at p. 103):

 

It is difficult to see
logic in saying that although the accused may voluntarily give evidence in his
own behalf, his evidence assumes the nature of an admission or confession given
under compulsion when cross‑examination begins.

 

64.              Parker J.A. in a short judgment concurring
with Johnson J.A. added this comment (at p. 104):

 

                   The
essence of the matter is that the accused is not being called upon to testify
against himself but that, having voluntarily made a statement under oath in a
judicial proceeding, that statement may be used as evidence against him in any
other judicial proceeding in the same manner as any other voluntary statement
which he may have made. If one has given evidence under oath at a trial, one
can hardly be heard to complain when this evidence is put forward by an
opposite party in a later proceeding.

 

65.              It may be observed that this passage is
reproduced in Kaufman, The Admissibility of Confessions (3rd ed. 1979),
at p. 361. While the learned author acknowledged that it was an attractive
point of view and probably correct, he expressed concern that the Crown was
doing indirectly what it could not do directly. He noted, however, that the
dissent of Johnson J.A. had been accepted in the Supreme Court of Canada in a
very short judgment:

 

                   For the
reasons given by Mr. Justice Johnson, of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest
Territories, with whom we substantially agree, the appeal is allowed and
the conviction restored. The record is to be returned to the Court of Appeal
for the Northwest Territories to adjudicate upon the question of sentence.

 

and stated:

 

                   It
would be foolish to suggest that this judgment, brief though it is, does not
state the law as it now exists in Canada.

 

He was concerned, as is Lamer J., at the use by the court of the word
""substantially"" in its expression of agreement with Johnson J.A. In
my view that word has little, if any, significance here. Whatever qualification
it may express, the judgment involves a clear endorsement of the ratio of
Johnson J.A. and clearly states the law as it was in pre‑Charter  days.
It now remains to consider whether the Charter  has changed the law in
this respect.

 

66.              Two questions must be answered. Does
section 13 of the Charter  apply in the facts of this case and, if it
does, would it be effective to protect the appellant from the use of his
earlier evidence in his second trial? 

 

67.              I have no difficulty with the first
question. The first trial of the appellant took place before the introduction
of the Charter . Nevertheless, I agree with my brother Lamer that there
is no issue of retrospectivity in this case. All persons who come within the
terms of s. 13  of the Charter  acquired the right to its protection with
the adoption of the Charter  on April 17, 1982. The time at which the evidence
in question was given is of no significance. Any protection from s. 13  will
apply when it is sought to introduce the challenged evidence. I am also in
agreement with Lamer J. that the word ""witness"" in s. 13  includes and
applies to an accused who has given evidence in his own trial. The
determination of whether the evidence is incriminating must be made at the time
when it is tendered. I would add that I have no difficulty with the proposition
that the evidence in question here is incriminating and that the purpose of the
Crown in introducing it at the second trial as part of the Crown's case was to
incriminate the appellant.

 

68.              In order to determine whether s. 13 
protects the appellant from the use of his earlier evidence at his second trial
a general consideration of the impact of s. 13  is necessary. A comparison of s.
13  of the Charter  with s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act 
provides a useful starting point.

 

69.              Section 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act 
and s. 13  of the Charter  are set out hereunder:

 

Incriminating Questions

 

                   5. (1) ...

 

                   (2)
Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground
that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his
liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person,
and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness
would therefore have been excused from answering such question, then although
the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial Act,
compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in
evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding
against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in
the giving of such evidence.

 

Self‑crimination

 

                   13. A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have
any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any
other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of
contradictory evidence. 

 

A comparison of the two provisions shows that s. 13  of the Charter 
has indeed effected a major change in the law giving much wider protection
against self‑incrimination than s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act .
As earlier noted, the common law rule which allowed a witness to claim
privilege in respect of any evidence which would expose him to the risk of
criminal conviction or the imposition of penalties or forfeitures (see Phipson
on Evidence (13th ed. 1982), p. 314, para. 15‑36) was repealed by the
section. In place of the old rule, s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act 
requires an answer to an incriminating question but provides a safeguard
against its future use if an objection was made. Section 13  of the Charter 
provides a much wider protection. In the clearest terms it gives the right to a
witness who testifies in any proceeding not to have any incriminating evidence
so given used to incriminate him in any other proceedings. This is a protection
going far beyond that accorded by s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act . It
does not depend on any objection made by the witness giving the evidence. It is
applicable and effective without invocation, and even where the witness in
question is unaware of his rights. It is not limited to a question in respect
of which a witness would have been entitled to refuse to answer at common law
and its prohibition against the use of incriminating evidence is not limited to
criminal proceedings. It confers a right against incrimination by the use of
evidence given in one proceeding in any other proceedings.

 

70.              It would follow then that this appellant
would be entitled to succeed if the new trial is another proceeding. If,
however, it is not another proceeding, but merely part of the proceedings on
one indictment brought by the Crown, then s. 13  of the Charter  on its
own terms would not apply.

 

71.              What meaning should be attributed to the
words ""other proceedings"" in s. 13  of the Charter ? The word
""proceedings"", while of common usage, is one of uncertain and
variable meaning. A search through the texts and authorities, including legal
dictionaries, does little more than confirm this proposition. The word has been
used in both singular and plural form. It has frequently been used to describe
an action or another cause or matter or a step in an action. Proceedings have
been said to be still pending ""if a final judgment is not satisfied or
performed"": see Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed. 1982), vol. 37,
p. 30, para. 24. Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), p. 1083, offers
the same variety of definitions as do such case authorities as have been
considered. In the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Eddy v. Stewart,
[1932] 3 W.W.R. 71, in a case involving the construction of ss. 5 and 6 of the Debt
Adjustment Act, 1932 (Sask.), c. 51, and in relation to a foreclosure
action, Martin J. A. said, at p. 74: 

 

                   Counsel
for the plaintiff contended that the word ""proceeding"" in sec. 6
means ""action;"" while counsel for the defendant argued that the word
embraced each step in an action. The word ""proceeding,"" in its
derivative sense, means, according to Murray's English Dictionary, vol.
7, at p. 1407, ""the action of going onward; advance, onward movement or
course."" In its legal sense, it includes the form in which actions are
brought and defended; the manner of intervening in suits and of conducting
them; it is sometimes used as equivalent to and interchangeable with the word
""action,"" and it is also applied to any step in an action. From the
authorities it is clear that the word may be differently construed in different
Acts: Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary, vol. 3, pp. 1561 et seq.; Ratteau
v. Ball (1914) 47 N.S.R. 488, 15 D.L.R. 574‑‑Townshend, C.J.,
at p. 576.

 

                   The
meaning of the word ""proceeding,"" therefore, as used in secs. 5 and 6
of the statute, must be gathered from the context.

 

I agree with that learned judge and consider that the meaning to be
attributed to the words ""other proceedings"" in s. 13  of the Charter 
must be gathered from the context.

 

72.              The appellant contends for an
interpretation which would limit the word ""proceeding"" to a step in
the action with the result that the new trial would be another proceeding and,
therefore, s. 13  of the Charter  would prevent the admission at the
second trial of the evidence given at the first. The logical extension of this
argument would, it seems to me, mean that the judicial process would be
fragmented with the result that the preliminary hearing of an indictable
offence would also be another proceeding, evidence from which would be excluded
from the trial. The appeal would also be a separate proceeding, as would any
motions to quash or otherwise seek interlocutory relief and any evidence,
probably in affidavit form, in support of such interlocutory motions would not
be available for consideration at the trial or other fragment of the
proceedings. This would do such violence to the judicial process that it would,
in my opinion, be unreasonable to accept such a construction of the Charter .

 

73.              The respondent contends for an
interpretation which would attribute a broader meaning to the words in s. 13 
that would include all those judicial steps required by law to be taken in
effecting a lawful resolution of the issues raised by the charge between the
Crown and the accused. This would mean, of course, if accepted, that s. 13  of
the Charter  would not apply since the new trial would not be another
proceeding. 

 

74.              This, in my view, is the preferable
construction of s. 13  of the Charter . To begin with, s. 13  protects the
accused from evidence in other proceedings. The word ""other"" must
have some meaning. It must, in my view, mean proceedings other than the one in
which the evidence sought to be excluded was given. Why would the word
""other"" be employed if the protection was to be provided for all
proceedings? The use of the word ""other"" suggests a reference to
proceedings involving other issues and other parties and supports the Crown
position. Secondly, and of more importance, is the proposition that, while s.
13  of the Charter  was clearly intended to provide, and does provide, a
wider protection against self‑incrimination than that provided by s. 5(2) 
of the Canada Evidence Act , it was not nor could it be asserted in
argument that either s. 13  of the Charter  or s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  could operate to protect against self‑incrimination
respecting what was said by the accused at his own trial. Since the second
trial in the case at bar is on the same indictment, between the same parties,
and raising precisely the same issues, it cannot on a fair reading of s. 13  of
the Charter  be considered as another proceeding.

 

75.              The facts of this case illustrate the
reasonableness of this interpretation. The appellant argues that the Crown
gains an advantage by being able to use his testimony in the later trial. He
says, in effect: ""I was convicted because the trial judge did not deal
correctly with my evidence. If he had, I would have been acquitted."" The Court
of Appeal agrees to the extent that the evidence was not correctly dealt with
and quashes the conviction, sending the matter back for a new trial. The
appellant, having obtained the relief he sought, i.e. the new trial,
then seeks to insulate the jury from his former evidence although he relied
upon it at trial and it was the basis on which he procured his new trial. I
agree that he may not be called upon to give evidence at his new trial; he may
stand silent as the law provides but, in my opinion, consistent with the
general rules of evidence long applicable in such cases, and already mentioned,
the Crown is entitled in this step of the same proceedings to introduce the
past voluntary statements of the accused in evidence and s. 13  of the Charter 
does not prevent this step. The appellant, a person charged with an offence, is
entitled to a trial according to law which will lead to a judicial resolution
of all issues arising out of the charge as between him and the Crown. The
appellate procedures provided by law are designed to protect him in that right,
and where the issues arising between the Crown and the appellant on the charge
are not lawfully dealt with at a first trial the appellate court exists to
direct the new trial for the lawful resolution of the issues raised in the
proceedings. 

 

76.              Canadian courts have considered this
problem and with one exception have favoured the Crown's position on this
argument. In R. v. Wilson (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 481, Honey Co. Ct. J.
held that where an accused testified at his trial, which resulted in a
mistrial, s. 13  of the Charter  applied to prevent his evidence given at
his first trial from being admitted at his retrial. The question of the meaning
of the words ""other proceedings"" does not appear to have been argued
before him.

 

77.              In R. v. Sophonow (No. 1) (1983), 6
C.C.C. (3d) 394, Scollin J. disagreed with Honey Co. Ct. J. in Wilson, supra,
saying, at pp. 395‑96:

 

                   However,
I am not satisfied that s. 13  may properly be invoked in this case. In this
respect I part company with the view expressed in R. v. Wilson, supra.
There is no doubt that a second trial is, by its nature, a
""subsequent"" proceeding. In my view, it is not, however, an
""other"" proceeding as contemplated by s. 13 . I consider that the
sense, the justification and the thrust of s. 13  is to give generous protection
to the search for truth by guaranteeing that a witness who comes forward to
testify in one proceeding, and in the course of testifying truly, involves himself
in some incriminating conduct, is not exposed to the use of that testimony
itself in some other proceeding either then or later pending against
him, subject only to the exception provided in s. 13 . This rationale of
s. 13  has no application to the accused when, as in this case, he testifies in
his own defence. The proceedings here are proceedings on the very same
indictment against the very same accused and do not fall within the words
""any other proceedings"" as contemplated by s. 13 .

 

An appeal was taken to the Manitoba Court of Appeal (1983), 12 C.C.C.
(3d) 272, and allowed on another point, but the position taken by Scollin J. at
trial was approved by the judges of that court.

 

78.              The same view was taken by Legg J. in R.
v. Mannion (1984), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 161 in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench,
where he said, at p. 164:

 

                   It is
also my view that s. 13  of the Charter  has no application in the case at bar.
That section envisages two separate proceedings in which the evidence in one
proceeding is used in the other. This is a retrial of a charge of rape after a
new trial was ordered. [Here reference was made to R. v. Brown (No. 2)
(1963), 40 C.R. 90.]

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   This
case together with the fact that a new trial commences with the same indictment
unless otherwise ordered leads me to the conclusion that the first trial and
the second trial are one and the same proceeding. In the instant case, the
trial is proceeding on the same indictment as was used in the first trial. 

 

An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on this point but
allowed on another issue (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 503. The case has been heard
and judgment reserved in this Court.

 

79.              In R. v. Yakeleya (1985), 20 C.C.C.
(3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), Martin J.A., speaking for the court, dealt with a case
where the evidence given at the defendant's preliminary hearing was admitted on
his trial. He said (at p. 195):

 

                   We are
all of the view that the appellant's trial did not constitute ""other
proceedings"" in relation to the appellant's preliminary hearing on the
same charge. The preliminary hearing and the trial on the same charge are part
of the same proceedings: see R. v. Sophonow (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 272
at pp. 277 and 332, 11 D.L.R. (4th) 24, 29 Man. R. (2d) 1.

 

Judgment in the Court of Appeal in the case at bar was, of course, to
the same effect.

 

80.              What then, it may be asked, is the purpose
of s. 13  of the Charter ? In answer to this question we can again
refer to the law as it stood before the Charter  was adopted. Section
5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  and various provincial evidence acts
which were generally similar in effect provided the protection against
incrimination. The protection provided depended upon an objection to the
evidence, but where objection was not made the evidence was receivable in subsequent
proceedings against the witness who gave it. This rule applied not only to the
courts; it applied to evidence given before Royal commissions, statutory boards
and tribunals, `in bankruptcy' proceedings, and many other forms of judicial
and quasi‑judicial proceedings (see s. 2  of the Canada Evidence
Act ). There were many occasions where a witness through failure to object
even though ignorant of his rights or even where a witness, for example, in
bankruptcy matters, was compelled by law to answer the question rendered
himself vulnerable to the use of incriminating evidence in criminal proceedings
or to the use of prejudicial evidence in civil proceedings without recourse.
Many cases illustrate this problem: see Tass v. The King, supra, where a
witness called to give evidence at the preliminary hearing of another gave
evidence without an objection, which would invoke s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , and which was later received in evidence against him at his
own trial; R. v. Erdheim, supra, where statements made in bankruptcy
proceedings under compulsion of law were held to be admissible at a later
criminal proceeding against him; R. v. Coote, supra, where statements
made under oath upon a fire marshall's inquiry, held pursuant to statutory
power, were later admitted against the witness at his own trial for arson; R.
v. McGregor, [1967] 2 All E.R. 267 (C.A.), to similar effect. It may also
be observed that the power of provincial legislatures to give protection
against self‑incrimination did not extend to criminal matters‑‑see
Klein v. Bell, [1955] S.C.R. 309‑‑but was limited only to
civil proceedings within provincial jurisdiction. 

 

81.              There is a social interest in encouraging
people to come forward to give evidence, not only in court but on other
occasions in the tribunals and proceedings referred to above. That interest is
not served where witnesses in testifying expose themselves to the danger of
self‑incrimination because of such testimony. It is suggested that it was
a recognition of this fact, together with a recognition of the inadequacy of
the law relating to self‑incrimination and the inadequacy of provincial
powers in this respect that caused the framers of the Charter  to include
the very greatly strengthened Charter  provisions relating to self‑incrimination.
It was for this reason that s. 13  gave its protection against incrimination by
the use of the evidence given by the witness in ""other proceedings"".
It cannot, in my view, be construed to mean that protection under s. 13  of the Charter 
applies to evidence voluntarily given at a different stage in the very
proceedings which are before the Court. Section 13  of the Charter ,
however, could still have a role to play in this case. The appellant admitted
at his first trial that he was engaged in trafficking in narcotics when he met
the deceased. Section 13  would prevent the use of this evidence against the
appellant on a charge of trafficking, clearly another proceeding involving a
different charge and different issues. To say, however, that protection would
be given against the use of his first trial evidence on the second trial of
this indictment, on the footing that the second trial is another proceeding, is
to adopt an interpretation of s. 13  not dictated by its language, involving an
abandonment of long‑accepted and sound principles of evidence.

 

82.              It has been argued that to permit the
Crown to adduce at the second trial, as part of its case, the evidence given by
the accused on his first trial would be to permit the Crown to do indirectly
what it may not do directly. It is said that the Crown would be conscripting
the accused to assist in establishing the case against him and this would be to
infringe the rights conferred on the accused by s. 11 (c) and (d)
of the Charter . This argument has no force in my view. Section 11 (c)
gives the accused the right not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings
against himself in respect of the offence. There is not in this case any
compulsion involved. The appellant gave evidence voluntarily at his trial and
on the basis of that evidence obtained a new trial. I do not accept the
suggestion that appears in the judgment of Kerans J.A. that he was only
technically a voluntary witness. He had a fully‑guaranteed right to
silence. He was represented by counsel and he gave evidence. The provisions of
s. 11 (c) are not engaged in these circumstances where no compulsion
existed. The Crown is merely invoking the well‑settled rule of evidence
that past statements made by a party are ordinarily receivable in evidence
against him, and I adopt here the words of Parker J.A. in the Northwest
Territories Court of Appeal as well as those of Lord Campbell C.J. in R. v.
Scott, supra, quoted above. The appellant may not be compelled to give
evidence at his second trial but that protection, clearly provided by s. 11 (c)
of the Charter , does not extend to bar the use in evidence of earlier
voluntary statements that he has made which are clearly relevant to the issues.
By testifying at his trial he voluntarily waived his privilege of silence. It
is quite open to him to reclaim the privilege on his new trial and remain
silent, but in my view it is against all principle to say that the Charter 
right under s. 11 (c) would extend to bar the use in evidence of earlier
voluntary statements made by the accused clearly relevant to the issues. I
would add that s. 11 (d) is not in any way engaged in this case. 

 

83.              In my view then this appeal must fail. The
word ""proceedings"" in s. 13  of the Charter  means in a criminal
case all judicial steps taken upon one charge to resolve and reach a final
conclusion of the issue therein raised between the same party and the Crown.
This would include the preliminary hearing, the trial, and an appeal and a new
trial. All of these steps would be included in proceedings against the accused
and would not be ""other proceedings"" within the meaning of s. 13 . To
the suggestion that adopting this view would make admissible at a trial evidence
given by an accused on a voir dire held during the course of a trial,
there is, I think, a simple answer. The voir dire is clearly another
proceeding. Its purpose is not to resolve any issue raised in the charge but
merely to determine what may be introduced into the proceedings for that
purpose. After the voir dire the evidence found to be properly
admissible in the proceedings is admitted and thereafter forms part of the
proceedings. That which is excluded never becomes a part. The voir dire
serves this limited purpose but is clearly another proceeding. It follows then
that s. 13  of the Charter  would provide no protection against the use of
the evidence given in the first trial upon the second trial in this case.

 

84.              I would dismiss the appeal.

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Kienapple principle ‑‑

                   Accused was charged and convicted on five counts
arising out of the same incident: (1) taking a woman away against her will with
intent to have illicit sexual intercourse, (2) unlawfully confining that
person, (3) indecent assault, (4) rape, and (5) carrying a weapon for the
purpose of committing the indictable offence of rape.

 

                   At trial, the complainant testified in‑chief
and on cross‑examination as to the accused's limp and his difficulty
climbing stairs. The accused then elected to testify and did nothing to disturb
the testimony with respect to his restricted mobility. The Crown, in reply,
called witnesses to contradict the essence of complain‑ ant's testimony
as to the accused's difficulties in walking. When the Crown called the
complainant in reply, she testified about a new topic completely unrelated to
any previous evidence. The evidence adduced in reply forced the accused to
enter the witness box a second time. The Crown's cross‑examination dealt
with a collateral issue and amounted to a sharp attack on accused's
credibility. Accused appealed, citing reversible error below in the conduct of
the trial, and subsidiarily citing the application of the Kienapple
principle to some of the counts. The Court of Appeal agreed there was error
below but the majority, applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , dismissed the appeal. All convictions except that of rape were later
quashed in an addendum to the original judgment released before the formal
Order. 

 

                   Held: The appeals
should be allowed.

 

                   Dividing the prosecution's case so as to sandwich
the defence violates one of the fundamental precepts of our criminal process.
The accused must be given the opportunity to elect to remain silent or to enter
the witness box in his own defence in the full awareness of the Crown's
complete case. This did not occur here.

 

                   Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  could not be invoked here. The reviewing tribunal could not, with
anything approaching reality, retry the case to assess the worth of the
evidence remaining after the improperly adduced evidence had been extracted. The
situation resulting from the trial failed to qualify under any of the
authorities for the application of the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii).
Since the conviction for rape was quashed and a new trial ordered by this
Court, it was unnecessary to consider the issues raised concerning the
application of the Kienapple principle for its application flowed from
the conviction for rape. It was sufficient to allow the Crown appeals for the
purpose of ordering a new trial on all five counts.

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                Estey
and Lamer JJ.‑‑Tracy Evans John was charged and convicted in
Toronto by a jury on five counts, all arising out of the same incident:

 

1.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, did take away Joanne
Marie Volk, a female person, against her will with intent to have illicit
sexual intercourse with her, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

2.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, without lawful
authority, confined Joanne Marie Volk, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

3.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, indecently assaulted
Joanne Marie Volk, a female person, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

4.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, raped Joanne Marie Volk,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

5.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, carried a weapon, to
wit: a knife, for the purpose of committing the indictable offence of rape,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

2.                The accused appealed his convictions to
the Ontario Court of Appeal arguing reversible error below in the conduct of
the trial and, subsidiarily, that a conviction, if any, could not be entered as
regards some of the counts under the principle set out by this Court in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. All agreed that there was error below,
but the majority, applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code ,
dismissed the appeal. Brooke J. A. dissenting, would not have applied the
proviso and would have allowed the appeal from conviction and ordered a new
trial. The judgment was released on November 17, 1983. No reference was made in
the judgment to the issue regarding multiple convictions. 

 

3.                Before the issuance of the formal Order,
the Court of Appeal released, on December 1, 1983, an addendum to the original
judgment. In this addendum, all of the convictions except the conviction for
rape were quashed on the basis of the rule against multiple convictions.

 

4.                The accused appeals to this Court his
conviction for rape while the Crown appeals the application of the Kienapple
principle as regards some of the counts. The Crown also invites this Court to
pronounce upon certain procedural aspects that arise upon an application of Kienapple.

 

5.                The issues in these appeals therefore
divide into two parts. The first part concerns the application by the majority
in the court below of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  to
confirm a conviction under s. 143 of the Code for rape. The second part
concerns the quashing by the Court of Appeal of the convictions on the other
four counts in the indictment, as a result of an application of the principle
set out in Kienapple, supra.

 

6.                The issue arising out of the application
of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  concerns the Crown's
action in calling in reply the complainant and nine other witnesses to
introduce evidence concerning the physical characteristics of the accused,
particularly his mobility and agility, notwithstanding that he had an
artificial limb from the knee down on one leg. The complainant testified in‑chief
and in cross‑examination that the accused walked with a limp and had
difficulty climbing the two flights of stairs to his dwelling. Indeed, the
complainant admitted that in the course of the journey up the stairs, there was
a possibility that she could have escaped by reason of the accused's difficulty
except that she was frightened and this was probably due to the possession of a
knife by the accused. Against the backdrop of this evidence, the accused
elected to testify and he did nothing to disturb the complainant's description
of his restricted ability to move about. Indeed, he may have emphasized the
complainant's evidence by limping to the witness stand. In reply, other
witnesses called by the Crown contradicted the essence of the complainant's
testimony as to the difficulties the accused had in walking by reason of his
artificial limb. The Crown could not have called these witnesses to contradict
its own witness, the complainant Volk. To allow the Crown to do so in reply is
doubly wrong because the effect was to force the accused to return to the
witness box. When the Crown called the complainant in reply, she testified
about a new topic which had nothing whatever to do with any evidence entered by
the accused or on behalf of the accused in his defence. She proceeded to tell
the jury about a statement alleged to have been made by the accused to her that
he ""had planned... [the offence] for a week and it could have been
anyone"". The effect of this evidence on a juror's mind would in all
likelihood be serious. It is of course impossible to reconstruct this trial by
jury so as to determine what the verdict would have been had this evidence not
been presented. This information did not fall out of the complainant
accidentally, as the very form of the Crown's question indicates an awareness
of the answer desired. Indeed, counsel for the Crown, in proper frankness, acknowledged
that this was the case. Clearly this is the situation referred to in criminal
practice as the prosecution splitting its case. The wrongs which flow from such
a practice are manifold and the practice has been prohibited from the earliest
days of our criminal law. 

 

7.                The effect of this evidence by the
complainant also forced the accused to enter the witness box for the second
time. He was required so to do firstly in order to deal with the evidence of
his agility or mobility, and secondly to meet the evidence that he had indeed
planned the offence in general for some time. The cross‑examination of
the accused by the Crown centered on his ability to ascend stairs and to play
basketball. The first related to evidence led by reply witnesses who
contradicted the evidence of the complainant on this subject and the second
related to evidence by reply witnesses who introduced a purely collateral
matter, namely the accused's ability to play basketball without using a
wheelchair. In the course of this cross‑examination the issue was
squarely put to the accused that he had been lying in his examination‑in‑chief
when he said he played basketball only with the aid of a wheelchair. The
process reduced itself to a simple sharp attack in front of the jury on the
accused's credibility on an issue wholly collateral.

 

8.                These are the consequences that flow
from a violation of one of the fundamental precepts of our criminal process,
namely the dividing of the prosecution's case so as to sandwich the defence.
This is a particularly lethal tactic where the evidence in reply raises a new
issue and attacks the accused's credibility for this is the last evidence which
the members of the jury hear prior to their deliberations. It also raises the
question as to the propriety of the Crown's conduct in the context of the
accused's right to elect to remain silent or to elect to enter the witness box
in his own defence. He must be given the opportunity of making this decision in
the full awareness of the Crown's complete case. This did not occur in these
proceedings.

 

9.                Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  cannot be invoked in these circumstances. The reviewing tribunal
cannot, with anything approaching reality, retry the case to assess the worth
of the residual evidence after the improperly adduced evidence has been
extracted from the record. The appellate tribunal does not have the advantage
of seeing the witnesses, and in any case, was never intended in the criminal
process to replace the jury. It is unnecessary to reopen the many authorities
in this Court on the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  because the situation resulting from the trial in these proceedings
fails to qualify under any of these authorities for the application of the
proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

 

10.              The accused's appeal succeeds, the
conviction for rape is quashed and a new trial ordered on that count of rape.
As the conviction for rape, the foundation upon which the convictions at trial
for the other offences were set aside and quashed under the ""Kienapple
principle"", no longer exists, it is unnecessary to address the issues
raised by the Crown appeals as regards the alleged improper application by the
Court of Appeal of the principle in Kienapple to those convictions. It
is sufficient, in this case, to allow the Crown appeals for the purpose of
ordering a new trial on all five counts.

The B.C. Motor Vehicle
Act provided for minimum periods of imprisonment for the offence of driving
on a highway or industrial road without a valid driver's licence or with a
licence under suspension. Section 94(2) of the Act, moreover, provided that
this offence was one of absolute liability in which guilt was established by
the proof of driving, whether or not the driver knew of the prohibition or
suspension. The Court of Appeal, on a reference by the provincial government,
found s. 94(2) to be of no force or effect as it was inconsistent with s. 7  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms : ""the right to life,
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."" That
decision was appealed to this Court. 

 

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

 

Per Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Chouinard, Lamer
and Le Dain JJ.: A law with the potential of convicting a person who really has
done nothing wrong offends the principles of fundamental justice and violates a
person's right to liberty under s. 7  of the Charter  if imprisonment is
available as a penalty.

 








The analysis of s. 7  was
limited to determining the scope of the words ""principles of fundamental
justice"". That phrase is not a protected right but a qualifier to the
protected right not to be deprived of ""life, liberty and security of the
person""; its function is to set the parameters of that right. Interpretation
of the term must be with reference to the protected rights but not so as to
frustrate or stultify them. An interpretation equating ""fundamental
justice"" with ""natural justice"" would not only be wrong, in that
it would strip the protected interests of most of their content, but also would
be inconsistent with the affirmative purposive expression of those rights.

 

Sections 8  to 14  address
specific deprivations of the ""right"" to life, liberty and security of
the person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice, and as such,
violations of s. 7 . These sections are illustrative of the meaning of
""principles of fundamental justice"" in criminal or penal law. They
recognize principles given expression at common law, by international
convention and in the very entrenchment of the Charter  as essential
elements for the administration of justice founded on the dignity and worth of
the human person and the rule of law.

 

The principles of
fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets and principles not only
of our judicial process but also of the other components of our legal system.
These principles are not limited to procedural guarantees, although many are of
that nature. Whether any given principle may be said to be a principle of
fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7  must rest on an analysis of the
nature, sources, rationale and essential role of that principle within
the judicial process and in our evolving legal system. The words
""principles of fundamental justice"", therefore, cannot be given any
exhaustive content or simple enumerative definition but will take on concrete
meaning as the courts address alleged violations of s. 7 .

 








The Minutes of the
Proceedings of the Special Joint Committee were admissible but without much
weight given the inherent unreliability of such speeches and statements. The
comments of a few public servants, however distinguished, could not be
determinative in light of the many actors and the role of the provinces in
arriving at the Charter . To cast the interpretation of s. 7  in terms of
the comments made at the Joint Committee Proceedings would freeze the rights,
values and freedoms expressed in the Charter  as of the moment of
adoption and deny it growth and adjustment over time. 

 

The Canadian Bill of
Rights, too, was of little assistance in construing s. 7 . The words
""principles of fundamental justice"" in s. 2(e) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights are placed explicitly in context of and qualify a
""right to a fair hearing"". Section 7  of the Charter  does not
create the same context: the words ""principles of fundamental
justice"" are placed in context of and qualify much more fundamental
rights. The distinction was important.

 

Absolute liability does not
per se violate s. 7  of the Charter . An absolute liability offence
violates s. 7  only if and to the extent that it has the potential to deprive
life, liberty or the security of the person. There is no need that imprisonment
be mandatory. The combination of imprisonment and absolute liability, however,
violates s. 7  irrespective of the nature of the offence and can only be
salvaged if the authorities demonstrate, under s. 1 , such a deprivation to be a
justified limit in a free and democratic society. Generally, no imprisonment
may be imposed for an absolute liability offence and an offence punishable by
imprisonment cannot be an absolute liability offence.

 

Public interest cannot be a
factor in determining if absolute liability offends the principles of
fundamental justice but only as a justification under s. 1 . Administrative
expediency, invoked as a justification for sacrificing s. 7  rights, should only
succeed in cases arising out of exceptional conditions such as war, natural
disasters or epidemics.

 








Section 94(2) enacts in the
clearest of terms an absolute liability offence for which conviction will
result in a person's being deprived of his liberty. Whether or not the
provision is of limited or broad effect cannot change the fact that it is in
violation of the Charter  and at best could only be considered under s.
1 . Notwithstanding the desirability of keeping bad drivers off the roads or of
punishing them, no evidence was adduced demonstrating this end or the risk of
imprisonment of a few innocent people to be a reasonable and justifiable limit
on s. 7  within the meaning of s. 1  of the Charter .

 

Per McIntyre J.: Section 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act is inconsistent with s. 7  of the Charter . Fundamental
justice, as used in the Charter , involves more than natural justice,
which is largely procedural, and includes a substantive element. On any
definition of the term ""fundamental justice"", the imposition of
minimum imprisonment for an offence which may be committed unknowingly and
without intent and for which no defence can be made deprives or may deprive of
liberty and offends the principles of fundamental justice. 

 

Per Wilson J.: Section 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act violates s. 7  of the Charter  and is not saved by s. 1 .
This is because a mandatory sanction of imprisonment cannot be attached to an
absolute liability offence without offending s. 7 .

 

The phrase ""in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"" is not a
qualification on the right to life, liberty and security of the person in the
sense that it limits or modifies that right or defines its parameters. Rather
it protects the right against deprivation or impairment unless such deprivation
or impairment is effected in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

Section 7  does not affirm a
right to the principles of fundamental justice per se. Accordingly an
absolute liability offence does not offend s. 7  unless it violates the right to
either the life, liberty or security of the person through a violation of the
principles of fundamental justice.








Section 1  of the Charter 
permits reasonable limits to be placed on the citizen's s. 7  right provided the
limits are ""prescribed by law"" and can be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society. If these limits are not imposed in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice, however, they can be neither reasonable
nor justified under s. 1 . The phrase ""except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice"" restricts the government's power to
impose limits under s. 1 . A limit imposed on the s. 7  right in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice must still meet the tests in s. 1 .

 

The courts must determine
the principles which fall under the rubric ""principles of fundamental
justice"". It would seem, however, that the phrase must include the
fundamental tenets of our justice system. The framers of the Charter 
obviously deliberately avoided the concepts of ""natural justice"" and
""due process"". There seems no good reason to restrict the principles
of fundamental justice to procedural matters in light of the reference to the
rule of law in the preamble. Indeed, no purpose is achieved by importing the
dichotomy between substance and procedure into s. 7 .

 

The principles of
sentencing, and especially that the minimum sentence required to obtain the
objectives of the system be imposed, were key to determining that s. 94(2)
offended fundamental justice. Imprisonment is the most severe sentence imposed
by law, apart from death, and is generally reserved as a last resort for
occasions when other sanctions cannot achieve the objectives of the system.
Mandatory imprisonment for an absolute liability offence committed unknowingly
and unwittingly and after the exercise of due diligence is excessive and
inhumane. Such sanction offends the principles of fundamental justice embodied
in our penal system and accordingly is inconsistent with s. 7  of the Charter .

Introduction

 

2.                A law that has the potential to
convict a person who has not really done anything wrong offends the principles
of fundamental justice and, if imprisonment is available as a penalty, such a
law then violates a person's right to liberty under s. 7 of the Charter of
Rights and Freedoms (Constitution Act, 1982 , as enacted by the Canada
Act, 1982, 1982 (U.K.), c. 11).

 

3.                In other words, absolute liability
and imprisonment cannot be combined.

 

The Facts

 

4.                On August 16, 1982, the Lieutenant‑Governor
in Council of British Columbia referred the following question to the Court of
Appeal of that province, by virtue of s. 1 of the Constitutional Question
Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 63:

 

Is s. 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, as amended by the Motor Vehicle Amendment
Act, 1982, consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

5.                On February 3, 1983, the Court of
Appeal handed down reasons in answer to the question in which it stated that s.
94(2) of the Act is inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms : (1983), 42 B.C.L.R. 364, 147 D.L.R. (3d) 539, 4 C.C.C. (3d) 243,
33 C.R. (3d) 22, 5 C.R.R. 148, 19 M.V.R. 63, [1983] 3 W.W.R. 756. The Attorney
General for British Columbia launched an appeal to this Court.

 

The Legislation








6.                Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C.
1979, c. 288, s. 94, as amended by the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 1982,
1982 (B.C.), c. 36, s. 19:

 

 

 

94. (1) A person who drives a motor vehicle
on a highway or industrial road while

 

(a) he is prohibited from driving a motor
vehicle under sections 90, 91, 92 or 92.1, or

 

(b) his driver's licence or his right to
apply for or obtain a driver's licence is suspended under section 82 or 92 as
it was before its repeal and replacement came into force pursuant to the Motor
Vehicle  Amendment Act, 1982, 

 

commits an offence and is
liable,

 

(c) on a first conviction, to a fine of not
less than $300 and not more than $2 000 and to imprisonment for not less than
7 days and not more than 6 months, and

 

(d) on a subsequent conviction, regardless of
when the contravention occurred, to a fine Of not less than $300 and not more
than $2 000 and to imprisonment for not less than 14 days and not more than one
year.

 

(2)
Subsection (1) creates an absolute liability offence in which guilt is
established by proof of driving, whether or not the defendant knew of the
prohibition or suspension.

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ;
Constitution Act, 1982 :

 








1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to
such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society.

 

7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty
and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

11. Any person charged with an offence has
the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

52. (1) The Constitution of Canada is the
supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of
the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.

 

The Judgment of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia

 

7.                The Court was of the view that the
phrase ""principles of fundamental justice"" was not restricted to
matters of procedure, but extended to substantive law, and that the courts were
""therefore called upon, in construing the provisions of s. 7  of the
Charter , to have regard to the content of legislation"".

 








8.                Relying on the decision of this
Court in R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, the Court
of Appeal found ""that s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act is inconsistent
with the principles of fundamental justice"". They did not heed the
invitation of counsel opposing the validity of s. 94(2) to declare that, as a
result of that decision by our Court, all absolute liability offences violated
s. 7  of the Charter  and could not be salvaged under s. 1 . Quite the
contrary, the Court of Appeal said that ""there are, and will remain,
certain public welfare offences, e.g. air and water pollution offences, where
the public interest requires that the offences be absolute liability
offences"". Their finding was predicated on the following reasoning: 

 

The effect of s. 94(2) is
to transform the offence from a mens rea offence to an absolute liability
offence, hence giving the defendant no opportunity to prove that his action was
due to an honest and reasonable mistake of fact or that he acted without guilty
intent. Rather than placing the burden to establish such facts on the defendant
and thus making the offence a strict liability offence, the legislature has
seen fit to make it an absolute liability offence coupled with a mandatory term
of imprisonment.

 

9.                It can therefore be inferred with
certainty that, in the Court's view, the combination of mandatory imprisonment
and absolute liability was offensive to s. 7 . It cannot however be ascertained
from their judgment whether the violation was triggered by the requirement of
minimum imprisonment or solely by the availability of imprisonment as a
sentence.

 

Section 7 

 

1.               Introduction

 

10.              The issue in this case raises
fundamental questions of constitutional theory, including the nature and the
very legitimacy of constitutional adjudication under the Charter  as well
as the appropriateness of various techniques of constitutional interpretation.
I shall deal first with these questions of a more general and theoretical
nature as they underlie and have shaped much of the discussion surrounding s.
7 .

 

2.               The
Nature and Legitimacy of Constitutional Adjudication Under the Charter 








11.              The British Columbia Court of Appeal
has written in the present case that the Constitution Act, 1982  has
added a new dimension to the role of the courts in that the courts have now
been empowered by s. 52  to consider not only the vires of legislation
but also to measure the content of legislation against the constitutional
requirements of the Charter .

 

12.              The novel feature of the Constitution
Act, 1982 , however, is not that it has suddenly empowered courts to
consider the content of legislation. This the courts have done for a good many
years when adjudicating upon the vires of legislation. The initial
process in such adjudication has been characterized as ""a distillation of
the constitutional value represented by the challenged legislation""
(Laskin, Canadian Constitutional Law (3rd ed. rev. 1969), p. 85), and as
identifying ""the true meaning of the challenged law"" (Lederman (ed.),
The Courts and the Canadian Constitution (1964), p. 186), and ""an
abstract of the statute's content"" (Professor A. S. Abel, ""The
Neglected Logic of 91 and 92"" (1969), 19 U. of T. L.J. 487, p.
490). This process has of necessity involved a measurement of the content of
legislation against the requirements of the Constitution, albeit within the more
limited sphere of values related to the distribution of powers. 

 

13.              The truly novel features of the Constitution
Act, 1982  are that it has sanctioned the process of constitutional
adjudication and has extended its scope so as to encompass a broader range of
values. Content of legislation has always been considered in constitutional
adjudication. Content is now to be equally considered as regards new
constitutional issues. Indeed, the values subject to constitutional adjudication
now pertain to the rights of individuals as well as the distribution of
governmental powers. In short, it is the scope of constitutional adjudication
which has been altered rather than its nature, at least, as regards the right
to consider the content of legislation.

 








14.              In neither case, be it before or after
the Charter , have the courts been enabled to decide upon the
appropriateness of policies underlying legislative enactments. In both instances,
however, the courts are empowered, indeed required, to measure the content of
legislation against the guarantees of the Constitution. The words of Dickson J.
(as he then was) in Amax Potash Ltd. v. Government of Saskatchewan,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 576, at p. 590, continue to govern:

 

The Courts will not
question the wisdom of enactments ... but it is the high duty of this Court to
insure that the Legislatures do not transgress the limits of their
constitutional mandate and engage in the illegal exercise of power.

 

15.              In this respect, s. 7  is no different
than other Charter  provisions. As the Attorney General for Ontario has
noted in his factum:

 

Section 7 , like most of the
other sections in the Charter , limits the bounds of legislative action.
It is the function of the Court to determine whether the challenged legislation
has honoured those boundaries. This process necessitates judicial review of the
content of the legislation.

 

Yet, in the context of s. 7 , and in
particular, of the interpretation of ""principles of fundamental
justice"", there has prevailed in certain quarters an assumption that all
but a narrow construction of s. 7  will inexorably lead the courts to
""question the wisdom of enactments"", to adjudicate upon the merits of
public policy.

 

16.              From this have sprung warnings of the
dangers of a judicial ""super‑legislature"" beyond the reach of
Parliament, the provincial legislatures and the electorate. The Attorney
General for Ontario, in his written argument, stated that,

 








... the judiciary is
neither representative of, nor responsive to the electorate on whose behalf,
and under whose authority policies are selected and given effect in the laws of
the land. 

 

 

This is an argument which was heard
countless times prior to the entrenchment of the Charter  but which has
in truth, for better or for worse, been settled by the very coming into force
of the Constitution Act, 1982 . It ought not to be forgotten that the
historic decision to entrench the Charter  in our Constitution was taken
not by the courts but by the elected representatives of the people of Canada.
It was those representatives who extended the scope of constitutional
adjudication and entrusted the courts with this new and onerous responsibility.
Adjudication under the Charter  must be approached free of any lingering
doubts as to its legitimacy.

 

17.              The concerns with the bounds of
constitutional adjudication explain the characterization of the issue in a
narrow and restrictive fashion, i.e., whether the term ""principles
of fundamental justice"" has a substantive or merely procedural content. In
my view, the characterization of the issue in such fashion preempts an open‑minded
approach to determining the meaning of ""principles of fundamental
justice"".

 








18.              The substantive/procedural dichotomy
narrows the issue almost to an all‑or‑nothing proposition.
Moreover, it is largely bound up in the American experience with substantive
and procedural due process. It imports into the Canadian context American
concepts, terminology and jurisprudence, all of which are inextricably linked
to problems concerning the nature and legitimacy of adjudication under the U.S.
Constitution. That Constitution, it must be remembered, has no s. 52  nor has it
the internal checks and balances of ss. 1 and 33. We would, in my view, do our
own Constitution a disservice to simply allow the American debate to define the
issue for us, all the while ignoring the truly fundamental structural
differences between the two constitutions. Finally, the dichotomy creates its
own set of difficulties by the attempt to distinguish between two concepts
whose outer boundaries are not always clear and often tend to overlap. Such
difficulties can and should, when possible, be avoided.

 

19.              The overriding and legitimate concern
that courts ought not to question the wisdom of enactments, and the presumption
that the legislator could not have intended same, have to some extent distorted
the discussion surrounding the meaning of ""principles of fundamental
justice"". This has led to the spectre of a judicial ""super‑legislature""
without a full consideration of the process of constitutional adjudication and
the significance of ss. 1  and 33  of the Charter  and s. 52  of the Constitution
Act, 1982 . This in turn has also led to a narrow characterization of the
issue and to the assumption that only a procedural content to ""principles
of fundamental justice"" can prevent the courts from adjudicating upon the
merits or wisdom of enactments. If this assumption is accepted, the inevitable
corollary, with which I would have to then agree, is that the legislator
intended that the words ""principles of fundamental justice"" refer to
procedure only. 

 

20.              But I do not share that assumption.
Since way back in time and even recently the courts have developed the common
law beyond procedural safeguards without interfering with the ""merits or
wisdom"" of enactments (e.g., Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975]
1 S.C.R. 729, entrapment, non‑retrospectivity of offences, presumptions
against relaxing the burden of proof and persuasion, to give a few examples).

 








21.              The task of the Court is not to choose
between substantive or procedural content per se but to secure for
persons ""the full benefit of the Charter 's protection""
(Dickson J. (as he then was) in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1
S.C.R. 295, at p. 344), under s. 7 , while avoiding adjudication of the merits
of public policy. This can only be accomplished by a purposive analysis and the
articulation (to use the words in Curr v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 889,
at p. 899) of ""objective and manageable standards"" for the operation
of the section within such a framework.

 

22.              I propose therefore to approach the
interpretation of s. 7  in the manner set forth by Dickson J. in Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, and R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra,
and by Le Dain J. in R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R.
613. In R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., Dickson J. wrote at p. 344:

 

In Hunter v. Southam
Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, this Court expressed the view that the proper
approach to the definition of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter 
was a purposive one. The meaning of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter 
was to be ascertained by an analysis of the purpose of such a guarantee;
it was to be understood, in other words, in the light of the interests it was
meant to protect.

 

In my
view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom
in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the larger
objects of the Charter  itself, to the language chosen to articulate the
specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined,
and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights
and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the Charter .
The interpretation should be, as the judgment in Southam emphasizes, a
generous rather than a legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the purpose of the
guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter 's
protection. 

 

 

3.               The Principles of
Fundamental Justice

 








23.              I would first note that I shared the
views of Wilson J. in her statement in Singh v. Minister of Employment and
Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at p. 205, that ""it is incumbent
upon the Court to give meaning to each of the elements, life, liberty and
security of the person, which make up the ‘right’ contained in s. 7 "". Each of these,
in my view, is a distinct though related concept to be construed as such by the
courts. It is clear that s. 7  surely protects the right not to be deprived of
one's life, liberty and security of the person when that is done in breach of
the principles of fundamental justice. The outcome of this case is dependent
upon the meaning to be given to that portion of the section which states
""and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice"". On the facts of this case it is not
necessary to decide whether the section gives any greater protection, such as
deciding whether, absent a breach of the principles of fundamental justice,
there still can be, given the way the section is structured, a violation of
one's rights to life, liberty and security of the person under s. 7 .
Furthermore, because of the fact that only depreviation of liberty was
considered in these proceedings and that no one took issue with the fact that
imprisonment is a deprivation of liberty, my analysis of s. 7  will be limited,
as was the course taken by all, below and in this Court, to determining the
scope of the words ""principles of fundamental justice"", I will not
attempt to give any further content to liberty nor address that of the words
life or security of the person.

 

24.              In the framework of a purposive
analysis, designed to ascertain the purpose of the s. 7  guarantee and ""the
interests it was meant to protect"" (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra),
it is clear to me that the interests which are meant to be protected by the words
""and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice"" of s. 7  are the life, liberty and
security of the person. The principles of fundamental justice, on the other
hand, are not a protected interest, but rather a qualifier of the right not to
be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person.

 








25.              Given that, as the Attorney General
for Ontario has acknowledged, ""when one reads the phrase ‘principles of
fundamental justice’, a single incontrovertible meaning is not
apparent"", its meaning must, in my view, be determined by reference to the
interests which those words of the section are designed to protect and the
particular role of the phrase within the section. As a qualifier, the phrase
serves to establish the parameters of the interests but it cannot be
interpreted so narrowly as to frustrate or stultify them. For the narrower the
meaning given to ""principles of fundamental justice"" the greater will
be the possibility that individuals may be deprived of these most basic rights.
This latter result is to be avoided given that the rights involved are as
fundamental as those which pertain to the life, liberty and security of the
person, the deprivation of which ""has the most severe consequences upon an
individual"" (R. v. Cadeddu (1982), 40 O.R. (2d) 128 (H.C.), at p. 139). 

 

26.              For these reasons, I am of the view
that it would be wrong to interpret the term ""fundamental justice"" as
being synonymous with natural justice as the Attorney General of British
Columbia and others have suggested. To do so would strip the protected
interests of much, if not most, of their content and leave the
""right"" to life, liberty and security of the person in a sorely
emaciated state. Such a result would be inconsistent with the broad,
affirmative language in which those rights are expressed and equally
inconsistent with the approach adopted by this Court toward the interpretation
of Charter  rights in Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, per Estey J., and Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra.

 

27.              It would mean that the right to
liberty would be narrower than the right not to be arbitrarily detained or
imprisoned (s. 9 ), that the right to security of the person would have less
content than the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure (s.
8 ). Such an interpretation would give the specific expressions of the
""right to life, liberty and security of the person"" which are set
forth in ss. 8  to 14  greater content than the general concept from which they
originate.

 








28.              Sections 8  to 14 , in other words,
address specific deprivations of the ""right"" to life, liberty and
security of the person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice, and
as such, violations of s. 7 . They are designed to protect, in a specific manner
and setting, the right to life, liberty and security of the person set forth in
s. 7 . It would be incon­gruous to interpret s. 7  more narrowly than the rights
in ss. 8  to 14 . The alternative, which is to interpret all of ss. 8  to 14  in a
""narrow and technical"" manner for the sake of congruity, is out of
the question (Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, supra, at
p. 366).

 

29.              Sections 8  to 14  are illustrative of
deprivations of those rights to life, liberty and security of the person in
breach of the principles of fundamental justice. For they, in effect,
illustrate some of the parameters of the ""right"" to life, liberty and
security of the person; they are examples of instances in which the
""right"" to life, liberty and security of the person would be violated
in a manner which is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice. To put matters in a different way, ss. 7  to 14  could have been fused
into one section, with inserted between the words of s. 7  and the rest of those
sections the oft utilised provision in our statutes, ""and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing (s. 7 ) the following shall be deemed
to be in violation of a person's rights under this section"". Clearly, some
of those sections embody principles that are beyond what could be characterized
as ""procedural"". 

 

30.              Thus, ss. 8 to 14 provide an
invaluable key to the meaning of ""principles of fundamental justice"".
Many have been developed over time as presumptions of the common law, others
have found expression in the international conventions on human rights. All
have been recognized as essential elements of a system for the administration
of justice which is founded upon a belief in ""the dignity and worth of the
human person"" (preamble to the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C.
1970, App. III) and on ""the rule of law"" (preamble to the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ).








31.              It is this common thread which, in my
view, must guide us in determining the scope and content of ""principles of
fundamental justice"". In other words, the principles of fundamental
justice are to be found in the basic tenets of our legal system. They do not
lie in the realm of general public policy but in the inherent domain of the
judiciary as guardian of the justice system. Such an approach to the
interpretation of ""principles of fundamental justice"" is consistent
with the wording and structure of s. 7 , the context of the section, i.e.,
ss. 8 to 14, and the character and larger objects of the Charter  itself.
It provides meaningful content for the s. 7  guarantee all the while avoiding
adjudication of policy matters.

 

32.              Thus, it seems to me that to replace
""fundamental justice"" with the term ""natural justice""
misses the mark entirely. It was, after all, clearly open to the legislator to
use the term natural justice, a known term of art, but such was not done. We
must, as a general rule, be loath to exchange the terms actually used with
terms so obviously avoided.

 

33.              Whatever may have been the degree of
synonymy between the two expressions in the past, (which in any event has not
been clearly demonstrated by the parties and interveners), as of the last few
decades this country has given a precise meaning to the words natural justice
for the purpose of delineating the responsibility of adjudicators (in the wide
sense of the word) in the field of administrative law.

 

34.              It is, in my view, that precise and
somewhat narrow meaning that the legislator avoided, clearly indicating thereby
a will to give greater content to the words ""principles of fundamental
justice"", the limits of which were left for the courts to develop but
within, of course, the acceptable sphere of judicial activity. 

 








4.                Proceedings
and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of
Commons on the Constitution of Canada

 

35.              A number of courts have placed
emphasis upon the Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint
Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution in the
interpretation of ""principles of fundamental justice"", e.g., Latham
v. Solicitor General of Canada, [1984] 2 F.C. 734, 39 C.R. (3d) 78; Re
Mason; Mason v. R. in Right of Canada (1983), 35 C.R. (3d) 393 (Ont.
H.C.); R. v. Holman (1982), 28 C.R. (3d) 378 (B.C. Prov. Ct.)

 

36.              In particular, the following passages
dealing with the testimony of federal civil servants from the Department of
Justice, have been relied upon:

 

Mr.
Strayer (Assistant Deputy Minister, Public Law):

 

Mr.
Chairman, it was our belief that the words ""fundamental justice""
would cover the same thing as what is called procedural due process, that is
the meaning of due process in relation to requiring fair procedure. However, it
in our view does not cover the concept of what is called substantive due
process, which would impose substantive requirements as to policy of the law in
question.

 

This
has been most clearly demonstrated in the United States in the area of
property, but also in other areas such as the right to life. The term due
process has been given the broader concept of meaning both the procedure and
substance. Natural justice or fundamental justice in our view does not go
beyond the procedural requirements of fairness.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Mr.
Strayer: The term
""fundamental justice"" appears to us to be essentially the same thing
as natural justice.








Mr. Tassé (Deputy Minister) also said of the
phrase ""principles of fundamental justice"" in testimony before the
Committee:

 

We
assume that the Court would look at that much like a Court would look at the
requirements of natural justice, and the concept of natural justice is quite
familiar to courts and they have given a good deal of specific meaning to the
concept of natural justice. We would think that the Court would find in that
phraseology principles of fundamental justice a meaning somewhat like natural
justice or inherent fairness.

 

Courts
have been developing the concept of administrative fairness in recent years and
they have been able to give a good deal of consideration, certainly to these
sorts of concepts and we would expect they could do the same with this.

 

37.              The Honourable Jean Chrétien, then
federal Minister of Justice, also indicated to the Committee that, while he
thought ""fundamental justice marginally more appropriate than natural
justice"" in s. 7 , either term was acceptable to the Government. 

 

(a) Admissibility

 

38.              The first issue which arises is
whether the Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint
Committee may even be considered admissible as extrinsic aids to the
interpretation of Charter  provisions. Such extrinsic materials were
traditionally excluded from consideration in constitutional adjudication: e.g.,
Gosselin v. The King (1903), 33 S.C.R. 255, at p. 264; Reference re
Wartime Leasehold Regulations, [1950] S.C.R. 124.

 

39.              In Reference re Upper Churchill
Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297, at p. 317, however, McIntyre
J. stated that,

 








The
general exclusionary rule formerly considered to be applicable in dealing with
the admissibility of extrinsic evidence in constitutional cases has been set
aside or at least greatly modified and relaxed.

 

40.              Indeed, in the reference Re: Anti‑Inflation
Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, Laskin C.J. stated, at p. 389:

 

...no general principle of
admissibility or inadmissibility can or ought to be propounded by this Court,
and ...the questions of resort to extrinsic evidence and what kind of extrinsic
evidence may be admitted must depend on the constitutional issues on which it
is sought adduce such evidence.

 

41.              This approach was adopted by Dickson
J. in the reference Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
714, and McIntyre J. in Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion
Act, supra, in which he stated at p. 318:

 

It will therefore be open
to the Court in a proper case to receive and consider extrinsic evidence on the
operation and effect of the legislation.

 

42.              It is to be noted, however, that
McIntyre J.'s remarks are in relation to the interpretation of the challenged
statutory enactment rather than the interpretation of the Constitution itself.
The same is true of the remarks of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J.

 

43.              With respect to the interpretation of
the Constitution, however, such extrinsic materials were considered, in at
least two cases, by this Court.

 

44.              In Re: Authority of Parliament in
relation to the Upper House, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 54, the Court stated, at p.
66:

 








It is,
we think, proper to consider the historical background which led to the
provision which was made in the Act for the creation of the Senate as a part of
the apparatus for the enactment of federal legislation. In the debates which
occurred at the Quebec Conference in 1864, considerable time was occupied in
discussing the provisions respecting the Senate. Its important purpose is
stated in the following passages in speeches delivered in the debates on
Confederation in the parliament of the province of Canada: 

 

45.              The other case is Attorney General
of Canada v. Canadian National Transportation, Ltd., [1983] 2 S.C.R. 206.
Laskin C.J., in that case, referred to the pre‑Confederation debates in
the course of interpreting ss. 91(27)  and 92(14)  of the Constitution Act,
1867  (at p. 225).

 

46.              I would adopt this approach when
interpreting the Charter . Consequently, the Minutes of the Proceedings
and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution should, in my
view, be considered.

 

(b) Weight

 

47.              Having said that, however, I
nonetheless believe that the logic underlying the reluctance to allow the use
of materials such as speeches in Parliament carries considerable force with
respect to the Minutes of the Committee as well.

 

48.              In Reference re Upper Churchill
Water Rights Reversion Act, supra, McIntyre J. wrote at p. 319;

 

... I would say that the
speeches and public declarations by prominent figures in the public and
political life of Newfoundland on this question should not be received as
evidence. They represent, no doubt, the considered views of the speakers at the
time they were made, but cannot be said to be expressions of the intent of the
Legislative Assembly.

 








49.              Professor J. E. Magnet has written in
""The Presumption of Constitutionality"" (1980), 18 Osgoode Hall
L.J. 87, at pp. 99‑100:

 

In an administrative law
setting, ""The admissibility of ... (factual) evidence (on the issue of
legislative intent) ... seems so clear as not to require authority ....""

 

The
transposition of the administrative law principle to a constitutional context
is problematic. In the administrative law cases, the issue of intent concerns
the intent of a specific person. In the constitutional cases, the issue of
intent concerns the legislature, an incorporeal body made up of hundreds of
persons. It may be said that such a body, like a corporation, is a legal
fiction and has no intention in the relevant sense. It would follow that
legislative intent, in the constitutional setting, is a hollow concept.

 

Largely
in consideration of this argument, Canadian courts have developed the rule
that, in scrutinizing legislative intent for the purpose of determining
constitutional validity, statements by members of the legislature during
passage of the challenged Act are irrelevant and inadmissible. Several
explanations of the rule have been put forward. Strayer has argued that the
rule is sound because legislative motive is irrelevant to constitutional
validity: ""The essential factual issue here is that of effect....""
More convincingly, it has been argued that, considering the way in which the
Canadian process of enactment differs from that of the United States,
""Hansard gives no convincing proof of what the government
intended...."" Moreover, by allowing ambiguities in the statute to be
resolved by statements in the legislature, ministers would be given power in
effect to legislate indirectly by making such statements. ""Cabinets
already have powers enough without having this added unto them."" 

 

50.              If speeches and declarations by
prominent figures are inherently unreliable (per McIntyre J. in Reference
re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, supra, at p. 319) and
""speeches made in the legislature at the time of enactment of the measure
are inadmissible as having little evidential weight"" (per Dickson
J. in the reference Re: Residential Tenancies Act 1979, supra, at
p. 721), the Minutes of the Proceedings of the Special Joint Committee, though
admissible, and granted somewhat more weight than speeches should not be given
too much weight. The inherent unreliability of such statements and speeches is
not altered by the mere fact that they pertain to the Charter  rather
than a statute.

 








51.              Moreover, the simple fact remains that
the Charter  is not the product of a few individual public servants,
however distinguished, but of a multiplicity of individuals who played major
roles in the negotiating, drafting and adoption of the Charter . How can
one say with any confidence that within this enormous multiplicity of actors,
without forgetting the role of the provinces, the comments of a few federal
civil servants can in any way be determinative?

 

52.              Were this Court to accord any
significant weight to this testimony, it would in effect be assuming a fact
which is nearly impossible of proof, i.e., the intention of the
legislative bodies which adopted the Charter . In view of the
indeterminate nature of the data, it would in my view be erroneous to give
these materials anything but minimal weight.

 

53.              Another danger with casting the
interpretation of s. 7  in terms of the comments made by those heard at the
Special Joint Committee Proceedings is that, in so doing, the rights, freedoms
and values embodied in the Charter  in effect become frozen in time to
the moment of adoption with little or no possibility of growth, development and
adjustment to changing societal needs. Obviously, in the present case, given
the proximity in time of the Charter debates, such a problem is
relatively minor, even though it must be noted that even at this early stage in
the life of the Charter , a host of issues and questions have been raised
which were largely unforeseen at the time of such proceedings. If the newly
planted ""living tree"" which is the Charter  is to have the
possibility of growth and adjustment over time, care must be taken to ensure
that historical materials, such as the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of
the Special Joint Committee, do not stunt its growth. As Estey J. wrote in Law
Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, supra, at pp. 366‑67: 

 








Narrow and technical
interpretation, if not modulated by a sense of the unknowns of the future, can
stunt the growth of the law and hence the community it serves. All this has
long been with us in the process of developing the institutions of government
under the B.N.A. Act, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867 ). With
the Constitution Act, 1982  comes a new dimension, a new yardstick of reconciliation
between the individual and the community and their respective rights, a
dimension which, like the balance of the Constitution, remains to be
interpreted and applied by the Court.

 

5. The Canadian Bill of Rights

 

54.              The appellant states that s. 7 
""is a blend of s. 1(a) and s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights"". Considerable emphasis is then placed upon the case of Duke
v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 917, in which this Court interpreted the words
""principles of fundamental justice"" in s. 2(e) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. Fauteux C.J. noted, at p. 923:

 

Without attempting to
formulate any final definition of those words, I would take them to mean,
generally, that the tribunal which adjudicates upon his rights must act fairly,
in good faith, without bias, and in a judicial temper, and must give to him the
opportunity adequately to state his case.

 

55.              However, as Le Dain J. has written in R.
v. Therens, supra, with the implicit support of the majority, at p.
638:

 

In my
opinion the premise that the framers of the Charter  must be presumed to
have intended that the words used by it should be given the meaning which had
been given to them by judicial decisions at the time the Charter  was
enacted is not a reliable guide to its interpretation and application. By its
very nature a constitutional charter of rights and freedoms must use general
language which is capable of development and adaptation by the courts.

 

And after at pp. 638‑39:

 

Although it is clear that
in several instances, as in the case of s. 10 , the framers of the Charter 
adopted the wording of the Canadian Bill of Rights, it is also clear
that the Charter  must be regarded, because of its constitutional
character, as a new affirmation of rights and freedoms and of judicial power
and responsibility in relation to their protection.








                             . . .

In considering the
relationship of a decision under the Canadian Bill of Rights to an issue
arising under the Charter , a court cannot, in my respectful opinion,
avoid bearing in mind an evident fact of Canadian judicial history, which must
be squarely and frankly faced: that on the whole, with some notable exceptions,
the courts have felt some uncertainty or ambivalence in the application of the Canadian
Bill of Rights because it did not reflect a clear constitutional mandate to
make judicial decisions having the effect of limiting or qualifying the
traditional sovereignty of Parliament. The significance of the new
constitutional mandate for judicial review provided by the Charter  was
emphasized by this Court in its recent decisions in Law Society of Upper
Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, and Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
supra. 

 

 

56.              This view was also put forward by
Wilson J. in her judgment in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration,
supra, with which Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. concurred, at p. 209:

 

It seems to me rather that
the recent adoption of the Charter  by Parliament and nine of the ten
provinces as part of the Canadian constitutional framework has sent a clear
message to the courts that the restrictive attitude which at times
characterized their appproach to the Canadian Bill of Rights ought to be
re‑examined.

 

57.              In any event, the Duke case is
of little assistance in the interpretation of s. 7  of the Charter .
Section 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights states:

 

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied
so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 








(e) deprive a person
of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice for the determination of his rights and obligations;

 

58.              In section 2(e) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, the words ""principles of fundamental justice""
were placed explicitly in the context of, and qualify a ""right to a fair
hearing"". Section 7  of the Charter  does not create the same
context. In section 7, the words ""principles of fundamental justice""
are placed in the context of, and qualify much more fundamental rights, the
""right to life, liberty and security of the person"". The distinction
is important.

 

Conclusion

 

59.              I have, in this judgment, undertaken a
purposive analysis of the term ""principles of fundamental justice"" in
s. 7  of the Charter  in accordance with the method established by this
Court in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra. Accordingly, the
point of departure for the analysis has been a consideration of the general
objectives of the Charter  in the light of the general principles of Charter 
interpretation set forth in Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, supra,
and Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra. This was followed by a
detailed analysis of the language and structure of the section as well as its
immediate context within the Charter . 

 








60.              The main sources of support for the
argument that ""fundamental justice"" is simply synonymous with natural
justice have been the Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Special
Joint Committee on the Constitution and the Canadian Bill of Rights
jurisprudence. In my view, neither the Minutes nor the Canadian Bill of Rights
jurisprudence are persuasive or of any great force. The historical usage of the
term ""fundamental justice"" is, on the other hand, shrouded in
ambiguity. Moreover, not any one of these arguments, taken singly or as a
whole, manages to overcome in my respectful view the textual and contextual
analyses.

 

61.              Consequently, my conclusion may be
summarized as follows:

 

62.              The term ""principles of
fundamental justice"" is not a right, but a qualifier of the right not to
be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person; its function is to set
the parameters of that right.

 

63.              Sections 8 to 14 address specific
deprivations of the ""right"" to life, liberty and security of the
person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice, and as such,
violations of s. 7 . They are therefore illustrative of the meaning, in criminal
or penal law, of ""principles of fundamental justice""; they represent
principles which have been recognized by the common law, the international
conventions and by the very fact of entrenchment in the Charter , as
essential elements of a system for the administration of justice which is
founded upon the belief in the dignity and worth of the human person and the
rule of law.

 

64.              Consequently, the principles of
fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets and principles, not
only of our judicial process, but also of the other components of our legal
system.

 








65.              We should not be surprised to find
that many of the principles of fundamental justice are procedural in nature.
Our common law has largely been a law of remedies and procedures and, as
Frankfurter J. wrote in McNabb v. United States 318 U.S. 332 (1942), at
p. 347, ""the history of liberty has largely been the history of observance
of procedural safeguards"". This is not to say, however, that the
principles of fundamental justice are limited solely to procedural guarantees.
Rather, the proper approach to the determination of the principles of
fundamental justice is quite simply one in which, as Professor L. Tremblay has
written, ""future growth will be based on historical roots"" (""Section
7  of the Charter : Substantive Due Process?""(1984), 18 U.B.C.L. Rev.
201, at p. 254). 

 

66.              Whether any given principle may be
said to be a principle of fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7  will
rest upon an analysis of the nature, sources, rationale and essential
role of that principle within the judicial process and in our legal system, as
it evolves.

 

67.              Consequently, those words cannot be
given any exhaustive content or simple enumerative definition, but will take on
concrete meaning as the courts address alleged violations of s. 7 .

 

68.              I now turn to such an analysis of the
principle of mens rea and absolute liability offences in order to determine
the question which has been put to the Court in the present Reference.

 

Absolute Liability and Fundamental
Justice in Penal Law

 

69.              It has from time immemorial been part
of our system of laws that the innocent not be punished. This principle has
long been recognized as an essential element of a system for the administration
of justice which is founded upon a belief in the dignity and worth of the human
person and on the rule of law. It is so old that its first enunciation was in
Latin actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.

 

70.              As Glanville Williams said:








There
is no need here to go into the remote history of mens rea; suffice it to
say that the requirement of a guilty state of mind (at least for the more
serious crimes) had been developed by the time of Coke, which is as far back as
the modern lawyer needs to go. ""If one shoot at any wild fowl upon a tree,
and the arrow killeth any reasonable creature afar off, without any evil intent
in him, this is per infortunium.""

 

(Glanville Williams, Criminal Law, The
General Part, 2nd ed. (London, 1961), at p. 30.)

 

71.              One of the many judicial statements on
the subject worth mentioning is of the highest authority, per Goddard
C.J. in Harding v. Price, [1948] 1 K.B. 695, at p. 700, where he said:

 

The general rule applicable
to criminal cases is actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, and I venture to
repeat what I said in Brend v. Wood (1946), 62 T.L.R. 462, 463: `It is
of the utmost importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a
court should always bear in mind that, unless a statute either clearly or by
necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the
court should not find a man guilty of an offence against the criminal law
unless he has a guilty mind'.

 

72.              This view has been adopted by this
Court in unmistakable terms in many cases, amongst which the better known are Beaver
v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 531, and the most recent and often quoted
judgment of Dickson J. writing for the Court in R. v. City of Sault Ste.
Marie, supra. 

 








73.              This Court's decision in the latter
case is predicated upon a certain number of postulates one of which, given the
nature of the rules it elaborates, has to be to the effect that absolute
liability in penal law offends the principles of fundamental justice. Those
principles are, to use the words of Dickson J., to the effect that ""there
is a generally held revulsion against punishment of the morally innocent"".
He also stated that the argument that absolute liability ""violates
fundamental principles of penal liability"" was the most telling argument
against absolute liability and one of greater force than those advanced in support
thereof.

 

74.              In my view it is because absolute
liability offends the principles of fundamental justice that this Court created
presumptions against legislatures having intended to enact offences of a
regulatory nature falling within that category. This is not to say, however,
and to that extent I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal, that, as a
result, absolute liability per se offends s. 7  of the Charter .

 

75.              A law enacting an absolute liability
offence will violate s. 7  of the Charter  only if and to the extent that
it has the potential of depriving of life, liberty, or security of the person.

 

76.              Obviously, imprisonment (including
probation orders) deprives persons of their liberty. An offence has that
potential as of the moment it is open to the judge to impose imprisonment.
There is no need that imprisonment, as in s. 94(2), be made mandatory.

 

77.              I am therefore of the view that the
combination of imprisonment and of absolute liability violates s. 7  of the Charter 
and can only be salvaged if the authorities demonstrate under s. 1  that such a
deprivation of liberty in breach of those principles of fundamental justice is,
in a free and democratic society, under the circumstances, a justified
reasonable limit to one's rights under s. 7 .

 








78.              As no one has addressed imprisonment
as an alternative to the non‑payment of a fine, I prefer not to express
any views in relation to s. 7  as regards that eventuality as a result of a
conviction for an absolute liability offence; nor do I need to address here,
given the scope of my finding and the nature of this appeal, minimum
imprisonment, whether it offends the Charter per se or whether such
violation, if any, is dependent upon whether it be for a mens rea or
strict liability offence. Those issues were not addressed by the court below
and it would be unwise to attempt to address them here. It is sufficient and
desirable for this appeal to make the findings I have and no more, that is,
that no imprisonment may be imposed for an absolute liability offence, and,
consequently, given the question put to us, an offence punishable by
imprisonment cannot be an absolute liability offence. 

 

79.              Before considering s. 94(2) in the
light of these findings, I feel we are however compelled to go somewhat further
for the following reason. I would not want us to be taken by this conclusion as
having inferentially decided that absolute liability may not offend s. 7  as
long as imprisonment or probation orders are not available as a sentence. The
answer to that question is dependant upon the content given to the words
""security of the person"". That issue was and is a live one. Indeed,
though the question as framed focuses on absolute liability (s. 94(2)) in
relation to the whole Charter , including the right to security of the
person in s. 7 , because of the presence of mandatory imprisonment in s. 94(1) 
only deprivation of liberty was considered. As the effect of imprisonment on
the right to liberty is a foregone conclusion, a fortiori minimum
imprisonment, everyone directed their arguments when discussing s. 7  to
considering whether absolute liability violated the principles of fundamental
justice, and then subsidiarily argued pro or contra the effect of
s. 1  of the Charter .

 

80.              Counsel for those opposing the
validity of s. 94(2) took the position in this Court that absolute liability
and severe punishment, always referring to imprisonment, violated s. 7  of the Charter .
From the following passage of the judgment in the Court of Appeal it would
appear that counsel for those opposing the validity of the section took the
wider position in that Court that all absolute liability offences violated s. 7 
because of ""punishment of the morally innocent"":








In
seeking to persuade the court to that conclusion counsel opposing the validity
of s. 94(2) contended all absolute offences are now of no force and effect
because of s. 7  of the Charter  and that the provisions of s. 1  of the Charter 
should not be invoked to sustain them. In support of this submission counsel
relied upon the view expressed by Dickson J. in Sault Ste. Marie that
there was ‘a generally held revulsion against punishment of the morally innocent’. They contended
that had the Charter  been in effect when Sault Ste. Marie was decided
all absolute liability offences would have been struck down.

 

We
accept without hesitation the statement expressed by the learned justice but do
not think it necessarily follows that because of s. 7  of the Charter  this
category of offence can no longer be legislated. To the contrary, there are,
and will remain, certain public welfare offences, e.g., air and water pollution
offences, where the public interest requires that the offences be absolute
liability offences. 

 

 

81.              While I agree with the Court of
Appeal, as I have already mentioned, that absolute liability does not per se
violate s. 7  of the Charter , I am somewhat concerned with leaving
without comment the unqualified reference by the Court of Appeal to the
requirements of the ""public interest"".

 

82.              If, by reference to public interest,
it was meant that the requirements of public interest for certain types of
offences is a factor to be considered in determining whether absolute liability
offends the principles of fundamental justice, then I would respectfully
disagree; if the public interest is there referred to by the Court as a
possible justification under s. 1 of a limitation to the rights protected at s.
7 , then I do agree.

 

83.              Indeed, as I said, in penal law,
absolute liability always offends the principles of fundamental justice
irrespective of the nature of the offence; it offends s. 7  of the Charter 
if as a result, anyone is deprived of his life, liberty or security of the
person, irrespective of the requirement of public interest. In such cases it
might only be salvaged for reasons of public interest under s. 1 .

 








84.              In this latter regard, something might
be added.

 

85.              Administrative expediency, absolute
liability's main supportive argument, will undoubtedly under s. 1  be invoked
and occasionally succeed. Indeed, administrative expediency certainly has its
place in administrative law. But when administrative law chooses to call in aid
imprisonment through penal law, indeed sometimes criminal law and the added
stigma attached to a conviction, exceptional, in my view, will be the case
where the liberty or even the security of the person guaranteed under s. 7 
should be sacrificed to administrative expediency. Section 1  may, for reasons
of administrative expediency, successfully come to the rescue of an otherwise
violation of s. 7 , but only in cases arising out of exceptional conditions,
such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, epidemics, and the like.

 

86.              Of course I understand the concern of
many as regards corporate offences, specially, as was mentioned by the Court of
Appeal, in certain sensitive areas such as the preservation of our vital
environment and our natural resources. This concern might well be dispelled
were it to be decided, given the proper case, that s. 7  affords protection to
human persons only and does not extend to corporations.

 

87.              Even if it be decided that s. 7  does
extend to corporations, I think the balancing under s. 1 of the public interest
against the financial interests of a corporation would give very different
results from that of balancing public interest and the liberty or security of
the person of a human being. 

 








88.              Indeed, the public interest as regards
""air and water pollution offences"" requires that the guilty be dealt
with firmly, but the seriousness of the offence does not in my respectful view
support the proposition that the innocent human person be open to
conviction, quite the contrary.

 

Section 94(2)

 

89.              No doubt s. 94(2) enacts in the
clearest of terms an absolute liability offence, the conviction for which a
person will be deprived of his or her liberty, and little more, if anything,
need be added. However, I should not want to conclude without addressing an
argument raised by the appellant in this Court and considered by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal.

 

90.              The appellant argues that, as a result
of the case of R. v. MacDougall, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 605, s. 94(2) (the
absolute liability provision) is of limited effect. Hence, the section raises
""a false impression of a potential for wholesale injustice,"" says the
appellant. In my view, this argument is of little relevance to the
determination of this appeal. Whether the provision is of broad or of
""limited"" effect does not change its nature nor lead to a different
characterization for the purpose of determining a violation of s. 7 . The
question is whether the provision offends s. 7  of the Charter  at all,
rather than whether it does so in ""limited"" or ""wholesale""
fashion. At best, this argument may be considered under s. 1 .

 

91.              The appellant summarizes the decision
in MacDougall as establishing that ""where an accused is charged
with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was cancelled (contrary to a
provincial statute) and the revocation in question arose automatically as a
matter of law pursuant to a provincial statute, ignorance by the accused of the
fact that his licence was revoked is ignorance of law and cannot provide the
basis for an acquittal"".

 








92.              The respondent, however, distinguishes
the MacDougall case from the case at bar on two grounds. First, the
offence under consideration in MacDougall was one of strict liability
rather than absolute liability. Secondly, while MacDougall ""dealt
only with a suspension by operation of law, section 94(2) encompasses Court
imposed suspensions (section 90(2)), suspensions arising under the `old law' in
the absence of the accused, and suspensions imposed by administrative review by
the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles requiring delivery of notice (‘old’ act, Section
82(3))"". Thus, the respondent concludes that there are ""at least
three classes of morally innocent persons who are, by Section 94(2) deprived of
the opportunity to present a defence of the type outlined by Dickson J. in Regina
v. Sault Ste. Marie, (1978) 2 S.C.R. 1299 at 1326"". 

 

The defence will be
available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which,
if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all
reasonable steps to avoid the particular event.

 

93.              In the final analysis, it seems that
both the appellant and the respondent agree that s. 94 will impact upon the
right to liberty of a limited number of morally innocent persons. It creates an
absolute liability offence which effects a deprivation of liberty for a limited
number of persons. To me, that is sufficient for it to be in violation of s. 7 .

 

Section 1 

 

94.              Having found that s. 94(2) offends s.
7  of the Charter  there remains the question as to whether the appellants
have demonstrated that the section is salvaged by the operation of s. 1  of the Charter .
No evidence was adduced in the Court of Appeal or in this Court. The position
in that regard and the argument in support of the operability of s. 94(2) is as
follows in appellant's factum:








If this
Court rules that S. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act is inconsistent with S. 7 
(or S. 11 (d)) of the Charter , then it is submitted that S. 1  of the Charter  is
applicable. It is submitted that Laskin J. (as he then was) made it clear in Curr
v. The Queen, supra, that it is within the scope of judicial notice for
this Court to recognize that a statutory provision was enacted as part of a
legislative scheme aimed at reducing the human and economic cost of bad
driving. S. 94  is but part of the overall scheme laid out in the Motor Vehicle
Act by which the Legislature is attempting to get bad drivers off the road. S.
94 imposes severe penalties on those who drive while prohibited from driving
and those who drive while their driver's licence is suspended.

 

It is
submitted that if S. 94(2) is inconsistent with one of the above‑noted
provisions of the Charter , then S. 94(2) contains a ‘reasonable limit, etc.’ within the
meaning of S. 1  of the Charter .

 

95.              I do not take issue with the fact that
it is highly desirable that ""bad drivers"" be kept off the road. I do
not take issue either with the desirability of punishing severely bad drivers
who are in contempt of prohibitions against driving. The bottom line of the
question to be addressed here is: whether the Government of British Columbia
has demonstrated as justifiable that the risk of imprisonment of a few innocent
is, given the desirability of ridding the roads of British Columbia of bad
drivers, a reasonable limit in a free and democratic society. That result is to
be measured against the offence being one of strict liability open to a defence
of due diligence, the success of which does nothing more than let those few who
did nothing wrong remain free. 

 

96.              As did the Court of Appeal, I find
that this demonstration has not been satisfied, indeed, not in the least.

 

97.              In the result, I would dismiss the
appeal and answer the question in the negative, as did the Court of Appeal,
albeit for somewhat different reasons, and declare s. 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, as amended by the Motor Vehicle Amendment
Act, 1982, inconsistent with s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms .








98.              Having come to this conclusion, I
choose, as did the Court of Appeal, not to address whether the section violates
the rights guaranteed under ss. 11 (d) and 12  of the Charter .

 

The following are the
reasons delivered by

 

99.              McIntyre
J.‑‑I agree with Lamer J. that s. 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, as amended by the Motor Vehicle
Amendment Act, 1982, (1982) (B.C.), c. 36, s. 19, is inconsistent with s. 7 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . I agree that
""fundamental justice"", as the term is used in the Charter ,
involves more than natural justice (which is largely procedural) and includes
as well a substantive element. I am also of the view that on any definition of
the term ""fundamental justice"" the imposition of minimum imprisonment
for an offence in respect of which no defence can be made, and which may be
committed unknowingly and with no wrongful intent, deprives or may deprive of
liberty and it offends the principles of fundamental justice.

 

100.            I would accordingly dismiss the appeal
and answer the constitutional question in the negative. 

 

The following are the
reasons delivered by

 

101.            Wilson
J.‑‑I agree with my colleague, Mr. Justice Lamer, that s.
94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act violates s. 7  of the Charter  and
is not saved by s. 1 . I reach that result, however, by a somewhat different
route.

 








102.            I start with a consideration of
statutory ""offences"". These are divisible into offences for which mens
rea is required and those for which it is not. Statutory offences are
subject to a presumption in favour of a mens rea requirement as a
matter of interpretation, but the courts have increasingly come to accept the
proposition that legislatures may create non mens rea offences
provided they make it clear that the actus reus itself is
prohibited. This is typically so in the case of the so‑called
""regulatory"" or ""public welfare"" offences. There is no
moral delinquency involved in these offences. They are simply designed to
regulate conduct in the public interest.

 

103.            Two questions, therefore, have to be
answered on this appeal. The first is do absolute liability offences created by
statute per se offend the Charter ? The second is, assuming
they do not, can they be attended by mandatory imprisonment or can such a
sanction only be attached to true mens rea offences? Certainly,
in the absence of the Charter , legislatures are free to create absolute
liability offences and to attach to them any sanctions they please. Does s. 7
of the Charter  circumscribe their power in this regard? 

 

1.               Absolute Liability
Offences

 

104.            Section 7 affirms the right to life,
liberty and security of the person while at the same time indicating that a
person may be deprived of such a right if the deprivation is effected ""in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"". I do not view the
latter part of the section as a qualification on the right to life, liberty and
security of the person in the sense that it limits or modifies that right or
defines its parameters. Its purpose seems to me to be the very opposite, namely
to protect the right against deprivation or impairment unless such deprivation
or impairment is effected in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 








105.            Section 7 does not, however, affirm a
right to the principles of fundamental justice per se. There must
first be found an impairment of the right to life, liberty or security of the
person. It must then be determined whether that impairment has been effected in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. If it has, it passes the
threshold test in s. 7 itself but the Court must go on to consider whether it
can be sustained under s. 1  as a limit prescribed by law on the s. 7 right
which is both reasonable and justified in a free and democratic society. If,
however, the limit on the s. 7 right has been effected through a violation of the
principles of fundamental justice, the enquiry, in my view, ends there and the
limit cannot be sustained under s. 1 . I say this because I do not believe that
a limit on the s. 7 right which has been imposed in violation of the principles
of fundamental justice can be either ""reasonable"" or
""demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society"". The
requirement in s. 7 that the principles of fundamental justice be observed
seems to me to restrict the legislature's power to impose limits on the s. 7
right under s. 1 . It can only limit the s. 7 right if it does so in accordance
with the principles of fundamental justice and, even if it meets that test, it
still has to meet the tests in s. 1 . 

 








106.            Assuming that I am correct in my
analysis of s. 7  and its relationship to s. 1 , an absolute liability offence
cannot violate s. 7  unless it impairs the right to life, liberty or security of
the person. It cannot violate s. 7  because it offends the principles of fundamental
justice because they are not protected by s. 7  absent an impairment of the s. 7 
right. Leaving aside for the moment the mandatory imprisonment sanction, I
cannot find an interference with life, liberty or security of the person in s.
94 of the Motor Vehicle Act. It is true that the section prevents
citizens from driving their vehicles when their licences are suspended.
Citizens are also prevented from driving on the wrong side of the road. Indeed,
all regulatory offences impose some restriction on liberty broadly construed.
But I think it would trivialize the Charter  to sweep all those offences
into s. 7  as violations of the right to life, liberty and security of the
person even if they can be sustained under s. 1 . It would be my view,
therefore, that absolute liability offences of this type do not per se
offend s. 7  of the Charter .

 

2.               Absolute Liability Plus
Mandatory Imprisonment

 

107.            The real question, as I see it, is
whether s. 7  of the Charter  is violated by the attachment of a mandatory
imprisonment sanction to an absolute liability offence. Clearly a s. 7  right is
interfered with here in that a person convicted of such an offence
automatically loses his liberty.

 

108.            In what circumstances then may the
citizen be deprived of his right to liberty? Clearly not if he was deprived of
it through a process which was procedurally unfair. But is s. 7  limited to
that?

 

109.            I would assume that one of the reasons
for the rider attached to the right to liberty affirmed in s. 7  is to
accommodate the criminal justice system. It will be through the criminal
justice system that citizens will typically lose their liberty at the hands of
government. The system must not, therefore, cause them to lose their liberty in
violation of the principles of fundamental justice. The system must reflect
those principles and the validity of the penal provisions must be assessed in
relation to them. 

 

110.            Since s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle
Act imposes a limit prescribed by law on the s. 7  right, we must determine
whether fundamental justice is offended by attaching mandatory imprisonment to
an absolute liability offence. Given that we can have statutory non mens
rea offences, what is repugnant to fundamental justice in imprisoning
someone for their commission?








111.            At common law imprisonment was reserved
for the more serious mens rea offences. However, we are dealing
here with statutory offences and the legislation must stand unless it violates
s. 7 . We cannot, in my view, simply state as a bald proposition that absolute
liability and imprisonment cannot co‑exist in a statutory context.
Legislatures can supersede the common law. The legislature may consider it so
important to prevent a particular act from being committed that it absolutely
forbids it and, if it is committed, may subject the offender to a penalty
whether he has any mens rea or not and whether or not he had any
intention of breaking the law. Prior to the Charter  such legislation
would have been unassailable. Now it must meet the test of s. 7 . Where the
legislature has imposed a penalty in the form of mandatory imprisonment for the
commission of an absolute liability offence and has done so in clear and
unambiguous language, can the legislation survive an attack under s. 7 ? It is
suggested that such legislation cannot survive because it offends the
principles of fundamental justice and, in particular, the principle that
punishment is inappropriate in the absence of moral culpability.

 








112.            The common law distinguished sharply the
conduct of the wrongdoer from his state of mind at the time. Hence the famous
maxim referred to by my colleague‑‑actus non facit
reum nisi mens sit rea. The important thing to
note, however, is that while the maxim has always been viewed as identifying
the essential ingredients of a crime at common law, its meaning has been
subject to a process of historical and juridical development, particularly the
concept of mens rea. In the earliest beginnings of criminal liability
the mental state of the wrongdoer was not considered at all; it was enough that
he had done the fell deed: see Holdsworth, A History of English Law
(1923), vol. 2, pp. 50 et seq. At a later stage the accused's
state of mind was considered for two distinct purposes, namely (1) to determine
whether his conduct was voluntary or involuntary; and (2) to determine whether
he realized what the consequences of his conduct might be. But the first
purpose was viewed as the key one. It was considerably later in the development
of the law of criminal responsibility that the emphasis changed and an appreciation
of the consequences of his act became the central focus. The movement towards
the concept of the ""guilty mind"" was not, however, a sudden or
dramatic one. This is understandable. The judges of the day found the new rule
hard to apply because it was difficult to look into the state of a man's mind.
The ecclesiastical authorities, however, had no such problem and legal
historians seem to agree that the ecclesiastical influence was largely
responsible for moving the focus to the mental element in common law crime: see
Holdsworth, supra, p. 259. 

 

113.            The introduction of concepts of morality
into criminal responsibility inevitably led to a sharp distinction between
crimes which were mala in se and crimes which were merely mala
prohibita. Blackstone describes crimes which were mala in se
as offences against ""those rights which God and nature have
established"" (Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (17th
ed. by E. Christian, 1830)), p. 53 and crimes which were mala prohibita
as breaches of ""those laws which enjoin only positive duties, and forbid
any such things as are not mala in se... without any
intermixture of moral guilt"" (Blackstone, ibid., p. 57). This
distinction is now pretty well discredited: see Archbold's Pleading,
Evidence & Practice in Criminal Cases, 30th ed. (1938), p. 900; Allen, Legal
Duties and Other Essays in Jurisprudence (1931), p. 239. While it is
undoubtedly a fact that certain crimes evoke feelings of revulsion and
condemnation in the minds of most people, those feelings are now generally
perceived as dependent upon a number of variable factors such as environment,
education and religious prejudice and are no longer seen as providing a secure
basis for the segregation of crimes into two different categories. Quoting from
Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law, 16th ed. by J. W. C. Turner, 1952, at
pp. 22‑23:

 








Among the members of any
community at a given period, certain offences are by general agreement regarded
as especially serious and excite deep moral reprobation, whereas other
transgressions are regarded as venial and are more or less condoned, especially
when they infringe rules of law which are unpopular. It is indeed inevitable
that this apportionment of blame should be made. Yet the vague and fluctuating
line which in everyday life is drawn between the one group and the other only
marks a variation in degree; it is not a boundary which separates things
fundamentally alien in kind. Ethical reprobation of homicide, homosexuality,
libel, adultery, bigamy and slave trading, to take a few examples, is not the
same in all countries, and indeed may vary from section to section of the
people in the same country.

 

                                                                    ...

 

This
defective classification of crimes clearly formed an unsound premise from which
to draw any jurisprudential conclusion but it has an insidious attraction, and
in the form of English phrases such as ""in itself unlawful"" it has
penetrated into one or two modern judgments with vitiating effects upon the
logic and clarity of the argument. 

 

114.            Accepting that a guilty mind was an
essential ingredient of a crime at common law, it does not, of course, follow
that the same is true of a ""crime"" created by statute. I have already
referred to the presumption against absolute liability as a matter of statutory
interpretation. This undoubtedly reflects the common law approach to the nature
of crime. It is, however, only a presumption. Provided it does so in clear and
unambiguous terms the legislature is free to make a person liable for the actus
reus with or without mens rea.

 

115.            In Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law,
supra, p. 4, the author highlights the difficulty in identifying any
essential characteristics of crimes created by statute. He points out that such
crimes originate in the government policy of the day and that, so long as
crimes continue to be created by government policy, the nature of statutory
crime will elude definition. Lord Atkin adverted to the same difficulty in Proprietary
Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General for Canada, [1931] A.C. 310.
He stated at p. 324:

 








... the domain of criminal
jurisprudence can only be ascertained by examining what acts at any particular
period are declared by the State to be crimes, and the only common nature they
will be found to possess is that they are prohibited by the State and that
those who commit them are punished.

 

116.            In R. v. Pierce Fisheries Ltd.,
[1971] S.C.R. 5, Ritchie J., speaking for the majority of this Court, said at
p. 13:

 

Generally
speaking, there is a presumption at common law that mens rea is
an essential ingredient of all cases that are criminal in the true sense, but a
consideration of a considerable body of case law on the subject satisfies me
that there is a wide category of offences created by statutes enacted for the
regulation of individual conduct in the interests of health, convenience,
safety and the general welfare of the public which are not subject to any such
presumption.

 

117.            There seems to be no doubt that in s. 94
of the Motor Vehicle Act the legislature of British Columbia has created
such an offence. Subsection (2) expressly precludes the application of any
presumption in favour of a mens rea requirement. However, as already
indicated, I do not believe that any principle of fundamental justice is
offended by the creation of an absolute liability offence absent an impairment
of the s. 7  right.

 

118.            Is fundamental justice offended then by
the attachment of a mandatory term of imprisonment to the s. 94 offence? Is
there something repugnant about imprisoning a person for the commission of an
absolute liability offence? Presumably no objection can be taken to attaching
penal consequences such as a fine to a validly enacted absolute liability
offence, only to penal consequences in the form of imprisonment if this gives
rise to a violation of s. 7  of the Charter . If it does, then the Court
is not only empowered, but obligated by the Constitution, to strike the section
down. 

 








119.            I have already indicated that in my view
a law which interferes with the liberty of the citizen in violation of the
principles of fundamental justice cannot be saved by s. 1  as being either
reasonable or justified. The concepts are mutually exclusive. This is not, of
course, to say that no limits can be put upon the right to life, liberty and
security of the person. They clearly can, but only if they are imposed in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice and survive the tests in
s. 1  as being reasonable and justified in a free and democratic society. Nor is
the government precluded from resort to s. 33  of the Charter  in order to
dispense with the requirements of fundamental justice when, in a case of
emergency, it seeks to impose restrictions on the s. 7  right. This, however,
will be a policy decision for which the government concerned will be
politically accountable to the people. As it is, s. 94 cannot, in my view, be
saved by s. 1  if it violates s. 7 . The sole question is whether it violates s.
7 .

 

120.            My colleague, in finding that s. 94
offends the principles of fundamental justice, has relied heavily upon the
common law which precluded punishment in the absence of a guilty mind. We are
not, however, dealing with a common law crime here. We are dealing with a
statutory offence as to which the legislature has stated in no uncertain terms
that guilt is established by proof of the act itself.

 

121.            Unlike my colleague, I do not think that
ss. 8  to 14  of the Charter  shed much light on the interpretation of the
phrase ""in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"" as
used in s. 7 . I find them very helpful as illustrating facets of the right to
life, liberty and security of the person. I am not ready at this point,
however, to equate unreasonableness or arbitrariness or tardiness as used in
some of these sections with a violation of the principles of fundamental
justice as used in s. 7 . Delay, for example, may be explained away or excused
or justified on a number of grounds under s. 1 . I prefer, therefore, to treat
these sections as self‑standing provisions, as indeed they are. 

 








122.            I approach the interpretive problem
raised by the phrase ""the principles of fundamental justice"" on the
assumption that the legislature was very familiar with the concepts of
""natural justice"" and ""due process"" and the way in which
those phrases had been judicially construed and applied. Yet they chose
neither. Instead they chose the phrase ""the principles of fundamental
justice"". What is ""fundamental justice""? We know what
""fundamental principles"" are. They are the basic, bedrock principles
that underpin a system. What would ""fundamental principles of
justice"" mean? And would it mean something different from ""principles
of fundamental justice""? I am not entirely sure. We have been left by the
legislature with a conundrum. I would conclude, however, that if the citizen is
to be guaranteed his right to life, liberty and security of the person‑‑surely
one of the most basic rights in a free and democratic society‑‑then
he certainly should not be deprived of it by means of a violation of a
fundamental tenet of our justice system.

 

123.            It has been argued very forcefully that
s. 7  is concerned only with procedural injustice but I have difficulty with
that proposition. There is absolutely nothing in the section to support such a
limited construction. Indeed, it is hard to see why one's life and liberty
should be protected against procedural injustice and not against substantive
injustice in a Charter  that opens with the declaration:

 

Whereas
Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the
rule of law:

 

and sets out the guarantee in broad and
general terms as follows:

 

1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to
such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society.

 








I cannot think that the guaranteed right
in s. 7  which is to be subject only to limits which are reasonable and
justifiable in a free and democratic society can be taken away by the violation
of a principle considered fundamental to our justice system. Certainly the rule
of law acknowledged in the preamble as one of the foundations on which our
society is built is more than mere procedure. It will be for the courts to
determine the principles which fall under the rubric ""the principles of
fundamental justice"". Obviously not all principles of law are covered by
the phrase; only those which are basic to our system of justice. 

 

124.            I have grave doubts that the dichotomy
between substance and procedure which may have served a useful purpose in other
areas of the law such as administrative law and private international law should
be imported into s. 7  of the Charter . In many instances the line between
substance and procedure is a very narrow one. For example, the presumption of
innocence protected in s. 11(d) of the Charter may be viewed as a
substantive principle of fundamental justice but it clearly has both a
substantive and a procedural aspect. Indeed, any rebuttable presumption of fact
may be viewed as procedural, as going primarily to the allocation of the burden
of proof. Nevertheless, there is also an interest of substance to be protected
by the presumption, namely the right of an accused to be treated as innocent
until proved otherwise by the Crown. This right has both a societal and an
individual aspect and is clearly fundamental to our justice system. I see no
particular virtue in isolating its procedural from its substantive elements or
vice versa for purposes of s. 7 . A similar analysis may be made of the rule
against double jeopardy protected in s. 11(h).

 

125.            How then are we to decide whether
attaching a mandatory term of imprisonment to an absolute liability offence
created by statute offends a principle of fundamental justice? I believe we
must turn to the theory of punishment for the answer.

 








3.               Punishment and Fundamental
Justice

 

126.            It is now generally accepted among
penologists that there are five main objectives of a penal system: see Nigel
Walker, Sentencing in a Rational Society, 1969. They are:

 

(1) to protect offenders
and suspected offenders against unofficial retaliation;

 

(2) to reduce the incidence
of crime;

 

(3) to ensure that
offenders atone for their offences;

 

(4) to keep punishment to
the minimum necessary to achieve the objectives of the system; and

 

(5) to express society's
abhorrence of crime.

 

Apart from death, imprisonment is the
most severe sentence imposed by the law and is generally viewed as a last
resort i.e., as appropriate only when it can be shown that no other sanction
can achieve the objectives of the system.

 

127.            The Law Reform Commission of Canada in
its Working Paper 11, ""Imprisonment and Release"", in Studies on
Imprisonment (1976), states at p. 10:

 

Justice requires that the
sanction of imprisonment not be disproportionate to the offence, and humanity
dictates that it must not be heavier than necessary to achieve its objective. 

 








128.            Because of the absolute liability nature
of the offence created by s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act a person can
be convicted under the section even although he was unaware at the time he was
driving that his licence was suspended and was unable to find this out despite
the exercise of due diligence. While the legislature may as a matter of
government policy make this an offence, and we cannot question its wisdom in
this regard, the question is whether it can make it mandatory for the courts to
deprive a person convicted of it of his liberty without violating s. 7 . This,
in turn, depends on whether attaching a mandatory term of imprisonment to an
absolute liability offence such as this violates the principles of fundamental
justice. I believe that it does. I think the conscience of the court would be
shocked and the administration of justice brought into disrepute by such an
unreasonable and extravagant penalty. It is totally disproportionate to the
offence and quite incompatible with the objective of a penal system referred to
in paragraph (4) above.

 

129.            It is basic to any theory of punishment
that the sentence imposed bear some relationship to the offence; it must be a
""fit"" sentence proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Only
if this is so can the public be satisfied that the offender
""deserved"" the punishment he received and feel a confidence in the
fairness and rationality of the system. This is not to say that there is an
inherently appropriate relationship between a particular offence and its
punishment but rather that there is a scale of offences and punishments into
which the particular offence and punishment must fit. Obviously this cannot be
done with mathematical precision and many different factors will go into the
assessment of the seriousness of a particular offence for purposes of
determining the appropriate punishment but it does provide a workable
conventional framework for sentencing. Indeed, judges in the exercise of their
sentencing discretion have been employing such a scale for over a hundred
years.

 








130.            I believe that a mandatory term of
imprisonment for an offence committed unknowingly and unwittingly and after the
exercise of due diligence is grossly excessive and inhumane. It is not required
to reduce the incidence of the offence. It is beyond anything required to
satisfy the need for ""atonement"". And society, in my opinion, would
not be abhorred by an unintentional and unknowing violation of the section. I
believe, therefore, that such a sanction offends the principles of fundamental
justice embodied in our penal system. Section 94(2) is accordingly inconsistent
with s. 7  of the Charter  and must, to the extent of the inconsistency,
be declared of no force and effect under s. 52 . I express no view as to whether
a mandatory term of imprisonment for such an offence represents an arbitrary
imprisonment within the meaning of s. 9  of the Charter  or ""cruel
and unusual treatment or punishment"" within the meaning of s. 12  because
it is not necessary to decide those issues in order to answer the
constitutional question posed.

 

131.            I would dismiss the appeal and answer
the constitutional question in the negative.

 

Appeal dismissed. The
constitutional question is answered in the negative.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Information—Failure to give
sufficient details to identify transactions—Information quashed—Mandamus—Whether
defect can be cured by the supplying of particulars—Whether information can be
amended—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 510, 729, 732—Aeronautics

2, s. 700.

The respondents were charged with 32 summary
conviction offences relating to the breaches of the Aeronautics Act and
the regulations issued thereunder. Following appellant’s refusal to provide
particulars, respondents, prior to plea, made an application to quash the
information containing those counts. A Provincial Court judge allowed the motion ruling that it did not satisfy the
requirements of s. 510(3) of the Criminal Code. He also ruled that
this was not a case where particulars should be ordered. The Court of Queen’s
Bench and the Court of Appeal upheld the quashing and dismissed appellant’s
application for writs of mandamus and certiorari. Appellant at no time
during the proceedings sought an order for particulars or made a motion to
amend the information.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The information was ab initio vitiated
for want of sufficient details as required by s. 510(3) of the Code and
was not remediable in the present circumstances. Under Part XXIV of the Criminal
Code—summary convictions—an information that fails to comply with

[Page 486]

either s. 510(1) or (3), if objected to
prior to plea, must be quashed and cannot be salvaged by particulars or by
amendment.

application for mandamus. Appeal dismissed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Can particulars or an amendment salvage
an information in a summary conviction matter which is found, upon motion to
quash taken before plea, to be vitiated for want of sufficient details as
required by s. 510(3) of the Criminal Code? That is the
issue before this Court.

The Facts

In January 1981, an information was laid against
the respondents containing 32 counts, 16 alleging breaches of the Aeronautics
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-3, and 16 others, breaches of the regulations issued
thereunder.

The counts alleging breaches of the Aeronautics
Act were all in this form, save variations as regards the dates:

AND FURTHER THAT on or between the 27th day
of March, A.D. 1980 and the 29th day of March, A.D. 1980, at or near the City
of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, did unlawfully operate a commercial air
service without holding a valid and subsisting licence issued under Section 16
of the Aeronautics Act, Revised Statutes of Canada 1970, C. A-3, contrary to
Section 17(1) of the said Act, and did thereby commit an offence under the said
Section 17;

[Page 488]

The 16 counts alleging breaches of the
regulations were in this form, dates also varying:

AND FURTHER THAT on or between the 27th day of
March, A.D. 1980 and the 29th day of March, A.D. 1980, at or near the City of
Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, did unlawfully operate a commercial air
service in Canada, while not holding a valid and subsisting certificate issued
by the Minister certifying that the holder thereof is adequately equipped and
able to conduct a safe operation as an air carrier, contrary to Section 700 of
the Consolidated Regulations of Canada 1978, C. 2 (formerly the Air
Regulations) as amended;

Counsel for the respondents was given access to
and reviewed documentation in the possession of the R.C.M.P. with respect to
the charges. He made an informal request for particulars of the commercial air
services and customers to which the information referred. Counsel for the
appellant ultimately decided not to furnish particulars voluntarily and
indicated that he would oppose an application for particulars. Rather than
making such an application, the respondents, relying on ss. 732(1) and 510(3)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, brought a motion to quash
the information. Appellant did not suggest the ordering of particulars, and did
not move to amend the information.

Statutory Provisions

Criminal Code

Section 729:

729. (1)
Sections 510 and 512 apply, mutatis mutandis, to informations in respect
of proceedings as defined in this Part.

(2) The summary conviction court may, if it
is satisfied that it is necessary for a fair trial, order that a particular,
further describing any matter relevant to the proceedings, be furnished to the
defendant.

Section 510(1), (2), (3):

510. (1)
Each count in an indictment shall in general apply to a single transaction and
shall contain and is sufficient if it contains in substance a statement that
the accused committed an indictable offence therein specified.

[Page 489]

(2) The statement referred to in
subsection (1) may be

(a) in popular language
without technical averments or allegations of matters that are not essential to
be proved,

(b) in the words of the
enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an
indictable offence, or

(c) in words that are
sufficient to give to the accused notice of the offence with which he is
charged.

(3) A count shall contain sufficient detail
of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused reasonable
information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against him and to
identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or
insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count.

Section 732:

732. (1) An
objection to an information for a defect apparent on its face shall be taken by
motion to quash the information before the defendant has pleaded, and
thereafter only by leave of the summary conviction court before which the trial
takes place.

(2) A summary conviction court may, upon
the trial of an information, amend the information or a particular that is
furnished under section 729, to make the information or particular conform
to the evidence if there appears to be a variance between the evidence and

(a) the charge in the
information, or

(b) the charge in the
information

(i) as amended, or

(ii) as it would have been if amended in
conformity with any particular that has been furnished pursuant to
section 729.

(3) A summary conviction court may, at any
stage of the trial, amend the information as may be necessary if it appears

(a) that the information has
been laid

(i) under another Act of the Parliament of
Canada instead of this Act, or

(ii) under this Act instead of another Act
of the Parliament of Canada; or

(b) that the information

(i) fails to state or states defectively
anything that is requisite to constitute the offence,

[Page 490]

(ii) does not negative an exception that
should be negatived, or

(iii) is in any way defective in substance,

and the matters to be alleged in the
proposed amendment are disclosed by the evidence taken on the trial; or

(c) that the information is in any
way defective in form.

(4) A variance between the information and
the evidence taken on the trial is not material with respect to

(a) the time when the offence
is alleged to have been committed, if it is proved that the information was
laid within the prescribed period of limitation, or

(b) the place where the
subject-matter of the proceedings is alleged to have arisen, if it is proved
that it arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the summary conviction
court that holds the trial.

(5) The summary conviction court shall, in
considering whether or not an amendment should be made, consider

(a) the evidence taken on the
trial, if any,

(b) the circumstances of the
case,

(c) whether the defendant has been
misled or prejudiced in his defence by a variance, error or omission mentioned
in subsection (2) or (3), and

(d) whether, having regard to
the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be made without injustice
being done.

(6) Where in the opinion of the summary
conviction court the defendant has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by
an error or omission in the information, the summary conviction court may
adjourn the trial and may make such an order with respect to the payment of
costs resulting from the necessity of amendment as it considers desirable.

The Judgments

Provincial Court of Alberta: Murray Prov. Ct.
J.

The Court held that the counts in the
information did not contain details of the circumstances of the alleged
offences sufficient to give the respondents reasonable information with respect
to the acts or omissions to be proved against them and to

[Page 491]

identify the transactions to which the counts of
the information referred and that, accordingly, the minimal requirements of
s. 510(3) had not been met.

The Court found that there was nothing in the
circumstances surrounding the information which would enlighten the respondents
as to the nature of the case to be met and that the respondents had not been
tardy in putting forward the defence that the information was inadequate.
Murray Prov. Ct. J. was of the view that it would be improper to compel the
respondents to plead to an illegal information and that this was not a case
where particulars should be ordered. Accordingly, the information was quashed.

Court of Queens Bench of Alberta

The Crown thereupon applied to Lomas J. for
remedy by way of mandamus and certiorari. Both writs were denied, for
reasons which were not made known to this Court.

Court of Appeal of Alberta

The Court relied on the judgment of Rinfret J.
in Brodie v. The King, [1936] S.C.R. 188, to the effect that an
indictment must provide concrete facts which would identify the particular act
which is charged and thereby give the accused notice of it. The Court of Appeal
agreed with the courts below that these requirements had not been met, and that
the information was “bad in law and not merely defective”. Accordingly this was
not, said the Court, a case where the information could be cured by the
supplying of particulars and it was proper to quash the information.

First I would like to deal very briefly with the
question of whether the counts in the information meet the requirements of
s. 510(3).

Respondents in their factum, arguing that the
information did not meet those requirements, expressed their views as follows:

[Page 492]

The information at bar is in the express
words of the language contained in S. 17 of the Aeronautics Act, R.C.S.
(1970) c. A-3 and s. 700 of the Regulations thereunder. In each instance,
the gravamen of the offence is the operation of a “commercial air service”
without the requisite licence or certificate. Regard must be had to
s. 9(1) of the Aeronautics Act, which defines “commercial air
service” as “any use of aircraft in or over Canada for hire or reward”. “Hire
or reward” is defined as “any payment, consideration, gratuity or benefit
directly or indirectly charged, demanded, received or collected by any person
for the use of an aircraft”.

The operation of a “commercial air service”
within the meaning of s. 9(1) of the Aeronautics Act could
therefore relate to a multitude of activities or usages of aircraft in Canada,
for example the use of an aircraft to haul passengers or freight, the use of an
aircraft as a demonstrator by a dealer or manufacturer, or indeed even the use
of the aircraft in a photo session for the purposes of advertisement of another
product such as liquor or cigarettes. The statute under which the Information
at bar has been laid casts a broad net and the prohibition is directed at many
diverse and unrelated uses of aircraft in Canada which by the language of
s. 9(1) are deemed to be the operation of a “commercial air service.”

I find this to be an accurate description of the
situation faced by the respondents. In agreement with what has been
specifically found by at least two of the three courts below (one expressed no
views), I am of the view that the information is ab initio vitiated for
want of sufficient details as required under s. 510(3).

The remaining and real issue in this case is as
follows: does a judge who has, upon a motion to quash made before plea, made a
finding that a count in an information is vitiated for want of sufficient
details as required under s. 510(3) of the Code, have a discretion
to order particulars, or to amend the count, or must the count be quashed? One
should recall that in this case no particulars were asked for nor were
particulars volunteered in court by the parties; neither did the Crown move to
amend. I should nevertheless not want to narrow the issues to the point of
leaving unanswered the question as to what could or should the judge have

[Page 493]

done had he been asked. In fact, I would find it
difficult to deal with the matter without answering those questions and have
therefore, framed the issue so as to encompass those aspects. I should however
make two observations: first, we are dealing with a summary conviction offence,
and what I say should be read in the light of the differences between ss. 516
and 529 governing amendments and particulars for indictable offences, and ss.
729 and 732 governing summary convictions; secondly, the motion to quash is one
taken before plea.

With great hesitation I have come to the
conclusion that Parliament has not given the trial judge any other alternative
but to quash the information, irrespective of whether or not particulars are
offered and of whether or not the prosecution moves to amend under s. 732.

My hesitation in reading the law as such is due
to the fact that it appears to me that Parliament needed not go so far in
ensuring the furtherance of the policy considerations which are recognized as
having inspired our various laws governing the charging process in criminal
law. A judge’s jurisdiction to interfere with the liberty of a citizen is
dependent upon the citizen becoming an accused. That will happen only if and
when he is charged with an offence known to the law. This is enacted by
s. 510(1). When accused, the citizen shall then be treated fairly. This
requires that he must be able clearly to identify what he is alleged to have
done wrong so that he may prepare his case adequately, and that at the outset
of his trial or thereafter once the trial is over and at some other court, he
must be able to argue that he has already been acquitted or convicted of the
offence or that he comes within the protective principles set out in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.

It therefore appeared to me, and still does,
that a judge when faced with a motion to quash for a

[Page 494]

count vitiated by virtue of s. 510(3), as
in this case, should be empowered (and normally should exercise such a power)
to order particulars. This course of action would meet all of the policy
considerations I have set out and would have the added advantage of getting on
with matters instead of seeing the information being laid anew (when possible)
and having further delays imported into the process. Be that as it may, that is
not the law and I can find no way of interpreting the law as such, short of
usurping Parliament’s prerogatives. I come to this conclusion for three
reasons: Parliament’s changes to the Code following this Court’s
decision in Brodie v. The King, supra; the fact that particulars have
never been considered as a proper means to cure vitiated informations for
defects of substance; and the wording of s. 729.

Section 510 is substantially the same as its
predecessor sections (ss. 852 and 853 of R.S.C. 1927, c. 36; R.S.C. 1906,
c. 146; and s. 611 of 1892 (Can.), c. 29) in force at the time of the Brodie
decision, except for s. 510(3) which then read as follows:

853. Every
count of an indictment shall contain so much detail of the circumstances of the
alleged offence as is sufficient to give the accused reasonable information as
to the act or omission to be proved against him, and to identify the transaction
referred to: Provided that the absence or insufficiency of such details
shall not vitiate the count.

(Emphasis added.)

The difference it will be noted is quite
substantial and is found in the last lines of the subsection: “Provided
that the absence or insufficiency of such details shall not vitiate the
count” whereas, s. 510(3) introduced in the new Code of 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, (as s. 492(3)) states “but otherwise the absence or
insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count”. (Emphasis added).
As of 1953-54, defects under s. 510(3) vitiated counts.

[Page 495]

Before commenting on the Brodie decision
and the effect of the changes to the Code in 1953-54, a review of the
law and of the cases prior to Brodie is in order as it will assist in
understanding the limitations to reconsider Brodie put upon this Court
by the 1953-54 amendments; also, when considering whether s. 729(2) (the
ordering of particulars) can be used to salvage a vitiated information.

The Code of 1892 enacted, as regards
charges, their contents and their quashing for want thereof, substantially the
same sections as those in force at the time of Brodie in 1936.
Though the sections appear to be different for informations, the courts at
the time dealt with defects in informations in the same way they had when
considering defects in indictments; apart from the inherent differences
resulting from the absence of any preliminary proceedings or evidence adduced
prior to arraignment in the case of summary convictions, the courts had as many
exigencies as to their content. (See, for example, R. v. King (1893), 25
N.S.R. 488; R. v. France (1898), 1 C.C.C. 321; Riopelle v. Desrosiers
(1900), 3 Q.P.R. 195; Re Fisher (1905), 9 C.C.C. 451; R. v.
Limerick, Ex parte Staples (1922), 39 C.C.C. 351; R. v. Jordan (1925),
44 C.C.C. 23; R. v. Henderson, Ex parte Brindle (1926), 45 C.C.C. 310).
That had also been the case in England, as appears from what is said in Saunders’
Practice of Magistrates’ Courts, 6th ed., 1902, at p. 41:

The information should give an exact and a
legal description of the offence, and it should contain the same certainty as
an indictment: (Ex parte Pain, 5 B. & C. 251; Re Elmy and Sawyer,
1 Ad. & Ell. 843; R. v. Marsh, 4 D. & R. 267; Cotterill
v. Lemprière, 24 Q.B. Div. 634; 62 L.T. Rep. 695.) Facts must be stated in
a direct and positive manner: (Rex v. Bradley, 19 Mod. 155; Rex v.
Fuller, 1 Ld. Raym. 509; Rex v. Pereira, 2 Ad. & Ell. 375); and
not be in the alternative: Rex v. Middlehurst, 1 Burr. 399; R. v.
Morley, 1 You. & Jer. 22; R. v. Marshall, 1 Mod. c. 158).

[Page 496]

The wording of the relevant sections in the
Code was similar to the equivalent sections in England in the Summary
Jurisdiction Act, 1879 (U.K.), 42-43 Vict., c. 49, s. 39. Section
39(1) of that Act, the forerunner of our s. 510(2), read as follows:

39. …

1. The description of any offence in the
words of the Act, or any order, byelaw, regulation, or other document creating
the offence, or in similar words, shall be sufficient in law; and

. .
.

That section had been perceived by some
(see Saunders, supra, at p. 42) as a relaxation of the common law
requirements for a valid information, which requirements had survived through
the courts notwithstanding statute law, which provided that (Summary
Jurisdiction Act, 1848 (U.K.), 11-12 Vict., c. 43, s. 1):

… no objection shall be taken or allowed to
any information, complaint, or summons, for any alleged defect therein in
substance or in form, or for any variance between such information, complaint,
or summons and the evidence adduced on the part of the informant or complainant
at the hearing of such information or complaint as hereinafter mentioned; but
if any such variance shall appear to the justice or justices present and acting
at such hearing to be such that the party so summoned and appearing has been
thereby deceived or misled, it shall be lawful for such justice or justices,
upon such terms as he or they shall think fit, to adjourn the hearing of the
case to some future day.

The clearest authority illustrating the English
judges’ resistance to statutory changes to the common law, relatively
contemporary to the introduction into Canada of the Code, is found in Smith
v. Moody, [1903] 1 K.B. 56, where Lord Alverstone C.J., dealing with a
defect in a charge governed by the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, supra, said
(at p. 60):

I was at first inclined to think that the
defect was cured by s. 39 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, which
provides that “the description of any offence in the words of the Act …
creating the offence, or in similar

[Page 497]

words, shall be sufficient in law”; but on
further considering the question, which is undoubtedly one of importance, it
seems to me that it could not have been intended by that section to do
away with the old rule of criminal practice which requires that fair
information and reasonable particularity as to the nature of the offence must
be given in indictments and convictions. All that is meant by s. 39 is
that the offence itself need only be described in the words of the statute
creating it.

In Canada, the courts split. One group of cases
(to mention but a few: R. v. France, supra; Re Effie Brady (1913), 21
C.C.C. 123; R. v. Armstrong (1916), 26 C.C.C. 151; R. v. Trainor (1916),
27 C.C.C. 232; Hatem v. The King (1927), 49 C.C.C. 164), appears to have
recognized codification for what it meant; the others (see amongst others: R.
v. Beckwith (1903), 7 C.C.C. 450; R. v. Goodfellow (1906), 10 C.C.C.
424; R. v. Bainbridge (1917), 30 C.C.C. 214; R. v. Desjardins (1919),
45 C.C.C. 100; R. v. Limerick, Ex parte Staples, supra; R. v. Jordan, supra)
treated the Code as Lord Alverstone had the 1879 Statute. This
latter group, in my view, overlooked an important difference between Canadian
and English law: the proviso in s. 611(4) of our 1892 Code (at the
time of Brodie, s. 853):

… Provided that the absence or
insufficiency of such details shall not vitiate the count.

The first group was of the view that the lack of
such “details of the circumstances” did not go to substance and therefore could
be cured by particulars or through amendment. The others, because they
considered such “details” as part of the substance of the information, found
that their lack in an information was fatal thereto.

Of particular importance, however, is the fact
that all agreed that defects of substance raised before plea by motion to quash
could not be cured, through particulars nor through amendment, notwithstanding,
as regards indictments, the text of s. 629 of the 1892 Code which
conferred wide powers to amend at that stage “any defect apparent on the face”
of an indictment. These words were inter-

[Page 498]

preted as referring to defects other than of
substance. (See R. v. Cameron (1898), 2 C.C.C. 173; R. v. Weir (No.
2) (1899), 3 C.C.C. 155; R. v. Weir (No. 5) (1900), 3 C.C.C. 499; R.
v. Desjardins, supra, and Taschereau’s Criminal Code, Carswell Co.,
1893, pp. 704 et seq.; contra: R. v. Hazen (1893), 20 O.A.R. 633; Ead
v. The King (1908), 40 S.C.R. 272 and R. v. Kerr (1922), 53 O.L.R.
228).

The courts agreed generally as to the effects
and as to the limitations to possible cures for a defect of substance; but they
really parted ways in determining when a defect was one of substance.

This Court in the Brodie decision came
down on the side of those who followed Lord Alverstone C.J., in Smith.

The charge preferred in Brodie was as
follows:

The Attorney-General of the province of
Quebec charges that: during the months of September and October in the year of
our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty‑three, at the city of
Quebec, in the district of Quebec, and elsewhere in the province of Quebec,
George H. Brodie, of Toronto, and G.C. Barrett, of Belleville, Ontario, were
party to a seditious conspiracy, in conspiring together and with one W.F.
Greenwood, W.G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs. A.M. Rose and also
with other persons unknown, thereby committing the crime of seditious
conspiracy.

This charge had been unsuccessfully challenged
by motion to quash. The accused were found guilty and the Court of Appeal for
Quebec upheld the conviction. That decision was then appealed to this Court.
Rinfret J. (as he then was) speaking for the Court, referred to s. 852
(now s. 510(1) and (2)) in the following terms, at pp. 193-94:

If section 852 be analysed, it will be
noticed the imperative requirement (“shall contain”) is that there must be a
statement that the accused has committed an indictable offence; and such
offence must be “specified.” It will be sufficient if the substance of the
offence is stated; but every count must contain such statement “in

[Page 499]

substance.” In our view, this does not mean
merely classifying or characterizing the offence; it calls for the necessity of
specifying time, place and matter (Compare dictum of Channel, J., in Smith
v. Moody, [1903] 1 K.B. 56, at 63), of stating the facts alleged to
constitute the indictable offence.

The manner of stating the matter is of no
absolute importance, in view of subsections 2 and 3. The statement may be
made in popular language, without any technical averments or allegations; or it
may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or declaring the
matter charged to be an indictable offence; but we think the latter parts of
subsections 2 and 3 are indicative of the intention of Parliament: the
statement must contain the allegations of matter “essential to be proved,” and
must be in “words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with
which he is charged.” Those are the very words of the section; and they were
put there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one of its main objects
being that the accused may have a fair trial and consequently that the
indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable precision the act or acts
with which he is charged, in order that he may be advised of the particular
offence alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.

What Parliament intended by using the words
“a statement *** (of) some indictable offence therein specified,” in
subsection 1 of section 852 is, to our mind, clearly illustrated by
the “examples of the manner of stating offences” given in Form 64, referred to
in subsection 4 of section 852.

Under the Interpretation Act (Ch. 1
of R.S.C., 1927), by force of sec. 31 (d):

wherever forms are prescribed, slight
deviations therefrom, not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead,
shall not invalidate them;

which obviously means that any substantial
deviation might be sufficient to invalidate the form used. Now, a perusal of
the examples given in Form 64 will be sufficient to indicate that in no case is
the manner of stating offences limited to the mere naming of them, but in each
case the act charged against the accused, though described in the words
of the enactment, is identified by specifying the time, the place and the
matter. We think the examples in Form 64 are referred to for the purpose of
indicating that they ought to be followed in substance. It is not sufficient
in a count to charge an indictable offence in the abstract. Concrete facts of a

[Page 500]

nature to identify the particular act
which is charged and to give the accused notice of it are necessary ingredients
of the indictment.

(Emphasis added.)

I pause here to mention the striking resemblance
between the underlined portions of his remarks and the wording of s. 853
(now s. 510(3)).

He then said, at p. 195:

As a matter of fact, this requirement of an
indictment is further embodied in sec. 853 of the Criminal Code, which
enacts that

Every count *** shall contain so much
detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence as is sufficient to give to
the accused reasonable information as to the act or omission to be proved
against him and to identify the transaction referred to.

Such is the rule of the Criminal Code.

Of course, it is qualified by the proviso

that the absence or insufficiency of such
details shall not vitiate the count,

and it must be granted that these words are
very strong. It should be noticed, however, that the proviso, as well as the
section itself, relates only to the “absence or insufficiency of details.”
It does not detract from the obligation resulting from sec. 852 that the
substance of the offence should be stated in the indictment.

He dealt with the charge, at p. 198:

Applying the above principles to the
present appeal, it follows that the indictment must be found insufficient. It
is not the case where an offence is imperfectly stated; it is a case where
essential averments were wholly omitted. The so-called indictment contains
defects in matters of substance. To use the apt words of counsel for the
appellants: “it does not describe the offence in such a way as to lift it from
the general to the particular.”

Finally he concluded the matter as follows, at
p. 199:

These averments were omitted and these
necessary ingredients were lacking in the indictment preferred against the
appellants. Their absence constitutes defects in matters of substance; and we
are of opinion that these defects were not cured by the so-called incomplete
par-

[Page 501]

ticulars verbally given by the Crown when,
at the outset of the trial, objection was taken to the indictment by counsel
for the accused. The Crown, it may be added, in the argument before us did not
rely on these particulars, and took the stand that the indictment was
sufficient as it stood. Nor can we accede to the argument that, in the
circumstances, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually
occurred and that we should exercise the powers given to us by sec. 1014
of the Criminal Code. In our view, it was a substantial wrong towards the
appellants to have compelled them to plead to an illegal indictment.

The motion to quash the indictment made by
the accused at the beginning of the trial, and before pleading, ought to have
been granted. The appeal will, therefore, be allowed. The indictment and the
conviction must be quashed, the Crown being at liberty to prefer a fresh
indictment, if so advised.

Of significance in Brodie is the import
to s. 852(1) of the “details” described in s. 853, and, the resulting
extension by the Court of the vitiating effect given to their absence in a
charge.

Brodie did not
settle much if one considers the thirty odd cases reported on point between
1936 and 1953. Evidently that decision’s disregard for the proviso set out in
s. 853 left it open to some courts to distinguish Brodie. As a
result, the two groups I referred to earlier carried on much the same, the only
difference being the opportunity for some to refer to Brodie for added
support, and the need for others to distinguish that decision. (See amongst
others: R. v. Griss, [1936] O.R. 604; R. v. Safeway Stores Ltd.
(No. 1), [1938] 2 W.W.R. 479; R. v. Container Materials Ltd., [1939]
4 D.L.R. 387; R. v. Imperial Tobacco Co. (1939), 72 C.C.C. 388; R. v.
Adduono, [1940] O.R. 184; R. v. Madill (No. 2), [1943] 1 W.W.R. 371;
R. v. Langlois (1944), 83 C.C.C. 124; R. v. McNab (1945), 61
B.C.R. 74; R. v. Rycer (1946), 2 C.R. 388; R. v. Hing Lee Yen (1947),
3 C.R. 352; R. v. Annunziello (1948), 6 C.R. 330; R. v. Brooks, [1951]
O.W.N. 513; MacDonald v. The Queen (1952), 14 C.R. 387; R. v. Steele (1952),
14 C.R. 285).

[Page 502]

This is probably what brought about action by
Parliament. Parliament made two changes to the law in this area in the Code of
1953-54.

First Change: The Proviso

Consolidating ss. 852 and 853, Parliament changed
the proviso of s. 853 as aforementioned by deleting the wording to which
the Court in Brodie, in my respectful view, did not give sufficient
heed, and substituting the wording we find today, wording which in my view
supports (ex post facto) the Brodie judgment. As a result
insufficiencies under s. 510(3) were as of then and are still today of the same
effect as those under s. 510(1). They vitiate, and the charge is no less
vitiated under s. 510(3) than under s. 510(1). That put an end to the
controversy on that point, as witness the decisions that followed the new Code
(see amongst others: Re Kipling’s Prohibition Application; Re
Juvenile Delinquents Act (1961), 36 W.W.R. 273; Shumiatcher v.
Attorney General of Saskatchewan (1962), 38 C.R. 411; R. v. Wixalbrown (1963),
41 C.R. 113; R. v. Harrison (1964), 45 C.R. 54; Taylor v. Gotfried (1964),
43 C.R. 307; R. v. Otterbein (1967), 50 C.R. 285; R. v. Hipke (1967),
59 W.W.R. 653; R. v. McAuslane (No. 2) (1972), 18 C.R.N.S. 9; Re
Regina and Marcoux (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 222; R. v. Tremblay, [1974]
R.L. 373; R. v. Cruz (1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 255).

Second Change: The Power to Amend

The Brodie decision, no amendment having
been sought in that case, did not deal with the power to amend defects of
substance. Added to that is the fact that the courts had read down, in varying
degrees, the existing power to amend to cure a count defective because of “an
omission to state or a defective statement of anything requisite to constitute
the offence …” (s. 889(2) Code of 1927). Furthermore, as mentioned
earlier, defects of substance were not curable. Parliament made them curable,
but only if, and only to the extent that the amendment could find support in
the evidence adduced at trial. Such is still the case today, and I cannot find
any support when reading s. 732, for the proposition that prior to there
being any evidence there can be an amendment for anything but

[Page 503]

a defect of form (s. 732(3)(c)) or one to
correct an erroneous reference to the relevant act allegedly breached (s.
732(3)(a)).

As regards particulars, the only change made to
the relevant sections was to extend to all matters the giving of
particulars. Very eloquent is the fact that the precise words (the words
“further describing”), upon which Brodie rested its finding that
particulars could not cure defects of substance, were not deleted or modified.
(See also, on the use of particulars: R. v. Sinclair (1906), 12 C.C.C.
20; R. v. Desjardins, supra; R. v. Buck (1932), 57 C.C.C. 290; R. v.
McNab, supra; R. v. Rycer, supra, dissent of O’Halloran J.A.; R. v.
Gotfried, sub nom. Taylor v. Gotfried, supra, reasons of Freedman J.A.; R.
v. Otterbein, supra; R. v. Klein, [1968] 4 C.C.C. (2d) 209; R. v. Aulik (1968),
64 W.W.R. 65; R. v. Stiopu (1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 464; contra: R. v.
McNicoll (1967), 50 C.R. 305 (obiter) and, to some extent R.
v. Toronto Magistrates, ex parte Bassett, [1967] 1 C.C.C. 251, and R. v.
Ostrove (1967), 60 W.W.R. 267.)

Brodie had
commented on those limitations to the availability of particulars and denied
them any curative effect when substance was involved, even when given formally.
Indeed, the judgment referred to a passage from the remarks of Mulock C.J.O. in
R. v. Buck, supra, one might assume with approval given what was said
afterwards, (though such approval is not mentioned), where he said, at
p. 293:

The true function of particulars is to give
further information to the accused of that which it is intended to prove
against him, so that he may have a fair trial. It is not intended to be in
effect the supplementing of a

[Page 504]

defective indictment by supplying that
which ought to have appeared in the indictment itself. This is very plain from
the reading of s. 859 of the Code.

Rinfret J. then went on to say, at p. 197:

That this is the correct interpretation of
sec. 855 is strengthened, in our view, by comparison with sec. 859
enumerating the cases in which particulars may be ordered.

Subsection (d) of
sec. 859 deals with the charge of selling, or exhibiting, an obscene book,
pamphlet, newspaper, printing or writing. If the court is satisfied that it is
necessary for a fair trial, it may order the prosecutor to furnish particulars
stating what passages in the book, pamphlet, newspaper or other printing or
writing are relied on in support of the charge. Which presupposes that the
book, pamphlet, newspaper, printing or writing has already been referred to in
the charge.

This is made still clearer in
subsections (e), (f) and (g) relating
to “any document or words the subject of a charge”; to “means by which any
offence was committed”; or to “any person, place or thing referred to in any
indictment.” Each of these subsections begins by the words: “further
describing,” which obviously contemplates indictments already describing the
document or words the subject of a charge, the means by which any offence was
committed, but requiring a “further” description which, in the view of the
Court, “is necessary for a fair trial.”

As for the “person, place or thing” dealt
with in subsection (g), the point is made doubly clear, since the
subsection speaks of a “person, place or thing (already) referred to in
any indictment”; and it is stated that a particular may be ordered “further
describing” them.

The evident relation between the matters
dealt with in subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g)
of sec. 855 and the corresponding subsections of sec. 859
is, we think, illuminating on the subject-matter of the present discussion.
Clearly the result flowing from the two sections read together is: that
some statement of the particular circumstances of the offence charged is
assumed to be already contained in the count; that there may be omissions
which, on account of sec. 855, are not sufficient to make the count
objectionable; that the count will not be deemed insufficient by reason only of
those omissions; and that if the court is satisfied that it is necessary for a

[Page 505]

fair trial, it may order particulars to
describe further, or with more precision the matters in question.

The limited change, in the light of this
context, to the section dealing with particulars is striking. Defects of
substance were and remain not curable through particulars, and I am unable to
distinguish between informations vitiated in their substance under
s. 510(1) and those under s. 510(3) in order to find cure through
particulars for the latter.

Appellant seeks support in three decisions. The
first is R. v. Otterbein, supra. As in the present case, a motion to
quash before plea was made for a failure to comply with s. 492(3) (now
s. 510(3)). Fraser J. having found such a defect said, at p. 292:

Having regard to the wording of
s. 492(3) and to the cases referred to it seems clear that the proviso at
the end of subs. (3) does not excuse failure to comply with the earlier part of
that subsection. Having regard to the same cases and to the wording of
s. 492(6) it seems equally clear that it is no answer to a motion to
quash brought at this stage to say that the defendant could demand or move for
particulars under s. 701(2).

(Emphasis added.)

Then, in obiter, he said of amendments:

While the question does not arise on this
application it would seem to me that, when objection was taken to the
sufficiency of the information, there was nothing to prevent it being amended
under the provisions of s. 704, had counsel for the Crown made an
application for that purpose. In this connection I refer to the judgment of
Schroeder J. (now J.A.), in Regina v. Peacock, [1954] O.W.N. 169, 18
C.R. 95, 108 C.C.C. 129. I do not in any way rest my judgment herein on the
opinion expressed in this paragraph.

It goes without saying that Fraser J. is clearly
against appellant’s position as regards particulars. As for his obiter remarks
concerning amendments, the text of s. 704 (now s. 732) makes it clear
that,

[Page 506]

except for defects of form or under
s. 732(3)(a), amendments can only be made if, and to the extent
that the matters to be alleged in the amendment “are disclosed by the evidence
taken on the trial”.

The second case referred to by appellant is R.
v. Miron (1974), 28 C.R.N.S. 261, a decision of the Ontario Court of
Appeal. That is a case where an amendment was made in the course of the trial.
With regard to such an amendment the Court of Appeal said, at p. 262:

We are of the opinion that as originally drawn
this indictment did not comply with s. 510(3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C
1970, c. C-34. The Crown’s case was not that the appellants had agreed to rob
someone not yet selected; it was that an agreement had been reached to rob a
specific person. However, under the authority of Regina v. Denis, [1969]
2 O.R. 205, [1970] 1 C.C.C. 86, and under the terms of s. 529(3) of the
Code, we think that the trial Judge had authority to amend the indictment, and
he did amend it so as to cure the defect.

The reference to the Denis decision makes it
clear that the amendment was made after plea and was supported by the evidence
adduced. Indeed, in Denis the amendment was made at the end of the Crown’s
case. Again I fail to see any support here for the appellant.

The appellant refers us also to R. v. Bengert
(No. 5) (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 481. That is a case where the motion to
quash was presented some five months into the evidence. The Court said, at
p. 506:

We think that the power of the Court to
make an amendment under the provision of s. 529(3) is greater than the
power of amendment which the Court had under the pre‑1955 Code. A
“defect in substance” must relate to a matter “essential to be proved”. That
being so, the Court has the power to amend an indictment which is defective in
substance, that is, an indictment which would be void if the Brodie case
was applicable. Moreover, we think that this approach is the “modern

[Page 507]

approach” to indictments as set out in such
decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada as R. v. Major (1976), 27
C.C.C. (2d) 239n, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 826, 40 C.R.N.S. 298; R. v. Côté (1977),
33 C.C.C. (2d) 353, 73 D.L.R. (3d) 752, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 8, and R. v. City of
Sault Ste. Marie (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 353, 85 D.L.R. (3d) 161, 3 C.R.
(3d) 30, [[1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299].

Then went on to say, at p. 507:

In view of the fact, however, that we have
concluded that the indictment in this case does conform to the requirements of
s. 510 we do not find it necessary to determine the extent of the Court’s
powers under s. 529(3)(b)(iii) or (c).

Added to the fact that the Court’s comments on
s. 529(3) were obiter, I find nothing there to support what
appellant advances in this case.

Finally, appellant invites us to take a
“remedial approach” when interpreting s. 732(3) and find that the words “a
summary conviction court may, at any stage of the trial, amend the information
…” include “before plea”. “The remedial approach”, says appellant, relying on Sisko
v. Attorney General of British Columbia (1977), 8 C.R. (3d) 372, and Re
Lakeview Motors Ltd. v. The Queen (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 475, “holds that a
trial commences at different times for different purposes” and that for
purposes of amendment of defects in a charge, a trial commences before plea.

With respect for the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, I cannot agree. I readily would adopt a flexible approach to the
definition of the word “trial” were it not for the fact that amendments under
s. 732(3)(b) are conditional to their subject matter having been
“disclosed by the evidence taken on the trial”. Whatever be the scope we give
under the section to the word “trial”, the amendment cannot be made before
that evidence is adduced.

To sum up, I am of the view that under Part XXIV
of the Code, an information that fails to comply with either
s. 510(1) or (3), if objected to

[Page 508]

prior to plea, must be quashed and cannot be
salvaged by particulars or by amendment.

Before dismissing, as a result, this appeal, I
should like to make a few comments on the vehicle the Crown chose for redress.
The Crown sought mandamus. Neither in the Court of Queen’s Bench nor in the
Court of Appeal of Alberta was an objection taken to that vehicle on the
grounds that the proper remedy was that of a stated case. Nor was the matter in
any way raised by the courts or counsel below or by counsel in this Court. This
is understandable having regard to the law as it now stands in Alberta (see R.
v. Canadian Pacific Ltd. (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 14).

Given the wording of s. 762 and the
decision of R. v. B & B Stone Ltd. (No. 2) (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d)
464, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, and to a certain extent that of
R. v. Schille (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 230, a decision of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, some might contend that this appeal could not, in any
event, have succeeded. Not having had the benefit of argument on that point I
would leave the matter open to be decided by this Court in a more appropriate
setting.

This appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Criminal Law — Attempted murder — Mens rea — Whether
requisite mens rea restricted to intent to kill or recklessly cause bodily harm
known to likely cause death — Whether s. 24 in combination with construc­tive
murder sections can form basis for attempted murder — Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, ss. 24(1), 212 (a)(i),(ii), 213(d).

Respondent, who wanted to speak with his estranged
wife, broke into an apartment building with a loaded sawed-off shotgun. Kurely,
the man with whom his wife had been living, went to investigate the sound of
break­ing glass and threw the chair he was carrying at respondent when he saw
him climbing the stairs. The gun discharged, missing Kurely, and a struggle
followed. Shortly after his arrest, respondent stated to police that he
""had him [Kurely] by the throat and I would have killed him."" The
trial judge found respondent had broken into the apartment building with the
intent to use the shotgun to force his wife to leave and convicted him of
attempted murder. The Court of Appeal over-turned that conviction and ordered a
new trial. At issue here is whether the mens rea in attempted murder is
limited to an intention to cause death or to cause bodily harm knowing it to be
likely to cause death, or whether the mens rea required extended to the
intention to do some action constituting murder as defined by ss. 212 or 213 of
the Code.

Held (Ritchie J. dissenting): The appeal
should be dismissed.



 



* The Chief Justice took no part in the judgment.

[Page 226]

Per Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard, Lamer
and Wilson JJ.: The mens rea for attempted murder is the specific intent
to kill and a mental state falling short of that level, while it might lead to
convic­tion for other offences, cannot lead to a conviction for an attempt. The completed offence of murder involves
kill­ing and any intention to complete that offence must include the intention
to kill. An attempt to murder should have no lesser intent. Nothing illogical
arises from the fact that in certain circumstances a lesser intent will suffice
for a conviction for murder. A person cannot intend to commit the unintentional
killings described in ss. 212 and 213 of the Code. Any illogic lies
in the statutory characterization of unintentional killing as murder.

The
crime of attempt developed as, and remains, an offence separate and distinct
from murder. While the Crown must still prove both mens rea and actus
reus, the mens rea is the more important element. The intent to
commit the desired offence is a basic element of the offence
of attempt, and indeed, may be the sole criminal element in the offence given that an attempt may be complete without
completion of the offence intended.

[Page 227]

Clayton C. Ruby and
Michael Code, for the respondent.

The following are the reasons delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—I am unable to distin­guish
this case from that of Lajoie v. The
Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 399, which is a unanimous judg­ment of this
Court and by which I feel bound.

I would therefore allow this appeal.

The judgment of Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIn­tyre,
Chouinard, Lamer and Wilson JJ. was deliv­ered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal
involves consider­ation of the mental element required for proof of the crime
of attempted murder, the subject of this Court's earlier judgment in Lajoie v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 399.

At the date of the events which give rise to this appeal the
respondent had been married some twenty-five years. His wife had left the
matrimoni­al home and was living with one Kurely. The respondent was depressed
and had been drinking to excess on the date in question. He telephoned his wife
at Kurely's residence and told her he was afraid that their twenty-three year
old son was about to commit suicide and asked her to meet him. She refused to
cooperate. Later the same evening the respondent broke into a friend's home
while its owners were absent and took away three shotguns. He sawed off the
barrel of one, loaded it, and taking some extra ammunition with him went to
Kurely's apartment building and gained entry by breaking the glass in the front
door. On hearing the noise caused by the breaking glass, Kurely came from his
bedroom to investigate, carrying a chair with a jacket hanging on it. He saw
the respondent, carrying the shotgun, ascending the stairs to the second floor.
He threw the chair and jacket, hitting the respondent. The gun went off. The
blast missed Kurely by some three feet but put a hole in the jacket which had
been on the chair. A struggle followed in which Kurely appears to have wrested
the gun from the respondent. When the police arrived, having been called during

[Page 228]

the course of the fight between the two men, Kurely was on the
floor with his head partly under a bed and with the respondent upon him
striking him weakly.

Shortly after his arrest the respondent stated to the police:

I just went over to see
my wife. I had phoned her earlier. I broke the window and went in. Then
I heard what sounded like a gun go off. You
are lucky you got there when you did.
I had him by the throat and I would have killed him.

According to the respondent's account of events,
the gun was discharged accidentally, although under tests conducted by the
police the weapon was not found to be prone to accidental discharge.

The respondent was charged with a number of
offences arising out of this affair but only one, that of attempted murder, is
involved in this appeal. It was contained in the first count of the information
and was in these terms:

... did attempt to murder Michael KURELY by discharging a sawed-off shotgun at him contrary to s.
222 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

He elected trial by judge alone and was
convicted. The conviction was quashed in the Court of Appeal and a new trial
directed. This appeal is taken by leave of this Court.

The trial judge disposed of the other charges
against the respondent and made a finding that he had broken into Kurely's
apartment building with intent to use the shotgun to force his wife to leave.
He said:

I turn now to the very real point of the charge of attempted
murder, and having made the finding I have of the break and enter at the house
at 108 6th Street, with intent to commit an
indictable offence, wither [sic] forceable
confinement or worse. Forceable confinement if you accept the evidence
of the Accused, I feel prob­ably worse than that.

He then referred to s. 213(d) of the Criminal Code which
is in these terms:

[Page 229]

213. Culpable homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while committing
or attempting to commit ... kidnapping
and forcible confinement ... breaking and entering ... whether or not
the person means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows
that death is likely to be caused to any human being, if

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon his
person

(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit
the offence, or

(ii) during or at the time of his flight after committing or
attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

Noting that breaking and entering with intent to
commit an indictable offence is one of the offences named in the section, he
convicted the respondent of attempted murder on the basis that the respond­ent
had carried and used a weapon in the course of a breaking and entry with intent
to effect forceable confinement of his wife.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal (MacKin­non
A.C.J.O., Dubin and Lacourcière JJ.A.) was written by MacKinnon A.C.J.O. He
accepted the submission by counsel for Ancio that the findings of fact which
formed the basis of the conviction were that the respondent committed the
offence of breaking and entering Kurely's residence and that he had in his
possession a weapon during the commission of the offence. He then considered
whether these findings of fact in the absence of any finding of an intent to
kill or cause bodily harm were sufficient to support a conviction for attempted
murder by the interaction of ss. 24(1) and 213(d) of the Criminal Code, and said:

There is no question in the instant appeal that the trial
judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to
break and enter the Kurrelli [sic] premises and intended to have in his possession
the sawed-off shotgun. The appellant was charged with the offence of attempted murder and the
""offence"" referred to in s. 24(1) is the offence of
""attempted murder"" and not the offence of break and enter while
carrying a weapon on his person. If death
had ensued in the instant case it would have been constructive murder,
but from

[Page 230]

the standpoint of an attempt, can there be an intention to
attempt an unintentional act without more?

and further:

In the law of attempts it is the mens rea which is fundamental and in the circumstances of this case
there must be the intention either to
mean to cause death or in the case of attempted murder, as now
established by R. v. Lajoie, meaning
to cause the victim bodily harm knowing it is likely to cause his death, and
reckless whether death ensues or not. The trial judge, according­ly in this
case, had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt (or a jury if one is
present) that the Crown has established the required intent under s. 212(a)(i)
or 212(a)(ii).

He then went on to hold that while there was
evidence before the trial judge from which he could have drawn the necessary
inferences regard­ing the intent to kill or cause bodily harm likely to cause
death, he had not done so, and as a result had not made the findings necessary
to support the conviction. Accordingly, the conviction was quashed and a new
trial was ordered.

The Crown contended in this Court that the Court of Appeal was in
error in holding that the mens rea in
attempted murder was limited to an intention to cause death (s. 212(a)(i)), or
an inten­tion to cause bodily harm knowing it to be likely to cause death and
being reckless whether death ensues (s. 212(a)(ii)).
The Crown's position was stated in its factum in these
words:

... the intention for attempted murder is not restricted to
an actual intention to kill or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm that
one knows is likely to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not,
but extends to an intention to do that
which constitutes the commission of the offence of murder as defined in
sections 212 and 213 of the Criminal Code. It is the Crown's position that
Section 24 and Section 213(d) in combination can form the basis for a
conviction of attempted murder. [Emphasis is mine.]

The respondent supported the judgment of the Court of Appeal
which followed the judgment of

[Page 231]

this Court in R. v. Lajoie, supra. In
that case it was held that a conviction for attempted murder could be sustained
where the Crown had shown on the part of the accused either an intent to kill
the potential victim or an intent to cause bodily harm which he knows is likely
to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not. Although reference
was made in Lajoie to the possibility of committing attempted murder as
defined in s. 213 (see concluding sentence on page 408), the respondent
and the Court of Appeal in the case at bar adopted the view that this was
merely obiter and MacKinnon A.C.J.O. disposed of the matter in these
words:

To interpret the quoted statement broadly
is not necessary to the decision in R. v. Lajoie. I do not read the judgment of the Court to
require us to give it the consequences I have recited. The essential
issue determined by R. v. Lajoie was that there can be a finding of an attempt to murder when it
is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused meant to cause the victim
bodily harm which he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether
death ensued or not.

The respondent submitted that the Crown's posi­tion,
that s. 213(d) coupled with s. 24(1)
described a further intent sufficient to warrant a
conviction for attempted murder, should not be accepted because there was no
authority to extend the con­cept of a constructive intent further than Lajoie
had taken it. While contending on the facts of this case that he was not
obliged to go further, he argued that in reason and logic a specific intent to
kill should be the only intent sufficient to ground a conviction for attempted
murder. It was said that the effect of the Crown's argument in extending the
concept of an attempt to s. 213(d)
of the Criminal Code would be to justify a
conviction for attempted murder in the absence of any mental element with
respect to the causing of death which would be to ignore the words of s. 24(1) specifical­ly
requiring an intent to commit the offence in question.

[Page 232]

Lying at the heart
of the controversy which arises in this case is the judgment of this Court in Lajoie, supra. In that case the appellant shot a
taxi-driver while attempting a robbery. The victim was struck by a bullet while
fleeing the scene but did not die. The appellant was charged with vari­ous
offences, one of which was attempted murder. At trial the judge instructed the
jury that in order to convict the appellant upon the attempted murder charge
they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that in shooting at the victim
the accused had the intent to kill him. He declined to act on the Crown's
request to charge the jury to the effect that, if they were not satisfied on
the question of the intent to kill, a conviction of attempted murder could also
rest upon proof of an intent to cause the appellant bodily harm, knowing it to
be likely to cause death and being reckless whether death ensued or not. The
appellant was found guilty of the lesser offence of discharging a firearm with
intent to endanger life.

On appeal the Crown
succeeded and a new trial was ordered. The majority, Branca J.A. and Nemetz
J.A. (as he then was) were of the view that the mental element or intent
required for an attempted murder was not limited to the intent to kill but
included as well those mental elements described in s. 212(a)(i) and (ii).
Branca J.A. said, at pp. 394-95 ([1971] 5 W.W.R. 385):

I am of opinion that in a charge of attempted murder, when the evidence discloses an intent to
commit murder as defined in the Code and the accused does or omits to do an
act for the purpose of carrying out that intention, he is
guilty of an attempt to commit that crime whether or not it was possible in the
circumstances to commit it. If
the evidence discloses any of the intentions referred to in ss. 201(a) (i) or 201(a)(ii)
or 201(c) or 202(a)(i)(ii) or
202(d)(i)(ii) the accused person may be found guilty of attempted murder.

Nemetz J.A. expressed agreement
with the reasons of Branca J.A. and after referring to certain of the

[Page 233]

authorities which have dealt
with this question concluded his reasons by saying, at p. 399:

It was ably argued by Mr. Lecovin, counsel for the
respondent, that the word ""attempt"" relates, in the first place, to
an endeavour to commit a crime, and accord­ingly there cannot be an attempt
unless the respondent was trying to commit the crime — in this case, to kill. I cannot accept this submission. I do not go so far as to suggest
that a trial judge must, in every case of attempted murder, charge on the
indirect intent found in s. 201(a)(ii). In some special set of circumstances it
may be inappropriate to charge on the indirect intent found in this subsection.
(I do not find it necessary, in this case, to consider subss. (b) and (c) of s.
201.)

However, upon the facts in this case I have
no doubt that the indirect intent described in s. 201(a)(ii) should have been
drawn to the jury's attention in order that the jurymen could consider whether,
in the circumstances, the accused meant to cause the victim bodily harm that
he, the accused, knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death
ensued or not.

Taggart J.A. dissented. He
recognized that there was authority which would support the positions taken by
both parties to the appeal, and he dealt with the leading cases and reached the
conclusion that to obtain a conviction for attempted murder the Crown must
prove that the accused intended to kill the victim.

In the Supreme Court
of Canada the appeal was dismissed. Martland J. wrote the judgment of the Court
and after a brief statement of the facts stated the question in issue, at p. 401, in these words:

The question of law, which is in issue in this appeal, as a
result of the dissent of Taggart J.A. in the Court of Appeal, is as to whether
the learned trial judge should have directed the jury that the intent, which
must be established to support a charge of attempted murder, is proven if the
jury is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant meant to cause
bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether
death ensued or not. Branca J.A. and Nemetz J.A. were of the opinion that the
learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury in this way. Taggart
J.A. took the opposite view.

[Page 234]

He recognized that there was conflicting authority upon the
question, but he expressed agreement with the majority of the Court of
Appeal and he said, at p. 405:

Section 210 of the Code provides that every
one who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life. Murder may be committed if the
accused means to cause death, but it may also be committed if he means to cause
bodily harm knowing that it is likely to cause death and is reckless whether
death ensues or not. If it can be established that the accused tried to cause
bodily harm to another of a kind which he knew was likely to cause death, and
that he was reckless as to whether or not death would ensue, then, under the
wording of s. 210, if death did not ensue an attempt to commit murder has been
proved.

He supported this conclusion by referring to the difference
between s. 264 of the Criminal Code of
1927, which was in these terms:

264. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life, who, with intent to commit murder,

(a) administers any poison or other
destructive thing to any person, or causes any poison or destructive thing to
be so administered or taken, or attempts to administer it, or attempts to cause
it to be so administered or taken; or

(b) by any means whatever wounds or causes
any griev­ous bodily harm to any person; or

(c) shoots at any person, or, by drawing a
trigger or in any other manner, attempts to discharge at any person any kind of
loaded arms; or

(d) attempts to drown, suffocate, or strangle any person; or

(e) destroys or damages any building by the explosion of any
explosive substance; or

(f) sets fire to any ship or vessel or any part thereof, or
any part of the tackle, apparel or furniture thereof, or to any goods or
chattels being therein; or

(g) casts away or destroys any vessel; or

(f) by any other means attempts to commit murder. 

and s. 210 of the 1953-54 Code, now s. 222:

[Page 235]

210. Every one who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for life.

He observed that s. 264 of the Criminal Code in its opening sentence included the words
""who, with intent to commit murder"" and that these words were omitted
and replaced with ""who attempts … to commit murder"" in the revision
which resulted in the enactment of s. 210. He concluded that
it was the presence of the words ""with intent to commit murder"" in
the former section 264 that led the court to conclude in R. v. Flannery, [1923] 3 W.W.R. 97, 40 C.C.C. 263, that only a specific
intent to kill would suffice to found a conviction for attempted murder and
that it was that intent which was considered to be essential by Lord Goddard in
Whybrow cited infra. In his view the omission of those
words in the enactment of s. 210 justified a construction of s. 24 which would
admit of a conviction for attempted murder without a specific intent to kill.

He then referred to the decision of this Court
in R. v. Trinneer, [1970] S.C.R. 638, which con­cerned the
application of s. 21(2) of the Criminal
Code and which involved consideration of the words ""the
commission of the offence"" as they appear in s. 21(2). The relevance of
the Trinneer case was explained
on the basis that the Court had there decided that the words ""the
commission of the offence"" meant commission in any of the ways
contemplated by the Code and
not merely its commission in the form of an intentional killing. He said, at p.
408:

Similarly, in my opinion, when s. 24(1) refers to ""an
intent to commit an offence"", in relation to murder it means an intention to commit that offence in any
of the ways provided for in the Code whether under s. 201 (now 212) or
under s. 202 (now 213).

There is no doubt that prior to this Court's judgment in Lajoie there was much uncertainty on
this issue caused by the differing views expressed by the courts on the matter.
In his dissenting reasons in Lajoie in
the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Taggart J.A. illustrated this point by
referring to many of the cases, including R. v.

[Page 236]

Flannery, supra;
R. v. Whybrow (1951), 35 Cr. App.
R. 141; R. v. Ménard, [1960] Que.
Q.B. 398n, 130 C.C.C.
242; Tousignant v. The Queen, [1960] Que.
Q.B. 767n, 130 C.C.C.
285, all of which supported his dissenting conclusion that the
specific intent to kill was required in order to justify a conviction on a
charge of attempted murder. He referred as well to R. v. Walker, [1963] Que.
Q.B. 578n, [1964] 2
C.C.C. 217; and R. v. Ritchie, [1970] 5 C.C.C. 336, which
adopted the other view and would support a conviction for attempted murder upon
proof of any of the intents specified in s. 212
of the Criminal Code.

In R. v. Flannery Stuart
J.A., speaking for the Alberta Court of Appeal (Clarke J.A. dissented in part,
but on another point), held in a case involv­ing a charge of attempted murder
that the intent to kill must be shown to ground a conviction. The Crown had
argued that if the accused meant to cause bodily injury which he knew to be
likely to cause death, and was reckless whether it did or not, the necessary intent
for a conviction was present. This proposition was rejected and, at pp. 265-66, Stuart J. said:

The contention was that the accused evidently did intend to cause Mary Steele a bodily injury which
was known to him to be likely to cause death and was reckless whether
death ensued or not, and that, therefore,
there was evidence of an intent to murder, the act described in the section amounting to murder. But the fallacy of this reasoning is this, that it is
simply because the actual intent to
kill may be absent that sub-sec. (b) is thought necessary at all. If
that intent exists then clause (a) covers
the case. Parliament evidently thought that even though the actual
intent to kill might not be shown, yet if the offender intends to cause and
does cause an injury which be knows to be likely to cause death and doesn't care whether it does or not
and death actually results, the offence should be treated as murder. But where death has not in fact resulted
and the charge is of an intention to murder coupled with acts apparently done for the purpose of carrying out that intention, i.e., of an ""attempt"" to
murder, as is indicated in the
marginal words of the Cr. Code R.S.C. 1906, ch.

[Page 237]

146, then we are of opinion that the actual intent to kill
must be shown. In other words the accused is deprived of the benefit of an
absence of actual intent to kill only where he has actually killed and has
intended to do an injury which he knows is likely to kill and is reckless
whether it does so or not. Where, luckily for him, the injured person does not
die then we thought and so decided that the actual intent to kill must be
shown. The obscurity or difficulty probably arises from the use in sec. 264 of
the words ""intent to commit murder"" instead of the words ""intent
to cause death."" The word ""murder"" being used, which, by virtue
of sec. 259 covers a number of different sets of facts and is, therefore,
pregnant with legal significance, one is in danger of being led to include in
the meaning of the word as used in sec. 264 everything that is to be found in
the defini­tion of murder given in all the clauses of sec. 259. But if this
method of interpretation were followed then reading 259 and 264 together we
would have the expression ""with the
intention to mean to cause to a person (not killed in fact) an
injury which, &c.""

This was obviously not intended by Parliament and I think
the expression ""with intention to commit murder"" must refer to that
simple ordinary type of murder which is covered by clause (a) of sec. 259,
namely, where ""the offender means to cause the death of the person
killed.""

In Whybrow Lord Goddard, speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal, in a
case where the trial judge had instructed the jury that:

If you are satisfied beyond all reasonable
doubt that on that evening of the 30th April he did connect up this wire in
such a way that it would pass the domestic supply in the skirting of the
bedroom along the wire to the socket in the cupboard, which in turn was
connected with the soap dish, and if you are further satisfied that in doing
that he intended to kill his wife or to do her grievous bodily harm, then he
would be guilty of attempted murder.

said, at p. 148:

There is no question that that was a misdirection, and the
jury should have been told that the essence of the offence was the intent to
murder as it was presented by the prosecution and as it had been dealt with
throughout the case.

[Page 238]

This case has frequently been cited as a concise statement of the
law of England on this point.

In Tousignant
the Quebec Court of Appeal followed their earlier judgment in Ménard and approved of the Whybrow decision. There were three
separate judgments written but all supported the proposition that an intent to
kill was a neces­sary element which must be shown by the Crown to procure a
conviction for attempted murder. The position taken by the court on this point
is summa­rized in the words of Hyde J., at p. 287:

All murder involves homicide and there can be no attempt to murder without an attempt to kill.
Basically, murder is committed when a person ""means to cause
death"" and does so (s. 201). By para. (c) of s. 201 the intent to cause death is replaced by the
commission of an act, for an unlawful
object, ""that he knows or ought to know is likely to cause
death"" so that when death occurs the
assailant is presumed to have intended it even though he may have desired ""to effect his
object without causing death or bodily harm to any human being"".
Without such express provision such a homicide, although culpable, would not
amount to murder.

R. v. Owens, [1970] 2 C.C.C. 38 (B.C.C.A.), supports the proposition that the
specific intent to kill must be shown in attempted murder, as does the English
case of R. v. Loughlin, [1959] Crim.
L.R. 518 (C.C.A.)

The opposing view to that expressed in the cases cited above
finds expression in R. v. Walker in
the Quebec Court of Appeal, R. v. Ritchie in
the Ontario Court of Appeal and, particularly, in Lajoie in this Court. In R.
v. Walker the accused was charged with attempted murder. He had been
the driver of the car in which his companions arrived at the scene of the crime
and attempted to make their escape after the commission of the robbery. In the
pursuit which followed one of the accused's companions fired several shots from
the moving car and wounded one of the pursuing officers. The appellant Walker
was charged with attempted murder. His guilt depended upon proof of a common
unlawful purpose under s. 21(2) of the Criminal
Code. The trial judge directed the

[Page 239]

jury that to convict they would
have to find that the unlawful purpose which was shared by the accused was to
shoot some person. The court held (Rinfret J.A. dissenting) that if the accused
and his companions formed an intention in common to commit armed robbery and to
drive away with the proceeds they were all guilty as parties to any offence,
such as attempted murder committed by one of them, if he knew or should have
known that it would be a probable consequence of carrying out the intention. It
was therefore possible upon such a direction that a conviction for attempted
murder could be recorded without a specific intent to kill. Rinfret J.A. in a
dissenting opinion adopted the view expressed in Ménard and Tousignant
and concluded that the appeal should have been allowed, because the
specific intent to kill had not been demonstrated and accordingly a conviction
for attempted murder could not be made.

In R. v. Ritchie the
Ontario Court of Appeal (Schroeder, McGillivray and Evans JJ.A.) held that a
conviction of attempted murder would prop­erly be made if the jury were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused meant to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not. Schroeder J.A., who wrote the
judgment of the court, chose between the opposing lines of authority with these
words, at p. 343:

The trend in modern criminal law is towards the expansion of
the concept of mens rea to
include reckless­ness as well as intention, and that is clearly exemplified in
ss. 201 and 202 of the Criminal Code. It is not easy to discern the
logic which underlies the view that the mental element required for an attempt
is that of a direct intention to bring about the actus reus of the crime
intended. I adopt the opinion expressed in R. v. Walker, cited supra,
and R. v. McLennan, cited supra, in preference to the
opinions expressed in the other cases which have been cited. I am free to do so
since I am unaware of any Ontario decision in which the principle relied upon
by appellant's counsel was adopted and applied.

[Page 240]

A great deal of the confusion surrounding the nature of the
intent required to found a conviction for attempted murder may well stem from
an assumption that murder and attempted murder are related offences which must
share the same mental elements. A brief review of the historical development of
the law relating to the two offences demonstrates that the crime of attempt
developed as a separate and distinct offence from the offence of murder.

In very early times murder was simply the kill­ing
of a human being. The law was concerned with the injury done to the family of
the deceased and the compensation which should follow. The conse­quence of the
killing was the important feature and the intent or mens rea was of little if any significance. Special mental elements
were recog­nized in statutes as early as the thirteenth century, and by the
fourteenth century the concept of malice aforethought had developed (see 13
Rich­ard 2, Stat. 2, c. 1). Thus two elements came to be recognized in murder:
the killing, and the malice aforethought, which in modern times has come to
mean the necessary intent or intents.

As the common law developed, the mental ele­ment
required for the commission of murder expanded to include both constructive
intent and knowledge of the likelihood of death as a result of a person's acts,
with recklessness as to whether death ensued or not. Murder was thus defined in
the Criminal Code when it was
enacted in 1892 in ss. 227 and 228 in these words:

227. Culpable homicide is murder in each of the following cases:

(a) If the offender means to cause the death of the person
killed;

(b) If the offender means to cause to the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender
to be likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;

(c) If the offender means to cause death or, being so reckless as aforesaid, means to cause such bodily
injury as aforesaid to one person,
and by accident or mistake kills another person, though he does not mean
to hurt the person killed;

[Page 241]

(d) If the offender, for any unlawful object, does an act
which he knows or ought to have known to be likely to cause death, and thereby
kills any person, though he may have desired that his object should be effected
without hurting any one.

228. Culpable homicide is also murder in
each of the following cases, whether the offender means or not death to ensue,
or knows or not that death is likely to ensue:

(a) If he means to inflict grievous bodily injury for the
purpose of facilitating the commission of any of the offences in this section
mentioned, or the flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted
commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury; or

(b) If he administers any stupefying or overpowering thing
for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death ensues from the effects
thereof; or

(c) If he by any means wilfully stops the breath of any
person for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death ensues from such
stopping of the breath.

2. The following are the offences in this section referred
to: —Treason and the other offences mentioned in Part IV. of this Act, piracy
and offences deemed to be piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful
custody, resisting lawful apprehension, murder, rape, forcible abduction,
robbery, burglary, arson.

In s. 228 as originally enacted there was no provi­sion
equivalent to s. 213(d) of the present Code. The
`use of weapon' provision was
enacted in 1947 in s. 7 of
an Act to Amend the Criminal
Code, 1947 (Can.), c. 55. Section 260 of
the 1927 Code was amended by
adding subs. (d):

(d) If he uses or has upon his person any
weapon during or at the time of the commission or attempted commission by him
of any of the offences in this section mentioned or the flight of the offender
upon the com­mission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues as a
consequence of its use.

which provision
appears as s. 213(d) in
the present Code in this form:

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon his
person

(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit
the offence, or

[Page 242]

(ii) during or at the time of his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence.

I would first observe that ss. 212 and 213 of
the present Criminal Code prescribe
the various mental elements which, if accompanied by a kill­ing, may amount to
murder. It is trite to say then that murder may be a killing with intent to
kill and it may also be a killing with a variety of other intents which involve
no intent to kill.

The offence of attempts developed much later
than the offence of murder. In early times an attempt to commit an offence was
not itself a crime. It was considered that in the absence of a guilty act
intention alone was not punishable. The modern offence of attempting the
commission of a crime is said to have its origins in the Court of Star Chamber.
An early venture into this field is found in The Case of Duels (1615), 2 St. Tr. 1033, which involved
proceedings against one William Priest for sending a written challenge to duel
and one Richard Wright for carrying it and a stick that was to be the measure
of the length of the weapons to be employed. It was asserted by Sir Francis
Bacon, then Attorney General, at p. 1041, that:

For the Capacity of this Court, I take this
to be a ground infallible: that wheresoever
an offence is capital, or matter of felony, though it be not acted,
there the combination or practice tending to that offence is pun­ishable in this court as a high misdemeanor. So
practice to impoison, though it took no effect; waylaying to murder, though it took no effect; and the like;
have been adjudged heinous misdemeanors punishable in this court. Nay,
inceptions and preparations in inferior crimes,
that are not capital, as suborning and preparing of witnesses that were never deposed, or deposed nothing
material, have likewise been censured in this court, as appeareth by the decree
in Garnon's Case.

[Page 243]

The court in its
decree gave effect to the Attorney General's submission saying, in part, at p.
1046:

And the court with one consent did declare
their opin­ions: That by the ancient law of
the land, all inceptions, preparations, and combinations to execute
unlawful acts, though they never be performed, as they be not to be punished capitally, except it be in case of
treason, and some other particular cases of statute law, so yet they are punishable as misdemeanors and contemps: and
that this court was proper for offences of such nature.

The practice of the
Court of Star Chamber in this respect became
firmly established in that court (see Hall, General
Principles of Criminal Law (2nd ed., 1960), p. 565 et seq., and was in time adopted in the Court of
King's Bench. It has been said that the origin
of the doctrine of crimi­nal attempt as it is known in the common law was Lord
Mansfield's judgment in R. v. Scofield (1784), Cald. Mag. Rep. 397. Scofield
was charged in an indictment with ""wickedly,
unlaw­fully and maliciously intending devising and con­triving to feloniously
set fire to, burn and consume a certain house"". Lord Mansfield said, at p.
402-03:

The next question is, Whether an act done in pursu­ance of
an intent to commit an act, which, if compleat­ed, would be a misdemeanor only,
can itself be a misdemeanor? It was objected, that an attempt
to commit a misdeameanor was no offence: but no authority for this is cited;
and there are many on the other side: as the case cited; of The King v. Johnson, the King v. Sutton, which was an indictment
for having in custody and possession stamps with
intent to impress septres on sixpences, etc. And
there the court say ""lading wool is lawful, but, if it be with an intent to transport it, that makes it
an offence. Here the intent is the offence; and the having in his custody, an
act that is the evidence of that intent."" But in the case of the wool, the
transport­ing of it was only a misdemeanor,
yet an act done to that end was held indictable. In the King v. Taylor, the Court granted an
information as for a nuisance for keeping great quantities of gunpowder to the
endanger­ing of the church and houses where
the defendant lived. There is also the case cited of the King v. Samuel Vaughan, which is founded
upon the same principle as that of the King v.
Plympton; where it was holden that to bribe a
corporator by money or promises to vote at

[Page 244]

corporation elections is an offence, for
which an infor­mation will lie: the case of
Vaughan was that of offering a bribe
for an office, and if received, and the office procured, neither party would
have been guilty of more than a misdemeanor:
and it is laid down by the Court in the case of the King v. Langley that words directly
tending to a breach of the peace, are indictable.

There was a distinction made at the bar between an act done
with an intent to commit a felony and an act done with an intent to commit a
misdemeanor. In the degrees of guilt there is
great difference in the eye of the law,
but not in the description of the offence. So long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not
punishable by our laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law
judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and,
if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself
would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes
criminal and punishable. The case cited of the King v. Sutton is an express authority. We are therefore of
opinion that the indictment is good.

Whether Scofield was the starting point for the common law doctrine is doubted by Hall (op.
cit., pp. 569-70) but
the question seems to have been settled in R. v. Higgins (1801), 2 East 5, 102 E.R. 269, where it was said, at E.R. 274, by Grose J.:

First, as to the offence
itself, it must be admitted that an attempt to commit a felony is in
many cases at least a misdemeanor;

Any doubt remaining regarding
the existence of the offence of attempted murder in England was set to rest by the
enactment in 1861 of 24 and
25 Victoria, c. 100, ss. 11-15. These sections made it a felony to
attempt the commission of murder in the various ways described.

[Page 245]

In Canada the common law
offence of attempt was codified in the 1892 Criminal Code as s. 64 which
appeared in these terms:

64. Every one who, having an intent to
commit an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of accom­plishing his
object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence
intended whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit such
offence or not.

2. The question whether an act done or
omitted with intent to commit an offence is or is not only preparation for the
commission of that offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit
it, is a question of law.

A minor amendment in 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, changed
the section to its present form in s. 24:

24. (1) Every one who,
having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits to do anything for
the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible
under the circumstances to commit the offence.

(2) The question whether an act or omission
by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere
preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to
commit the offence, is a question of law.

The section has therefore
covered the law of attempt in general since the codification of the
law in 1892. In addition, particular provision has been made in the Criminal Code for the offence of attempted murder. In the 1892 Code, s. 232 provided:

232. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to imprisonment for life, who does any of the following
things with intent to commit murder; that is to say—

(a.) administers any poison or other destructive thing to
any person, or causes any such poison or destructive thing to be so
administered or taken, or attempts to administer it, or attempts to cause it to
be so adminis­tered or taken; or

(b.) by any means whatever wounds or causes any grievous
bodily harm to any person; or

(c.) shoots at any person, or, by drawing a trigger or in
any other manner, attempts to discharge at any person any kind of loaded arms;
or

[Page 246]

(d.) attempts
to drown, suffocate, or strangle any person; or

(e.) destroys or damages any building by the explosion of
any explosive substance; or

(f.) sets fire to any ship or vessel or any part thereof, or
any part of the tackle, apparel or furniture thereof, or to any goods or
chattels being therein; or

(g.) casts away or destroys any vessel; or

(h.) by any other means attempts to commit murder. In the
1906 and 1927 Codes s. 264 provided :

264. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to imprisonment for life, who, with intent to commit murder,

(a) administers any poison or other destructive thing to any
person, or causes any poison or destructive thing to be so administered or
taken, or attempts to administer it, or attempts to cause it to be so
administered or taken; or

(b) by any means whatever wounds or causes any grievous
bodily harm to any person; or

(c) shoots at any person, or, by drawing a trigger or in any
other manner, attempts to discharge at any person any kind of loaded arms; or

(d) attempts
to drown, suffocate, or strangle any person; or

(e) destroys or damages any building by the explo­sion of
any explosive substance; or

(f) sets fire to any ship or vessel or any part of the
tackle, apparel or furniture thereof, or to any goods or chattels being
therein; or

(g) casts away or destroys any vessel; or

(h) by any other means attempts to commit murder.

And in the 1953-54 Code, s. 210 dealt with the matter in these words:

210. Everyone who attempts by any means to commit murder is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

This section appears as s. 222 in
the present Code. (I have been greatly assisted in this review by the
very helpful summary of the subject written by

[Page 247]

Laidlaw J.A. in R. v. Cline (1956), 115 C.C.C.
18.)

It is clear from the
foregoing that in common law and under the criminal law of Canada crimi­nal
attempt is itself an offence separate and dis­tinct from the crime alleged to
be attempted. As with any other crime, the Crown must prove a mens rea, that is, the intent to commit the offence in
question and the actus
reus, that is, some
step towards the commission of the offence attempted going beyond mere acts of
preparation. Of the two elements the more significant is the mens rea. In R. v. Cline, supra, Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal, said, at p. 27:

Criminal intention alone is insufficient to establish a criminal attempt. There must be mens rea and also an act us reus. But it is to be observed that whereas in most crimes it is the actus reus which
the law endeavours to prevent, and the mens rea is only a necessary
element of the offence, in a criminal attempt
the mens rea is of primary importance and the actus
reus is the necessary element.

and in Russell on Crime (12th ed.), vol. 1, p. 175, it is said:

Since the mischief contained in an attempt depends upon the
nature of the crime intended, the criminality lies much more in the intention
than in the acts done.

This proposition was
accepted by Lord Goddard in Whybrow, supra, at
p. 147, where he stated that ""the intent becomes the principal ingredient
of the crime"".

The common law recognition of
the fundamen­tal importance of intent in the crime of attempt is carried
forward into the Criminal Code. A reading of s. 24 of the Code and
all its predecessors since the enactment of the first Code in
1892 confirms that the intent to commit the desired offence is a basic element
of the offence of attempt. Indeed, because the crime of attempt may be complete
without the actual commission of any other offence and even without the
performance of any act unlawful in itself, it is abundantly clear that

[Page 248]

the criminal element
of the offence of attempt may lie solely in the intent. As noted by Glanville
Williams, Criminal Law; The General Part (2nd ed., 1961), part 207, p. 642, in discussing
attempts:

An actus reus ... need not be a crime apart from the state of mind. It need not even be a tort or a moral wrong, or a social mischief.

The question now arises: What
is the intent required for an attempt to commit murder? As has been indicated
earlier, the Crown's position is that the intent required for a conviction on a
charge of attempt to murder is the intent to do that which will, if death is
caused, constitute the commission of murder as defined in ss. 212 and 213 of
the Code, so that a combination
of ss. 24 and 213(d) can form the basis for a conviction of attempted murder.
The respondent, on the other hand, argues that although the authorities
presently limit the intent to that which would constitute murder as defined in
s. 212 of the Code, logic and principle dictate that the intent should
be limited to the specific intent to kill described in s. 212(a)(i).

While it is clear from ss. 212 and
213 of the Criminal Code
that an unintentional killing can be
murder, it is equally clear that whatever mental elements may be involved and
whatever means may be employed there cannot be a murder without a killing. Section 24 of the Code defines,
in part, the offence of attempt as ""having an intent to commit an
offence"". As Estey J. observed in R. v. Quinton, [1947] S.C.R. 234, at pp. 235-36, in referring to
the then s. 72 (now s. 24):

This section requires that one to be guilty
of an attempt must intend to commit the
completed offence and to have done some act toward the accomplishment of
that objective.

The completed offence of murder
involves a kill­ing. The intention to commit the complete offence

[Page 249]

of murder must
therefore include an intention to kill. I find it impossible to conclude that a
person may intend to commit the unintentional killings described in ss. 212 and
213 of the Code. I am then of the view that the mens rea for an
attempted murder cannot be less than the specific intent to kill.

As I have said
earlier, there is a division of opinion upon this point and strong arguments
have been raised in favour of the Crown's position that a ""lesser
intent"", such as that provided in s. 212(a)(ii) or even no intent at all
relating to the causing of death as provided in s. 213(d), may suffice
to found a conviction for attempted murder. This view is supported in Lajoie. In
my view, with the utmost respect for those who differ, the sections of the Criminal
Code relied on in that case do not support that position.

As noted above,
Martland J.'s analysis of the intent required to found a conviction for
attempted murder is based primarily on the change in word­ing of s. 222. In
my opinion, emphasis on the amendment of this section is unwarranted for two
reasons. Firstly, s. 222 does not define or create the offence of
attempted murder. The scheme of the Criminal Code in relation to
attempts has been the same from its inception. One section defines the offence
of attempts generally (s. 72, now s. 24). Another sets out the penalties
for attempts (s. 57, now s. 421), and a third creates a separate penalty for
attempted murder (s. 264, s. 210 in Lajoie, now s. 222). Rather
than defining or creat­ing an offence, s. 222 merely fixes a penalty for
a specific attempt. Despite the categorization of the various means of
committing murder set out in the old s. 264, there is no essential
difference between the old and the new sections in this respect.

Secondly, the
elimination of the words ""with intent to commit murder"" from s. 264
is not

[Page 250]

significant, Section
24 defines an attempt as ""hav­ing an intent to commit an offence"".
Because s. 24 is a general section it is necessary to `read in' the offence in
question. The offence of attempted murder then is defined as ""having an
intent to commit murder"". This does not differ from the old s. 264
reference to ""with intent to commit murder"", which Martland J.
acknowledged was inter­preted, in R. v.
Flannery, to require
the specific intent to kill.

Martland J. placed
further emphasis on s. 222 of the Criminal Code by relying on the words ""attempts by any means"" to support his
conclusion that murder may be attempted in any of the ""ways"" set out
in ss. 212 and 213. In my view, the reference to ""any means"" in s.
222 refers to ways in which a murder could be accomplished, such as by
poisoning, shooting, or stabbing. The earlier version of s. 222 (s. 232 in
1892, s. 264 in 1906) listed the various methods by which a killing could be
effected, but the illustrations were replaced in the 1953-54 revision with a
general reference to murder ""by any means"". In any event, ss. 212 and
213 have nothing to do with the means of killing. They are concerned solely
with describing the mental elements which will suffice to make a completed
killing murder. The fact that certain mental elements, other than an intent to
kill, may lead to a conviction for murder where there has been a killing does
not mean that anything less than an intent to kill will suffice for an attempt
at murder.

It was argued, and
it has been suggested in some of the cases and academic writings on the
question, that it is illogical to insist upon a higher degree of mens rea for attempted murder, while accepting a lower
degree amounting to recklessness for murder. I see no merit in this argument.
The intent to kill is the highest intent in murder and

[Page 251]

there is no reason
in logic why an attempt to murder, aimed at the completion of the full crime of
murder, should have any lesser intent. If there is any illogic in this matter,
it is in the statutory characterization of unintentional killing as murder. The
mens rea for attempted murder is, in my view, the specific intent to
kill. A mental state falling short of that level may well lead to convic­tion
for other offences, for example, one or other of the various aggravated
assaults, but not to a conviction for an attempt at murder. For these reasons,
it is my view that Lajoie should no longer be followed.

I would accordingly
dismiss the Crown's appeal and confirm the Court of Appeal's order for a new
trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Transferred
intent—Murder—Accused failed to kill intended victim but mistakenly killed two
others—Jury charged that accused liable to conviction for first degree
murder—Whether or not jury properly charged—Whether or not “planned and
deliberate” in s. 214 relates to intended or actual victims—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 205, 212(b), 214(2).

Appellant had planned to kill his wife but in
carrying out his plan killed his two young children instead. The trial judge
charged the jury that appellant could be convicted of the first degree murder
of his children if the jury were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
appellant had planned to kill his wife. The issue here is whether the Ontario
Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the trial judge had correctly
charged the jury.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Ritchie,
Dickson, Estey, Mclntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: Planning and deliberation
with the relation to the killing of a specific person makes the offence first
degree murder when in the course of carrying out the plan the accused in fact
kills someone else.

The question of liability for first degree
murder is one of statutory interpretation and does not depend on the doctrine
of “transferred intent”. Section 214(2) does not create a separate substantive
offence of first degree murder; it classifies for sentencing purposes the
substantive offence of murder as defined by ss. 212 and 213. Under s. 212(b)
it is murder when a person, meaning to cause the death of a human being, by
accident or mistake causes the death of another human being. Section 214(2)
classifies as first degree, a murder committed in any of the relevant ways
specified in the Code, if that murder was planned and deliberate. The
element of

[Page 209]

planning and deliberation required by s.
214(2) relates to the specific mens rea of the applicable section—in the
present case, under s. 212(b), to the intention to cause death to the
wife. When s. 214(2) is combined with s. 212(b) the identity and
character of any victim is entirely irrelevant. This conclusion also accords
with the policy rationale underlying s. 214(2) which imposes a harsher
penalty because of the added moral culpability to a murder that is planned and
deliberate. This added culpability relates to planning and deliberation with
regard to the taking of a human life and not with regard to the identity of the
victim.

Per Wilson J.:
Murder is in the first degree when “it” is planned and deliberate. Under s.
212(b) an intent to murder one person is sufficient mens rea if,
by accident or mistake, the accused kills another. Planning and deliberating
the murder of the intended victim and killing by accident or mistake another
person is therefore sufficient to make the killing of the unintended victim
planned and deliberate.

David Watt, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Ritchie, Dickson, Estey,
Mclntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—Murder is first degree murder when it
is planned and deliberate. The appellant Rolf Arthur Droste planned, and
deliberated upon, the killing of his wife. In the course of carrying out that
plan he caused the death of his two young children, Rolf Maurice Droste and
Monique Jean Droste. His wife survived. The case is here by leave of this Court
upon the following question:

[Page 210]

Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of
Ontario err in law in holding that the learned trial Judge had correctly
charged the jury that, if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the Appellant herein had planned and deliberated to kill his wife, then he
could be convicted of the first degree murder of his children, Rolf Maurice
Droste and Monique Jean Droste.

I The Facts

Mr. Droste, his wife and two children were
invited to a birthday party at the house of friends. The morning of the day
upon which the party was to be held Mr. Droste went to a gas station. He filled
the gas tank of the car. At the same time he filled five gallon container with
gasoline. Later, he cleaned the back seat of the car using gas from the five
gallon container. He testified that the seat was oily, some snowmobile parts
having been placed on it at an earlier date. He reactivated the seat belts in
the rear seat of the vehicle. Shortly after noon Mr. Droste, his wife and
the children left for the party; the children were strapped in the back seat by
the seat belts. Mrs. Droste noticed the smell of gasoline when she entered the
vehicle. En route, as the vehicle was approaching a bridge, flames began
to shoot up between the two front seats. Mr. Droste attempted to extinguish
them with his right hand. Mrs. Droste testified that her husband then took
a screwdriver from under his seat and began hitting her on the left side of the
head, at the same time yelling at her to let go the steering wheel. The vehicle
crashed into the bridge abutment. Mr. Droste fell forward on the steering wheel
and was temporarily incapacitated. Mrs. Droste got out through the door on the
driver’s side as the passenger door would not open; she helped her husband out
of the vehicle. Mr. and Mrs. Droste tried to get the children out of the
back seat of the car but were unable to do so. The children died from asphyxia
due to smoke inhalation.

Crown evidence was to the effect that four
gallons of gasoline had been used out of the five gallon container found in the
trunk of the car. In the opinion of the Crown’s experts the fire did not

[Page 211]

start in the engine; it was caused by an
accelerant used in the interior of the vehicle.

The Crown adduced other damning evidence. A
co-worker of Mr. Droste testified that Droste had been telling him of various
plans to kill Mrs. Droste. The final plan involved crashing a motor vehicle
into a tree, starting a fire inside the vehicle and leaving Mrs. Droste to die.
Other co-workers gave evidence that Droste told them he was going to kill his
wife. There was evidence that Mr. Droste was sexually involved with a married
woman at the time of the occurrence and that he desired to collect the proceeds
of an insurance policy recently placed on the life of Mrs. Droste.

Mr. Droste was indicted on two charges, namely,
first degree murder of each child. The trial judge instructed the jury that if
they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Droste had planned and
deliberated to kill his wife, then he could be convicted of the first degree
murder of his children.

In the absence of the jury he explained to
counsel the basis of his charge:

I am relying primarily on the wording of
214(2). There is no reference therein which would restrict the applicability to
the intended victim, and I realize it is arguable, but it seems to me if a
murder is established under 212(b) the planning and deliberation may relate to
the murder of an intended victim whereas the actus rea [sic] relates
to the unintended victim, otherwise you would never have first degree murder in
circumstances where all the components are proven with reference to A and the
unintended victim B, is killed.

I am also of the view that this approach is
consistent with the doctrine of transferred malice as outlined in Glanville
Williams; The Criminal Law, the General part 2nd Edition, pages 125 to 137. It
is a difficult problem and I appreciate the submission, but in putting the
charge together I concluded that the element of planning and deliberation could
be in relation to an intended victim when the charge was laid under 212(b).

[Page 212]

The jury returned a verdict of guilty on each
charge. Mr. Droste appealed and the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the trial judge had
correctly charged the jury. The sole question in this appeal is whether the
Court of Appeal was correct in so holding.

II The Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario

Martin J.A. delivered judgment for a
unanimous Court. After reciting the facts, he referred to the submission of
counsel for Mr. Droste, renewed in this Court, that a conviction for first
degree murder cannot be supported on the basis that the accused planned and
deliberated the killing of his wife and by accident or mistake caused the death
of his children; that ss. 212(b) and 214(2) of the Criminal Code cannot
be combined to found a conviction for first degree murder and that the trial
judge had erred in failing so to instruct the jury. Counsel contended that the
death of the victim must be planned and deliberate.

Section 212(b) reads:

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

…

(b) where a person, meaning to cause
death to a human being or meaning to cause him bodily harm that he knows is
likely to cause his death, and being reckless whether death ensues or not, by
accident or mistake causes death to another human being, notwithstanding that
he does not mean to cause death or bodily harm to that human being;…

Section 214(2) reads:

214. …

(2) Murder is first degree murder when it is
planned and deliberate.

The conclusion of the Court of Appeal on the
point under discussion will be found in the following passage:

We think that the trial judge correctly
instructed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the appellant’s intention to kill his wife was planned and deliberate and that
in the course of the

[Page 213]

carrying out that intention he caused the
death of the children by accident or mistake, that the resulting murder
constituted first degree murder.

Section 214(2) provides that “murder” is
first degree murder when “it” is planned and deliberate. Where murder as
defined by s. 212(b) is committed and that murder is planned and deliberate the
murder is first degree murder even though the planned and deliberate intention
to kill took effect on a person other than the intended victim.

The Court considered the law to be correctly
stated by Professor Mewett in the following passage from an article entitled First
Degree Murder (1978-79), 21 Crim. L.Q. 82, at p. 83:

Section 212(b) does not seem to
cause problems, at least where it applies by virtue of meaning to cause someone
else’s death. Since it is the murder that has to be planned and deliberate and
since the effect of s. 212(b) is merely to enact that an intent to
murder A is sufficient mens rea if by accident or mistake, the accused
kills B, then it would seem that planning and deliberating the murder of A and
by accident or mistake killing B would make the “murder” of B (for so it is
defined in s. 212(b)) planned and deliberate.

The Court continued:

We are also of the view that the
transferrence of a planned and deliberate intention to kill one person to the
actual victim is in accord with the general principles of the criminal law.
Clearly, the moral culpability of one who intends to kill one person, preceded
by planning and deliberation, but who by accident or mistake kills another
person, is the same as if he had succeeded in killing his intended victim. As
Rothman, J., said in Charest v. Beaudoin J.S.P. (1980), 18 C.R. (3d) 58
at 62-3:

An accused may deliberate for months,
weighing the advantages and consequences of killing his intended victim, “A”.
He may do a great deal of planning: recruiting an accomplice, selecting a
weapon, keeping “A” under surveillance and finally choosing his moment to do
the killing. If by some mischance—poor marksmanship or the sudden emergence of
another person—he kills “B” instead of “A”, surely his planning and
deliberation is no less than it would have been if he had killed “A”. All of
the same ingredients of planning and deliberation remain unchanged. The only
change is in the identity of the person whose

[Page 214]

death is caused, and this, it seems to me, is
entirely irrelevant to the question of whether the murder was planned and
deliberate.

Any other conclusion would, in my opinion,
be logically ludicrous and absurd in its consequences. Parliament could hardly
have intended to punish premeditated murder less severely where an accused
kills a perfect stranger than it would otherwise punish an accused for the same
premeditation if he had managed to kill his intended victim.

In short I conclude that a murder that is
planned and deliberate does not cease to be planned and deliberate because a
mistake is made in the victim. In my opinion, s. 214(2) is applicable to
murders committed under s. 212(b).

Finally, the Court cited R. v. Gross (1913),
23 Cox C.C. 455. In that case Darling J. referred to the legal principle “laid
down over and over again” that if a person feloniously fires at another in such
circumstances as could make the killing of that person murder, but by accident
hits and kills a third person whom he never intended to hit at all, that is
murder. Darling J. went on to say that if the firing at the person intended to be
hit would be manslaughter (as, for example, provocation operating on the mind
of the accused), then, if the bullet strikes a third person who is not intended
to be hit, the killing of that person equally would be manslaughter and not
murder. Martin J.A. in the present case concluded, by a parity of reasoning,
that an intention which is aggravated by the fact that it is planned and
deliberate is transferred from the contemplated victim to the actual victim.

III The Argument of Counsel for the Appellant

Counsel submits that, as it is the murder
which must be planned and deliberate, the elements of “planning and
deliberation” stated in s. 214(2) must be with respect to all the components
charged in the indictment, and found to have been committed. He further submits
that a murder cannot be planned and deliberate where the person who committed
the offence did not intend to cause the death of, or to cause grievous bodily
harm to, the victim.

Counsel argues that the Criminal Code creates
a step-by-step procedure to be followed in deter-

[Page 215]

mining whether a homicide offence has been
committed: the determination of whether a murder is “planned and deliberate”
only occurs after it has been determined that what has been committed is
a murder and it is only the murder that has actually been committed which can
be planned and deliberate according to s. 214(2).

In a subsidiary submission counsel says that the
interpretation placed upon s. 214(2) by the Ontario Court of Appeal results in
transferring the planning and deliberation directed towards the wife of the
appellant (the intended victim) to the children of the appellant (the actual
victims) and this interpretation is not in accord with the doctrine of
transferred intent as stated by the common law, nor by the rules of statutory
interpretation in determining the application of this doctrine to s. 214(2).

The nub of the argument is this. Mr. Droste was
not charged with murder in the abstract; he was charged and convicted of
murdering his children. The killing of the children was neither planned nor
deliberate. Section 214(2) requires, as a matter of law, that the planning and
deliberation relate to or fasten on the victim whose death is actually caused.
A killing that is by definition accidental (s. 212(b)) cannot be, at the
same time, deliberate.

In my view this submission involves misplaced
analogies to the doctrine of transferred intent and a misreading of the
statutory scheme of the Criminal Code with regard to homicide, and is,
as well, incompatible with the policy considerations obviously underlying s.
214(2).

IV Transferred Intent

Much of the appellant’s argument recalls the
controversy surrounding the English common law concept of “transferred malice”
or, more precisely, “transferred intent”. Professor Glanville Williams Criminal
Law, The General Part (2nd ed.), at p. 126, describes the operation of this
concept as follows:

Transferred intention (transferred malice)
occurs when an injury intended for one falls on another by

[Page 216]

accident. In other words, if the defendant
intends a particular consequence, he is guilty of a crime of intention even
though his act takes effect upon an object (whether person or property) that
was not intended. His “malice” (i.e. his intention) is by a legal
fiction transferred from the one object to the other. The defendant is then
treated for legal purposes as though he had intended to hit the object that he
did hit, though in fact he did not have the intent, nor even was reckless as to
it.

The authors of Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law (4th
ed.), formulate the doctrine in these terms at p. 59:

If D, with the mens rea of a
particular crime, does an act which causes the actus reus of
the same crime, he is guilty, even though the result, in some respects, is an
unintended one.

The essence of the dispute as to the rationality
of the doctrine of “transferred intent” is latent in these constrasting
formulations.

The literature on transferred intent
distinguishes between two kinds of situations in which the “wrong victim”
suffers harm at the hands of the accused. The first, sometimes called error
in objecto involves a mistake by the perpetrator as to the identity of the
victim. A gunman aims at and shoots a pedestrian on the street; the assailant
thought the pedestrian was X, but in fact he is Y. There is little controversy
that this sort of mistake as to the identity of the victim in no way affects
the fact that the perpetrator has committed an intentional crime. It is the
second “wrong victim” situation, sometimes called aberratio ictus, or
more poetically, “a mistake of the bullet” that has led to the controversy
surrounding the doctrine of transferred intent. In this second situation the
perpetrator aims at X but by chance or lack of skill hits Y. The
appropriateness of assessing criminal liability as though the bullet had found
its intended mark depends heavily upon one’s evaluation of the importance of
the identity of the victim as an element of the offence in question. The
authors of Smith and Hogan Criminal Law, supra, at pp. 60-61 present
Professor Williams’ critique of the doctrine as applied to murder, and their
response, as follows:

[Page 217]

Williams regards the doctrine of
transferred malice as a “rather arbitrary exception to normal principles”. He
rejects the argument that “the result is not unintended, for the
intention was to kill, and the result is a killing”. He writes:

“This argument. sounds plausible only
because part of the real intention is omitted. Although the result in the sense
of a killing was intended, the result in the sense of a killing of P was not
intended. After all the accused is not indicted for killing in the abstract; he
is indicted for killing P; and it should therefore, on a strict view, be
necessary to establish mens rea in relation to the killing of P.”

The answer to this, it is submitted, is
that D’s act is unintentional only in a respect which is immaterial. The test
of materiality in a difference of result is whether it affects the existence of
the actus reus
which D intended. Thus it would be immaterial that
D intended to shoot P in the heart but, because of a quite unexpected movement
by P, shot him (unintentionally) in the head. The actus reus of
murder is the killing of a human being—any human being—under the Queen’s
Peace, and his identity is irrelevant.

In Canada, liability for the killing of an “unintended victim” is not the
result of the operation of the doctrine of transferred intent. It is the result
of the explicit terms of s. 212(b) which, it will be recalled, provides:

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

…

(b) where a person, meaning to
cause death to a human being or meaning to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and being reckless whether death ensues or
not, by accident or mistake causes death to another human being,
notwithstanding that he does not mean to cause death or bodily harm to that
human being;. [Emphasis added]

It will be noted that the wording of this
section imposes liability for murder both in situations of error in
objecto (mistake) and in situations of aberratio ictus (accident).
The jury found that Mr. Droste, meaning to cause the death of a human
being (Mrs. Droste) by accident caused the death of another human being (each
of the children). He is therefore guilty of murder pursuant to s. 212(b)
and the debate between Professor Wil-

[Page 218]

liams and Professors Smith and Hogan can have no
relevance to this finding. The next question is whether, as counsel contends,
it can have relevance to the issue of whether Mr. Droste is guilty of
first degree murder.

The majority decision of this Court in Ancio
v. The Queen, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 25, released concurrently herewith,
illustrates the proposition that where the Criminal Code creates a
separate substantive offence related to murder, it is the mens rea for
that separate offence and not necessarily the mental states enumerated in ss.
212 and 213 that determines liability. For attempted murder, the requisite mens
rea is an intention to kill. A lesser intention, even if sufficient to
impose liability for murder if death does result, will not suffice to impose
liability for attempted murder if death does not ensue. It might appear
possible to argue by parity of reasoning that s. 214(2) creates the separate
substantive offence of first degree murder and that part of the mens rea for
this offence is planning and deliberation with regard to the identity of the
victim. If this analogy to the reasoning in Ancio were correct, then in
order to establish Mr. Droste’s liability for first degree murder the Crown would
have to demonstrate planning and deliberation in relation to the deaths of the
children. In the event, however, this analogy is not correct. Even if s. 214(2)
did create a separate substantive offence of first degree murder—which it does
not—I would incline to Professors Smith and Hogan’s analysis and to the
conclusion of Martin J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal that the identity of
the victim would not be an essential element of such an offence. Such
speculation is, however, unnecessary since this Court’s decision in R. v.
Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 24, does make it clear that s. 214 does not create
a separate substantive offence of first degree murder, but rather constitutes a
characterization, for purposes of sentencing, of the substantive offence of murder
as outlined in the various parts of ss. 212 and 213. There is therefore no
possibility of a distinct mens rea for first degree murder nor can there
be a question of transferring any such intent from the planned to the actual
victim. The issue of whether what Mr. Droste was found to have done consti-

[Page 219]

tutes first degree murder affords no parallel to
the issue in Ancio, nor does it depend on the applicability or
appropriateness of the doctrine of transferred intent. It is a relatively
straightforward issue of statutory interpretation.

V Statutory Interpretation

The appellant’s argument depends in large
measure on the purported contradiction in the notion “planning and
deliberating” upon an “unintentional” killing. This conceptualization of what
underlies finding Mr. Droste guilty of first degree murder does not accord with
the scheme of the Criminal Code with regard to homicide.

According to s. 205 of the Code, a person
commits homicide when, directly or indirectly, by any means, he causes the death
of a human being. Mr. Droste committed homicide by causing the death of his
children. Homicide is culpable or not culpable. Culpable homicide is murder or
manslaughter or infanticide. As outlined earlier, s. 212(b), when
stripped of non‑essentials, provides that culpable homicide is murder
where a person (Mr. Droste), meaning to cause death of a human being (Mrs.
Droste), by accident causes death to another human being (each of his
children), notwithstanding that he does not mean to cause death or bodily harm
to that human being. For purposes of the Criminal Code, then, what Mr.
Droste did was not “unintentional”. The argument of the appellant, as I
understand it, would truncate s. 212(b) by writing one of its vital
components out of the section. Mr. Droste was not charged with the accidental
killing of his children. He was charged with meaning to cause the death of Mrs.
Droste and by accident or mistake causing the death of the children. Causing
death by accident normally results in acquittal or, at most, a conviction for
manslaughter. When such a killing is accompanied by an intention to cause death
to another human being s. 212(b) dictates that the homicide is not
manslaughter but murder, i.e. intentional killing.

[Page 220]

There is no question that on the jury’s findings
Mr. Droste is guilty of murder under s. 212(b). Is he, pursuant to s.
214(2), guilty of first degree murder? Subsections (1), (2) and (7) of
s. 214 provide sequentially that (a) murder is first degree or second
degree murder; (b) murder is first degree murder when it is planned and
deliberate; (c) all murder that is not first degree murder is second degree
murder. The appellant’s submissions appear to require treating ss. 212(b)
and 214(2) as describing different substantive offences embodying different
mental elements. “Planning and deliberation” would thus become part of the
mental element for the substantive offence under s. 214(2), an element which,
on the appellant’s submission, would have to be proven with regard to the
actual killing committed, i.e. the killing of the children.

The majority judgment of this Court in R. v.
Farrant, supra, makes it impossible for the appellant to succeed on this
argument. On pages 140-42 of that judgment the following passages appear:

Section 214, however, is not the section
which sets out the elements of the offence of murder. This is done in ss. 212
and 213. Section 214 does not create a distinct and independent substantive
offence of first degree constructive murder pursuant to forcible confinement.
The section is subservient to ss. 212 and 213; it classifies for sentencing
purposes, the offences in s. 212 and 213 as either first or second degree
murder. The importance of the distinction between first and second degree
murder is that first degree murder carries with it a mandatory life sentence
without eligibility for parole for twenty‑five years (s. 218, s. 669(a)).
A conviction for second degree murder also carries with it a mandatory life
sentence, but parole may be granted after 10 years of imprisonment unless the
jury recommends a greater number of years.

…

The distinction between first and second
degree murder in s. 214 is not based upon intent; it is based upon 1) the
presence of planning and deliberation (s. 212(2)); 2) the

[Page 221]

identity of the victim (s. 214(4)); or 3)
the nature of the offence being committed at the time of the murder (s.
214(5)). The primary and essential determination for a jury to make is whether
murder has been committed, either under s. 212 or, where the evidence warrants
it, under s. 213. Considerations of the distinctions between first and second
degree murder are irrelevant in making this preliminary determination. Once the
offence has been found, it is then classified.

To argue that s. 214 is controlling in a situation
such as the present one is to confuse the sections which set out the elements
of the offence of murder with the classification process provided in s. 214.
The classification in s. 214 functions within the context of sentencing and is
not determinative of the substantive offence of murder.

The same point had been made in R. v. Woods
and Gruener (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 220, at p. 229, by Howland C.J.O.
delivering the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal:

Section 214 is a classification section. It
does not create new substantive offences of first degree murder and second
degree murder. It starts from the premise that murder within ss. 212 or 213 has
been committed and specifies that the additional elements which will determine
whether the offence is first degree murder or second degree murder. There are
four situations in which the murder will constitute first degree murder:

(1)   When it is planned and deliberate within s-ss. (2) and (3).

…

It is clear, then, that first degree murder and
second degree murder are not different offences. The substantive offence is
murder. The characterization of murder as being in the first degree or in the
second degree is for sentencing purposes only. There is no question of
transferring the intent to cause a s. 212(b) offence to the actus reus of
first degree murder, nor is it a case of transferring the intent to commit
first degree murder upon victim A to the actus reus of
committing murder against victim B. I repeat, the substantive offence involved
is murder under s. 212(b). The mens rea for that offence is
intending the death or grievous bodily harm likely to cause death, to person A.
The actus reus
for this offence is causing the death of person

[Page 222]

B. Once these elements have been established, an
accused is guilty of murder. Section 214(2) specifies one of several situations
in which murder is murder in the first degree, namely, where “it” is planned
and deliberate. The “it” refers to murder, committed in any of the relevant
ways specified by the Code, including s. 212(b). This means that
the element of planning and deliberation must be related to the specific mens
rea of the applicable section, which in the present case is, as I have just
mentioned, intending to cause death to person A. There may be some mental states
specified in ss. 212 or 213 which are incompatible with planning and
deliberation, but this mens rea is not one of them.

VI Policy Considerations

The rationale behind s. 214(2) is that
there is an added moral culpability to a murder that is planned and deliberate
which justifies a harsher sentence. This added culpability is present by virtue
of the planning and deliberation with relation to the taking of a human life,
not with relation to the identity of the intended victim. A mistake or accident
as to the victim is not a mitigating factor. The legal evaluation of the
magnitude of the crime should not be affected by the fact that the accused is a
poor marksman, hitting and killing B rather than A. The point is quaintly, but
cogently, made in Foster’s Crown Cases (3rd ed., 1809), Discourse II,
“Of Homicide”, at p. 262.

…where the injury intended against A. proceeded
from a wicked, murderous, or mischievous motive, the party is answerable for
all of the consequences of the action, if death ensueth from it, though it had
not it’s effect upon the person whom he intended to destroy. The malitia I
have already explained, the heart regardless of social duty and deliberately
bent upon mischief, and consequently the guilt of the party is just the same in
the one case as in the other.

When s. 214(2) is combined with s. 212(b)
the identity and character of any victim is entirely irrelevant. The
requirement of planning and deliberation is a requirement that relates to the
inten-

[Page 223]

tion to take a human life and not to the
identity of the victim.

VII Conclusion

In the result, whether one approaches the
question on an analysis of the relationship of s. 214(2) to the substantive
offence in s. 212(b), or on the basis of the underlying policy rationale
of s. 214(2), or, even if it were relevant, on the basis of transferred
intent, one arrives at precisely the same conclusion: planning and deliberation
with relation to the killing of a specific person makes the offence first
degree murder when in the course of carrying out the plan the accused in fact
kills someone else.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The following are the reasons delivered by

WILSON J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment of my colleague, Mr. Justice Dickson, and I agree with
his conclusion that the appeal in this case must be dismissed. Because my
colleague relies heavily on the judgment of the majority of this Court in R.
v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 24, with which I disagreed, I wish to record my
own reason for dismissing the appeal.

I would respectfully adopt the following passage
from the reasons of Martin J.A. speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal in
this case (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 588, at p. 592:

We think that the trial judge correctly
instructed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the appellant’s intention to kill his wife was planned and deliberate and that
in the course of carrying out that intention he caused the death of the
children by accident or mistake, that the resulting murder constituted first
degree murder.

Section 214(2) provides that “murder” is
first degree murder when “it” is planned and deliberate. Where murder as
defined by s. 212(b) is committed and that murder is planned and
deliberate the murder is first degree murder even though the planned and
deliberate intention to kill took effect on a person other than the intended
victim.

As we have indicated, we are satisfied that
a conviction for first degree murder may be supported on the

[Page 224]

basis of a combination of s. 212(b) and
214(2) and we are unable to accept the submission of Mr. Kluwak that in order
to constitute first degree murder under s. 214(2) the planning and deliberation
must be with respect to the person actually killed. We think the law is
correctly stated by Professor Mewett in an article entitled First Degree Murder
(1978-79), 21 Crim. L.Q. 82 at 83, where he states:

Section 212(b) does not seem to cause
problems, at least where it applies by virtue of meaning to cause someone
else’s death. Since it is the murder that has to be planned and deliberate and
since the effect of s. 212(b) is merely to enact that an intent to
murder A is sufficient mens rea if by accident or mistake, the accused
kills B, then it would seem that planning and deliberating the murder of A and
by accident or mistake killing B would make the “murder” of B (for so it is
defined by s. 212 (b)) planned and deliberate.

It seems to me that this reasoning is
dispositive of the present appeal and on that basis therefore I would dismiss
it.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Juvenile delinquents—Identification
of criminal—Juvenile charged with a delinquency relating to an indictable
offence under the Criminal Code—Fingerprinting—Police officer using reasonable
force—Whether fingerprinting lawful—Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
J-3—Identification of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-1, s. 2.

The issue in this appeal is whether the use
of reasonable force by a peace officer to obtain fingerprints from a juvenile
charged under the Juvenile Delinquents Act with a delinquency relating
to an indictable offence under the Criminal Code is authorized by
s. 2 of the Identification of Criminals Act. That
section provides that reasonable force may be used to fingerprint “any
person in lawful custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable
offence”. The question was raised as a preliminary question of law in a civil
action for assault brought on behalf of the appellant Philip Brown against the
respondents. The Supreme Court of British Columbia answered in the negative but
the decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Dickson,
Beetz, Mclntyre and Chouinard JJ.: The question should be answered in the
affirmative. The expression “indictable offence” in s. 2(1) of the Identification
of Criminals Act clearly includes an indictable offence that is a violation
of the Criminal Code when it is punishable under the Code and, in
the absence of any expressed legislative intent to the contrary, the same
expression does not exclude the same violation when that violation is
punishable under the Juvenile Delin-

[Page 193]

quents Act. A
finding of delinquency relating to an indictable offence under the Code is
a conviction of an indictable offence within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the
Act. Therefore, if the appellant could be convicted of an indictable offence
within the meaning of that subsection, he could be “charged” with it.

Per Wilson J.:
The Juvenile Delinquents Act provides a limited form of immunity for
juveniles from criminal prosecution. This does not mean, however, that the acts
themselves cease to have a criminal character. Here, the 16-year old appellant
was capable of committing an indictable offence and the fact that he was
charged with a delinquency rather than with an indictable offence under
s. 9 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act did not relieve his act of its
character as an indictable offence. For the purposes of s. 2 of the Identification
of Criminals Act appellant could be said to be charged with an indictable
offence and the respondents were therefore entitled to use reasonable force in
securing his fingerprints.

The judgment of Dickson, Beetz, Mclntyre and
Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

CHOUINARD J.—In issue in this appeal is the
following question:

Is a Peace Officer in whose lawful custody
is a juvenile charged with a delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act which
relates to an indictable offence under

[Page 194]

the Criminal Code authorized by the Identification
of Criminals Act or by common law or otherwise to use reasonable force in
taking the fingerprints of the said juvenile, where the juvenile does not
consent to the taking of fingerprints?

This question is set out in an order of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia which directed that it be determined before
trial of the appellant’s action against the respondents in damages for assault.

The facts are not in dispute and are succinctly
recited in a statement agreed upon by the parties:

STATEMENT
OF FACTS

1. The Plaintiff, Philip Brown, is a male
born October 27, 1963, and therefore was 16 years of age and a child
pursuant to the Juvenile Delinquents Act on March 19, 1980, the relevant
time in this action.

2. The Defendant, Vern R. Baugh, is a
member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, holding rank of Sargeant,
stationed at Kelowna, B.C.

3. The Defendant, Allan Williams, is the
Attorney-General of the Province of British Columbia, and as such was charged
with the responsibility under the Police Act, R.S.B.C. 1974, Chapter 64,
as amended on March 19, 1980.

4. On March 19, 1980, the Plaintiff was
properly arrested and charged with a delinquency under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, to wit: unlawfully having in his possession a motor
vehicle of a value exceeding $200.00, the property of Inland Gas Company Ltd.,
knowing that the said motor vehicle was obtained by the commission of an
offence punishable by indictment; which relates to an indictable offence under
the Criminal Code.

5. Sargeant Baugh requested fingerprints
from the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff was allowed legal counsel, after which the
juvenile denied his consent to fingerprints.

6. Pursuant to instructions from the
Defendant, the Attorney-General of British Columbia, Sargeant Baugh proceeded
to take the fingerprints of the Plaintiff, which he so took in good faith and
with reasonable care using no more force than was reasonably necessary for that
purpose.

7. That at all material times the Plaintiff
was in lawful custody.

[Page 195]

The appellant relies on the interpretation of
the Identification of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-1 and the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3.

Two points are made by the respondents: the use
of reasonable force to obtain fingerprints from a juvenile is authorized by the
Identification of Criminals Act; alternatively, such use of reasonable
force for that purpose is authorized by the common law.

Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 2 of the
Identification of Criminals Act read:

2. (1) Any
person in lawful custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable
offence, or who has been apprehended under the Extradition Act or the Fugitive
Offenders Act, may be subjected, by or under the direction of those in
whose custody he is, to the measurements, processes and operations practised
under the system for the identification of criminals commonly known as the
Bertillon Signaletic System, or to any measurements, processes or operations
sanctioned by the Governor in Council having the like object in view.

(2) Such force may be used as is necessary
to the effectual carrying out and application of such measurements, processes
and operations.

Chief Justice McEachern of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia held that a juvenile charged with a delinquency under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act is not a person charged with an indictable offence within
the meaning of s. 2 of the Identification of Criminals Act. To
reach that conclusion, Chief Justice McEachern relied on both the judgment of
the Supreme Court and that of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in R.
v. A.N., respectively reported at [1977] 5 W.W.R. 549 and (1978), 39 C.C.C.
(2d) 329. He also relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward
Island in R. v. D.G. (1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 157.

Chief Justice McEachern further held that the
common law does not authorize the use of force to take fingerprints. He
therefore answered the question in the negative.

[Page 196]

Reversing, the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia concluded “…that a juvenile charged with a delinquency which is also
an offence punishable by indictment is a person charged with an indictable
offence within the meaning and for the purposes of the Identification of
Criminals Act”.

The Court of Appeal consequently answered the
question in the affirmative on that basis. As a result it became unnecessary to
deal with the common law point and the Court did not “comment on any common law
right to fingerprint without the consent of the juvenile suspect”.

On the statutory point, the Court of Appeal had
this to say:

We are supported in our conclusion by
consideration of the intent of the Parliament of Canada. In enacting the Identification
of Criminals Act, the criterion established by Parliament for determining
the applicability of this statutory power was not the age of the accused but
the seriousness of the crime allegedly committed—indictable offences and
offences under certain specified statutes. That Parliament was concerned
primarily with the nature of the crime rather than the age of the accused is
consistent with the limitation of s. 44(1) of the Young Offenders Act, Bill
C-61, 1980-81, that no fingerprints of a young person who is accused of
committing an offence shall be taken except in circumstances in which an adult
may, under the Identification of Criminals Act, be fingerprinted. In
other words age, as a test of applicability, defers to the magnitude of the
crime.

The Court of Appeal also relied on the unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Clark (1977), 35
C.C.C. (2d) 319 and on the majority judgment of this Court in Morris v. The
Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 405. This latter judgment on which both respondents
relied heavily in their argument on the statutory point is, in my view,
determinative of the issue in this case.

The facts in Morris are summarized in the
headnote as follows:

Appellant, aged 19, was found guilty by the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Criminal Side, for the district of Montreal, consisting
of a judge and jury, on a charge of breaking and entering with intent (s. 306 Cr.C.).
He appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the trial judge erred by
allowing evidence of the cross-

[Page 197]

examination of appellant, in which he
contradicted the evidence he had given in chief and admitted having been found
guilty, under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, of offences, under the Criminal
Code. The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction; hence the appeal to this
Court.

The main issue is stated by Pratte J. who wrote
the majority judgment of this Court, at p. 425:

Such being the case, I now come to consider
the main issue in the appeal which is as to whether the cross-examination of
the appellant upon his record as a juvenile was admissible in evidence under
s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act or under s. 593 Cr.C. The
trial judge allowed the cross-examination under both provisions and his
decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

The majority in that case confirmed the judgment
of the Court of Appeal with respect to both s. 12 of the Canada
Evidence Act and s. 593 of the Criminal Code.

The majority reasons with respect to s. 593
Cr.C. are of no assistance here. We are not concerned with the adducing
of evidence of previous convictions or of other evidence in answer to evidence
of his good character adduced by the accused, nor with the question whether the
evidence adduced by the accused constituted evidence of his good character, on
which the s. 593 issue turned in Morris. For the purposes of this
appeal, it will therefore be sufficient to consider the judgment of this Court
in Morris only as it relates to s. 12 of the Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10.

Subsection (1) of this section reads:

12. (1) A
witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence,
and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses to
answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction.

In Morris, two grounds were relied upon
in support of the proposition that s. 12 did not authorize the questioning
of an accused as to his previous delinquencies, namely (i) a delinquency is not
an offence within the meaning of this expression as used in s. 12; and
(ii) a finding of delin-

[Page 198]

quency is not to be construed as a conviction
for the purposes of s. 12.

With respect to the meaning of the word
“offence” Pratte J., for the majority, made the following comments at pp. 425
to 427:

As to the first ground, it should first be
observed that the word “delinquency” which is described as an offence in ss. 3
and 22(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act embraces within its meaning
two categories of acts; the first category includes acts that are in violation
of “any provision of the Criminal Code or of any federal or provincial
statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality” (Juvenile
Delinquents Act, s. 2(1)), or as Fauteux J. put it in Attorney General
of British Columbia v. Smith, [1967] S.C.R. 702, at p. 710, that are
“punishable breaches of the public law, whether defined by Parliament or the
Legislatures”; the second category includes sexual immorality or other similar
form of vice which, while not illegal in the case of adults, should be
repressed in the case of juveniles.

Leaving aside the delinquencies of the
second category that I have mentioned above, the Juvenile Delinquents Act does
not prescribe any special rule of human conduct for juveniles; the Criminal
Code and the other statutes referred to above are applicable to juveniles
and non-juveniles alike. Essentially, the Juvenile Delinquents Act does
not create any offence; the offence results from the violation of another
statute which, in the case at bar, is the Criminal Code. But, when the
offence is committed by a juvenile, a particular method of enforcement is
prescribed: the usual type of penalty imposed in criminal matters, i.e. imprisonment
or fine, intended to act as a deterrent of wrongful action, is generally
replaced by various courses of action left at the discretion of the Court and
designed to provide the child with such care, education and protection as he
requires in order to rehabilitate himself and mature into a law-abiding
citizen. The Act “provides a special procedure for the discipline and treatment
of children outside of the ordinary criminal courts, although their delinquencies
may be offences under the Criminal Code” (per Laskin J.A., as he then
was, in R. v. Horsburgh, [1966] 1 O.R. 739, at pp. 756 and 757). In Attorney
General of British Columbia v. Smith, supra, Fauteux J., as he then was,
speaking for the Court, rightly pointed out at p. 708 that: “The primary
legal effect of the Juvenile Delinquents Act,…, is the effective
substitution, in the case of juveniles, of the provisions of the Act to the
enforcement provisions of the Criminal Code or” of any other relevant statute.

[Page 199]

In Morris, the delinquencies adjudged
against the accused all consisted in violations of the Criminal Code, some
of which at least were indictable offences.

Stating the question to be answered, Pratte J.
wrote, at p. 428:

The question that stands up for
determination is therefore quite narrow: it is whether the word “offence” as
used in s. 12(1) of the Canada Evidence Act includes a delinquency
consisting in a violation of the Criminal Code which is enforceable
under the Juvenile Delinquents Act rather than the Code itself.

And, on the same page, he concluded:

In brief, the expression “any offence” in
s. 12(1) clearly includes an offence that is a violation of the Criminal
Code when it is punishable under the Code; in the absence of any expressed
legislative intent to the contrary, I cannot logically bring myself to the view
that the same expression excludes the same violation when it is punishable
under the Juvenile Delinquents Act which, like the Code, is
“genuine legislation in relation to criminal law”.

The question as to whether the word “offence”
included delinquencies other than violations of the Criminal Code was
left open. Pratte J. wrote at p. 428:

I express no opinion as to whether the
meaning of the word “offence” as used in s. 12(1) of the Canada
Evidence Act should otherwise be restricted so as to exclude certain kinds
of delinquencies.

But the Court clearly decided that “offence”
included delinquencies consisting in violations of the Criminal Code.

As was held in Morris and is equally
applicable here “…the Juvenile Delinquents Act does not create any
offence; the offence results from the violation of another statute which, in
the case at bar, is the Criminal Code”. The mere fact that because the
appellant is a juvenile the special procedure provided for by the Juvenile
Delinquents Act is substituted to the enforcement provisions of the Criminal
Code, does not alter the nature of the offence. To paraphrase the reasons
of Pratte J. in Morris, the expression “indictable offence” in s. 2(1)
of the Identification of Criminals Act clearly includes an indictable
offence that is a violation of the Criminal Code when it is

punishable under the Code; in the absence
of any expressed legislative intent to the contrary, I cannot logically bring
myself to the view that the same expression excludes the same violation when it
is punishable under the Juvenile Delinquents Act which, like the Code,
is “genuine legislation in relation to criminal law”.

There remains the question whether a juvenile
charged with a delinquency consisting in an indictable offence can be said to
be a person “charged” with an indictable offence within the meaning of
s. 2(1) of the Identification of Criminals Act. The disposition by
this Court of the second ground in Morris is, in my view, decisive. As
put by Pratte J. at p. 429:

The second ground advanced by the appellant
is that a finding of delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act is
not to be construed as a conviction for the purposes of s. 12 of the Canada
Evidence Act; therefore, a person who has been found guilty of delinquency
could not be said to have been “convicted”. This submission of the appellant is
based on the fact that a Juvenile Court is, under the Act, empowered to adjudge
a child to have committed a delinquency and not to convict a child of
having committed a delinquency.

On that ground, Pratte J. concluded at
p. 431:

In my opinion, therefore, the power of the
juvenile court to adjudge guilt is equivalent to the power of an ordinary
criminal court to convict and I cannot see any essential difference between the
power to adjudge a person guilty of an offence and the power to convict a
person of the same offence. With respect, I find no merit in the submission of
the appellant that a finding of delinquency should not be construed as a
conviction for the purposes of s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act.

For the same reasons, it must be concluded in
the case at bar that a finding of delinquency which relates to an indictable
offence under the Criminal Code is, within the meaning of s. 2(1)
of the Identification of Criminals Act, a conviction of an indictable
offence. It necessarily follows that if the appellant could be convicted of an
indictable offence within the meaning of that subsection, he could be “charged”
with it.

The appellant has sought to distinguish Morris
as regards both the interpretation of the expression

[Page 201]

“any offence” and the interpretation of the word
“conviction” in s. 12(1) of the Canada Evidence Act.

As to the expression “any offence” the appellant
submitted:

This Court in Morris was concerned
with the interpretation of section 12(1) of the Canada Evidence Act, and
therefore, the Court was primarily concerned with the expression “any offence”
in section 12(1). It is not contended in the case at bar that a
delinquency is not an “offence”; the words in section 3 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act make it clear that a delinquency is an offence. The
question for this Court is whether the delinquency is an “indictable offence”,
as the words are used in the Identification of Criminals Act, and
whether a child charged with a delinquency is “charged with an indictable
offence”.

This submission might have merit if the basis
for the decision in Morris were as suggested by the appellant. But, with
respect, such is not the case. The expression “any offence” was interpreted in
that case as it relates to violations of the Criminal Code and only to
such violations. The question whether it would, under the Canada Evidence
Act, include other categories of delinquencies was expressly left open. It
is perhaps not inconceivable that the Court could have held that the
expression, without more, was broad enough to include a delinquency which is an
“offence” within the meaning of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. But that
is not what the Court did. It held that it includes a delinquency which
consists in a violation of the Criminal Code. A violation of the Criminal
Code necessarily includes indictable offences as well as summary conviction
offences. Indeed some of the violations of the Criminal Code of which
the accused in Morris had been previously convicted consisted in
indictable offences. Hence the applicability of the interpretation of the
expression “any offence” in Morris to the expression “indictable offence”
in the Identification of Criminals Act.

As to the word “conviction” the appellant
submitted:

The other question considered by the
Supreme Court of Canada in Morris is the meaning of the word “con-

[Page 202]

viction” in section 12 of the Canada
Evidence Act, and the Court held that the power to adjudge guilt under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act was “equivalent” to the power of an ordinary Court to
convict, and held that the meaning of the word “conviction” within the Canada
Evidence Act could be expanded to include an adjudgment under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. In assessing the bearing that Morris should have on
the question at bar, it must be remembered that the question arose in Morris
as a question of credibility, and hence not one to be decided on technical
interpretations. It is also of critical importance that in Morris, the
Court was concerned with interpretation of evidentiary statutes which should be
interpreted more widely than a statute such as the Identification of
Criminals Act. It is perhaps of interest that Mr. Justice Pratte
states at p. 429:

The word “conviction” is not a term of art
that is applicable only to Criminal Code offences punishable in the
manner provided in the Code. When used in a statute, its meaning varies
depending on the context in which it is found; it may or may not include the
imposition of a penalty.

I do not find this submission persuasive. I fail
to see how interpreting the same provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act,
this Court could determine that a juvenile can be “convicted” of violations
of the Criminal Code, including indictable offences, when the Canada
Evidence Act is being considered and could no longer be “convicted” of the
same violations when the statute being considered is the Identification of
Criminals Act. In either case, it is the Juvenile Delinquents Act which
is being interpreted, the same adjudgment of delinquency which is said to be a
“conviction”.

The appellant further submitted with regard to
the word “conviction”:

It is also to be noted that the majority
decision in Morris relies also upon an alternative ground that the
cross-examination in that case was admissible pursuant to section 593 of
the Criminal Code and a general right of cross-examination, and that
therefore the majority decision in Morris may not be determinative of
this issue.

[Page 203]

That the majority decision did consider the
alternative ground based on s. 593 Cr.C. does not alter its
conclusion on the ground based on s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act. It
is to be noted further that in view of its conclusion on s. 12 of the Canada
Evidence Act, it was unnecessary for the Court to consider s. 593 of
the Criminal Code and the majority judgment so indicates at p. 437.

In view of my conclusion on the statutory point
it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the common law point.

For these reasons I would answer the question in
the affirmative.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal with
costs.

The following are the reasons delivered by

WILSON J.—It seems to me that the underlying
issue which must be addressed in this appeal is whether the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, merely prescribes a different
procedure for dealing with juvenile offenders or whether it in fact changes the
character of the act so that it is no longer an indictable offence but only a
delinquency.

This issue was addressed in the very context we
have before us, namely in connection with the right of the police to
fingerprint juveniles, in the case of R. v. D.G. (1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d)
157. McQuaid J. in that case approached the issue on the basis of a purely
grammatical interpretation of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. He found
that a juvenile could not be “charged with” or “convicted of” an “indictable
offence” unless the Crown took steps under s. 9 of the Act to have the
juvenile tried as an adult. He reinforced his conclusion with three lines of
argument. First, since s. 5(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act provides
that trials under the Act are to be summary proceedings and s. 27(1)(a)
of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, defines indictable
offences as offences which may be prosecuted by indictment, a “delinquency”
does not fit into the definition of an indictable offence found in the Interpretation
Act. Secondly, since s. 3(2) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act states
that a child adjudged to have committed a

[Page 204]

delinquency “shall be dealt with, not as an
offender, but as one in a condition of delinquency”, he cannot be
considered to have been convicted of a crime. And third, the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, and particularly s. 3, is not merely a mechanism by
which a different form of procedure is adopted in the prosecution of children
for criminal offences, but is legislation which characterizes what would, if
committed by an adult, be a criminal offence as a mere delinquency when
committed by a child.

The problem, it seems to me, with the
interpretive approach taken by McQuaid J. is that he is dealing with two
statutes as if they addressed each other when in fact they do not. What he was
called upon to do was interpret the words “charged with or under conviction of
an indictable offence” in s. 2(1) of the Identification of Criminals
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-1. This Act was passed by Parliament in 1898 (1898
(Can.), c. 54) and the relevant wording has remained unchanged since that time.
The Juvenile Delinquents Act dates back to 1908 (1908 (Can.), c. 40)
and, while it has been amended from time to time, the provisions with which we
are concerned have been in existence, albeit in somewhat different form, since
the original Act was passed. I think it is fair to say that when Parliament
originally passed the Identification of Criminals Act it did not
contemplate a distinction between juvenile and adult offenders. There is
nothing in the Juvenile Delinquents Act which speaks directly to the
relationship between it and the Identification of Criminals Act and the
relationship is one which must be determined therefore by inference from the
words of the two pieces of legislation. In such circumstances it seems to me
that the Court should take a broad rather than a narrow view of both pieces of
legislation and not refine too much on the use of certain expressions at the
expense of the policy reflected in the legislation as a whole. I believe that the
third issue addressed by McQuaid J. is the crucial one. Does the Juvenile
Delinquents Act change the character

[Page 205]

of the act when committed by a juvenile so that
it is no longer an indictable offence but only a delinquency?

It seems to me that where the courts have
addressed this question they have concluded that for the purposes of the
application of other statutes the acts of juveniles who offend the Criminal
Code are indeed criminal offences. The two leading cases are the majority
decision of this Court in Morris v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 405, and
the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Clark (1977), 35
C.C.C. (2d) 319.

In Morris the issue was the relationship
between the Juvenile Delinquents Act and the Canada Evidence Act and,
in particular, whether adjudications of delinquency could be characterized as
“convictions” or “offences” within the meaning of s. 12 of the latter Act.
Spence J., in dissent, adopted the view that they were not, relying principally
on ss. 3, 20 and 38 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. Writing for the
majority Pratte J. came to the opposite conclusion. For him the fact that no
specific inclusion of “delinquencies” was made in s. 12 of the Canada
Evidence Act was not conclusive of whether delinquencies arising out of
violations of the Criminal Code were covered by the term “offences” in
that Act. Pratte J. appears to have considered both the purposes of the two
pieces of legislation and the breadth of meaning which could be ascribed to the
words used in each Act. Having decided that the words “offences” and
“convictions” in s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act were sufficiently
broad to encompass adjudications of delinquency and that it was consonant with
the purpose of each Act that a broad meaning of the words be adopted, he
proceeded to do so.

With respect I do not find the decision in Morris
particularly helpful on the essential issue as I have stated it. That issue
is, however, specifically addressed in Clark, supra. In that case the
question was whether the appellant, who had been convicted of possession of
stolen goods knowing that the goods were obtained from the commission of an
offence punishable by indictment under

[Page 206]

s. 312(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, could
succeed on the ground that his 15-year old brother, who had stolen the goods in
question, had not committed “an offence punishable by indictment”. Arnup J.A.
drew a distinction between the capacity to commit an offence and an immunity
from prosecution for the offence. He reasoned that the Juvenile
Delinquents Act provided a limited form of immunity from criminal
prosecution of juveniles. This did not, however, mean that the acts themselves
ceased to have a criminal character.

Arnup J.A. also rejected the argument that since
s. 5 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act mandated summary procedure in
the case of a juvenile offender, an offence committed by him could not be an
offence “punishable by indictment”. He drew no distinction between “an
indictable offence” and “an offence punishable by indictment” and he noted that
the character of the offence was not changed by the method in which the Crown
elected to proceed on it. In other words, where the Crown has an option to
proceed summarily or by way of indictment and it chooses the former course, the
offence is still one “punishable by indictment”. Thus it appeared to him that
the fact that the Crown did not elect to proceed against a juvenile delinquent
under the provisions of s. 9(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act did
not mean that the delinquency lost its character as an indictable offence.

Applying the reasoning of Arnup J.A. to this
case, it appears to me that the 16-year old appellant was capable of
committing an indictable offence. The fact that he was charged with a
delinquency rather than with an indictable offence under s. 9 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act did not relieve his act of its character as an indictable
offence. For purposes of s. 2 of the Identification of Criminals Act therefore
it could be said that the appellant was charged with an indictable offence.
Since the other prerequisites of the Act were met the respondents were entitled
pursuant to the Act to use reasonable force in securing the appellant’s
fingerprints.

[Page 207]

For these reasons I agree with my colleague,
Mr. Justice Chouinard, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Procedure—Preliminary
inquiry—Preferring indictment—Additional offences disclosed by evidence at
preliminary inquiry—Power of agent of Attorney General to prefer indictment on
additional offences—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, ss. 496, 504, 505, 507
(as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.),
c. 93, s. 63).

At the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry,
the presiding provincial court judge committed the appellant for trial on the
two counts for which he was charged and declined the Crown’s request to commit
him on two additional offences disclosed by the evidence. Later, the Crown
counsel preferred an indictment containing four counts under s. 507(2) of the Criminal
Code. Two counts corresponded to those for which appellant had been
committed and the additional two to offences disclosed from evidence taken at
the preliminary inquiry and arising from the same transaction. The Ontario
Court of Appeal upheld an Ontario Supreme Court decision to dismiss appellant’s
application to quash the two additional counts. This appeal is to determine
whether an agent of the Attorney General had authority pursuant to s. 507(2) of
the Code to prefer the two additional counts which arose out of the
evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

Held (Dickson
and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Ritchie,
Estey and Lamer JJ.: The agent of the Attorney General had the power to prefer
an indictment including counts other than those charged but revealed by the
evidence at a preliminary inquiry. Such power is found in s. 507(2) of the Criminal
Code and was first introduced into the Code in 1907 as s. 873A. The
1969 amendments adding subs. (3), while curtailing the gen-

[Page 132]

eral power to prefer, did not take away that
power. Save a few minor exceptions and Nova Scotia, the following principles govern the preferment of indictments in
jury trials:

(A) The Attorney General or anyone with the
written consent of a judge of the court may prefer an indictment for any
offence irrespective of whether a preliminary inquiry has been held, and if so,
whether the accused was discharged or committed for that or any other offence.

(B) Anyone else empowered under s. 507(2) to
prefer indictments can do so only if the following conditions have been met:
(1) a preliminary inquiry has been held; (2) the accused has been committed for
trial on at least one of the charges inquired into by the justice; and (3) the
count of the indictment must be for an offence for which the accused was
committed or for an offence disclosed in the evidence introduced at the
preliminary inquiry, and which is not an offence for which the accused was
discharged.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 441, 35 O.R. (2d) 124, affirming a judgment of
Galligan J. (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 126, 34 O.R. (2d) 185, dismissing
appellant’s motion to quash counts in an indictment. Appeal dismissed, Dickson
and Wilson JJ. dissenting.

David Smye, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

[Page 133]

The judgment of Ritchie, Estey and Lamer JJ. was
delivered by

LAMER J.—Appellant applied to Galligan J. of the
Supreme Court of Ontario seeking to quash some of the counts of an indictment
that had been preferred against him to the General Sessions of the Peace at
Hamilton. Galligan J. dismissed the application, and the accused’s appeal to
the Ontario Court of Appeal was also unsuccessful. His appeal to this Court is
by leave.

The Facts

An information was sworn containing two counts
charging the accused with break and entry with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein contrary to s. 306(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and
impersonating a police officer contrary to s. 361(a) of the Criminal
Code. The accused elected trial by judge and jury.

At the preliminary inquiry the accused was
committed for trial on both counts. The presiding Provincial Court Judge,
applying this Court’s decision in R. v. Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985,
declined a request from Crown counsel to commit for trial in respect of two
additional offences. It is conceded that these two additional allegations arose
out of the same transaction as that concerning the counts for which accused had
been committed. It is also conceded that there was evidence led at the
preliminary inquiry from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably have
convicted the appellant for those requested additional counts. Finally,
appellant is not arguing that the evidence in support of those additional
counts was of no relevance to the two counts for which he was committed by the
Provincial Court Judge.

Crown counsel, acting as an agent of the
Attorney General, preferred an indictment under s. 507 of the Criminal
Code containing four counts: two of which corresponded to the two counts on
the information and for which the accused had been

[Page 134]

committed (the wording of one of those was in
the indictment somewhat different than that in the information); and the other
two for offences disclosed from evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing.

The accused had originally sought in the Supreme
Court, to quash not only the two additional counts but also one of the two for
which he had been committed, an order of prohibition against the conduct of a
trial on these counts, and an order of mandamus to compel the quashing of these
counts. In his appeal to this Court the accused has abandoned his challenge to
the count of the indictment for which he had been committed and is now seeking
to quash only the two added counts.

The Issue

Could the agent of the Attorney General prefer
an indictment pursuant to s. 507(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada
containing counts which alleged offences, the commission of which were
disclosed by the evidence taken at a preliminary inquiry but which were not the
subject of a charge at the preliminary inquiry, in addition to those counts
alleged in the offences contained in the information which were the subject of
the preliminary inquiry and for which the accused was committed to stand trial
at the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry?

Section 507 reads as follows:

507. (1) In
the Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia and in the Yukon
Territory and Northwest Territories it is not necessary to prefer a bill of
indictment before a grand jury, but it is sufficient if the trial of an accused
is commenced by an indictment in writing setting forth the offence with which
he is charged.

(2) An indictment under subsection (1)
may be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent, or by any person with
the written consent of a judge of the court or of the Attorney General or, in
any province to which this section applies, by order of the court.

[Page 135]

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

an indictment under subsection (1)
shall not be preferred except with the written consent of a judge of the court,
or by the Attorney General.

The governing section for preferring a
charge in the case of a trial before a judge of Part XVI is s. 496:

496. (1)
Where an accused elects under section 464, 484, or 492 to be tried by a
judge without a jury, an indictment in Form 4 shall be preferred by the
Attorney General or his agent, or by any person who has written consent of the
Attorney General, and in the Province of British Columbia may be preferred by
the clerk of the peace.

(2) An indictment that is preferred under
subsection (1) may contain any number of counts, and there may be joined
in the same indictment

(a) counts relating to offences in
respect of which the accused elected to be tried by a judge without a jury and
for which the accused was committed for trial, whether or not the offences were
included in one information, and

(b) counts relating to offences
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or
in substitution for any offence for which the accused was committed for trial.

(3) An indictment that is preferred under
subsection (1) may include an offence that is not referred to in paragraph
(2)(a) or (b) if the accused consents, and that offence may be
dealt with, tried and determined and punished in all respects as if the offence
were one in respect of which the accused had been committed for trial, but if
that offence was committed wholly in a province other than that in which the
accused is before the court, subsection 434(3) applies.

Appellant’s position

The appellant’s argument is, in the result, that
the preferment for an additional charge is governed by subs. 3(a) of s.
507 and that only the Attorney General himself and not his agent, short of the
agent’s obtaining the Court’s consent, could

[Page 136]

prefer the indictment. His position is that one
must read the words “a preliminary inquiry has (not) been held” as meaning an
inquiry pursuant to an information which contains the count or counts
subsequently found in the indictment. He says that s. 507 is a comprehensive
procedure for preferring indictments in provinces where there is no grand jury,
that s. 507(2) applies only when a preliminary has been held upon the offence
charged in the information followed by a committal and that, if no preliminary
was held or if it resulted in a discharge, it is s. 507(3) which governs the
situation. His supportive arguments are twofold. He first argues that the power
to add counts in one indictment preferred to a petit jury never existed in
provinces where there is no grand jury; his second argument is that, in any
event, this power, if it did exist, was taken away in 1969 when the Code was
amended to include what is now s. 507(3).

The Crown’s position

The Crown says that the plain meaning of the
words “a preliminary inquiry has not been held” makes the limitation found in
s. 507(3) to the general power to prefer before a petit jury inapplicable where
there has been a preliminary inquiry at which evidence, relevant to the offence
charged and sufficient to support a prima facie case on all of the
charges contained in the indictment was properly adduced by the Crown, and
where a committal results.

The Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal for Ontario (1981), 64
C.C.C. (2d) 441, 35 O.R. (2d) 124, adopting the obiter view of
Lacourcière J.A. in R. v. Dwyer and Lauzon (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 83,
and the reasoning adopted by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in R.
v. G. & P. International News Ltd. and Judd (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 169,
which was subsequently followed by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.
Philbin and Henderson, [1978] 1

[Page 137]

W.W.R. 122, agreed with the Crown’s
interpretation of the section.

I am of the view that the power to prefer counts
other than those charged but revealed by the evidence at a preliminary is found
in s. 507(2) since its introduction in 1907 as s. 873A.

I am also of the view that the 1969 amendments,
while curtailing the general power to prefer, did not take away that power.

The Power Always Existed

A historical review of the relevant
sections shows that s. 507(3) was enacted by Parliament when it realized
that what had started out as an exceptional procedure had gradually become the
general rule and that control by the courts and greater direct political
accountability through the Attorney General’s personal involvement were
desirable when by-passing the holding of an inquiry or when overlooking a
discharge; and this was so even when there was to be a preferment before a
grand jury.

Prior to codification, anyone could, under the
common law, prefer an indictment before a grand jury except for certain
offences (perjury, subornation of perjury, conspiracy, obtaining money by false
pretences, keeping a gambling house, keeping a disorderly house, indecent
assault (Vexatious Indictments Act, 1859 (U.K.), 22 & 23 Vict., c.
17) and libel (Newspaper Libel and Registration Act, 1881 (U.K.), 44
& 45 Vict., c. 60, s. 6)). For these offences there was a statutory
requirement that the person either be bound over to prosecute by a magistrate
following a preliminary inquiry or that he be given permission to prefer before
the grand jury by a judge or by the Attorney General. By-passing the grand jury
could only be done by a criminal information preferred before the petit jury by
the Attorney General, the Solicitor General and the Master of the Crown Office,
and, in any event, such a procedure was limited to mis-

[Page 138]

demeanours. The system of preferment of
indictments and that of criminal informations was greatly criticized by Stephen
(see Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England (1883), vol. 1, pp.
293 et seq.). Some of his views appear to have been accommodated in our
first Code of 1892.

The Canadian system required the finding of a
true bill by a grand jury. At the time, criminal informations, though not
abolished till 1953, were no longer being authorized (see R. v. Wilson (1878),
43 U.C.Q.B. 583). The preferment of a bill of indictment, was governed by
s. 641 of the Code of 1892:

641. Any one
who is bound over to prosecute any person, whether committed for trial or not,
may prefer a bill of indictment for the charge on which the accused has been
committed, or in respect of which the prosecutor is so bound over, or for any
charge founded upon the facts or evidence disclosed on the depositions taken
before the justice. The accused may at any time before he is given in charge to
the jury apply to the court to quash any count in the indictment on the ground
that it is not founded on such facts or evidence, and the court shall quash
such count if satisfied that it is not so founded. And if at any time during
the trial it appears to the court that any count is not so founded, and that
injustice has been or is likely to be done to the accused in consequence of
such count remaining in the indictment, the court may then quash such count and
discharge the jury from finding any verdict upon it.

2. The Attorney-General or any one by his direction
or any one with the written consent of a judge of any court of criminal
jurisdiction or of the Attorney-General, may prefer a bill of indictment for
any offence before the grand jury of any court specified in such consent; and
any person may prefer any bill of indictment before any court of criminal
jurisdiction by order of such court.

3. It shall not be necessary to state such
consent or order in the indictment. An objection to an indictment for want of
such consent or order must be taken by motion to quash the indictment before
the accused person is given in charge.

[Page 139]

4. Save as aforesaid no bill of indictment
shall after the commencement of this Act be preferred in any province of Canada.

A bill of indictment could be preferred with or
without a preliminary inquiry into the matter, but, if no preliminary had been
held, only the Attorney General, or someone by his direction or that of the
Court or the consent of the Court could prefer before the grand jury. The main
change in the system was that prosecutors other than those aforementioned had
to go through a preliminary inquiry and then could prefer before the grand
jury, for offences: 1) for which the accused had been committed, if bound over
to do so; 2) for which he had been discharged but only if the prosecuting
person had requested to be bound over to prosecute same; 3) which were founded
upon the facts disclosed on the depositions taken before the justice in the
course of the preliminary inquiry.

As for speedy trials, (roughly today’s trials
before a judge of Part XVI) the charging process was governed by the following
sections: 765, 767 and 773, ss. 767(2) and 773 being those relevant to this
appeal:

767. …

2. If the prisoner demands a trial by jury
the judge shall remand him to gaol; but if he consents to be tried by the judge
without a jury the county solicitor, clerk of the peace or other prosecuting
officer shall prefer the charge against him for which he has been committed for
trial, and if, upon being arraigned upon the charge, the prisoner pleads
guilty, the prosecuting officer shall draw upon a record as nearly as may be in
one of the forms MM or NN in schedule one to this Act, such plea shall be
entered on the record, and the judge shall pass the sentence of the law on such
prisoner, which shall have the same force and effect as if passed by any court
having jurisdiction to try the offence in the ordinary way.

773. The
county attorney or clerk of the peace or other prosecuting officer may, with
the consent of the judge, prefer against the prisoner a charge or charges for
any offence or offences for which he may be tried under the provisions of this
part other than the charge or

[Page 140]

charges for which he has been committed to
gaol for trial, although such charge or charges do not appear or are not
mentioned in the depositions upon which the prisoner was so committed.

(Emphasis added.)

We need not here consider summary trials.

The Code of 1892 was setting up a new
system whereby the normal process was the holding of a preliminary before a
justice or a magistrate.

Generally speaking, by-passing the grand jury,
(though theoretically possible through criminal informations) occurred only
when and as a result of an accused consenting to be tried for certain
indictable offences under Part LIV (speedy trials).

By-passing the preliminary inquiry required the
Attorney General’s direction or consent or that of the court. But, of
importance, once a preliminary had been held, except for speedy trials, binding
over was sufficient to overcome the effect of a judge’s discharge. Furthermore,
as for offences not charged but revealed by the evidence adduced at the
preliminary the rule did not even require committal. Committal would seem to be
a restriction for speedy trials, but is only the result of the nature of that
process. Speedy trials could only be offered to those who were going to be
tried, and committal was not referred to in the governing sections as a
restriction but mentioned as an inevitable prerequisite. The letter of the
ancestor section to today’s s. 496 would appear at first sight to be
giving a much wider charging power. But it did not, as a matter of practice
operate in that way and was quite in line with the rule for jury trials.
Indeed, the judge when consenting to additional charges was expected to
exercise his discretion in a way that would protect the accused who had
consented to the process and relinquished his right to

[Page 141]

a jury trial on the charge for which he had been
committed.

Comments in Tremeear’s Criminal Code (2nd
ed., 1908), on s. 834, the successor to s. 773 of the Code of 1892,
support this view. At pages 668-69:

Preferring another charge.]—Notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 834, a judge should
not, against the wish of a prisoner, give his consent, at the trial before him,
under the speedy trials clauses without a jury, to any other charge being
preferred than that upon which the prisoner was committed for trial, unless it
is clear that, while it may be more formally or differently expressed, it is
substantially the same charge as the one on which he was committed for trial.
R. v. Carriere (1902), 6 Can.
Cr. Cas. 5, 14 Man. R. 52.

In order to have the right to prefer such
other charge, the prisoner must have been committed or admitted to bail and
subsequently placed and held in custody, on the charge of having committed an
indictable offence, for which he had the right to demand a speedy trial without
a jury, he must have been brought and must be legally before the judge of
sessions, he must have consented to waive his right to a trial by jury and have
consented to take a speedy trial without one. The object of this provision is
to permit, during the course of a speedy trial, the prosecuting officer to
prefer the same charge in another form, to substitute a charge for an attempt
to commit an offence when the charge is for the complete commission of the
offence, or to substitute a charge for the commission of an offence which is a
lesser one than the offence for which the prisoner was committed for trial, but
which is included in its commission, even though it should not be stated as
described in the depositions. The other charge must not be a totally distinct
charge nor be wholly disconnected with the charge for which the committal or
the admission to bail for trial was made. It must be cognate to the one for
which the prisoner was committed or bailed. R. v. Wener (1903), 6 Can. Cr. Cas. 406 (Que.). When the charge
has been drawn without sufficient accuracy, a proper and appropriate charge may
be substituted and preferred. This gives a reasonable application to the
provisions contained in sec. 834, which must preclude

[Page 142]

any other interpretation. Regina v. Lonar,
25 N.S.R., p. 124; Regina v. Smith, 25 N.S.R., p. 138, and Regina v. Morgan, 2
B.C.R., p. 829. The prisoner need not necessarily be tried for an offence in
the language of the commitment or of the recognizance, but he may be tried on
any form of charge in which the offence can properly be described, although not
so mentioned in the depositions. R. v. Wener (1903), 6 Can. Cr. Cas. 406; Cornwall v. Regina, 33
U.C.Q.B. 119.

In case of a substitution of another charge
for which the law permits a heavier punishment the prisoner’s consent should be
distinctly obtained, not to the substitution, but to the waiving of the right
of trial by jury. Goodman v. R. (1883), 3 Ont. R. 18.

Where a man consents to waive his right to
a jury, and to be tried summarily by the judge on a charge which on its face
would only warrant an imprisonment for less than a year, he ought not by any
implication to be held as assenting to waive such right as to any charge that
the law may allow to be substituted therefor which might render him liable to a
larger punishment, and his assent to be summarily tried on the substituted charge
should be obtained and recorded. Ibid.

The consent of the judge must be obtained
before the “other charge” is preferred. R. v. Cohon, 6 Can. Cr. Cas. 386 (N.S.).

After a committal for trial at the instance
of the Crown upon a charge of manslaughter and arraignment thereon under the
speedy trials clauses and election of the accused for speedy trial without a
jury, the proceedings in the county court judge’s criminal court will not be
stayed at the instance of the Crown to enable a charge of murder to be substituted.
The King v. Telford, 8 Can. Cr. Cas. 223.

After an election for speedy trial without
a jury, leave should not be granted to add other charges substantially
different from those upon which his election was made, unless the accused is
willing to elect speedy trial in respect also of such additional charges. R. v.
Douglas (1906), 12 Can. Cr.
Cas. 120 (Man.).

The grand jury system was generally awkward and
unfair to victims or other informants who had initiated a prosecution and were
bound over. Awk-

[Page 143]

ward because public officers interested in the
prosecution of crime had to either get a consent from the Attorney General or
the Court, or lay an information. Unfair to them because, when laying an
information before a justice, they were considered as being on the same footing
as a private informant, were subject to being bound over and personally risk
the consequences of a grand jury not finding a true bill or the consequences of
an acquittal subsequent to a true bill. (See R. v. St. Louis (1897),
1 C.C.C. 141). Furthermore, it was unfair to the victims of crimes who
prosecuted: “The fact that the attorney-general and the Crown prosecutors take
charge of a case when it is transmitted to the proper Court and it is a public
one and therefore submit the indictment to the Grand Jury and conduct the case
before the Petit Jury, does not relieve the prosecutor from his liability to
pay such costs on the happening of any of the events just enumerated.” (See R.
v. St. Louis, supra, per Wurtele J., at p. 147). Added to that was the
fact that “The preferring of an indictment by an agent of the Attorney-General
acting under a general appointment to attend to all criminal cases at a session
of the Court without having obtained the special direction of the Attorney-General
or an order or consent under Cr. Code, sec. 641, is not a
compliance with Cr. Code, sec. 641, requiring the indictment to be
preferred by the person bound over by recognizance to prefer the same, and, if
the latter fails to appear, the indictment should be quashed.” (The summary of
the decision of Weatherbe J., Graham E.J., and Henry J. in R. v. Hamilton (1898),
2 C.C.C. 178, (C.A.N.S.))

Parliament in 1900, one might assume in reaction
to this latter decision of the Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia, amended s. 641
of the Code by enacting 63-64 Vict., c. 46, s. 641, which added a
paragraph:

[Page 144]

641. …

2. The counsel acting on behalf of the
Crown at any court of criminal jurisdiction may prefer against any person who
has been committed for trial at such court a bill of indictment for the charge
on which the accused has been so committed or for any charge founded on the
facts or evidence disclosed in the depositions taken before the justice.

Crown counsel could therefore prefer the
indictment in the stead of the person bound over or, more important, when no
one was bound over following the committal. There was however a limitation, the
requirement that there had to be a committal. In the case of a discharge, only
the person bound over at his request could prefer the indictment, save of
course a specific preferment under s. 641(3).

To summarize one sees that, by 1900, under the
grand jury system the holding of a preliminary inquiry resulting in a committal
was the rule and could be avoided or a discharge subsequent thereto could be
overlooked only subject to either the control of the courts or to personal
accountability on the part of a private citizen being open to forfeiture of his
security, the payment of costs and even damages, or subject to control by the
Attorney General. But on the other hand, once a preliminary had resulted in a
committal, the system was lax as to what charges could be preferred, the only
prerequisite (even for speedy trials as a matter of judicial practice) being
that it be for a charge “founded on the facts or evidence disclosed in the
depositions”.

The Revised Statutes of Canada of 1906 brought
no change to the system, save a rearrangement and renumbering of the relevant
sections. But in 1907, by the enactment of s. 873A (6 & 7 Ed. VII, c.
8) there was introduced for the first time as an exception for the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta what has now become the system for all provinces save
Nova Scotia.

873A. In the
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, it shall not be necessary to
prefer any bill of indictment

[Page 145]

before a grand jury, but it shall be
sufficient that the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence be
commenced by a formal charge in writing setting forth as in an indictment the
offence with which he is charged.

2. Such charge may be preferred by the
Attorney General or an agent of the Attorney General, or by any person with the
written consent of the judge of the court or of the Attorney General, or by
order of the court.

This was at the time an exceptional mode of
prosecution. There needed not be any preferment before a grand jury. These two
new provinces had already known the system as having been part of the Northwest Territories where there was no
grand jury. Preliminary inquiries were held but this was not always the rule,
as appears from the remarks of Johnstone J. then of the Supreme Court of
Saskatchewan, sitting en banc in 1909 in the case of R. v. Duff (No.
2) (1909), 15 C.C.C. 454, where he said, at p. 465:

It has been of common occurrence in this
Province in the past, and in the Territories forming the Provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta for
years before the foundation of these Provinces, to commence the prosecution of
persons for criminal offences without first having had a preliminary hearing
before a justice of the peace.

The list of persons at s. 873A does not include
“counsel acting on behalf of the Crown”. The persons therein listed are
practically the same persons, when adding to them the agents of the attorneys
general, that could by-pass the holding of a preliminary inquiry or a
discharge.

Nevertheless, following the introduction of s.
873A into the Code there was great uncertainty as to whether a
preliminary could be by-passed in view of the fact that there was no grand
jury. In 1910, this Court, Idington J. dissenting, on a reference Re
Criminal Code (1910), 43 S.C.R. 434, found in the affirmative. Every judge
clearly states in his reasons that the finding, because made on a reference,
was not binding and that furthermore the Court had not had the benefit of
adversarial argument. Idington J. predicated his dissent essen-

[Page 146]

tially on two arguments: first, that as regards
s. 873A, there was open to the Court two interpretations, one of which
permitting to read into that section the requirement for a preliminary
inquiry. This is what I understand from his remarks, at p. 450:

It seems to me the question cannot be
answered as if beyond doubt, and when answered here and thus ex parte can
bind no one.

But I am quite sure of one thing relative
to the administration of justice, and that is that no one entrusted therewith
or any part thereof should ever jeopardize or prejudice by the adoption of a
doubtful course of procedure, when a safer one was at hand, either the administration
of justice or the standing, reputation or freedom of another for a single hour.

I therefore answer the first question,
‘yes,’ and each of the others, ‘no.’

His other argument was more textual. It seized
onto the words of s. 873A “the trial of any person charged with a criminal
offence be commenced by a formal charge”. His reasoning went as follows, at pp.
448-49:

With some changes in 1869 the law stood as
above indicated till the Criminal Code was enacted in 1892.

Section 641 thereof expressly prohibited
indictments being preferred unless there had been the preliminary examination
followed by a prosecutor being bound over or a committal; or the
Attorney-General or any one by his direction or a judge permitted.

This was again amended by 63 & 64 Vict.
ch. 46, and again by the Revised Statutes of Canada and stood as it now stands
in the Criminal Code sections 870 to 873 inclusive.

These sections are plain. They
require, except in specified cases left to the discretion of an
Attorney-General or a judge of a court of record or of criminal jurisdiction,
preliminary proceedings.

The amendment section 873(a)
does not in the slightest degree imply any intention to repeal them beyond the
obvious necessity arising from the substitution of the officers above named for
the discharge of the functions of the grand jury relative to placing a man on
his trial.

[Page 147]

It deals only with the case of “the
trial of any person charged with a criminal offence.” How charged? Is it
confined to those who have been judicially so charged, by virtue of the
provisions of the law for committing the accused for trial?

How can it mean aught else? The word
“charged” is the apt one to designate a person accused and in charge. Doubtless
it has another meaning but it may well be argued that it is in this restricted
sense that the Act applies it.

(Emphasis added.)

The majority’s view was that the system those
Territories had known prior to their becoming provinces would continue. Though
they did not expressly say so one might assume that they felt that the fact
those Territories had become provinces did not change the need for an
exceptional mode of prosecution in that part of the country. Also, they said
that the text of s. 873A was clear, unambiguous and expressed clearly what
Parliament had intended. But the Court so insisted on the fact that the
decision was in no way binding that I cannot but think that the uncertainty the
reference was intended to dispel remained. Nevertheless, Parliament did not
speak out on that aspect of the matter till 1953. In the meantime however, by
amendments in 1909, 1925 and in 1943, the charging power in the case of speedy
trials was gradually modified.

By 1944 the Criminal Code provided:

827. …

2. If the prisoner has been brought before
the prosecuting officer, and consents to be tried by the judge, without a jury,
the trial shall proceed on the day named by the judge in the manner provided by
the next following subsection.

(3) In such case or if the prisoner has
been brought before the judge and consents to be tried by him without a jury,
the prosecuting officer shall prefer a formal statement in writing, setting
forth as separate counts therein the charge or charges against him for which he
has been committed for trial and any charge or charges founded on the facts or
evidence disclosed in the depositions and any charge or charges preferred
against him pursuant to the provisions of section eight hundred and
thirty-four.

[Page 148]

834. The
prosecuting officer may, with the consent of the judge, prefer against the
prisoner a charge for any offence for which he may be tried under the
provisions of this Part other than the charge for which he has been committed
to jail for trial or bound over, although such charge does not appear or is not
mentioned in the depositions upon which the prisoner was committed or is for a
wholly distinct and unconnected offence: Provided that the prisoner shall not
be tried under this Part or upon any such additional charge unless with his
consent obtained as hereinbefore provided.

2. Any such charge may thereupon be dealt
with, prosecuted and disposed of, and the prisoner may be remanded, held for
trial or admitted to bail thereon, in all respects as if such charge had been
the one upon which the prisoner was committed for trial.

Following a committal, no longer was the judge’s
and the accused’s consent required as regards offences revealed at the
preliminary. The criterion of the case law for the judge giving his consent had
been enacted. By 1944, the special intervention, consent or direction of the
attorney general or his agent or of the court was only required to by-pass a
preliminary or to overcome a discharge so as to go directly to trial with a
jury in petit jury provinces or to the grand jury in others. If a preliminary
had been held and resulted in a committal “a prosecuting officer” could, in
speedy trials, charge additionally or in the stead of the offence the object of
the committal for any offence revealed by the evidence. On the other hand, the
powers of the agent of the Attorney General (as all others listed in today’s s.
507(2)) were unlimited for jury trials but limited to those of a “prosecuting
officer” in speedy trials: the offence charged had to be disclosed in the
evidence taken at the preliminary. The limitation to the Attorney General’s and
his agent’s wide powers to indict in the case of jury trials when charging in
speedy trials is understandable in the light of two facts: the Attorney General
could always avoid a speedy trial by ordering a trial by jury (see R. v.
King (1956), 114 C.C.C. 125; that power recognized by the courts was
eventually enacted by 1968-69 (Can.), c. 38,

[Page 149]

s. 43, and is today s. 498 of the Code);
furthermore, this was only fair to the accused, who has relinquished his right
to a jury trial on the assumption that he would be tried for an offence related
to the events that were investigated and disclosed to him at the preliminary
inquiry.

In the new Code of 1953, Parliament
modified the wording of the section, by then s. 489, and replaced the words
“the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence” upon which Idington
J. rested in part his dissenting views by the words “the trial of an accused”.

489. (1) In
the provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia
and in the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories it is not necessary to
prefer a bill of indictment before a grand jury, but it is sufficient if the
trial of an accused is commenced by an indictment in writing setting forth the
offence with which he is charged.

(2) An indictment under subsection (1)
may be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent, by the Deputy Attorney
General, or by any person with the written consent of a judge of the court or
of the Attorney General or, in any province to which this section applies,
by order of the court.

By then other provinces, namely Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia, that had formerly been
grand jury provinces, had joined Saskatchewan and Alberta in a
non grand jury system. The considerations that could explain and justify for Alberta and Saskatchewan such an exceptional system at the outset were no longer valid for
those two provinces and in any event could surely not be invoked as regards
these newcomers. Yet Parliament did not speak out, except to take out of the Code
most of the footing of the argument of Idington J. Curiously, Parliament
specifically abrogated in 1953 what had since long disappeared, the laying of
criminal informations. Yet,

[Page 150]

this is precisely for all practical purposes
what could be done under s. 489, and even more so as it applied to all
indictable offences and not only to misdemeanours as was the case for criminal
informations. Be that as it may, I cannot read down, as suggested by appellant,
the unambiguous language of s. 489 of the 1953 Code that Parliament
could well have modified had it intended to express its disagreement with the
views of the majority of this Court in Re Criminal Code.

At the time of the 1969 amendments, there was no
restriction on the power enjoyed by those persons listed at today’s s. 507(2)
to indict directly in jury trials. Furthermore, the restriction to their powers
to indict was only for trials before a judge of Part XVI, and, though requiring
that a preliminary had been held, that there be a committal, and that the count
be one related to offences disclosed in the evidence, clearly did not require
that a preliminary have been held and a committal have ensued for each count
found in the indictment.

The 1969 Amendments

But there was an anomaly. As I said, at the
outset the exceptional mode of prosecuting instituted in 1907 had become the
rule. Also, there was a controversy between the courts of various provinces as
to whether, having chosen to proceed by resorting to a preliminary inquiry, an
attorney general could under the section shortcircuit the process before
the magistrate’s decision, or overrule his discharge by indicting directly.
(For a review of the case law on the point, see Culliton CJ.S. in R. v.
Sommervill (1963), 40 C.R. 384). Even those courts acknowledging that the
attorney general was so empowered expressed concern over the fact that it
should exist and expressed the feeling that in any event that it should be only
in exceptional circumstances that the attorney general disregard a finding of
the judiciary resulting in

[Page 151]

a discharge, and indict notwithstanding. This
was further aggravated by the fact that gradually most prosecutions were being
handled by full time Crown attorneys who were usually agents of the attorney
general and that the attorney general was more and more remote from the taking
of such a delicate decision and that as a result his political accountability
was not sufficiently being triggered. Furthermore, a review of the cases in the
1960’s reveals conflicting attitudes from one province to another and in a few
jurisdictions, what some might consider an abuse of the power by the Crown
Attorneys acting as agents of the attorney general. (See, as illustrations, R.
v. Biernacki (1962), 37 C.R. 226; R. v. Beaudry, [1967] 1 C.C.C.
272).

In 1969, Idington J.’s policy arguments, though
not his conclusions, finally prevailed. I am referring to those expressed when
he said, at pp. 449-50:

I am satisfied from the practice of such a
thing, though possible in law, never having been attempted, it was of set
purpose to bring about a definite preliminary examination, as the key-note of
criminal prosecution save where an Attorney-General or judge directed
otherwise.

The result was in the plainest possible
case the hearing had to be repeated before a magistrate to ensure committal for
trial.

The policy of the law that there should be
a preliminary examination was thus clearly settled and so settled in order that
on grounds of humanity and justice that examination might, as so often happens,
enable one accused, without perhaps the slightest foundation, by
cross-examination of his accusers or by his own explanations to dispel the
false appearances against him and save him the pain and indignity of being
improperly placed on his trial.

The differences between that and the system
of placing a man on his trial without being given such opportunity is most
radical. The tendency in the one method is towards a humane administration of
justice and in the other towards the vicious reverse thereof.

(Emphasis added.)

[Page 152]

His views were predicated, and with respect I
should say rightly so, on the need to afford an accused a mechanism to “dispel
the false appearances against him” and avoid a trial by ensuring that he be
given an opportunity to cross-examine and be heard and offer his own evidence,
and that a decision to deprive the accused of same or to override a justice’s
discharge be taken by the Attorney General himself with full knowledge
of the circumstances, a decision for which he would be politically accountable.

This is what in my view was enacted by
Parliament by the addition of subs. (3) to s. 489:

489. …

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

an indictment under subsection (1)
shall not be preferred except with the written consent of a judge of the court,
or by the Attorney General.

The effect of this amendment is to put all those
listed in s. 507(2), except the Attorney General (or save judicial
intervention), as regards jury trials in the position they were already in when
preferring charges before a judge of Part XVI. While the amendment to s. 507 is
the result of the two policy considerations I have already alluded to, its
drafting reflects the interaction of two facts: the very general power enjoyed
until then by those listed at s. 507(2) as regards jury trials, and the
relatively limited scope of the powers to charge enjoyed by them and others
when acting before a judge of Part XVI. The draftsmen proceeded by subtraction
rather than by rewriting s. 507(2) along the lines of s. 496(2)(b).
Questionable as that may be, I cannot find any further curtailment to the very
general power to indict such as to require that the preliminary inquiry be held
for each specific charge contained in the indictment. What Idington J. was
thinking of, an opportunity to cross-examine, to be heard and put the Crown’s
case to the test, is accommodated by the fact that, an inquiry having to be
held, any count in the indictment will necessarily be related to the charge
investigated at the preliminary under the evidenti-

[Page 153]

ary rules of relevancy, and by the requirement
that there be a committal for that charge.

Cory J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal in
the present case, put the matter as follows:

The question of relevancy and thus the
admissibility of evidence relating to a charge other than that contained in the
information will always constitute a serious problem for the Crown. The
question of relevancy will also act as a safeguard for the accused and ensure
that he has had full opportunity to investigate. The issue will only arise in
those cases where the additional counts disclosed by the evidence form an
integral part of the offence with which the accused is charged, in other words,
they are really a part of the same transaction. The acts upon which these
counts are based will be so closely interwoven with the offence facing the
accused on the preliminary inquiry that they will be a part of the res
gestae. Thus the evidence will be admissible on the preliminary hearing as
an essential part of the history of events pertaining to the charge under
investigation.

Appellant in his factum and in oral argument
before this Court relied greatly on what this Court said in R. v. Chabot,
supra. The issue in that case was inter alia, as stated by my
brother Dickson, as follows, at p. 1000:

How wide is the scope of a provincial court
judge’s power to commit for trial at a preliminary inquiry? Can the judge
commit for any charge disclosed by the evidence at the hearing? Alternatively,
can he commit only for charges that are ‘related’ to the charge specified in
the information? Can he commit only for the actual offence charged in the
information or an included offence?

and concluded at p. 1009:

I conclude, therefore, that a justice
conducting a preliminary inquiry may inquire into, and commit only on, the
charge specified in the information or informations. This includes any
‘included offences’ since

[Page 154]

included offences necessarily form part of
the original charge: s. 589(1) of the Criminal Code.

One of his reasons in support of this conclusion
followed, at pp. 1008-09:

Had Parliament wished to confer on a magistrate
the power to commit an accused for any offence disclosed by the evidence, it
could easily have done so in clear terms. The failure to specify such a power
in s. 475 is not due to inadvertence. Later sections dealing with the
power of the Crown to prefer an indictment expressly contemplate such power. In
s. 496(2)(b), for example, it is provided that the attorney general, in
certain circumstances, may prefer an indictment which includes counts “relating
to offences disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry…”. A
similar provision is included in s. 504, which deals with procedure before a
court constituted with a grand jury. Parliament clearly adverted to a power
such as is argued for by the Crown in the present case. Parliament chose expressly
to provide such power in ss. 496 and 504. No such power was intended under s.
475.

These remarks must be read in the light of those
preceding where he said, at p. 1002:

It is critical, as it seems to me, to
commence the inquiry with an analysis of the provisions of the Code. If
the power to commit for trial on offences other than those specified in the
information exists, such power must be found in the Code, either
expressly or by necessary implication. This is evident from the opinion of
Mr. Justice Ritchie in Doyle v. The Queen, supra, at p. 602, where
he stated:

Whatever inherent powers may be possessed
by a superior court judge in controlling the process of his own Court, it is my
opinion that the powers and functions of a magistrate acting under the Criminal
Code are circumscribed by the provisions of that statute and must be found
to have been thereby conferred either expressly or by necessary implication.

It is conceded by the Crown that nowhere is
a power to commit for a greater offence expressly conferred by the Code. The
question therefore becomes, is it manifest that Parliament conferred such
power by necessary implication?

(Emphasis added.)

Appellant seeks support from these remarks now
and says that the letter of s. 507(2) does not and never did expressly confer
the power to prefer for

[Page 155]

additional charges and that Parliament could
well have done so as it did for trials before judges sitting under Part XVI of
the Code and for the preferment of indictments before grand juries in Nova Scotia.

As I have already said, s. 507 was, until the
introduction in 1969 of s. 507(3), as clear and unambiguous as was s. 873A in
1907 and s. 489 in 1953, and to all mentioned at s. 507(2) it granted
expressly, given the unqualified broad language of s. 507(1), the power to
indict for any offence irrespective of a preliminary inquiry having been held
or the result thereof.

By saying that, if the power ever existed,
it was taken away in 1969 by the addition of s. 507(3), it is the
appellant who is arguing, as the Crown did unsuccessfully in Chabot, that
it is manifest that Parliament took the power away by “necessary implication”
by reading into the words of s. 507(3)(a) (as was the Crown in Chabot
by reading in words into the words of s. 475 of the Code) “a
preliminary inquiry has not been held.” the additional words “into each of the
offences charged in the indictment.”

Furthermore, the amendment of 1969 could not so
curtail the general power that existed under subss. (1) and (2) of s. 507 as
such would be giving to the words “a preliminary inquiry has not been held” a
different meaning under s. 507(3) than that under subs. (4) of s. 505, infra,
notwithstanding the fact that both sections using identical language
were introduced at the same time. On the other hand, if appellant’s suggested
meaning were given to both sections, we are led into an absurdity. Indeed,
dealing with this latter hypothesis, giving to those words the meaning
suggested by appellant in both sections would lead to an absurdity as regards
s. 504.

Section 504 reads:

504. The
prosecutor may prefer, before a court constituted with a grand jury, a bill of
indictment against

[Page 156]

any person who has been committed for trial
at that court in respect of

(a) the charge on which that person
was committed for trial, or

(b) any charge founded on the facts
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry.

Section 505 reads:

505. (1) A
bill of indictment may be preferred

(a) by the Attorney General or
anyone by his direction, before the grand jury of any court constituted with a
grand jury,

(b) by anyone who has the written
consent of the Attorney General, or the written consent of a judge of a court
constituted with a grand jury, before the grand jury of the court specified in
the consent, or

(c) by order of a court constituted
with a grand jury, before the grand jury of that court.

(2) No reference is necessary in an
indictment to a consent that is given or an order that is made under this
section.

(3) No objection shall be taken to an
indictment for want of a consent or order required by this section unless
it is taken by motion to quash the indictment before the accused is given in
charge to the jury.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

a bill of indictment shall not be preferred
except with the written consent of a judge of a court constituted with a grand
jury, before the grand jury of the court specified in the consent, or by the
Attorney General before the grand jury of any court constituted with a grand
jury.

Parliament could not have intended to abolish
under s. 505(4) the power it had conferred upon the prosecutor under s. 504(b).

To summarize, and to relate my conclusion as
regards s. 507(2) to s. 507(1) and (3): except in Nova Scotia (and save a few
exceptions, such as, to illustrate a prosecution under s. 124) the preferment
of indictments in jury trials is governed as follows:

[Page 157]

1. The Attorney General or anyone with the
written consent of a judge of the court may prefer an indictment for any
offence irrespective of whether a preliminary inquiry has been held, and if so,
whether the accused was discharged or committed for that or any other offence.

2. Anyone else empowered under s. 507(2) to
prefer indictments can do so only if the following conditions have been met:

1) A preliminary inquiry has been held;

2) The accused has been committed for trial on
at least one of the charges inquired into by the justice;

3) The count of the indictment must be for

a) an offence for which the accused was
committed, or

b) for an offence disclosed in the evidence
introduced at the preliminary inquiry, and which is not an offence for which
the accused was discharged.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The reasons of Dickson and Wilson JJ. were
delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The question is
whether the provisions of s. 507 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, permit an agent of the Attorney General to prefer an indictment
containing counts alleging offences additional to those with which an accused
has been charged, and committed to trial, at a preliminary inquiry. Though
essentially a question of statutory interpretation the ramifications extend to
basic issues concerning the nature and purpose of a preliminary inquiry.

I The Facts

On April 2, 1980 the appellant Rodger David McKibbon appeared before Bennett
Prov.Ct.J. on charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit an
indictable offence contrary to

[Page 158]

s. 306(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and
with impersonating a police officer, contrary to s. 361(a).
Following a preliminary inquiry, McKibbon was committed for trial on both
charges. Counsel for the Crown requested that the appellant be committed for
trial on two additional counts which he maintained were disclosed by the
evidence at the preliminary inquiry, namely breaking and entering a dwelling
place and committing therein an indictable offence contrary to s. 306(1)(b)
and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary
to s. 85. The presiding judge following the decision of this Court in R. v.
Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985, refused to commit for the additional offences.

On April 18, 1980 the Assistant Crown Attorney
for the Judicial District of Hamilton-Wentworth purported to prefer an
indictment on all four counts, the two for which McKibbon had been committed
for trial and the two on which the judge presiding at the preliminary inquiry
had declined to commit. McKibbon subsequently brought an application before
Galligan J. to quash the two additional counts as improperly preferred.
Galligan J. (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 126, 34 O.R. (2d) 185, dismissed the
application and his decision was confirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal
(Brooke, Weatherston and Cory JJ.A.) now reported sub nom. Re McKibbon and
The Queen (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 441, 35 O.R. (2d) 124. In this decision
Cory J.A. held that where a preliminary inquiry results in an accused being
committed for trial, the Crown prosecutor may, without the personal
intervention of the Attorney General, prefer an indictment which includes
counts with which the accused was not originally charged but which were
disclosed in the evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

[Page 159]

II The Effect of R. v. Chabot

Much of the argument before this Court dealt
with the implications for this case of the decision in R. v. Chabot, supra. In
the Chabot case this Court unanimously held that the judge presiding at
a preliminary inquiry has no power to commit a person for trial for any
offences (except for included offences) other than those with which that person
was charge at the beginning of the preliminary inquiry. The Court held that in
view of the principle in Doyle v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597, any
power of committal would have to be found either expressly or by necessary
implication in the provisions of the Criminal Code. None of the
sections of the Code cited by the Crown was capable of supporting a
power to commit for offences with which the accused had not been charged at the
preliminary inquiry, even if such offences were disclosed by the evidence. At
pages 1008-09 of the judgment the following was said about the presiding
judge’s purported power to commit in such circumstances:

Had Parliament wished to confer on a
magistrate the power to commit an accused for any offence disclosed by the
evidence, it could easily have done so in clear terms. The failure to specify
such a power in s. 475 is not due to inadvertence. Later sections dealing
with the power of the Crown to prefer an indictment expressly contemplate such
power. In s. 496(2)(b), for example, it is provided that the attorney
general, in certain circumstances, may prefer an indictment which includes
counts “relating to offences disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary
inquiry…”. A similar provision is included in s. 504, which deals with
procedure before a court constituted with a grand jury. Parliament clearly
adverted to a power such as is argued for by the Crown in the present case.
Parliament chose expressly to provide such power in ss. 496 and 504. No such
power was intended under s. 475.

The appellant seeks to extend this reasoning to
the present case. In Chabot the issue was a judge’s power to commit.
Here it is a Crown prosecutor’s power to prefer an indictment. According to the
appellant, however, the principles are the same. If the Crown prosecutor is to
be authorized to prefer

[Page 160]

an indictment alleging offences other than those
for which a preliminary inquiry has been held, that power must appear either
explicitly or by necessary implication in the Criminal Code. Where the
trial is to take place before a judge sitting without a jury or before a judge
and jury in a jurisdiction where indictments are preferred before a grand jury,
the Criminal Code explicitly grants the Crown prosecutor the powers in
dispute in the present case. As Chabot points out the relevant
sections are ss. 496 and 504. Section 496 deals with a trial to be
held before a judge sitting without a jury:

496. (1)
Where an accused elects under section 464, 484 or 492 to be tried by a
judge without a jury, an indictment in Form 4 shall be preferred by the
Attorney General or his agent, or by any person who has the written consent
of the Attorney General, and in the Province of British Columbia may be
preferred by the clerk of the peace.

(2) An indictment that is preferred
under subsection (1) may contain any number of counts, and there may be
joined in the same indictment

(a) counts relating to offences in
respect of which the accused elected to be tried by a judge without a jury and
for which the accused was committed for trial, whether or not the offences were
included in one information, and

(b) counts relating to offences
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or
in substitution for any offence for which the accused was committed for trial.

(Emphasis added.)

Where an accused elects to be tried by a judge
and jury in a grand jury jurisdiction (currently Nova
 Scotia is the only such jurisdiction) powers such as
those in issue are specified in s. 504:

504. The
prosecutor may prefer, before a court constituted with a grand jury, a bill of
indictment against any person who has been committed for trial at that court in
respect of

[Page 161]

(a) the charge on which that person
was committed for trial, or

(b) any charge founded on the
facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry.

(Emphasis added.)

In the present case the appellant elected trial
by judge and jury in a jurisdiction in which indictments are not preferred
before a grand jury. The relevant section of the Criminal Code in
such a situation is s. 507. According to the appellant, unlike ss. 496 and 504,
but like the sections of the Code cited by the Crown in Chabot, s.
507 contains no mention of the power being claimed:

507. (1) In
the Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia and in the Yukon
Territory and Northwest Territories it is not necessary to prefer a bill of
indictment before a grand jury, but it is sufficient if the trial of an accused
is commenced by an indictment in writing setting forth the offence with which
he is charged.

(2) An indictment under subsection (1)
may be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent, or by any person with
the written consent of a judge of the court or of the Attorney General or, in
any province to which this section applies, by order of the court.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

an indictment under subsection (1)
shall not be preferred except with the written consent of a judge of the court,
or by the Attorney General.

In the absence of the explicit authorization
found in ss. 496 and 504, the appellant contends, the Crown prosecutor in a
non-grand jury jurisdiction, should, like the presiding judge in Chabot,
not be held to possess the powers claimed for him.

In the Ontario Court of Appeal, Cory J.A.
pointed out a flaw in this argument. It was his opinion that the Crown
prosecutor’s purported

[Page 162]

power of indictment, though not specified in the
detail found in ss. 496 and 504 was nevertheless included in the general power
granted by s. 507. Section 507(2) provides:

(2) An indictment under subsection (1)
may be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent, or by any person with
the written consent of a judge of the court or of the Attorney General or, in
any province to which this section applies, by order of the court.

In the opinion of Cory J.A. this section, when
combined with s. 507(1) which provides that it is sufficient if the trial of an
accused is commenced “by an indictment in writing setting forth the offence
with which he is charged”, constituted adequate specific authorization within
the Criminal Code for a Crown prosecutor to prefer an indictment in a
situation such as the present. In his opinion, the only remaining issue was
whether s. 507(3) limited this wide power.

The conclusion of Cory J.A. as to the width of
s. 507(1) and (2) echoes the majority view in Re Criminal Code (1910),
43 S.C.R. 434. In that reference this Court was asked its opinion as to whether
the predecessor of s. 507(1) and (2) (s. 873A of the 1906 Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1906,
c. 146 as amended by 1907 (Can.), 6 & 7 Ed. VII, c. 8, s. 2) permitted an
agent of the Attorney General to prefer an indictment in the absence of a prior
preliminary inquiry. The majority of the Court had no difficulty in finding a
power to prefer an indictment (even where no preliminary inquiry had been held)
in the following words of s. 873A, substantially still present in s. 507(1):

… it shall be sufficient that the trial of
any person charged with a criminal offence be commenced by a formal charge in
writing setting forth as in an indictment the offence with which he is charged.

It is true that each member of the majority in Re
Criminal Code, supra, emphasized that the opinions in that reference had no
binding force, and it is also true that the case was the occasion

[Page 163]

for a powerful and eloquent dissent by Idington
J. which concluded that no such power was to be found in the words in question.
Nevertheless, most judicial opinion has endorsed the majority view, especially
in view of the fact that in 1953 (1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 489(1)) Parliament
deleted the words “the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence”
upon which Idington J. based much of his dissent, and substituted the phrase
“trial of an accused”.

Assuming that this preponderant judicial opinion
is correct, then the words of s. 507(1) and (2) standing alone would provide
more than ample authorization for the Crown prosecutor to prefer the indictment
now in issue. In that case, the only question, as Cory J.A. points out, is
whether s. 507(3) limits the wide powers granted in subss. (1) and (2) so as
nevertheless to prohibit what the Crown prosecutor purported to do.

III “Where a preliminary inquiry has not been
held”

Section 507 was amended in 1969 by the
addition of subs. (3):

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

an indictment under subsection (1)
shall not be preferred except with the written consent of a judge of the court,
or by the Attorney General.

(Emphasis added.)

There is no question that this provision limits
the wide powers otherwise apparently conferred by s. 507(1) and (2). Does it
limit them sufficiently to apply to the present case? The answer depends on the
meaning of the words “a preliminary inquiry has not been held”. The appellant
claims that these words contemplate a preliminary inquiry on the specific
charges for which the indictment is sought to be preferred; otherwise “a
preliminary inquiry has not been held”. The Crown says that

[Page 164]

this is reading too much into the phrase and so
long as the charges in question arise following a preliminary inquiry, even if
that inquiry is into charges other than those for which the indictment is
sought to be preferred, it cannot be said that “a preliminary inquiry has not
been held”.

Cory J.A. agreed with the Crown’s contention,
citing in support, inter alia, R. v. G. & P. International News Ltd. and
Judd (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 169 (B.C.C.A.), R. v. Philbin and Henderson,
[1978] 1 W.W.R. 122 (Alta. C.A.) and R. v. Dwyer and Lauzon (1978),
42 C.C.C. (2d) 83 (Ont. C.A.), reversed on other grounds [1980] 1 S.C.R. 481.
The appellant’s submission, on the other hand, harks back to lower court
judgments, inter alia R. v. Dwyer (1976), 38 C.R.N.S. 129 (Ont. H.C.)
and R. v. Cormier (unreported, Ont. H.C.).

Counsel for the Crown argues that the
appellant’s interpretation of the phrase is essentially similar to the
unsuccessful argument by the Crown in Chabot, namely that a meaning
absent from the express words of the section is to be read into it “by
necessary implication” and is to be preferred to the plain meaning of the words
in question. I do not think the Crown can succeed on this argument. In my view
the reading proposed by the appellant does not depart from the plain meaning of
the words in question and it is, with respect, more likely than the Crown’s
reading.

A preliminary inquiry cannot be held in the
abstract. It is a proceeding designed to investigate specific charges in order
to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to commit an accused for
trial on those charges. It begins with a reading of the charges in question and
ends with the presiding judge’s decision whether or not to commit on any or all
of those charges. This means that if the preliminary inquiry does not pass
through all these stages, if it is commenced but not completed, then “a
preliminary inquiry has not been held” within the meaning of s. 507(3)(a)
(Re Stewart and The Queen No. 2 (1977), 35 C.C.C.

[Page 165]

(2d) 281 (Ont. C.A.)). In
other words “a preliminary inquiry has not been held” absent a conclusion about
the specific offence with which the accused has been charged.
Section 507(3) refers to “an indictment under subsection (1)”, that
is “an indictment in writing setting forth the offence with which [the accused]
is charged”. I agree with Goodman J. (as he then was) in R. v. Dwyer, supra,
that this is strong evidence that s. 507(3)(a) contemplates a
preliminary inquiry into each and every charge with reference to which an
indictment is sought to be preferred. In my view, as a purely textual issue,
based only on the wording of s. 507, the appellant’s reading is preferable to
that of the Crown.

The Crown, however, presents additional
arguments essentially to the effect that even if the appellant’s reading is a
possible one when s. 507 is looked at in isolation, when one considers the
wider context of the Criminal Code provisions relating to the preferment
of indictments, the appellant’s reading becomes logically and pragmatically
insupportable.

The phrase “where a preliminary inquiry has not been
held” appears not only in s. 507 but also in s. 505 dealing with indictments
before a court constituted with a grand jury. If in s. 507 this phrase
contemplates a preliminary inquiry into the specific charges in question then
it must have the same meaning in s. 505. But this, the Crown contends, leads to
a logical absurdity.

In order to understand the Crown’s contention on
this point it is useful to place side by side the Criminal Code provisions
dealing respectively with indictments in grand jury and non‑grand jury
jurisdictions.

(Emphasis added.)

In the sections dealing with indictments
before a grand jury the phrase currently in issue appears in s. 505(4)(a).
If one looks only at s. 505, there is nothing inherently implausible about
reading “where a preliminary inquiry has not been held” in the manner suggested
by the appellant. The problem arises when one considers the effect of such a
reading on s. 504. Where there has been a committal, s. 504 explicitly
authorizes the prosecutor in a grand jury jurisdiction to prefer an indictment
on charges disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry. This is,
of course, precisely the power claimed for the Crown prosecutor in non-grand
jury jurisdictions in the present case, a power which the appellant claims is
specifically negated by s. 507(3). If section 505(4) has—as it must—the
same meaning and effect as s. 507(3), then the result, says the respondent,
will be that s. 504 gives the Crown prosecutor a power which s. 505(4)
immediately takes away. This, he says, would be an absurd result and one which
points to the impossibility of reading “where a preliminary inquiry has not
been held” in the manner proposed by the appellant.

If this were indeed the effect of the
appellant’s reading it would be a telling, and perhaps decisive, factor against
it. In my view, however, it does not have this effect.

Subsection 505(4) provides that its
restrictions apply “notwithstanding anything in this section”. Its
effect is to modify the general powers of preferment articulated in s. 505(1)(a-c).
It has no effect on the powers granted the “prosecutor” in s. 504, which is a
separate and distinct provision from

[Page 168]

s. 505. The relationship between these two
sections is somewhat obscured by the fact that s. 504 precedes s.
505. This sequence is, however, of no particular significance. When the
predecessor of s. 504 was enacted in 1900 (63-64 Vict., c. 46) as s. 641(2) of
the then Criminal Code it followed some of the provisions now
contained in s. 505 and preceded others. Over the course of time the original
provisions relating to the preferment of indictments have been amended, split
up, renumbered and rearranged. Their present sequence is more fortuitous than
deliberate and does not reflect their logical relationship. If one considers
the logical sequence of ss. 504 and 505 rather than their numerical
arrangement, it will be seen that s. 505(1-3) sets out the general principles
governing the preferment of an indictment before a court constituted with a
grand jury. Subsection (4), which contains the phrase in issue, imposes a
general restriction on the powers of preferment set out in subs. (1) by
restricting who may prefer an indictment where no preliminary inquiry into the
charge in question has been held or where such a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged. Section 504 then lays out an
exception to the restriction contained in s. 505(4)(a). Where the
accused has been committed for trial on a charge for which a preliminary
inquiry has been held, and where this preliminary inquiry discloses evidence of
further offences, then despite the fact that a preliminary inquiry into these
charges has not been held within the meaning of s. 505(4)(a), s. 504
nevertheless authorizes the Crown prosecutor to add to the indictment counts
relating to these additional offences.

On this reading it becomes possible both to give
the phrase in issue its more probable meaning and to avoid any contradiction
between ss. 504 and 505. Admittedly this reading does result in different
powers being given a prosecutor in grand jury jurisdictions from those accorded
in non-grand jury jurisdictions. This, however, is objectionable

[Page 169]

from neither an historical nor a policy point of
view. The majority in Re Criminal Code, supra, was of the opinion that
it was possible to bypass the preliminary inquiry in non-grand jury
jurisdictions in a way that was impossible before a court constituted with a
grand jury. This is an indication that almost from the beginning the
predecessors of ss. 504 and 505 on the one hand, and s. 507 on the other, were
conceptualized as capable of leading to dramatically different procedural results.
Further, the limited exception embodied in s. 504 to the general rule
prohibiting a prosecutor from preferring an indictment where no preliminary
inquiry has been held into the charges in question can be justified in a grand
jury jurisdiction in a way that it could not be where there is no grand jury.
The deliberations of the grand jury will afford an opportunity for the
sufficiency of the charges in question to be tested before the accused is made
to stand his trial, an opportunity which would be totally missing were a
similar power to be granted to a prosecutor in a non-grand jury jurisdiction.

On the basis of this analysis there seems little
justification for the Crown’s contention that the reading proposed by the
appellant is unacceptable from the point of view of either logic or policy. On
the contrary, on closer examination it would seem that it is the reading
proposed by the Crown that exhibits the infelicities purported by the Crown to
mar the appellant’s reading.

The Crown contends that a preliminary inquiry
has been held within the meaning of ss. 505(4) and 507(3) even if the
ostensible subject of the preliminary inquiry is a charge other than and in
addition to the one for which the indictment is sought to be preferred. This
reading leads to startling results when it is applied to s. 507(3)(b).
If, for example, a preliminary inquiry were held on the basis of an information
alleging three different offences and the inquiry ended with the accused

[Page 170]

being committed on two counts and being
discharged on the third, then on a consistent application of the Crown’s
proposed reading, the situation would be one where “a preliminary inquiry has
been held and the accused has been discharged”. It would therefore fall
directly within the terms of s. 507(3)(b) and therefore, despite the
committal, an indictment could not be preferred except by the Attorney General
or with the written consent of the court. This would clearly be an absurd
result but it is difficult to see how it could be avoided on the Crown’s
reading of what constitutes a situation “where a preliminary inquiry has been
held”.

There are further problems with the Crown’s
interpretation. If the Crown’s submission is correct and in this case s. 507
authorizes a prosecutor to add to an indictment counts relating to offences
disclosed in the evidence on a preliminary inquiry into other charges, then it
of course follows that the similar wording in s. 505 has the same effect. But
this is also precisely what s. 504 authorizes. This fact leads to one of two
very problematic conclusions as to the effect of s. 504. One possibility is
that s. 504 merely confirms a power that the Crown prosecutor already has by
virtue of s. 505. In that case s. 504 constitutes a totally redundant
provision, a highly unlikely possibility with regard to a section of the Criminal
Code. The other perhaps more likely possibility is that since the powers
given the prosecutor in s. 504 are cast in narrower terms than those which the
Crown says are given by s. 505, s. 504 modifies and constricts the ampler
provisions of s. 505. This gives s. 504 some purpose within the Criminal
Code but it results in a situation in which the powers to indict of a Crown
prosecutor are narrower in a grand jury jurisdiction than they are in jurisdictions
where there is no grand jury (where there is no equivalent to s. 504 to
constrict the powers the Crown says are granted by s. 507). From a policy point
of view this is an unlikely result since it results in less protection
for the accused precisely in the jurisdiction where he also does not have the
added safeguard of a grand jury to test the sufficiency of the charges in
question. This surprising

[Page 171]

consequence also has the effect of undermining
the Crown’s argument that its interpretation is superior since it results in a
uniformity of procedure in grand jury and non-grand jury jurisdictions. It
would appear that it is the Crown’s interpretation that is logically and
pragmatically unsupportable.

IV The Effects of the Powers Claimed by the
Crown

On the basis of the preceding analysis it is my
firm view that as a question of statutory interpretation the words “where a
preliminary inquiry has not been held” must refer to a preliminary inquiry with
reference to the specific charge for which an indictment is sought to be
preferred. I am glad to come to this conclusion because in my view it produces
a result that is both truer to the purpose of a preliminary inquiry and more
equitable to the accused.

The function of a preliminary inquiry is to
allow the sufficiency of the case for the Crown to be tested and if the case
does not persuade the presiding judge that the accused is “probably guilty”, to
spare the accused the expense, anxiety and humiliation of a criminal trial. Its
purpose therefore is to benefit the accused and to provide him with a
preliminary opportunity to clear himself of the charges against him without
having to go to trial. Its purpose is not to serve as an investigatory
tool to allow the Crown to strengthen or broaden its case.

Does the power contended for by the Crown accord
with the purposes of a preliminary inquiry? In the argument before this Court,
as in the decision in the Ontario Court of Appeal, the question at issue was
treated as though it were confined to the powers of a Crown prosecutor to add
to an indictment counts alleging offences disclosed by the evidence at the
preliminary inquiry where an accused has already been committed for trial fol-

[Page 172]

lowing a preliminary inquiry on other charges.
That indeed is what the Crown prosecutor purported to do in the case before us,
and it is on the basis of this understanding of the issue that Cory J.A. was
able to dismiss the possibility of a Crown prosecutor taking unfair advantage
of the power in issue. Basing himself on the statement in Chabot, supra, that
the rules of evidence relating to relevancy apply to preliminary hearings as
well as trials, it was his opinion that the scope afforded to a Crown
prosecutor for adding counts to an indictment was very narrow:

The question of relevancy and thus the
admissibility of evidence relating to a charge other than that contained in the
information will always constitute a serious problem for the Crown. The
question of relevancy will also act as a safeguard for the accused and ensure
that he has had full opportunity to investigate. The issue will only arise in
those cases where the additional counts disclosed by the evidence form an
integral part of the offence with which the accused is charged, in other words,
they are really part of the same transaction. The acts upon which these counts
are based will be so closely interwoven with the offence facing the accused on
the preliminary inquiry that they will be a part of the res gestae. Thus
the evidence will be admissible on the preliminary hearing as an essential part
of the history of events pretaining to the charge under investigation.

I cannot agree that the power claimed for the
Crown prosecutor can logically be restricted in this way. Whatever the limits
on the authority claimed for the Crown in the present case, the arguments
advanced in support of this purported power are capable of sustaining a much
broader claim. Assuming the majority opinion in Re Criminal Code, supra, to
be correct, then standing by themselves s. 507(1) and (2) would authorize an
agent of the Attorney General to prefer an indictment on any charge whether or
not there has been a preliminary inquiry on the charge in question or any other
charge. The only limitations on this power are those contained in s. 507(3),
and these on the Crown’s interpretation amount only to a requirement that (a) a
preliminary inquiry leading to a committal on some charge has been held
and (b) the accused has not been discharged with reference

[Page 173]

to the offence for which the indictment is
sought to be preferred. This is a considerably wider power to indict than that
contemplated by Cory J.A. If, in a grand jury jurisdiction the Crown
prosecutor’s power to indict is restricted in the way described by Cory
J.A. it is the result of the operation of s. 504, a section which has no
equivalent in the provisions applicable to non‑grand jury provinces.

It might be suggested that the words in s.
507(3) operate as the requisite restriction. The essence of such a submission
would be that while it is not necessary to hold a preliminary hearing into the
precise offence for which the indictment is sought to be preferred in order to
satisfy the requirement that a preliminary inquiry be held, this requirement
does at least make it necessary that a preliminary hearing be held into
“related charges” so that additional charges would be based on evidence adduced
at the preliminary inquiry.

An essentially similar argument was advanced in Chabot
with reference to the purported power of the presiding judge at a
preliminary inquiry to commit an accused for trial on charges “related” to
those that formed the subject matter of the preliminary inquiry. That argument
was rejected in Chabot. I can see no more basis for it in the language
of s. 507 than there was in the language of the sections in issue in Chabot.

I am very far from impugning the integrity or
sense of decency of Crown prosecutors in Canada, but in my view acceding to the
Crown’s submissions in this case would open, at least as a theoretical consequence,
the possibility of preliminary inquiries being used to bolster and widen rather
than to test the Crown’s case, for “fishing expeditions” rather than to allow
the accused to rebut the accusations against him.

Putting aside any fanciful flights of imagination
as to potential prosecutorial abuses of the wide

[Page 174]

powers latent in the Crown’s interpretation of
s. 507, it is plain that simply knowing that any evidence he gives can lead to
additional charges being preferred against him will have a chilling effect on
an accused’s willingness to testify himself, or to ask others to testify on his
behalf, at a preliminary inquiry. Furthermore, since he cannot know in advance
the nature of possible additional charges against him, his ability to rebut
these charges will be crucially weakened. Finally, as regards such additional
offences, the preliminary inquiry cannot be at all to the benefit of the
accused. With regard to alleged offences that form the subject of the
preliminary inquiry, it is possible for the presiding judge to dismiss the
charges and the accused is thereafter protected by the provisions of s. 507(3)(b).
No such conclusion is possible in relation to any additional offences or to
offences “disclosed by the evidence”. Where no charges have been laid, they
cannot be dismissed. Under such conditions the preliminary inquiry can only
benefit the Crown.

Finally, it should be noted that while granting
the powers claimed on behalf of the Crown could cause substantial inequity to
an accused, rejecting these claims would seem to have little deleterious effect
on the Crown’s ability to make its case or on the administration of justice.
All that is really being asked of the Crown prosecutor is that he know the
nature of his case before he embarks on the preliminary inquiry. In special
circumstances such as where it would be unjust to witnesses to compel them to
repeat at a second inquiry testimony of a particularly distressing or traumatic
character, s. 507(3) does allow for an indictment to be preferred even absent a
preliminary inquiry, with the consent of the court, or as is more usual, by the
Attorney General himself. This provision is capable of dealing sensibly with
unusual or exceptional cases without turning the preferring of indictments on
charges for which a preliminary inquiry has not been held, into an ordinary
part of criminal procedure.

[Page 175]

V Conclusion

In Re Criminal Code, supra, at p. 450,
Idington J. said as follows:

… I am quite sure of one thing relative to
the administration of justice, and that is that no one entrusted therewith or
any part thereof should ever jeopardize or prejudice by the adoption of a
doubtful course of procedure, when a safer one was at hand, either the
administration of justice or the standing reputation or freedom of another for
a single hour.

In my view, the course of procedure proposed by
the Crown in this case is more than just “doubtful”. It is based on an
interpretation of s. 507 that is logically and practically the less acceptable
of the two alternatives. It would place in the hand of the Crown prosecutor a
power not in accord with the purpose of a preliminary inquiry, inherently
inequitable to the accused and potentially open to abuse. For all these reasons
I prefer the “safer course” advocated on behalf of the appellant.

I would allow the appeal. The two additional
counts in the indictment should be quashed as improperly preferred.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Parties to an
offence—Murder—Charge to the jury—Instructions excluding s. 21 from the
consideration of the jury—Error in law—Criminal Code, ss. 21 and 218.

Following a fight involving respondent and
several other persons on an Indian Reserve in Restigouche, respondent was
accused of second degree murder under ss. 218 and 21 of the Criminal Code. He
was acquitted at trial and a Crown appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal was
dismissed. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court to determine whether the
trial judge had erred in his charge to the jury as to the applicability of
s. 21 of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

The words employed by the trial judge in his
charge to the jury dealing with the applicability of s. 21 of the Criminal
Code could convey no other meaning to a jury than that s. 21, dealing
with parties to offences other than those who actually commit them, did no
apply in this case. However, there was evidence upon which a properly
instructed jury could have found that respondent was a party to the unlawful
killing and could therefore have been convicted. Given the evidence, it was a
fatal error in law to exclude consideration of s. 21(1) of the Code from
the jury. It did not matter that only one person was charged. Where there is
evidence that more than one person participated in the commission of an
offence, it is appropriate to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of
s. 21(1) of the Code.

R. v. Sparrow (1979),
51 C.C.C. (2d) 443, approved.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of
Appeal, rendered on February 22, 1982, dismissing an appeal from a verdict of
acquittal by a judge and a jury. Appeal allowed.

[Page 75]

Michel Babin and Gilles Fournier, for the
appellant.

Lucien Grenier, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—The respondent was charged with
second degree murder in an indictment which read:

That at Restigouche, on or about June the 15th 1979, did illegally commit a second
degree murder on the person of Brennan Arsenault, committing thereby an
indictable offence under the article 218 and 21 of the Criminal Code of Canada
as amended to date.

He was acquitted at trial and a Crown appeal to
the Court of Appeal was dismissed. This appeal is by leave granted March 15,
1982.

The respondent Eugene Isaac and the deceased
Brennan Arsenault (also known as Brian) lived on an Indian reserve at
Restigouche. At the time of the killing the Isaacs and the Arsenaults were not
on good terms. This was at least partly due to a feud between one Delphis
Wysote, another resident of the reserve and a sometime friend of the
Arsenaults, and members of the respondent’s family. Some months before the
killing Delphis had stabbed Isaac’s brother who retaliated a week later by
firing a rifle at Delphis. Both were convicted and imprisoned.

Around midnight on June 14, 1979 a minor scuffle occurred involving the deceased
and the respondent in which the deceased “played with” the respondent’s hat.
Talbert Isaac, the respondent’s brother, chased the deceased and his brother
away, terminating the incident. Several witnesses said that the respondent had
not reacted angrily or aggressively on that occasion and it does not appear to
have been serious.

At approximately 2:00 a.m. on June 15, the respondent and
his sister visited the deceased’s home. The respondent’s brother, Donald, and
his friend, Murray Barnaby, either accompanied them or arrived at the Arsenault’s
house shortly after. Elizabeth Hewitt, a sister of the deceased, and her
brother, Lloyd Arsenault, were downstairs in the

[Page 76]

house drinking. The deceased, who had been
drinking a good deal that day, was sitting at the dining room table asleep.
According to the respondent, he was offered a beer. Then an argument began
involving Lloyd Arsenault and Delphis Wysote which led to an invitation by the
respondent to Lloyd Arsenault to come outside and fight. The assembled company
went outside, including the deceased who had awakened. What then occurred is
best described by the respondent in an extract from a statement he made to the
police which was admitted in evidence. It is reproduced hereunder in the form
in which it is recorded in the transcript.

So me and Murray, my sister to Arsenault’s
place. Leona entered in Elizabeth’s house with me at the same time. Ten (10) minutes after, Lloyd
Arsenault started arguying with me. Delphis put is nose in our business. I said
to Lloyd: “If you want to fight why don’t you come outside.” So we went outside
me and Lloyd and as soon I grabged Lloyd Brian Arsenault jumped in my back. So
I threw Brian off my back on the ground. The I got on top of him and started
punching on his face with my fist about five (5) times. So I left him there. At
the same time, Murray Barnaby was trying to get after Lloyd Arsenault. After, I
grabbed Lloyd. I did not fight long with him because Donald Isaac came and we
both fighting with him.

And at that time, Murray was punching Brian on his face. So Mercer came out and me and
Donald were fighting with Lloyd. So he came toward us and started yelling, and
we stopped fighting. And Elizabeth Arsenault was on the porch.

Donald was arguing with Mercer, he sent him
back in the house and he went in. He just jumped in the house and came out. And
we all took off and started running towards my brother’s house, Reggie. We all
are hiding in the basement. After five (5) minutes, we have been there, Carmen
told us to leave and we went at my father’s house.

The police put some questions to the respondent
and the questions and answers were given in evidence. They are set out
hereunder:

Q. Did you use to go at Arsenault’s case?

A. No.

Q. Why did you go there?

A. Because my sister wanted us to go.

[Page 77]

Q. Who was in the house when you got in?

A. Delphis Wysote, Elizabeth Arsenault,
Brian Arsenault, Lloyd Arsenault and Murray were standing right besides the
door.

Q. Why did stay there?

A. Because they offered me to have a beer.

Q. During the arguing did you mention the
name of your brother Leonard?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you say about him?

A. Because Lloyd told that he already tried
to bet me.

Q. Lloyd told that…

A. …

A. Lloyd told that he already tried to beat
him up on the street. And Delphis said that he already take care of… I told to
Delphis: You have already cut him up before.

Q. How come Donald got involved in that
fight?

A. Probably to help me.

Q. When did you see him first?

A. When he was going home by the driveway
of Reggie Isaac towards my brother’s place.

Q. When you saw him was it during the
fight?

A. During the fiht, yea.

Q. Did you see someone with something in
his hand during the fight?

A. No I was to busy to fight with Lloyd.

Moments after the melee outside the house
commenced, Elizabeth Hewitt’s husband, Mercer Hewitt, who had been upstairs in
bed, arrived on the scene, stopped the fight and discovered that Brian
Arsenault was dead.

The medical evidence given by the pathologist
who conducted an autopsy on the deceased was that death was caused by a heavy
blow or blows to the front part of the head with some kind of blunt object such
as a fist or a large piece of wood. The damage was severe. The skull was
fractured in the left frontal region, the brain had been pushed back and there
was extensive cerebral hemorrhaging. Under cross-examination by defence
counsel, Dr. Bachand admitted that death could have been caused by a
single hard blow but said it was unlikely to have been caused by injury to the
back

[Page 78]

of the head. According to the medical evidence,
all of the major head wounds sustained by the deceased occurred while he was
still alive. The evidence of heavy drinking on the deceased’s part was
confirmed by his blood alcohol reading of 222 milligrams per 100 millilitres of
blood. In his charge to the jury the trial judge adequately dealt with the
elements of murder and manslaughter and the significance of drunkenness on the
part of an accused in relation to those offences. This part of his charge was
not challenged in this Court. The basis of the Crown’s challenge to the verdict
is that portion of the charge on the applicability of s. 21(1) and
s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code. After reading the
subsections and giving hypothetical examples of their application, he told
the jury:

It is my responsibility to tell you that
the first part of article twenty-one (21) cannot apply in, to this case,
provided you can draw from the evidence that the accused and his companions had
the intent of going at Arsenault’s place and start a fight. They had no
intention of killing anybody. It was then their common purpose in engaging in a
fight. Not to kill anybody.

So, the first part of article 21 applies
only to a charge which may be laid down in this case, a charge of assault with
intent to cause bodily harm which is not the charge here in this case.

The second part of article twenty-one (21)
does not apply either. I’ll tell you why. If somebody starts to fight, there is
a possibility that somebody might be killed, but it is not a probability. The
article says that the commission of an offence will be the probable consequence
of carrying out a common purpose.

When there is only a possibility that an
offence may be committed, the article does not apply. It is only where there is
a probability. In this case, the common purpose of the three (3) purposes [sic]
were only in engaging in a fight and not to kill anybody and I don’t think you
can draw from the evidence that there was a probability that man might be
killed in—during the fight.

So, this part of article twenty-one (21)
does not apply either.

After deliberating for some time, the jury
returned and requested more instruction on the crime of

[Page 79]

manslaughter. The judge re-directed the jury and
said in part:

In order to find the accused guilty of
manslaughter, you have to come to the conclusion that the Crown has proven all
the elements of the murder, except the element on intent to kill a human being.

That is to say that one, the death of the
victim was caused by violence, two, that the death of the victim was the
consequence of the blows given by the accused and not by someone else, three,
that the wounds inflicted to the victim are these blows that caused the death
of the victim.

On these three elements, you have to come
to the conclusion that each and everyone of them has been proven beyond
reasonable doubt. If you have a doubt on one of these elements, the crime of
manslaughter has not been proven, but if you come to the conclusion that all of
these elements have been proven beyond reasonable doubt, then, you have a crime
of manslaughter.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal
from the acquittal of the respondent. While each of the three members of the
Court wrote separate reasons for judgment, they were in agreement that the
charge to the jury, although perhaps not perfect, did not contain such errors
as to warrant a direction for a retrial. They also considered that the points
raised by the Crown related to questions of fact or, at best, mixed fact and
law and not law alone. Monet J.A. further expressed the view that the trial
judge had not, as asserted by the Crown, withdrawn consideration of s. 21
from the jury’s consideration, but had merely given his opinion on the facts as
he was entitled to do.

In this Court the Crown contended that there was
sufficient evidence to go to the jury as to whether the respondent was a party
to the unlawful killing within the meaning of s. 21(1) and s. 21(2)
of the Criminal Code. The trial judge erred, therefore, in directing the
jury to disregard the provisions of s. 21 of the Code. It was
asserted that the issue raised was one of law, not mixed fact and law. If the
jury had been properly instructed, they would have had no other choice than to
convict the

[Page 80]

respondent of at least manslaughter. The
respondent contended that the comments of the judge, referred to above, were
mere expressions of his opinion that s. 21 could be inapplicable depending
on the jury’s view of the facts. The Court of Appeal did not err in considering
that the issues raised by the Crown were matters of mixed law and fact. It was
further contended that in any event on the evidence there was no occasion to
charge under s. 21 of the Code.

At the outset I must observe that I cannot
accept the argument that the words employed by the trial judge in dealing with
the applicability of s. 21 of the Criminal Code amounted only to an
expression of opinion as to the facts. In my opinion, the words appearing in
the record could convey no other meaning to a jury than that s. 21,
dealing with parties to offences other than those who actually commit them,
could not be applied in this case. This meaning could only have been reinforced
by the later remarks made in response to the request for further instructions
in which the trial judge said that in order to convict the jury had to be
satisfied that “the death of the victim was the consequence of the blows given
by the accused and not by someone else”. I am therefore of the view that the
Crown’s assertion that consideration of s. 21 of the Code was
removed from the jury is well-founded.

What then was the consequence of this direction
with respect to s. 21 of the Criminal Code? A brief reference to
the evidence is necessary to find the answer. It is perfectly clear that there
was evidence upon which a jury could have found that an offence was committed,
an unlawful killing, which could have been murder or manslaughter. There was as
well evidence from which a jury could have concluded that both the respondent
and Barnaby participated in the assault which caused the death and in doing so
assisted each other, Barnaby engaging Lloyd Arsenault while the respondent
pummelled the deceased and later joining the attack on the deceased while the
respondent “grabbed Lloyd”. There was nothing, however, in

[Page 81]

the evidence of those who participated in the
fighting or in the medical evidence to enable the jury to say whose blow or
blows caused the death. The inescapable conclusion from the medical evidence,
however, would have been that the injuries received by the deceased resulted in
his death, all having been suffered before death. It follows then that a
properly instructed jury could have found on the evidence that the respondent
and Barnaby were parties to the unlawful killing and could therefore have been
convicted. It was in these circumstances a fatal error to exclude consideration
of s. 21(1) of the Code from the jury.

I do not overlook the fact that only the
respondent was charged in the indictment and that the record is silent as to
charges that may have been brought against the other participants. Nonetheless,
where there is evidence that more than one person participated in the
commission of a crime, even though only one is charged, a direction under
s. 21 of the Criminal Code may be necessary. I note the words of
Martin J.A. in R. v. Sparrow (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 443, at
p. 458, where, speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin,
Lacourcière and Thorson JJ.A.), he said:

I am of the view that it is also
appropriate, where an accused is being tried alone and there is evidence that
more than one person was involved in the commission of the offence, to direct
the jury with respect to the provisions of s. 21 of the Code, even
though the identity of the other participant or participants is unknown, and
even though the precise part played by each participant may be uncertain.

I adopt those words as a correct statement of
the law.

It was also contended that the trial judge erred
in excluding consideration of s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code from
the jury. I do not propose, however, to deal further with the matter since a
new trial must, in any event, be directed because of the error with respect to
s. 21(1) of the Code. A decision as to the applicability of
s. 21(2) must await a new trial and will be based upon the state of the
evidence then adduced.

[Page 82]

I might observe that in this Court counsel for
the respondent conceded, while contending that there was no evidence to warrant
a charge to the jury under s. 21 of the Code, that if sufficient
evidence had existed it would have been error in law to exclude that
section from the jury.

The Crown seeks a new trial on a charge of
manslaughter only. I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial on a charge
of manslaughter.

Appeal allowed.

Crown’s case was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. Although considered
at the preliminary inquiry, the testimony of two witnesses that related to a
telephone conversation between them and the accused’s wife or somebody
purporting to be his wife was not admitted at trial. This evidence would have
explained why the accused knew of the circumstances of the victim’s death prior
to the discovery of the body—the most incriminating evidence adduced against
him. The accused’s wife was not called as a witness. In his address to the
jury, the Crown explained that the prosecution is prohibited by law from
calling the accused’s wife to give evidence and the trial judge did not comment
that statement. Appellant was convicted. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found
that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence confirming part of the
accused’s testimony but, considering that no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice had occurred in view of the overwhelming evidence of the accused’s
guilt, applied the proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code and
upheld the conviction. The Court held also that the Crown’s remark did not
constitute a comment within the meaning of s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence
Act and could not reasonably have been interpreted by the jury as a
suggestion that an innocent accused would

[Page 312]

have called his wife to confirm his
testimony. Appellant’s appeal to this Court was on three grounds: (1) this was
not a proper case to apply s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code; (2) the
trial judge’s silence in respect of the Crown’s remark resulted in an endorsement
of the statement and was in effect a misdirection in law to the jury and (3)
the Crown’s remark was a comment forbidden by s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence
Act.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

The trial judge erred in refusing to admit
testimony corroborating the accused’s explanation as to how the victim had been
killed and s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code could not apply to
uphold the verdict. The onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the
verdict “would necessarily have been the same if the errors had not occurred”.
Such determination is generally made upon a reading of the evidence put to the
jury. But when the error of law is the preclusion of exculpatory evidence, the
determination must be made with regard to the entirety of the evidence and in
light of the effect the excluded evidence could possibly have had on the
evidence that did go to the jury. Any reasonable effect that the excluded
evidence could have had on the jury should, in applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii),
enure to the benefit of the accused. Here, if admitted, the excluded evidence
would have tended to negate the inference that the accused had to be on the
scene at the time of the crime to have known the circumstances of the victim’s
death—the very inference the jury was concerned about. Without that inference,
the evidence put to the jury, while sufficient to support a conviction, would
not have made an acquittal unreasonable.

The problems raised by the Crown’s remark
will not arise at the new trial: as the victim was under 14 years old, the
accused’s wife is a competent and compellable witness for the prosecution
without the accused’s consent. This new rule of evidence, which was introduced
by s. 4(3.1) of the Canada Evidence Act, is merely procedural and,
in accordance with s. 36(d) of the Interpretation Act, will be
applicable at the new trial.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 289, dismissing appellant’s appeal from his
conviction on a charge of first degree murder. Appeal allowed and new trial
ordered.

R.J. Climie, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—The appellant was indicted of the first
degree murder of his stepdaughter and, on November 18, 1978, was convicted by a
jury in the County of Brant, Ontario. His
appeal to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful but required the application of
the proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. Leave
to appeal to this Court was granted at large.

A factual overview

On February 15, 1978, the appellant’s 8-year old
stepdaughter Tricia disappeared from her school yard before classes had begun.
On February 19, 1978, her body
was found on the bank of a nearby river. She had been killed by some nineteen
blows to the head. A tan coloured hatchet sheath was found twenty-eight inches
from the body. Medical evidence indicated that the injuries could have been
inflicted by a hatchet. The killing was estimated to have taken place on the
day of her disappearance.

The Crown’s case against the appellant was based
entirely on circumstantial evidence relating to:

1) motive, that is, Wildman’s enmity toward his
wife and to a lesser degree Tricia;

2) opportunity;

3) identification of a man and child by a Mrs.
Jean Coubrough;

4) a hatchet, owned by Wildman at one time;

[Page 314]

5) Wildman’s surreptitious disposal of his
clothing on February 15, 1978; and

6) false statements made to the police by
Wildman after the investigation started on February 15th.

Finally, and, in my view, if unexplained, fatal
to the accused, was the fact that he made statements indicating that he had
knowledge of the cause of death, the nature and location of the injuries and of
the kind of weapon used prior to that information being released by the police,
indeed, even prior to the discovery of the body and prior to the police
themselves becoming aware of those circumstances.

I will return to the facts and deal more
thoroughly with them when disposing of the ground of appeal upon which this
appeal should in my view succeed.

At the trial the set of events giving rise to
the three grounds of appeal in this Court were twofold: one relating to
Wildman’s wife not having testified, the other to a ruling on evidence.

First set of events

The accused’s wife was not called as a witness
by either the Crown or by the defence. When addressing the jury, Crown counsel
advised the jury as follows:

You are, however, bound by the law, what
his Lordship says, and anything I say that sounds like law—and if I am not
correct, I’m sure his Lordship will correct me.

One of the points that you have heard a lot
of evidence about a woman by the name of Joyce Wildman, who is the wife of the
accused. You probably wondered why you haven’t heard from Joyce Wildman. Well,
I tell you as a point of law that the prosecution is prohibited by law from
calling Joyce Wildman to give evidence.

(Emphasis added.)

The trial judge did not correct that statement
of the law, which the appellant takes to be incorrect.

As a result, appellant raises two grounds:

[Page 315]

1) that the judge’s silence resulted in an
endorsement of the statement and was therefore in effect a misdirection in law
to the jury;

2) Crown counsel’s submission was a comment
forbidden by s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10.

Second set of events

The appellant was denied the right to adduce,
through cross-examination, evidence that purportedly would have explained his
very incriminating knowledge of the circumstances of the death prior to the
discovery of the body. The Court of Appeal having found this ruling wrong in
law then applied the proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

3) Appellant raises as a third ground that this
was not a proper case for the application of the proviso.

The Court of Appeal

Many grounds were raised by appellant in the
Court of Appeal of Ontario (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 289, including one of the
three raised in this Court, the one relating to the denial of the right to
adduce evidence in regard to the accused’s knowledge of the circumstances of
death. As I said, the Court of Appeal agreed with appellant that the trial
judge had erred in excluding this evidence (as did the Crown at the trial and
in this Court), but agreed with the Crown that, no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice having been occasioned thereby, it was a proper case to
invoke the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii). The test the Court of Appeal
purported to apply was as follows (at p. 304):

Before invoking s. 613(1)(b)(iii) we
must be satisfied that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would inevitably
have found a verdict of guilty even if the Mclsaacs had given their testimony: MacDonald
v. The Queen, (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 1 at p. 12, 75 D.L.R. (3d) 107,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 832 at p. 848.

The other two grounds in this Court, resulting
from the Crown’s comments as to Mrs. Wildman’s

[Page 316]

compellability were raised by the Court of
Appeal proprio motu, and were disposed of as follows (at p. 295):

Whether or not the appellant’s wife was a
competent and compellable witness for the prosecution is a question of some
difficulty which was not argued at the trial. Consequently, there was no ruling
by the trial Judge upon which this Court is able to voice an opinion and the
question is one which in our view should be reserved until it arises squarely
for decision. In any case, we do not agree with Mr. Carter’s suggestion that it
is possible to construe the trial Judge’s failure to correct Crown counsel as a
tacit acceptance by him of the correctness of Crown counsel’s statement of the
law.

With respect to Mr. Carter’s second
submission, we do not think that Crown counsel’s remarks constituted a comment,
within the meaning of s. 4(5), on the failure of the appellant’s wife to
testify. In the particular circumstances of this case the remarks were in the
nature of an explanation by Crown counsel, in light of his understanding of the
law of evidence, for his failure to call Mrs. Wildman. Unlike in R. v. Cooper
(No. 2) (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 140, 51 D.L.R. (3d) 221, 5 O.R. (2d) 118,
and R. v. Arneson (1930), 54 C.C.C. 330, [1930] 3 W.W.R. 163, 25
Alta. L.R. 125, Crown counsel’s remarks in the present case could not
reasonably have been interpreted by the jury as a suggestion that an innocent
accused would have called his wife to confirm his testimony. As in the case of Avon v. The
Queen (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 357, 21 D.L.R. (3d) 442, [1971] S.C.R. 650,
where the Supreme Court of Canada was concerned with somewhat similar remarks
by a trial Judge, the language used here was a “statement” explaining the
prosecution’s inability to call an accused’s spouse rather than a “comment”
disparaging the accused’s ability to use his wife’s imposed silence to cloak
his guilt. None the less, we are of the view that Crown counsel’s remarks came
perilously close to contravening s. 4(5) and that it would have been preferable
if they had not been made. Again, however, if it were necessary, we would apply
the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)of the Code.

[Page 317]

The third ground (the exclusion of evidence
and s. 613(1)(b)(iii))

This ground should, with respect, have succeeded
in the Court of Appeal and resulted in the ordering of a new trial. There is
here no disagreement as to the commission of an error by the trial judge; nor
does anyone take issue with the test the Court of Appeal said must be met in
order to apply s. 613(1)(b)(iii). Where we part is as regards the proper
application of the test to the facts of this case, a matter this Court has
declared, for policy reasons, to be a question of law (see Mahoney v. The
Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834).

As announced earlier, I now return to the
evidence in this case.

Motive

The appellant and Joyce Wildman married in
October 1973 when he was 21 and she was 19. At that time Tricia Paquette was 4
years old. She is the natural daughter of Joyce Wildman, but not of John
Wildman. Mrs. Wildman had agreed that John would adopt Tricia after their
marriage, but later reneged on this promise. Two children were born to the
marriage.

All agree that the marriage was a turbulent one.
There were numerous fights and on a few occasions the police had to be called
in. They separated on numerous occasions. John Wildman attributed this to his
wife’s alcoholism. Donna Dumont, the sister of Joyce Wildman, attributed the
separation to John Wildman’s lack of affection for Tricia Paquette and to Mr.
Wildman being a thief.

There is substantial evidence of various events,
some disproving these assertions, others supportive thereof. I have read the
evidence and I am satisfied that there is evidence supportive of the fact that
appellant’s animosity towards his wife, whether understandable or not, could in
turn be supportive of a motive for his killing Tricia. There is also evidence
that he threatened his wife’s life and that of a social worker.

[Page 318]

In June of 1977, when the police were called
because of a dispute over the custody of the two younger girls, he said “if
Joyce gets the two babies, I will get Tricia”. John Wildman testified that he
used the expression “get Tricia” in the sense of getting custody of her, just
as, when referring to the two babies, he used the expression “gets the two
babies”. The officer who heard this comment took it at the time to have been
said in relation to custody. Four witnesses testified that Wildman acted in an
appropriate fatherly manner towards Tricia.

Opportunity

There is no need to consider the evidence in any
detail. The accused attempted to establish an alibi, but was not successful.
Tricia disappeared from school shortly before 9 a.m. on February 15th. The appellant’s
first recorded contact with anyone that morning was between 10:15 and 10:45 a.m. when he spoke to his landlady while in
his apartment. Tests established that a person could have walked from the
school yard to where Tricia’s body was found and from there to appellant’s
apartment in fifty minutes.

Identification and the disposal of the
clothing

Mrs. Jean Coubrough lived at 94 Grand Street. The back of her property
ran to the embankment overlooking the river about 270 feet from where the body
was found. On February 15, between 9 and 10 a.m., Mrs. Coubrough saw a man and
a child walking down the railroad tracks. The man, she said, walked with a
purpose and the child struggled along six feet behind. The child was wearing a
blue ski jacket matching the description of the one Tricia was wearing on that
day. It is common ground that the man and the child Mrs. Coubrough saw
would have been in her field of vision for about 22 to 25 seconds. She
described the man as being about 5 feet 3 inches tall, and of the same height
but somewhat slimmer than the accused she saw in court. The accused, it was
established, had gained 10 pounds while in jail. He was wearing a black
knee-length coat, a black hat, but no gloves though it was a very cold morning.

[Page 319]

The hat was what she called “an airman’s hat”
turned up in the middle. She saw no glasses on the man, but only saw a profile
of the man’s face.

Joyce Smoke, a social worker who had been
“handling” the Wildman family, said she was accustomed to seeing John Wildman
wear a black hat and a black coat. But, as regards the hat, she was
contradicted by her secretary Miss Carvel, and by several other witnesses who
said Mr. Wildman did not wear a hat. Mr. Mclsaac said that on February 14 the
appellant was wearing a long brown leather coat and tan cowboy boots. Wildman
testified he had lost his gloves the night of February 14. He also testified he
had put his coat and boots in the garbage on Monday, February 13, and put the
garbage out on Wednesday, February 15. This happened about two hours after
Tricia went missing. He explained this as the result of a call he received from
his wife on February 13.

Q. After—sorry. During this telephone
discussion that you had with your wife, was the question of a pair of boots and
a coat discussed?

A. Yes, sir, they were.

Q. And at that time did you indicate to
your wife, what if anything you were going to do with them?

A. Yes, I told her I was going to throw
them in the garbage.

Q. Why was that?

A. Well, she had bought me the boots about
six months earlier and she bought me the coat for Christmas, and I was to be
indebted for life for them.

Q. What do you mean by that?

A. Well, such things as, there was no
heater in her bathroom at 481 Colborne.

Q. Yes?

A. And there wasn’t any in mine at 25 Duke.

Q. Yes?

A. But I had an electric heater, so she
wanted that. And I said, “Well, I need it”; she says, “Well─

Q. Well, don’t tell us what she said: you
argued over that?

[Page 320]

A. Yes, she said that I should give it to
her because she had bought my coat and boots.

Q. And was it in that discussion you said
you would throw them away?

…

And he was seen putting garbage in front of the
neighbour’s house, which he explained as follows:

Q. All right. Do you recall when you put
those into a garbage bag?

A. On Monday night.

Q. Before or after you talked to Joyce?

A. Well, after; I mean, I hadn’t decided to
throw them out until after I had talked to her.

Q. There has been some evidence that you
took the garbage bag, I guess westerly towards the store, and put a garbage
bag, I think one door down from your place?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

Q. Why did you do that?

A. Because I’m lazy.

Q. What was in it?

A. Garbage.

Q. Okay. Well, why—if you are so lazy—walk
one door down and put the garbage out?

A. No—well, we had a problem with dogs
ripping garbage apart.

Q. Yes?

A. Now this had—this bag had dirty diapers,
bad foodstuffs: like when my wife had left, she left the fridge open and the
food in there had gone bad.

Q. Yes?

A. This was all in that bag. I merely took
it to the next door neighbour’s house to leave it there; if the dogs tore it
apart, I wouldn’t have to clean it up.

Q. All right. About what time was that,
that you took

your garbage out?

A. I would say about 11.30, quarter to twelve.

The boots and coat, according to him, were put
out in front of his residence while the other garbage bags went to the
neighbour’s. There was also

[Page 321]

some evidence, though not conclusive, that
Wildman, due to a diabetic condition would, after walking some distance,
develop a limp. Mrs. Coubrough did not see the man limp.

The hatchet

The injuries to Tricia’s head could have been
caused by a hatchet. A sheath was found 28 inches from the body. A hatchet was
located in the water 200 feet from the body. Near the location of the hatchet, on
the river’s embankment, was a bloodstained garbage bag; the blood was not
inconsistent with Tricia’s. The hatchet fitted snugly into the sheath. Wildman
had owned a hatchet and a sheath which he sold to one Daniel Curry. The hatchet
disappeared from Curry’s apartment sometime between the middle of January and
February 23, 1978. The appellant was at Curry’s apartment on February 9, 1978 and could have stolen it as he
was left alone for some time. I do not intend to canvass the evidence in
detail. Many witnesses were heard who had seen Wildman’s or Curry’s hatchet.
Curry said it had a long black handle, and had “Stainless”, stamped on it. The
hatchet found in the river had “Fuller 16 Forged” stamped on it. One Paul Bell
said that Curry’s hatchet had “Fuller 16 Forged” stamped on it. Witnesses when
looking at the sheath, the markings, the handle, or the colour of the hatchet
found near the body and comparing it with their recollection of the one owned
by Wildman or by Curry or borrowed from either of them, either concluded that
the hatchets were different or, at best, similar, but none could affirm that
they were identical let alone the same one. The additional cuts in the sheath
and the difference of colour of the hatchet and the sheath found on the scene of
the crime that might have misled some of the witnesses could be explained by
the forensic testing done on them. But in the end, one could summarize the
extensive evidence surrounding the hatchet’s possible identification by saying
that the hatchets and sheaths were somewhat similar, but no more.

[Page 322]

The false statements

When questioned by the police as to why he would
have put garbage in front of the neighbour’s house, the appellant denied having
done so, nor did he mention his disposing of the coat and boots. An expert
witness said that the killer’s coat and boots would normally have been
bloodstained. Generally speaking, Wildman gave various differing versions as
regards the boots, the coat, and the garbage bags, the hatchet, and, through
various statements to the police and to others, such as his landlord McIsaac,
and Dan Curry, he appears to have given them the run-around intentionally, was
very uncooperative and, as a result, his conduct must be regarded as highly
suspect.

On this evidence, standing alone, one could not
say that a verdict of guilty would have been unreasonable; nor could one
consider likewise unreasonable a jury entertaining a reasonable doubt and
acquitting. There is strong circumstantial evidence upon which a jury could be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, but I would be unable to say that it was
overwhelming, as said the Court of Appeal.

What justified the Court of Appeal in finding,
as they did, the evidence overwhelming was the result of the following
additional evidence.

Tricia disappeared on February 15 and her body
was discovered four days later on February 19. Prior to the 19th no one could
be sure that Tricia was dead, whether death was self‑inflicted or
involved another person, was accidental or intentional, the nature and location
of the wounds inflicted, the instrument, if any, used or probably used to
inflict the wounds. Yet, on February 16 Wildman phoned a Mr. Beyer, his divorce
lawyer, and told him “that his wife had accused him of killing Tricia with an
axe”.

After the discovery of Tricia’s body on the
19th, the police, because of the sheath found 28 inches

[Page 323]

from the body, started looking for a hatchet. On
that day a press release by the police said that “she had been battered with a
blunt instrument”. On that evening the police interrogated Wildman about a
hatchet.

On the 20th Wildman said to a witness that
“someone put an axe in Tricia’s head”. It was only on February 23 that the
police revealed with precision the nature of the wounds, and only on February
28 the use of a hatchet.

On February 19, 23 and 25, the appellant
mentioned to various persons that “Tricia had been killed with an axe”. His
knowledge of the circumstances of the crime on the 19th, 23rd and 25th is not
unexplained. He was questioned with insistance by the police on the 19th about
a hatchet and the police press release referred to Tricia having been battered
with a blunt instrument. It would not be unreasonable for Wildman to suspect
that the police were of the view that the blunt instrument was a hatchet and
that some of the wounds, if not all, would be to the head, since Tricia had
been “battered” to death. But what needed explanation was his statement to his
lawyer on the 16th. Whoever knew those details on that date had to either have participated
or witnessed the crime, or have received the information from someone who had.
In his testimony he attempted to explain this knowledge; Wildman testified as
follows:

Q. Prior to that question of a hatchet
being discussed between you and Detective Sergeant Stephenson, had any other
police officer told you about a hatchet, or asked you about a hatchet?

A. No, sir.

Q. Had any other person?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. When?

A. On Thursday, the day after Tricia
disappeared.

He was not questioned any further about this
person because of a ruling the trial judge had made in the course of the
Crown’s case.

[Page 324]

The ruling

In the course of cross-examining Mrs. Beverly
McIsaac and Mr. Ronald McIsaac, the attorney for the defence was denied the
right to elicit the contents of a conversation which took place over the phone
at the McIsaacs’ on February 16. Wildman was at the McIsaacs’ when the phone
rang. Mrs. McIsaac answered and she identified the voice as being that of
Mrs. Wildman. Mrs. Wildman accused her, Mr. McIsaac and John Wildman of
“murdering Tricia with a hatchet”. Mr. McIsaac got on the phone and would have
corroborated the conversation, though uncertain as to the identity of the voice
because he had not, as his wife had many times previously, ever spoken to Mrs.
Wildman on the phone. The McIsaacs’ had been examined on the matter at the
preliminary inquiry.

Mrs. McIsaac:

Q. I understand, Mrs. McIsaac, that on
Thursday night—that would be the day after Tricia Paquette disappeared, I
understand that you received a phone call from someone who identified herself
as Joyce Wildman. Am I correct?

A. Yes.

Q. The phone call went to your apartment
and you answered it?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you agree with me that, whoever
made that phone call indicated to you, or sorry, that they accused you and Ron
and John Wildman of murdering Tricia Paquette with a hatchet?

A. That is right. They did.

Q. That is the day after Tricia
disappeared?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you, prior to that day, ever talk on
the telephone with Joyce Wildman?

A. She would phone and start arguing with
us and kept calling us murderers and that.

And, later on:

Q. If I might go back to the telephone call
you received from someone who said she was Joyce Wildman, on Thursday, during
that telephone conversation, did your husband speak to that person?

[Page 325]

A. I answered the phone and my husband got
the phone and she called him a murderer and John and I murderers.

Q. Did John talk to that person on the
telephone or was it just you and your husband?

A. Just my husband and I.

Q. When she said that you and Ron and John
had murdered Tricia with an axe or hatchet, do you remember which it was she
said? An axe or hatchet?

A. It was a hatchet, I think.

Q. When she said that, do you remember what
you

said to her?

A. I just told her no, we didn’t… have
anything to do with it.

Q. Up to that point, was that the first
time that you can remember any mention being made of a hatchet, either on the
radio or in the newspaper or T.V.?

A. It seemed to me that that person knew
about the hatchet before anyone else did.

Q. Was that the first time that the hatchet
was

brought to your attention?

A. Yes.

Mr. McIsaac:

Q. I understand, Mr. McIsaac, that, on the
Thursday after Tricia was missing, that you received a phone call from a person
who told you they were Joyce Wildman; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And in that phone conversation, this
woman, who said she was Joyce Wildman, accused you and your wife and John
Wildman of killing Patricia with a hatchet?

A. That is right.

Q. I suggest to you that you took the phone
from your wife and discussed that, or heard that same accusation from the
person who said she was Joyce Wildman; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Up to that point, after Tricia had been
missing, had you received any information from the newspaper or radio or T.V.?

A. Yes.

Q. Just a moment. Was there any
information, from those sources, that there was a hatchet involved in killing
Tricia, or was the phone call the first time that the hatchet was brought to
your attention?

[Page 326]

A. Yes, it was the first time.

Q. When you talked to that person on the
phone, who said she was Joyce Wildman, did it appear they had been drinking or
could you tell?

A. I couldn’t tell.

Q. From the time you became John Wildman’s
landlord, you had a number of times to see and talk to Joyce Wildman?

A. Yes.

Q. She came to John’s apartment a number of
times?

A. Yes.

Q. Did the voice on the telephone, on
Thursday night, accusing you of killing Tricia with a hatchet, did that sound
to you like Joyce Wildman’s voice?

A. I really couldn’t say because I never
talked to her on the phone before.

All agree that proof of the conversation was
admissible and that the trial judge erred in disallowing it. The result is
twofold. It left unexplained the most incriminating evidence adduced against
Wildman. It also deprived him of the right to put before the jury the fact
that, for some reason, his wife, or somebody purporting to be his wife, knew
before the body was discovered that Tricia was dead, that she had been murdered
and that the instrument used was a hatchet!

The importance of this evidence to the defence
was directly proportional to the incriminating effect the evidence it sought to
explain had against the accused. Unexplained, that knowledge by the accused was
very incriminating and, as I said before, made the circumstantial evidence
“overwhelming” as said the Court of Appeal.

Witness the fact that the Crown, when addressing
the jury, stressed at some length the fact that Wildman had incriminating
knowledge of the circumstances of her death.

Witness also what the trial judge said in his
charge:

Mr. Beyer was called by the defence, and he
was acting for Wildman. In cross‑examination by Mr. Swan-

[Page 327]

son he said that the accused spoke to
him—and I do not recall whether it was on the telephone or in person—on
February the 16th—no, he said he had a call from Wildman and that Wildman said
that his wife was accusing him of killing Tricia with an axe. That is Thursday
the 16th. The child’s body had not yet been found.

The accused, as a result of the exclusion of Mr.
and Mrs. McIsaacs’ testimony on that point, was the only one left asserting the
existence of this accusation by his wife on the phone.

The trial judge told the jury:

You alone are the judges of the facts. You
will have to judge whether that was said and how Joyce could know. Did she tell
this to John or accuse him of this? You have to judge, did Mr. Beyer hear that,
or is it correctly reported by him, and you may think that Mr. Beyer has no
interest in this matter.

The Crown then asks for you to consider
Guillemette’s evidence. About three days before the body was found—no, I will
deal with this aspect of it in a moment.

If you do not accept the evidence that
Joyce told him on Thursday, February the 16th, that Tricia was killed with an
axe, how could he know? The Crown says that the only person or persons who
could know were the person or persons who in fact used that axe to kill Tricia.
You will recall that the gentleman who owned the hairdressing establishment was
called, and he said that Joyce was working there from fairly early in the
morning on Wednesday the 15th until 4.00 o’clock in the afternoon.

If you accept his evidence, then Joyce was
not at the river that morning with Tricia.

The jury’s request is very eloquent as regards
the importance of the evidence of the knowledge and, as a corollary, the
damaging effect of excluding its explanation.

After four hours of deliberation the jury
returned and asked the judge the following:

FOREMAN OF THE JURY: We would like the details
of the timing relative to the January 20th events concerning the receptionist
at the Children’s Aid Society, of Joyce Smoke, Detective White, and Mr.
Wildman’s personal recollection of that time period.

[Page 328]

We would like to re-hear the testimony of
the solicitor, Mr. Beyer.

His LORDSHIP: The whole of it?

THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Your lordship, we
feel it is relatively short and we would like to hear what he has to say.

As regards Mr. Beyer’s testimony, the judge
read his personal notes to the jury, and said:

Now, if you are not satisfied with that,
would you like to hear the tape?

FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Sir, I would like to
hear, I would like to hear the last portion of the tape pertaining to the
discussion re the remarks attributed to Mrs. Wildman, made to Mr. Beyer by Mr.
Wildman regarding the hatchet.

His LORDSHIP: All right.

After hearing the tape, the jury retired and
came back an hour and a half later with a verdict of guilty.

Mr. Beyer’s testimony was crucial and in fact
fatal to the accused. The judge put the matter quite properly when he told the
jury that if they did not accept the accused’s (sole) evidence that Joyce had
told him “that Tricia was killed with an axe, how could he know?”

The judge was quite right in this. And the
inference to be drawn from this knowledge of the accused would then be that he
had to have been there.

The proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)

As regards resort by a Court of Appeal to the
proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) the law has been clearly laid down by this
Court in Colpitis v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739. Cartwright
J.’s formulation of the test was as follows, at p. 744:

…once error in law has been found to have
occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court
that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such error had not
occurred. The satisfaction of this onus is a condition precedent to the right
of the Appellate Court to apply the terms of the subsection at all. The Court
is not bound to apply the subsection merely because this onus is discharged.

[Page 329]

Under our system of law a man on trial for
his life is entitled to the verdict of a jury which has been accurately and
adequately instructed as to the law. The construction of s. 592(1)(b)(iii)
contended for by the Crown in this case would transfer from the jury to the
Court of Appeal the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the
accused beyond a reasonable doubt. To adapt the words of Lord Herschell in Makin
v. Attorney General for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57 at
70, the judges would in truth be substituted for the jury, the verdict would
become theirs and theirs alone, and would be arrived at upon a perusal of the
evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and
weighing the evidence with the assistance which this affords.

The determination as to whether the verdict
“would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred” is
generally made upon a reading of the evidence put to the jury.

But when the error of law is the preclusion of
exculpatory evidence, then the determination must be made with regard to the
entirety of the evidence, that evidence having been included, and in the light
of the effect the excluded evidence could, within reason, possibly have had on
the evidence that did go to the jury. Any reasonable effect that excluded
evidence could have had on the jury should, in applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii),
enure to the benefit of the accused. When the excluded evidence is, as in this
case, of a certain importance and might reasonably have had an effect on the
jury then, even assuming we in this Court would have nevertheless convicted, I
find it difficult to be satisfied that the jury would have necessarily agreed
with us. Any reasonable, possible effect of that excluded evidence on the jury
should enure to the benefit of Wildman.

The effect of the McIsaacs’ testimony would have
been to corroborate the accused’s explanation and thereby to tend to negate the
inference that the accused had to have been there—the very inference that the
jury was concerned about. Had that evidence been adduced, it would have then
been open to the jury not to entertain the inference and, as a result, we would
then be left with evidence which, as I have already stated, while sufficient to
support a conviction, would not make an acquittal unreasonable; therefore the
Crown has

[Page 330]

not, in my respectful view, met the onus of
satisfying me “that the verdict would necessarily have been the same”, had the
defence been allowed, as was its right, to adduce the evidence of the telephone
conversation of February 16 (see Colpitts v. The Queen, supra).
I would, therefore, on this ground allow the appeal, and order a new trial.

The other grounds

The other two grounds for appeal can be disposed
of together. Being of the view that a new trial should be ordered, I would
normally, in order to avoid any further appeal arising out of those grounds,
deal with the matter as to whether the spouse would, at the trial be a
compellable witness under the circumstances of this case and, if not, whether
and to what extent comment could be made by the Crown as to why she was not
called to testify. But those problems will not arise at the new trial in view
of the introduction to s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act supra, of subs.
(3.1), which covers the situation as follows:

(3.1) The wife or husband of a person
charged with an offence against any of sections 203, 204, 218, 219, 220, 222,
223, 245, 245.1, 245.2 or 245.3 of the Criminal Code where the
complainant or victim is under the age of fourteen years is a competent and
compellable witness for the prosecution without the consent of the person
charged.

The new trial will be governed by that section.

Indeed s. 36(d) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, states that:

36. Where an
enactment (in this section called the “former enactment”) is repealed and
another enactment (in this section called the “new enactment”) is substituted
therefor,

…

(d) the procedure established
by the new enactment shall be followed as far as it can be adapted thereto in
the recovery or enforcement of penalties and forfeitures incurred, and in the
enforcement of rights, existing or accruing under the former enactment or in a
proceeding in relation to matters that have happened before the repeal;

[Page 331]

This is an enactment of the common law rule that
there is no vested right in procedure along with a limitation to the effect
that the following of the new procedure must be feasible (see R. v. Ali,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 221). Therefore, a new procedure applies to pending suits
without breaching the “rule of interpretation to the effect that statutes
ought, if possible, to be interpreted so as to respect vested rights” (see E.A.
Driedger, “The Retrospective Operation of Statutes”, Legal Essays in Honour
of Arthur Moxon, University of Toronto Press, 1953, pp. 5 et seq.)
Section 36(J) of the Interpretation Act uses procedure in a wide
sense and that expression includes the rules of evidence. On the point, Phipson
on Evidence, 13th ed., 1982, at p. 1:

Law is commonly divided into substantive
law, which defines rights, duties and liabilities; and adjective law, which
defines the procedure, pleading and proof by which the substantive law is
applied in practice.

The rules of procedure regulate the general
conduct of litigation; the object of pleading is to ascertain for the guidance
of the parties and the court the material facts in issue in each particular
case; proof is the establishment of such facts by proper legal means to the
satisfaction of the court, and in this sense includes disproof. The
first-mentioned term is, however, often used to include the other two.

(Emphasis added.)

Some rules of evidence must nevertheless be
excluded for they are not merely procedural, they create rights and not merely
expectations and, as such, are not only adjectival but of a substantive nature.
Such has been found to be the case for rules or laws creating presumptions
arising out of certain facts. (See, for example, as regards the presumption of
advancement in questions of ownership of property as between husband and wife, Bingeman
v. McLaughlin, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 548.) P. Roubier, in Le
droit transitoire, 2nd ed., Paris, Dalloz et Sirey, 1960, at p. 237,
rationalizes their exclusion because, says he, [TRANSLATION] “As these rules
are independent of the existence of an issue, they are not affected by the fact
that there is

[Page 332]

litigation in progress”. Such is also the case
of the lawyer-client privilege resulting from a person’s right to the
confidentiality of his lawyer, irrespective of whether there is litigation,
(see Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 860). The courts,
for obvious reasons of logic, have not excluded under new laws, for want of
certain new prerequisites to its admissibility, evidence which had complied
with the prerequisites of the previous. R. v. Ali, supra, is an
illustration of this approach, using the proviso “as far as it can be adapted
thereto” of s. 36(d) of the Interpretation Act. (For a more
thorough review of the case law on the matter, see Pierre-André Côté, Interprétation
des lois (1982), at pp. 155 et seq.) But such is not the case as
regards a spouse’s incompetence to testify.

Spouses do not have a substantive right to the
confidentiality as to what either was seen doing by the other or to the
confidentiality of what was to the other communicated by either.

The incompetence and uncompellability of s. 4 of
the Canada Evidence Act, supra, is not the result of a
substantive right to confidentiality and is merely procedural.

If a new trial ensues, Mrs. Wildman will be a
competent and compellable witness for the prosecution without the consent of
the accused.

To conclude, I would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and order a new trial.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

Following the seizure of their cannabis cargo
by the police in Canadian waters, appellants were charged with importing
cannabis into Canada and with
possession for the purpose of trafficking. At trial, the accused advanced the
defence of necessity claiming that they did not plan to import into Canada as their destination was Alaska but that, following a series of
mechanical problems aggravated by deteriorating weather, they had decided for
the safety of ship and crew to seek refuge on the Canadian shoreline to repair
the vessel. The vessel found a sheltered cove but grounded amidships on a rock.
The defence tendered evidence that the captain, fearing he was going to
capsize, ordered the men to offload the cargo. When the police arrived on the
scene

[Page 233]

most of the marihuana was onshore. The
accused also relied upon a “botanical defence” arguing that the Crown had
failed to prove that the ship’s cargo was “Cannabis sativa L.” as
provided for in the schedule to the Narcotic Control Act. The trial
judge, however, withdrew the botanical defence from the jury. The appellants
were acquitted. The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a new
trial holding that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant the Crown’s
application to call rebuttal evidence with respect to the condition of the
vessel. The Court also held that the trial judge was correct in withdrawing the
botanical defence from the jury.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

Per Ritchie,
Dickson, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: The defence of necessity is available in
Canada and should be recognized as an excuse operating by virtue of
s. 7(3) of the Criminal Code. The essential criteria for the
operation of the defence is the moral involuntariness of the wrongful action
measured on the basis of society’s expectation of appropriate and normal
resistance to pressure. The defence only applies in circumstances of imminent
risk where the action was taken to avoid a direct and immediate peril. The act
in question may only be characterized as involuntary where it was inevitable,
unavoidable, and where no reasonable opportunity for an alternative course of
action that did not involve a breach of the law was available to the accused.
As well the harm inflicted by the violation of the law must be less than the
harm the accused sought to avoid. Where it was contemplated or ought to have
been contemplated by the accused that his actions would likely give rise to an
emergency requiring the breach of the law it may not be open to him to claim
his response was involuntary; mere negligence or involvement in criminal or
immoral activity when the emergency arose, however, will not disentitle an
accused from relying upon the defence. Finally, where sufficient evidence is
placed before the Court to raise the issue of necessity the onus falls upon the
Crown to meet the defence and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused’s act was voluntary; the accused bears no burden of proof. In this
case, the trial judge was correct in instructing the jury upon necessity,
however, he erred in his directions to them. Although he adequately charged the
jury upon the majority of issues pertinent to the proper test for neces-

[Page 234]

sity he did not direct their attention to the
issue of the availability of a reasonable legal alternative. This error goes to
the heart of the defence and justifies a new trial.

The trial judge was correct in withdrawing
the appellants’ botanical defence from the jury as the phrase “Cannabis
sativa L.” in the Narcotic Control Act was meant to embrace all
forms of marihuana. In keeping with the doctrine of contemporanea expositio the
meaning to be given to this phrase is the meaning the botanical community
ascribed to it when the Act became law in 1961. At that time, botanists were
virtually unanimous in holding that cannabis (marihuana) consisted only of one
species and that the plants which some botanists referred to as “Cannabis
indica Lam.” and “Cannabis ruderalis Jan.” were merely subspecies of
“Cannabis sativa L.”. Where the legislature has deliberately chosen a
specific scientific or technical term to represent an equally specific and
particular class of things, it would do violence to Parliament’s intent to give
a new meaning to that term whenever the taxonomic consensus among members of
the relevant scientific fraternity has shifted.

Since a new trial must be ordered there is no
need to decide whether the trial judge erred in refusing to allow the Crown to
tender rebuttal evidence.

Per Wilson J.:
The defence of necessity must be grounded either on excuse or on justification.
The only way in which the defence of necessity can be applied as an excuse is
where the accused’s act is done in the interest of self-preservation. Such an
act must be characterized not by the voluntariness of the act but by its
unpunishable nature. As such, the act may be exempted from culpability if it
arose in a life-threatening situation of necessity. Where, however, a defence
by way of excuse is premised on compassion for the accused or on a perceived
failure to achieve a desired instrumental end of punishment, the judicial
response must be to fashion an appropriate sentence but to reject the defence
as such.

[Page 235]

Where necessity is invoked as a
justification, the accused must show that he operated under a conflicting legal
duty which made his seemingly wrongful act right. Such justification must be
premised on a right or duty recognized by law. This excludes conduct attempted
to be justified on the ground of an ethical duty internal to the conscience of
the accused as well as conduct sought to be justified on the basis of a perceived
maximization of social utility resulting from it. Rather, the conduct must stem
from the accused’s duty to satisfy his legal obligations and to respect the
principle of the universality of rights. The justification therefore does not
depend on the immediacy or “normative involuntariness” of the accused’s act.
Finally, the justification is not established simply by showing a conflict of
legal duties. Since the defence rests on the rightfulness of the accused’s
choice of one over the other, the rule of proportionality is central to the
evaluation of the justification.

The judgment of Ritchie, Dickson, Chouinard and
Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—In this case we consider (i) a
recurring legal problem, the “necessity” defence; (ii) what is commonly known
as the “botanical” or “cannabis species” defence.

I Facts

The appellants are drug smugglers. At trial,
they led evidence that in early 1979 three of the appellants were employed,
with sixteen crew members, to deliver, by ship (the Samarkanda) a load
of cannabis (marihuana) worth $6,000,000 or $7,000,000 from a point in
international waters off the coast of Colombia, South America, to a drop point
in international waters 200 miles off the

[Page 237]

coast of Alaska. The ship left Tumaco, Colombia, empty with a port clearance document stating the
destination to be Juneau, Alaska. For three weeks the ship remained in international waters off the
coast of Colombia. While there,
a DC-6 aircraft made four trips, dropping into the water shrimp nets with a
total of 634 bales of cannabis which were retrieved by the ship’s longboats.

A “communications” package was also dropped from
a light aircraft, giving instructions for a rendez-vous with another vessel,
the Julia “B”, which was to pick up the cargo of cannabis from the Samarkanda
in international waters off the coast of Alaska. En route, according to the defence evidence, the vessel
began to encounter a series of problems; engine breakdowns, overheating
generators and malfunctioning navigation devices, aggravated by deteriorating
weather. In the meantime the fourth appellant, Nelson, part owner of the
illicit cargo, and three other persons left Seattle in a small boat, the Whitecap, intending to rendez‑vous
with the Samarkanda at the drop point in Alaska. The problems of the Samarkanda intensified as fuel was
consumed. The vessel became lighter, the intakes in the hull for sea water,
used as a coolant, lost suction and took in air instead, causing the generators
to overheat. At this point the vessel was 180 miles from the Canadian coastline.
The weather worsened. There were eight-to-ten-foot swells and a rising wind. It
was finally decided for the safety of ship and crew to seek refuge on the
Canadian shoreline for the purpose of making temporary repairs. The Whitecap
found a sheltered cove on the west coast of Vancouver Island, “No Name
Bay”. The Samarkanda followed the Whitecap into the Bay but later
grounded amidships on a rock because the depth sounder was not working. The
tide ran out. The vessel listed severely to starboard, to the extent that the
Captain, fearing the vessel was going to capsize, ordered the men to offload
the

[Page 238]

cargo. That is a brief summary of the defence
evidence.

Early on the morning of May 22, 1979 police officers entered No Name Bay
in a marked police boat with siren sounding. The Samarkanda and the Whitecap
were arrested, as were all the appellants except Perka and Nelson, the same
morning. The vessels and 33.49 tons of cannabis marihuana were seized by the
police officers.

Charged with importing cannabis into Canada and with possession for the purpose
of trafficking, the appellants claimed they did not plan to import into Canada or to leave their cargo of cannabis
in Canada. They had planned to
make repairs and leave. Expert witnesses on marine matters called by the
defence testified that the decision to come ashore was, in the opinion of one
witness, expedient and prudent and in the opinion of another, essential. At
trial, counsel for the Crown alleged that the evidence of the ship’s distress
was a recent fabrication. Crown counsel relied on the circumstances under which
the appellants were arrested to belie the “necessity” defence; when the police
arrived on the scene most of the marihuana was already onshore, along with
plastic ground sheets, battery operated lights, liquor, food, clothing, camp
stoves, and sleeping bags. Nevertheless, the jury believed the appellants and
acquitted them.

The acquittal was reversed on appeal. After the
close of the case for the accused at trial, the Crown had applied to call
rebuttal evidence with respect to the condition of the vessel. The trial judge
refused the Crown’s application. He held that the defence evidence relating to
the happenings in the engine room should not have caught the prosecution by
surprise and in the circumstances, the conditions for calling rebuttal evidence
had not been met. At trial the defence also relied upon a “botanical defence”
arguing that the Crown had failed to prove that the ship’s cargo was “cannabis
sativa L.”, as provided for in the Schedule to the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1. Thus

[Page 239]

the appellants had committed no offence. The
trial judge withdrew the botanical defence from the jury. On appeal by the
Crown, the Court of Appeal, in allowing the appeal, held that the trial judge
had erred in refusing to grant leave to the Crown to call rebuttal evidence
and, on the cross-appeal held that the judge was correct in withdrawing the
botanical defence from the jury.

The appellants have now appealed to this Court.
In addition to claiming that the Court of Appeal erred in reversing the trial
judge on the rebuttal issue, the appellants contend that the Court of Appeal
applied the wrong standard in ordering a new trial. The appellants also contend
that the botanical defence should have been left with the jury. The Crown, of
course, takes the opposite position on each of these questions and has raised
one of its own: whether the trial judge erred in charging the jury with respect
to the necessity defence. Because the appellants raised a preliminary objection
to this Court even addressing this last issue, I will deal with it first.

The appellants argue that this Court should not
consider the Crown’s contentions with respect to the necessity defence because
the Court of Appeal decided that the defence was available and the jury could
properly be instructed on it. Accordingly, the appellants contend the Crown’s
argument with respect to the defence of necessity is really in the nature of a
cross‑appeal. Since the Crown does not have an appeal as of right to this
Court and since leave has not been granted, the appellants say this Court does
not have jurisdiction to decide the issues raised by the “cross-appeal”.

[Page 240]

In both civil and criminal matters it is open to
a respondent to advance any argument to sustain the judgment below, and he is
not limited to appellants’ points of law. A party cannot, however, raise an
entirely new argument which has not been raised below and in relation to which
it might have been necessary to adduce evidence at trial. See Brown v. Dean,
[1910] A.C. 373; Dormuth v. Untereiner, [1964] S.C.R. 122; The
SS. “Tordenskjold” v. The SS. “Euphemia” (1908), 41 S.C.R. 154; Dairy
Foods, Inc. v. Co-opérative Agricole de Granby, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 651. That
is not the case here. The necessity defence was raised and fully argued in both
courts below. Therefore, if we regard the Crown’s submission as an argument to
sustain the judgment below, this Court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to hear and
decide the issue. Even if we regard the Crown’s submission with regard to
necessity as seeking to vary the decision of the court below, the Rules of
the Supreme Court of Canada, Rule 29(1), would still give this Court the
power to treat the whole case as open:

29. (1) If a respondent intends at the
hearing of an appeal to argue that the decision of the court below should be
varied, he shall, within thirty days after the service of the notice of appeal
or within such time as a Judge allows, give notice of such intention to all parties
who may be affected thereby. The omission to give such notice shall not in
any way limit the power of the Court to treat the whole case as open but
may, in the discretion of the Court, be a ground for an adjournment of the
hearing.

(Emphasis added.)

In the event, at the hearing of the appeal the
Court did treat the whole case as open and ruled that the Court would address
the merits of the Crown’s contentions with respect to the necessity defence.
That I now propose to do.

II The Necessity Defence

a) History and Background

From earliest times it has been maintained that
in some situations the force of circumstances makes it unrealistic and unjust
to attach criminal liability to actions which, on their face, violate the law.
Aristotle, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Book III, 1110a (trans. D. Ross,
1975, at p. 49), discusses the jettisoning of cargo from a ship in
distress and remarks that “any sensible man does so” to secure the safety of
himself and his crew. Pollard, arguing for the defendant in the case of Reniger
v. Fogossa (1551), 1 Plowd. 1 at p. 18, maintained:

…in every Law there are some Things which
when they happen a Man may break the Words of the Law, and yet not break the
Law itself; and such Things are exempted out of the Penalty of the Law, and the
Law privileges them although they are done against the Letter of it, for
breaking the Words of the Law is not breaking the Law, so as the Intent of the
Law is not broken. And therefore the Words of the Law of Nature, of the Law of
this Realm, and of other Realms, and of the Law of God will also yield and give
Way to some Acts and things done against the Words of the same Laws, and that
is, where the Words of them are broken to avoid greater Inconveniences, or
through Necessity, or by Compulsion…

In Leviathan (Pelican ed. 1968), at
p. 157, Hobbes writes:

If a man by the terrour of present death,
be compelled to doe a fact against the Law, he is totally Excused; because no
Law can oblige a man to abandon his own preservation. And supposing such a Law
were obligatory: yet a man would reason thus, if I doe it not, I die presently:
if I doe it, I die afterwards; therefore by doing it, there is time of life
gained; Nature therefore compells him to the fact.

To much the same purpose Kant, in The Metaphysical
Elements of Justice (trans. Ladd, 1965), discussing the actions of a person
who, to save his own life sacrifices that of another, says at p. 41:

[Page 242]

A penal law applying to such a situation
could never have the effect intended, for the threat of an evil that is still
uncertain (being condemned to death by a judge) cannot outweigh the fear of an
evil that is certain (being drowned). Hence, we must judge that, although an
act of self-preservation through violence is not inculpable, it still is unpunishable…

In those jurisdictions in which such a general
principle has been recognized or codified it is most often referred to by the
term “necessity”. Classic and harrowing instances which have been cited to
illustrate the arguments both for and against this principle include the mother
who steals food for her starving child, the shipwrecked mariners who resort to
cannibalism (R. v. Dudley and Stephens (1884), 14 Q.B.D. 273) or
throw passengers overboard to lighten a sinking lifeboat (United States v. Holmes,
26 Fed. Cas. 360 (1842)), and the more mundane case of the motorist
who exceeds the speed limit taking an injured person to the hospital.

In the United States a general defence of necessity has been recognized in the statutory
law of a number of states and has found its way into the Model Penal Code of
the American Law Institute. Attempts have been made, with mixed success, in
American jurisdictions to apply the defence to multifarious types of conduct,
including cases involving prison escapes, United States v. Bailey, 444
U.S. 394 (1980); social protests and civil disobedience, United States v.
Moylan, 417 F.2d 1002 (4th Cir. 1969), certiorari denied 397 U.S.
910; United States v. Cullen, 454 F.2d 386 (7th Cir. 1971); and
unorthodox medical treatments, United States v. Randall, 104 Daily Wash.
L. Rep. 2249 (D.C. Super. Ct.
1976); United States
v. Richardson, 588 F.2d 1235 (9th Cir. 1978).

In England, opinion as to the existence of a general defence of necessity has
varied. Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Law (abridged edition of
Wm. Hardcastle Browne, edited by Bernard C. Gavit, 1941) mentioned two
principles capable of being read as underlying such a defence. In Book 4, chap.
2, at p. 761, he says:

[Page 243]

As punishments are only inflicted for the
abuse of that free will, which God has given to man, it is just that a man
should be excused for those acts, which are done through unavoidable force and
compulsion.

Then under the rubric “Choice Between Two Evils”
he writes:

Choice Between Two Evils. This species of necessity is the result of reason and reflection
and obliges a man to do an act, which, without such obligation, would be
criminal. This occurs, when a man has his choice of two evils set before him,
and chooses the less pernicious one. He rejects the greater evil and chooses
the less. As where a man is bound to arrest another for a capital offence, and
being resisted, kills the offender, rather than permit him to escape.

Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of
England (1883), vol. II, p. 108, refers to compulsion by necessity as
one of the curiosities of the law, “a subject on which the law of England is so
vague that, if cases raising the question should ever occur the judges would
practically be able to lay down any rule which they considered expedient”. At
page 110 he concedes it just possible to imagine cases in which the expedience
of breaking the law would be so overwhelmingly great that people might be
justified in doing so but says that “these cases cannot be defined beforehand, and
must be adjudicated upon by a jury afterwards”.

Later English commentators have had even more
doubts on the matter. Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed. 1976), vol. 11, para. 26,
has this to say on the subject:

26. Necessity. Although there are cases in which it is not criminal for a person
to cause harm to the person or property of another, there is no general rule
giving rise to a defence of necessity, and it seems that, outside the specific
cases mentioned, it is no defence to a crime to show that its commission was
necessary in order to avoid a greater evil to the defendant or to others.

While Glanville Williams (“The Defence of
Necessity”, (1953) 6 C.L.P. 216) has been able to assert “with some assurance”
that the defence of necessity is recognized by English law, the authors

[Page 244]

of Smith & Hogan, Criminal Law (4th
ed. 1978) at pp. 193-94 state that “the better view appears to be that a
general defence of necessity is not recognized by the English courts at the
present time”.

A Working Party of the English Law Commission
proposed to resolve this uncertainty by recognizing a general defence of
necessity, but one that was carefully circumscribed to prevent its being
invoked in extravagant and inappropriate cases. The English Law Commission,
however, rejected the Working Party proposal and instead made two
counterproposals (Law Com. No. 83, Part IV) which recognized the possibility of
the existence of a defence of necessity at common law but clearly disapproved
of its principles. The Commission proposed:

First, that no attempt should be made to
establish the defence by legislation. Secondly, that the proposed Act should
expressly abolish any such defence as may exist at common law.

In Canada the existence and the extent of a general defence of necessity was
discussed by this Court in Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R.
616. As to whether or not the defence exists at all I had occasion to say at
p. 678:

On the authorities it is manifestly
difficult to be categorical and state that there is a law of necessity,
paramount over other laws, relieving obedience from the letter of the law. If
it does exist, it can go no further than to justify non-compliance in urgent
situations of clear and imminent peril when compliance with the law is
demonstrably impossible.

Subsequent to Morgentaler, the courts
appear to have assumed that a defence of necessity does exist in Canada. On the later trial of
Dr. Morgentaler, the defence of necessity was again raised on a charge of
procuring a miscarriage. Some admissible evidence was made in support of the
plea and the case went to the jury, which rendered a verdict of not guilty. An
appeal by the Crown from the acquittal failed: R. v. Morgentaler (1976),
33 C.R.N.S. 244. Leave to appeal to this Court was

[Page 245]

refused, [1976] 1 S.C.R. x. The defence also
succeeded in four other cases: R. v. Guenther (1978), 8 Alta L.R. (2d)
125; R. v. Pootlass (1977), 1 C.R. (3d) 378; R. v. Fry (1977),
36 C.C.C. (2d) 396; R. v. Morris (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 163. In a
number of other cases the existence of such a defence was acknowledged but held
to be unavailable on the facts. Some examples include: R. v. Gilkes (1978),
8 C.R. (3d) 159; R. v. Doud (1982), 18 M.V.R. 146; R. v. Byng (1977),
20 N.S.R. (2d) 125; R. v. Walker (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 126 and R. v.
Salvador (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 521 (N.S.S.C. App. Div.), the case most
nearly analogous to the one at bar, of which more anon.

In the present appeal the Crown does not
challenge the appellants’ claim that necessity is a common law defence
preserved by Criminal Code s. 7(3). Rather, the Crown claims the trial
judge erred in (1) instructing the jury on the defence in light of the facts
and (2) imposing the burden of disproof of the defence upon the Crown, rather
than imposing the burden of proof on the appellants.

b) The Conceptual Foundation of the Defence

In Morgentaler, supra, I characterized
necessity as an “ill-defined and elusive concept”. Despite the apparently
growing consensus as to the existence of a defence of necessity that statement
is equally true today.

This is no doubt in part because, though
apparently laying down a single rule as to criminal liability, the “defence” of
necessity in fact is capable of embracing two different and distinct notions.
As Mr. Justice Macdonald observed succinctly but accurately in the Salvador case, supra, at p. 542:

Generally speaking, the defence of
necessity covers all cases where non-compliance with law is excused by an
emergency or justified by the pursuit of some greater good.

[Page 246]

Working Paper 29 of the Law Reform Commission of
Canada at p. 93 makes this same point in somewhat more detail:

The rationale of necessity, however, is
clear. Essentially it involves two factors. One is the avoidance of greater
harm or the pursuit of some greater good, the other is the difficulty of
compliance with law in emergencies. From these two factors emerge two different
but related principles. The first is a utilitarian principle to the effect
that, within certain limits, it is justifiable in an emergency to break the
letter of the law if breaking the law will avoid a greater harm than obeying
it. The second is a humanitarian principle to the effect that, again within
limits, it is excusable in an emergency to break the law if compliance would
impose an intolerable burden on the accused.

Despite any superficial similarities, these two
principles are in fact quite distinct and many of the confusions and the
difficulties in the cases (and, with respect, in academic discussions) arise
from a failure to distinguish between them.

Criminal theory recognizes a distinction between
“justifications” and “excuses”. A “justification” challenges the wrongfulness
of an action which technically constitutes a crime. The police officer who
shoots the hostage-taker, the innocent object of an assault who uses force to
defend himself against his assailant, the Good Samaritan who commandeers a car
and breaks the speed laws to rush an accident victim to the hospital, these are
all actors whose actions we consider rightful, not wrongful. For such
actions people are often praised, as motivated by some great or noble object.
The concept of punishment often seems incompatible with the social approval
bestowed on the doer.

In contrast, an “excuse” concedes the
wrongfulness of the action but asserts that the circumstances under which it
was done are such that it ought not to be attributed to the actor. The
perpetrator who is incapable, owing to a disease of the mind, of appreciating
the nature and consequences of his acts, the person who labours under a mistake
of fact, the drunkard, the sleepwalker: these are all

[Page 247]

actors of whose “criminal” actions we disapprove
intensely, but whom, in appropriate circumstances, our law will not punish.

Herbert Packer, The Limits of the Criminal
Sanction (1968), expresses the distinction thus at p. 113:

…conduct that we choose not to treat as
criminal is “justifiable” if our reason for treating it as noncriminal is
predominantly that it is conduct that we applaud, or at least do not actively
seek to discourage: conduct is “excusable” if we deplore it but for some
extrinsic reason conclude that it is not politic to punish it.

It will be seen that the two different
approaches to the “defence” of necessity from Blackstone forward correspond, the
one to a justification, the other to an excuse. As the examples cited above
illustrate, the criminal law recognizes and our Criminal Code codifies a
number of specific categories of justification and of excuse. The remainder,
those instances that conform to the general principle but do not fall within
any specific category such as self-defence on the one hand or insanity on the
other, purportedly fall within the “residual defence” of necessity.

As a “justification” this residual defence can
be related to Blackstone’s concept of a “choice of evils”. It would exculpate
actors whose conduct could reasonably have been viewed as “necessary” in order
to prevent a greater evil than that resulting from the violation of the law. As
articulated, especially in some of the American cases, it involves a
utilitarian balancing of the benefits of obeying the law as opposed to
disobeying it, and when the balance is clearly in favour of disobeying,
exculpates an actor who contravenes a criminal statute. This is the “greater
good” formulation of the necessity defence: in some circumstances, it is
alleged, the values of society, indeed of the crimi-

[Page 248]

nal law itself, are better promoted by
disobeying a given statute than by observing it.

With regard to this conceptualization of a
residual defence of necessity, I retain the skepticism I expressed in Morgentaler,
supra, at p. 678. It is still my opinion that, “[n]o system of
positive law can recognize any principle which would entitle a person to
violate the law because on his view the law conflicted with some higher social
value”. The Criminal Code has specified a number of identifiable
situations in which an actor is justified in committing what would otherwise be
a criminal offence. To go beyond that and hold that ostensibly illegal acts can
be validated on the basis of their expediency, would import an undue
subjectivity into the criminal law. It would invite the courts to second-guess
the legislature and to assess the relative merits of social policies underlying
criminal prohibitions. Neither is a role which fits well with the judicial
function. Such a doctrine could well become the last resort of scoundrels and
in the words of Edmund Davies L.J. in Southwark London Borough Council v.
Williams, [1971] Ch. 734,
it could “very easily become simply a mask for anarchy”.

Conceptualized as an “excuse”, however, the
residual defence of necessity is, in my view, much less open to criticism. It
rests on a realistic assessment of human weakness, recognizing that a liberal
and humane criminal law cannot hold people to the strict obedience of laws in
emergency situations where normal human instincts, whether of self-preservation
or of altruism, overwhelmingly impel disobedience. The objectivity of the
criminal law is preserved; such acts are still wrongful, but in the
circumstances they are excusable. Praise is indeed not bestowed, but pardon is,
when one does a wrongful act under pressure which, in the words of Aristotle in
the Nicomachean Ethics, supra, at

[Page 249]

p. 49, “overstrains human nature and which no
one could withstand”.

George Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law (1978),
decribes this view of necessity as “compulsion of circumstance” which
description points to the conceptual link between necessity as an excuse and
the familiar criminal law requirement that in order to engage criminal
liability, the actions constituting the actus reus of an offence must be
voluntary. Literally this voluntariness requirement simply refers to the need
that the prohibited physical acts must have been under the conscious control of
the actor. Without such control, there is, for purposes of the criminal law, no
act. The excuse of necessity does not go to voluntariness in this sense. The
lost alpinist who on the point of freezing to death breaks open an isolated
mountain cabin is not literally behaving in an involuntary fashion. He has
control over his actions to the extent of being physically capable of
abstaining from the act. Realistically, however, his act is not a “voluntary”
one. His “choice” to break the law is no true choice at all; it is
remorselessly compelled by normal human instincts. This sort of involuntariness
is often described as “moral or normative involuntariness”. Its place in
criminal theory is described by Fletcher at pp. 804-05 as follows:

The notion of voluntariness adds a valuable
dimension to the theory of excuses. That conduct is involuntary—even in the
normative sense—explains why it cannot fairly be punished. Indeed, H.L.A. Hart
builds his theory of excuses on the principle that the distribution of
punishment should be reserved for those who voluntarily break the law. Of the
arguments he advances for this principle of justice, the most explicit is that
it is preferable to live in a society where we have the maximum opportunity to
choose whether we shall become the subject of criminal liability. In addition,
Hart intimates that it is ideologically desirable for the government to treat
its citizens as self-actuating, choosing agents. This principle of respect for
individual autonomy is implicitly confirmed whenever those who lack an adequate
choice are excused for their offenses.

[Page 250]

I agree with this formulation of the rationale
for excuses in the criminal law. In my view this rationale extends beyond
specific codified excuses and embraces the residual excuse known as the defence
of necessity. At the heart of this defence is the perceived injustice of
punishing violations of the law in circumstances in which the person had no
other viable or reasonable choice available; the act was wrong but it is
excused because it was realistically unavoidable.

Punishment of such acts, as Fletcher notes at
p. 813, can be seen as purposeless as well as unjust:

…involuntary conduct cannot be deterred and
therefore it is pointless and wasteful to punish involuntary actors. This
theory …of pointless punishment, carries considerable weight in current
Anglo-American legal thought.

Relating necessity to the principle that the law
ought not to punish involuntary acts leads to a conceptualization of the
defence that integrates it into the normal rules for criminal liability rather
than constituting it as a sui generis exception and threatening to
engulf large portions of the criminal law. Such a conceptualization accords
with our traditional legal, moral and philosophic views as to what sorts of
acts and what sorts of actors ought to be punished. In this formulation it is a
defence which I do not hesitate to acknowledge and would not hesitate to apply
to relevant facts capable of satisfying its necessary prerequisites.

c) Limitations on the Defence

If the defence of necessity is to form a valid
and consistent part of our criminal law it must, as has been universally
recognized, be strictly controlled and scrupulously limited to situations that
correspond to its underlying rationale. That rationale, as I have indicated, is
the recognition that it is inappropriate to punish actions which are
normatively “involuntary”. The appropriate controls and limitations on the
defence of necessity are, there-

[Page 251]

fore, addressed to ensuring that the acts for
which the benefit of the excuse of necessity is sought are truly “involuntary”
in the requisite sense.

In Morgentaler, supra, I was of the view
that any defence of necessity was restricted to instances of non-compliance “in
urgent situations of clear and imminent peril when compliance with the law is
demonstrably impossible”. In my opinion this restriction focuses directly on
the “involuntariness” of the purportedly necessitous behaviour by providing a
number of tests for determining whether the wrongful act was truly the only
realistic reaction open to the actor or whether he was in fact making what in
fairness could be called a choice. If he was making a choice, then the wrongful
act cannot have been involuntary in the relevant sense.

The requirement that the situation be urgent and
the peril be imminent, tests whether it was indeed unavoidable for the actor to
act at all. In LaFave & Scott, Criminal Law (1972), at p. 388,
one reads:

It is sometimes said that the defense of
necessity does not apply except in an emergency—when the threatened harm is
immediate, the threatened disaster imminent. Perhaps this is but a way of
saying that, until the time comes when the threatened harm is immediate, there
are generally options open to the defendant to avoid the harm, other than the
option of disobeying the literal terms of the law—the rescue ship may appear,
the storm may pass; and so the defendant must wait until that hope of survival
disappears.

At a minimum the situation must be so emergent
and the peril must be so pressing that normal human instincts cry out for
action and make a counsel of patience unreasonable.

The requirement that compliance with the law be
“demonstrably impossible” takes this assessment one step further. Given that
the accused had to act, could he nevertheless realistically have acted to avoid
the peril or prevent the harm, without breaking the law? Was there a legal
way

[Page 252]

Out? I think this
is what Bracton means when he lists “necessity” as a defence, providing the
wrongful act was not “avoidable”. The question to be asked is whether the agent
had any real choice: could he have done otherwise? If there is a reasonable
legal alternative to disobeying the law, then the decision to disobey becomes a
voluntary one, impelled by some consideration beyond the dictates of
“necessity” and human instincts.

The importance of this requirement that there be
no reasonable legal alternative cannot be overstressed.

Even if the requirements for urgency and “no
legal way out” are met, there is clearly a further consideration. There must be
some way of assuring proportionality. No rational criminal justice system, no
matter how humane or liberal, could excuse the infliction of a greater harm to
allow the actor to avert a lesser evil. In such circumstances we expect the
individual to bear the harm and refrain from acting illegally. If he cannot
control himself we will not excuse him. According to Fletcher, this requirement
is also related to the notion of voluntariness (at p. 804):

…if the gap between the harm done and the
benefit accrued becomes too great, the act is more likely to appear voluntary
and therefore inexcusable. For example, if the actor has to blow up a whole
city in order to avoid the breaking of his finger, we might appropriately
expect him to endure the harm to himself. His surrendering to the threat in
this case violates our expectations of appropriate and normal resistance and
pressure. Yet as we lower the degree of harm to others and increase the
threatened harm to the person under duress we will reach a threshold at which,
in the language of the Model Penal Code, “a person of reasonable firmness”
would be “unable to resist”. Determining this threshold is patently a matter of
moral judgment about what we expect people to be able to resist in trying
situations. A valuable aid in making that judgment is comparing the competing
interests at stake and assessing the degree to which the actor inflicts harm
beyond the benefit that accrues from his action.

[Page 253]

I would therefore add to the preceding
requirements a stipulation of proportionality expressable, as it was in Morgentaler,
by the proviso that the harm inflicted must be less than the harm sought to
be avoided.

d) Illegality or Contributory Fault

The Crown submits that there is an additional
limitation on the availability of the defence of necessity. Citing R. v. Salvador, supra, it argues that because the appellants were committing a crime when
their necessitous circumstances arose, they should be denied the defence of
necessity as a matter of law.

In Salvador, Jones J.A. thought it highly relevant
that the accused were engaged in an illegal venture when they were forced
ashore. He would have denied the necessity defence in such circumstances. At
page 528, he said:

Should the appellants who embarked on an
illegal venture be now heard to plead necessity when it was the venture which
eventually gave rise to that necessity? One who undertakes an ocean voyage in a
56-foot yacht loaded to the gunnels with narcotics could scarcely be surprised
at getting into difficulties at sea or eventually running afoul of the law. To
put things in perspective, this was a voyage by a band of conspirators with a
cargo of contraband having every intention of violating the law of nations from
the outset. It is clear from their evidence that they were employed for that
purpose. I fail to see how any self-respecting nation, as a signatory to the
Convention on Narcotic Drugs, could countenance the defence of necessity or
distress in such circumstances.

Macdonald J.A. (Cooper and Hart JJ.A.
concurring) said, in agreement, after holding that the necessity defence was
not available because compliance with the law was not demonstrably impossible
(at p. 545):

Finally I have grave reservations whether
the defence of necessity has any application to the circumstances of this case.
I entertain such reservation primarily because the appellants were actively
engaged in the commission of a joint criminal venture when the circumstances
arose

[Page 254]

that they contend gave rise to, or
supported, the defence of necessity.

Were it indeed accurate that the fact of doing
something illegal when the necessitous circumstances arise will deny one the
benefit of the necessity defence, I would nevertheless doubt that this
principle would be relevant to the present case. The accused here (as
incidentally was also apparently the case in Salvador) were not doing anything illegal under Canadian law when the
necessity arose. They were on the high seas. They were conspiring to import
marihuana into the United States, not Canada. If
such a limitation on the necessity defence were to be formulated, in my view,
the accused should, at a minimum, be violating some law of the forum, not just
the law of a foreign state.

In any event, I have considerable doubt as to
the cogency of such a limitation. If the conduct in which an accused was
engaging at the time the peril arose was illegal, then it should clearly be
punished, but I fail to see the relevance of its illegal character to the
question of whether the accused’s subsequent conduct in dealing with this
emergent peril ought to be excused on the basis of necessity. At most the
illegality—or if one adopts Jones J.A.’s approach, the immorality—of the
preceding conduct will colour the subsequent conduct in response to the
emergency as also wrongful. But that wrongfulness is never in any doubt.
Necessity goes to excuse conduct, not to justify it. Where it is
found to apply it carries with it no implicit vindication of the deed to which
it attaches. That cannot be over-emphasized. Were the defence of necessity to
succeed in the present case, it would not in any way amount to a vindication of
importing controlled substances nor to a critique of the law prohibiting such
importation. It would also have nothing to say about the comparative social
utility of breaking the law against importing as compared to obeying the law.
The question, as I have said, is never whether what the accused has done is
wrongful. It is always and by definition, wrongful. The question is whether
what he has done is voluntary. Except in the limited

[Page 255]

sense I intend to discuss below, I do not see
the relevance of the legality or even the morality of what the accused was
doing at the time the emergency arose to this question of the voluntariness of
the subsequent conduct.

In Salvador, Jones J.A. cited sources in
support of his view that illegal conduct should act as a bar to the necessity
defence. These sources do not support that view but do support a closely
related notion—that if the accused’s own “fault” (including negligence or
recklessness) is responsible for the events giving rise to the necessity, he
may not rely on the necessity defence.

This limitation has found expression in several
American state statutes codifying the necessity defence, such as those of New
York and Illinois and has been adopted by the United States National Commission
on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws which recommended that the defence apply
only “where the situation developed through no fault of the actor”. A parallel
is sometimes drawn between such a limitation and the restrictions placed on the
availability of the largely analogous defence of duress. See, e.g., A.J.
Ashworth, “Reason, Logic and Criminal Liability”, (1975) 91 L.Q.R. 102 at
p. 106.

In my view the accused’s fault in bringing about
the situation later invoked to excuse his conduct can be relevant to the
availability of the defence of necessity, but not in the sweeping way suggested
by some of the commentators and in some of the statutory formulations. Insofar
as the accused’s “fault” reflects on the moral quality of the action taken to
meet the emergency, it is irrelevant to the issue of the availability of the
defence on the same basis as the illegality or immorality of the actions
preceding the emergency are irrelevant. If this fault is capable of attracting
criminal or civil liability in its own right, the culprit should be

[Page 256]

appropriately sanctioned. I see no basis,
however, for “transferring” such liability to the actions taken in response to
the emergency, especially where to do so would result in attaching criminal
consequences on the basis of negligence to actions which would otherwise be
excused.

In my view the better approach to the
relationship of fault to the availability of necessity as a defence is based
once again on the question of whether the actions sought to be excused were
truly “involuntary”. If the necessitous situation was clearly foreseeable to a
reasonable observer, if the actor contemplated or ought to have contemplated
that his actions would likely give rise to an emergency requiring the breaking
of the law, then I doubt whether what confronted the accused was in the
relevant sense an emergency. His response was in that sense not “involuntary”.
“Contributory fault” of this nature, but only of this nature, is a relevant
consideration to the availability of the defence.

It is on this point that the analogy to duress
is especially enlightening. Section 17 of the Criminal Code provides:

17. A person
who commits an offence under compulsion by threats of immediate death or
grievous bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is committed
is excused for committing the offence if he believes that the threats will be
carried out and if he is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby
he is subject to compulsion…

(Emphasis added.)

The rationale for the proviso making the defence
unavailable to a member of a criminal conspiracy or association, is the same as
that articulated with regard to the common law defence of duress by Lord Morris
of Borth-y-Gest in Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland v.
Lynch, [1975] A.C. 653 at p. 670:

[Page 257]

In posing the case where someone is
‘really’ threatened I use the word ‘really’ in order to emphasise that duress
must never be allowed to be the easy answer of those… who readily could have
avoided the dominance of threats nor of those who allow themselves to be at the
disposal and under the sway of some gangster-tyrant.

If section 17 and the comments of Lord
Morris of Borth-y-Gest embody a notion of “contributory fault” it is not per
se on account of the accused’s participation in criminal or immoral
activity at the time he became subject to threats, nor on account of any simple
negligence on his part, but rather on account of the clear foreseeability of
his becoming subject to such threats and domination and the consequent
conclusion that he was not “really” threatened.

In my view the same test is applicable to
necessity. If the accused’s “fault” consists of actions whose clear
consequences were in the situation that actually ensued, then he was not
“really” confronted with an emergency which compelled him to commit the
unlawful act he now seeks to have excused. In such situations the defence is
unavailable. Mere negligence, however, or the simple fact that he was engaged
in illegal or immoral conduct when the emergency arose will not disentitle an
individual to rely on the defence of necessity.

e) Onus of Proof

Although necessity is spoken of as a defence, in
the sense that it is raised by the accused, the Crown always bears the burden
of proving a voluntary act. The prosecution must prove every element of the
crime charged. One such element is the voluntariness of the act. Normally,
voluntariness can be presumed, but if the accused places before the Court,
through his own witnesses or through cross-examination of Crown witnesses,
evidence sufficient to raise an issue that the situation created by external
forces was so emergent that failure to act could endanger life or health and
upon any reasonable view of the facts, compliance with the law was impossible,
then the Crown

[Page 258]

must be prepared to meet that issue. There is no
onus of proof on the accused.

The Crown argues, however, that s. 7(2) of
the Narcotic Control Act shifts the burden of persuasion to the accused.

Section 7(2) provides:

7.(1) …

(2) In any prosecution under this Act the
burden of proving that an exception, exemption, excuse or qualification
prescribed by law operates in favour of the accused is on the accused, and the
prosecutor is not required, except by way of rebuttal, to prove that the
exception, exemption, excuse or qualification does not operate in favour of the
accused, whether or not it is set out in the information or indictment.

The Crown contends that the defence of necessity
is an “exception, exemption, excuse or qualification prescribed by law”. I find
no merit in this contention.

The Narcotic Control Act provides for
several statutory exceptions to its broad prohibitions against importation,
sale, manufacture, and possession. The offences created by the Act are
generally subject to the proviso that the accused not have been acting under
the authority of the Act or the regulations thereunder. See sections 3(1)
(possession), 5(1) (importation), 6(1) (cultivation). Section 12 of the Act
implements this scheme by providing for a set of regulations governing the
issuance of licences for, inter alia, the importation, sale,
manufacture, or possession of narcotics. One who sells, imports, manufactures
or possesses narcotics pursuant to such authority does not commit an offence.

It seems clear that it is to these statutory
exceptions that s. 7(2) refers, and not to common law defences such as
necessity. One who wishes to plead the possession of a licence or other lawful
authority in response to a charge of importation bears, under s. 7(2), the
burden of persuading the trier of fact that such licence exists. One who pleads
necessity bears no such burden. Section

[Page 259]

7(2) does not place a persuasive burden as to
the defence of necessity on the accused.

f) Preliminary Conclusions as to the Defence
of Necessity

It is now possible to summarize a number of
conclusions as to the defence of necessity in terms of its nature, basis and
limitations: (1) the defence of necessity could be conceptualized as either a
justification or an excuse; (2) it should be recognized in Canada as an excuse,
operating by virtue of s. 7(3) of the Criminal Code; (3)
necessity as an excuse implies no vindication of the deeds of the actor; (4)
the criterion is the moral involuntariness of the wrongful action; (5) this
involuntariness is measured on the basis of society’s expectation of
appropriate and normal resistance to pressure; (6) negligence or involvement in
criminal or immoral activity does not disentitle the actor to the excuse of
necessity; (7) actions or circumstances which indicate that the wrongful deed
was not truly involuntary do disentitle; (8) the existence of a reasonable
legal alternative similarly disentitles; to be involuntary the act must be
inevitable, unavoidable and afford no reasonable opportunity for an alternative
course of action that does not involve a breach of the law; (9) the defence
only applies in circumstances of imminent risk where the action was taken to
avoid a direct and immediate peril; (10) where the accused places before the
Court sufficient evidence to raise the issue, the onus is on the Crown to meet
it beyond a reasonable doubt.

g) The Judge’s Charge

The trial judge concluded that there was before
him an adequate body of evidence to raise the issue of necessity and proceeded
to direct the jury with respect to the defence. As I have earlier indicated,
the Crown disputes whether the defence was open to the accused in the
circumstances of

[Page 260]

the case and submits further that if it was in
fact available, the trial judge erred in his direction.

In my view the trial judge was correct in
concluding that on the evidence before him he should instruct the jury with
regard to necessity. There was evidence before him from which a jury might
conclude that the accused’s actions in coming ashore with their cargo of
cannabis were aimed at self-preservation in response to an overwhelming
emergency. I have already indicated that in my view they were not engaged in
conduct that was illegal under Canadian criminal law at the time the emergency
arose, and that even if they were, that fact alone would not disentitle them to
raise the defence. The question then becomes whether the trial judge erred in
charging the jury in the terms that he did.

The summary of conclusions with regard to
necessity in the foregoing section indicates that for the defence to
succeed, an accused’s actions must be, in the relevant sense, an “involuntary”
response to an imminent and overwhelming peril. The defence cannot succeed if
the response was disproportional to the peril or if it was not “involuntary” in
the sense that the emergency was not “real” or not imminent or that there was a
reasonable alternative response that was not illegal.

In the course of his charge on the issue of
necessity the trial judge instructed the jury, using the specific words that
appear in Morgentaler, to the effect that they must find facts which
amount to an “urgent situation of clear and imminent peril when compliance with
the law is demonstrably impossible” in order for the appellants’ non-compliance
with the law against importation and possession of cannabis to be excused. That
is the correct test. It is, with respect, however, my view that in explaining
the meaning and application of this test, the trial judge fell into error.

[Page 261]

The trial judge was obliged, in my opinion, to
direct the jury’s attention to a number of issues pertinent to the test for
necessity. Was the emergency a real one? Did it constitute an immediate threat
of the harm purportedly feared? Was the response proportionate? In comparing
this response to the danger that motivated it, was the danger one that society
would reasonably expect the average person to withstand? Was there any
reasonable legal alternative to the illegal response open to the accused?
Although the trial judge did not explicitly pose each and every one of these
questions in my view his charge was adequate to bring the considerations
underlying them to the jury’s attention on every issue except the last one, the
question of a reasonable alternative.

This issue was the determining obstacle to the
success of the defence of necessity in a number of the cases referred to
earlier, including Gilkes, Doud, Byng and for the present case most
notably, because of the similarity of its factual basis, Salvador. Indeed
in most cases where the defence is raised this consideration will almost
certainly be the most important one.

In his charge, the trial judge did not advert to
this requirement. He did tell the jury that they must find facts capable of
showing that “compliance with the law [was] demonstrably impossible…” but on
his recharge he put before the jury a significantly different test. The test,
he said, is:

…can you find facts from this evidence, and
that means all the evidence, of course, that the situation of the Samarkanda at
sea was so appallingly dire and dangerous to life that a reasonable doubt
arises as to whether or not their decision was justified?

And again, at the conclusion of the recharge:

There is no need for the evidence to show
you that a certainty of death would result unless the action complained of by
the Crown was taken. It doesn’t go so far as that. You have to look at it as
reasonable people and

[Page 262]

decide on any reasonable view of the
matter, would these people have been justified in doing what they did? That is
all that necessity means.

Both of these passages imply that the crucial
consideration was whether the accused acted reasonably in coming into shore
with their load of cannabis rather than facing death at sea. That is not
sufficient as a test. Even if it does deal with the reality of the peril, its
imminence and the proportionality of putting into shore, it does not deal at
all with the question of whether there existed any other reasonable responses
to the peril that were not illegal. Indeed, aside from the initial repetition
of the Morgentaler formula, the trial judge did not advert to this
consideration at all, nor did he direct the jury’s attention to the relevance
of evidence indicating the possibility of such alternative courses of action.
In these respects I believe he erred in law. He did not properly put the
question of a “legal way out” before the jury.

In my view this was a serious error and omission
going to the heart of the defence of necessity. The error justifies a new
trial.

III The Botanical Defence

The Narcotic Control Act, s. 2, defines
cannabis (marihuana) as “Cannabis sativa L.” At trial, the appellants
presented expert testimony to the effect that there are three species of
cannabis—Cannabis sativa L., Cannabis indica Lam., and Cannabis
ruderalis Jan. The Crown countered with expert testimony that there is only
one species of cannabis—the prohibited Cannabis sativa L.

The divergence in views among botanists is of
recent origin. Before 1970, there were isolated references in the literature to
Cannabis indica (Lamarck 1785) and Cannabis ruderalis (Janis‑chevsky
1924) but the prevailing botanical view

[Page 263]

was that marihuana was monotypic and consisted
only of Cannabis sativa L.

It was proven at trial that the Samarkanda’s cargo
was marihuana but it was not proven that it was Cannabis sativa L., as
opposed to Cannabis indica Lam. or Cannabis ruderalis Jan. The
laboratory tests performed by the Crown were not designed to distinguish among
the three purported species, the Crown’s experts being of the view that all
marihuana was Cannabis sativa L. Counsel for the accused asked the trial
judge to put the question whether marihuana was monotypic or polytypic to the
jury, with an instruction that if they found there were three species of
cannabis and the Crown had not proven that the cannabis in the possession of
the appellants was the prohibited species, they should find the appellants not
guilty.

The trial judge agreed with the accused that the
taxonomic question was one of fact but ruled that its resolution was
unnecessary because Parliament, when it used the term Cannabis sativa L.
in the Narcotic Control Act, meant to embrace all marihuana. In his
view, since all marihuana was prohibited by the Act, it was irrelevant whether
the plant was botanically polytypic or monotypic. He declined to put the
accused’s “botanical defence” to the jury.

The appellants contend that the trial judge
erred in ruling as a matter of law that the term “Cannabis sativa L.” in
the Narcotic Control Act embraces all marihuana. They rely principally
on the rule of statutory construction that technical terms in statutes should
be given their technical meaning.

It is clear that the Latin phrase “Cannabis
sativa L.” is a technical term. Botanical nomenclature is governed by an
internationally accepted set of regulations which provide that Latin is the
official language of botany. Pursuant to the Code of Botanical Nomenclature,
plant species are assigned a Latin binomial with the name of the

[Page 264]

author (the taxonomist who first identifies and
names the species) appended in abbreviated form. The first word in the binomial
identifies the genus, or “family” to which the plant in question belongs; the
second word identifies the species. “Cannabis saliva L.” in this naming
system designates the species saliva of the genus cannabis. The
“L.” stands for Linnaeus, the botanist who discovered the plant in 1753.

It is well established that technical and
scientific terms which appear in statutes should be given their technical or
scientific meaning: see Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (12th
ed. 1969) at p. 28. The question presented in the case at bar, however, is
not whether the term “Cannabis sativa L.” should be assigned its
scientific or technical meaning. The parties agree that it should. The real
dispute, as I see it, is as to when, in temporal terms, that meaning should be
fixed. The appellants argue, in effect, for the meaning which the scientific
community would today give to the phrase. They submit that a jury could
reasonably find from the expert evidence presented that the scientific
community is now of the view that there are three species of the genus
cannabis, of which Cannabis sativa L. is only one. The Crown, on the
other hand, argues that the meaning to be given to the phrase “Cannabis
sativa L.” is the meaning which the botanical community ascribed to it when
the Narcotic Control Act became law in 1961. In 1961, botanists were
virtually unanimous in holding that cannabis marihuana consisted of only one
species and that the plants which some botanists referred to as Cannabis
indica Lam. and Cannabis ruderalis Jan. were merely subspecies of Cannabis
sativa L. The appellants, as I have said, ask that we give the phrase in
question the meaning which their experts say it bears at present among members
of the botanical community; the Crown asks us to freeze its meaning at the time
of enactment.

The doctrine of contemporanea expositio is
well established in our law. “The words of a statute

[Page 265]

must be construed as they would have been the
day after the statute was passed…” Sharpe v. Wakefield (1888), 22 Q.B.D.
239, at p. 242 (per Lord Esher, M.R.). See also Driedger, Construction
of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983) at p. 163: “Since a statute must be
considered in the light of all circumstances existing at the time of its
enactment it follows logically that words must be given the meanings they had
at the time of enactment, and the courts have so held”; Maxwell on the
Interpretation of Statutes, supra, at p. 85: “The words of an Act will
generally be understood in the sense which they bore when it was passed”.

This does not mean, of course, that all terms in
all statutes must always be confined to their original meanings. Broad
statutory categories are often held to include things unknown when the statute
was enacted. In Gambart v. Ball (1863), 32 L.J.C.P. 166, for example, it
was held that the Engraving Copyright Act of 1735, which prohibited
unauthorized engraving or “in any other manner” copying prints and engravings,
applied to photographic reproduction—a process invented more than one hundred
years after the Act was passed. (See also Maxwell, supra, at pp. 102 and
243-44.) This kind of interpretive approach is most likely to be taken,
however, with legislative language that is broad or “open-textured”. It is
appropriate, as the judgments of Viscount Sankey in Edwards v.
Attorney-General for Canada, [1930] A.C. 124, and Viscount Jowitt in Attorney-General
for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada (the Privy Council Appeals
Reference), [1947] A.C. 127, indicate, to the interpretation of the words
in constitutional documents, whose meaning must be capable of growth and
development to meet changing circumstances. But where, as here, the legislature
has deliberately chosen a specific scientific or technical term to represent an
equally specific and particular class of things, it would do violence to
Parliament’s intent to give a new meaning to that term whenever the taxonomic
consensus among members of the relevant scientific fraternity shifted. It is
clear that Parliament intended in 1961, by the phrase “Cannabis sativa

[Page 266]

L.”, to prohibit all cannabis. The fact that
some, possibly a majority, of botanists would now give that phrase a less
expansive reading in the light of studies not undertaken until the early
1970’s, does not alter that intention. The interpretation given to the Narcotic
Control Act by the trial judge was consistent with Parliament’s apparent
intent in enacting the legislation, and was, in my opinion, correct.

There is no question in my mind that the appellants
were given “fair warning” by the Narcotic Control Act that their conduct
was illegal. It is common knowledge in our society that marihuana is an illegal
drug. It is not common knowledge that some botanists have recently concluded
that there are three separate species of the mother plant, based on
morphological considerations. Against this background, it seems highly unlikely
that the citizen seeking guidance from his country’s laws as to what he may or
may not do, would see in the language “Cannabis sativa L.” a basis for
the three species botanical argument relied upon by the appellants in the case
at bar. It would simply be unreasonable to assume that by using the phrase “Cannabis
sativa L.” Parliament meant to prohibit only some intoxicating marihuana
and exempt the rest. Such an interpretation would be at odds with the general
scheme of the Narcotic Control Act as well as the common understanding
of society at large. Under the circumstances, it seems clear that the statute
gives ample warning as written. Fairness does not demand that it be more
narrowly construed.

This has been the approach taken by the two
Canadian courts who have considered the botanical defence, and both have
rejected it. See R. v. Herbert, Coombs and Spanks (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d)
423, at p. 439; R. v. Deslaurier, Paskell and Pinney, Ont. Co. Ct.
(District of York), July 1974, Steen J. The American cases are in accord. See,

[Page 267]

for example, People v. Hamilton, 105 Cal.
App. 3d 113 (1980); United States v. Lupo, 652 F.2d 723 (7th Cir. 1981);
United States v. Kelly, 527 F.2d 961 (9th Cir. 1976); United States
v. Gavic, 520 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir. 1975); United States v. Spann, 515
F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1975); United States v. Walton, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C.
Cir. 1975); United States v. Honneus, 508 F.2d 566 (1st Cir. 1974); United
States v. Kinsey, 505 F.2d 1354 (2nd Cir. 1974); United States v.
Sifuentes, 504 F.2d 845 (4th Cir. 1974); United States v. Gaines, 489
F.2d 690 (5th Cir. 1974); United States v. Moore, 446 F.2d 448 (3rd Cir.
1971).

The trial judge was correct in withdrawing the
appellants’ botanical defence from the jury.

IV Rebuttal Evidence

The British Columbia Court of Appeal concluded
that the trial judge erred in law in denying the Crown the right of rebuttal
and based its order for a new trial on this finding. I have already concluded
that there must be a new trial owing to the error of law in the trial judge’s
charge with respect to necessity. At this new trial the issue of whether in the
circumstances of the first trial the Crown was entitled in law to present the
rebuttal evidence it sought to adduce will no longer be relevant and will have
no effect on the outcome of the case. I do not, accordingly, find it necessary
to decide whether the trial judge erred in law in exercising his discretion to
refuse to allow the rebuttal.

V Conclusion

On the basis of all the above, it is my
conclusion that the Court of Appeal was correct in the result in ordering a new
trial and was correct in sustaining the trial judge’s decision to withhold the

[Page 268]

botanical defence from the jury.

I would dismiss the appeals.

The following are the reasons delivered by

WILSON J.—The factual background of this case,
the history of the litigation in the courts below and the grounds on which the appeal
was taken in this Court are very fully set out in the reasons for judgment of
Mr. Justice Dickson (as he was at the date of the hearing) and it is not
necessary for me to repeat them. Indeed, inasmuch as Dickson J.’s conclusion as
to the defence of necessity seems clearly correct on the facts of this case and
his disposition of the appeal manifestly just in the circumstances, I am
dealing in these reasons only with the proposition very forcefully advanced by
Dickson J. in his reasons that the appropriate jurisprudential basis on which
to premise the defence of necessity is exclusively that of excuse. My concern
is that the learned Justice appears to be closing the door on justification as
an appropriate jurisprudential basis in some cases and I am firmly of the view
that this is a door which should be left open by the Court.

As Dickson J. points out, criminal law theory
recognizes a distinction between justification and excuse. In the case of
justification the wrongfulness of the alleged offensive act is challenged; in
the case of excuse the wrongfulness is acknowledged but a ground for the
exercise of judicial compassion for the actor is asserted. By way of
illustration, an act may be said to be justified when an essential element of
the offence is absent, so that the defence effectively converts the accused’s
act from wrongful to rightful. Accordingly, those defences which serve to
establish a lack of culpable intent on the part of the accused, or which
demonstrate that, although the accused intended to commit the act, the act was
one which the accused was within his rights to commit, may be labeled
justification in so far as they elucidate the innocent nature of the act giving
rise to the charge. Such doctrines as mistake of fact, automatism, etc. which,
in the words of Lord Hailsham in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan, [1975]
2 All E.R. 347 (H.L.), are raised in order to “negative” mens rea, may
be appropriately placed

[Page 269]

in this category as they are invoked in order to
undermine the very ingredient of culpability. Similarly, the accused who claims
to have acted out of self-defence or provocation in utilizing aggressive force
against another individual raises a justificatory defence in that he asserts
the essential rightfulness of his aggressive act.

On the other hand, an excuse requires the court
to evaluate the presence or absence of the accused’s will. In contemporary
jurisprudence the most forceful champion of excuse in criminal law has been
Professor George Fletcher who has advocated a trend toward individualizing the
conceptual basis for culpability so that all circumstances subjectively
relevant to the accused be considered by the court. As such, the jury is
requested to exercise compassion for the accused’s predicament in its evaluation
of his claim: “I couldn’t help myself” (Fletcher, “The Individualization of
Excusing Conditions”, (1974) 47 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1269). This type of
analysis is reflected in the dissent of Seiler J. of the Supreme Court of
Missouri in State v. Green, 470 S.W. 2d 565 (1971), in which the
accused’s prison escape was seen as excusable due to the intolerability of his
confinement with aggressive homosexual inmates by whom he had been repeatedly
victimized. The basis of the defence could not have been that of justification
based on an objective balance of evils since numerous U.S. courts had already
established that the evil of prison escape outweighed the evil of intolerable
prison conditions (see, e.g., People v. Whipple, 279 P. 1008
(Cal. App. 1929); People v. Noble, 170 N.W. 2d 916 (Mich. App.
1969)). Rather, the issue for Seiler J. was the blamelessness of an accused in
committing an act which, although admittedly wrong, was one for which any juror
might have compassion. Thus, the nature of an excuse is to personalize the plea
so that, while justification looks to the Tightness of the act, excuse speaks
to the compassion of the court for the actor.

[Page 270]

As Dickson J. points out, although the necessity
defence has engendered a significant amount of judicial and scholarly debate,
it remains a somewhat elusive concept. It is, however, clear that justification
and excuse are conceptually quite distinct and that any elucidation of a
principled basis for the defence of necessity must be grounded in one or the
other.

Turning first to the category of excuse, the
concept of “normative involuntariness” stressed in the reasons of Dickson J.
may, on one reading, be said to fit squarely within the framework of an
individualized plea which Professor Fletcher indicates characterizes all claims
of excusability. The notional involuntariness of the action is assessed in the
context of the accused’s particular situation. The court must ask not only
whether the offensive act accompanied by the requisite culpable mental state (i.e.
intention, recklessness, etc.) has been established by the prosecution, but
whether or not the accused acted so as to attract society’s moral outrage. In
some U.S. jurisdictions this type of evaluation has been utilized to excuse
from criminal liability individuals who commit intentional offensive acts but
who operate under mental or sociological impairments with which one can
sympathize (see State v. St. Clair, 262 S.W. 2d 25 (Mo. S.C.
1953)), or to form the theoretical basis for a defence where the accused
confronted a desperate situation for which society might well be expected to
express its compassion (see United States v. Holmes, 26 Fed.
Cas. 360 (E.D. Pa. 1842)). In evaluating a claim of “normative
involuntariness” we seem to be told that the individual’s criminally wrongful
act was nevertheless blameless in the circumstances.

The position in English law, by contrast, was
most accurately stated in the well-known case of R. v. Dudley and Stephens (1884),
14 Q.B.D. 273, in which Lord Coleridge warned against allowing “compassion for
the criminal to change or weaken in any manner the legal definition of the
crime” (p. 288). The underlying principle here is the

[Page 271]

universality of rights, that all individuals
whose actions are subjected to legal evaluation must be considered equal in
standing. Indeed, it may be said that this concept of equal assessment of every
actor, regardless of his particular motives or the particular pressures
operating upon his will, is so fundamental to the criminal law as rarely to
receive explicit articulation. However, the entire premise expressed by such
thinkers as Kant and Hegel that man is by nature a rational being, and that
this rationality finds expression both in the human capacity to overcome the
impulses of one’s own will and in the universal right to be free from the
imposition of the impulses and will of others (see Hegel, Philosophy of
Right (trans. Knox, 1952), at pp. 226-27) supports the view that an
individualized assessment of offensive conduct is simply not possible. If the
obligation to refrain from criminal behaviour is perceived as a reflection of
the fundamental duty to be rationally cognizant of the equal freedom of all
individuals, then the focus of an analysis of culpability must be on the
act itself (including its physical and mental elements) and not on the actor.
The universality of such obligations precludes the relevance of what Fletcher
refers to as “an individualized excusing condition”.

On the other hand, the necessity of an act may
be said to exempt an actor from punishment, since the person who acts in
a state of what Dickson J. calls “normative involuntariness” may be viewed as
having been moved to act by the instinct for self-preservation. If so, the
defence does not invoke the Court’s compassion but rather embodies an implicit
statement that the sanction threatened by the law (i.e. future
punishment in one form or another) could never overcome the fear of immediate
death which the accused faced. Accordingly, in such a case the law is incapable
of controlling the accused’s conduct and responding to it with any punishment
at all. Although such an act dictated by the necessity of self-preservation is
a voluntary one (in the normal sense of the word), its “norma-

[Page 272]

tive involuntariness” (in the sense that the
actor faced no realistic choice) may form the basis of a defence if this is
conceived as based on the pointlessness of punishment rather than on a view of
the act itself as one the accused was entitled to commit. Indeed, one finds an
explicit warning to this effect in Kant, The Metaphysical Elements of
Justice (trans. Ladd, 1965), at pp. 41-42, where it is asserted that
“through a strange confusion among jurists” the analysis of the wrongfulness of
an act is often intertwined with the unquestionable futility of inflicting
punishment on a person who has acted in despair or in circumstances of dire
necessity.

It may be opportune at this point to comment
briefly on the need to avoid slipping into what may be labeled an “instrumentalist
analysis” of the purposes of punishment. For example, an analytic focus on
excusing conditions is often premised on the fact that punishment in such
situations will not serve the further goals of deterrence, rehabilitation, etc.
(see, e.g., Glanville Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part (2nd
ed. 1961), esp. at pp. 738-39). Such considerations, however, cannot form the
basis of an acceptable defence since they seem to view criminal culpability
merely as a phenomenon in a chain of cause and effect. From an instrumentalist
point of view the question is not whether liability is demanded in and of
itself (as Lord Coleridge insisted must be the case in Dudley and Stephens,
supra), but rather whether the infliction of punishment will have
some positive consequential effect (see, e.g., J. Bentham, An
Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, vol. II, 2nd ed.,
1823, p. 1).

The view of criminal liability as purposive only
when it serves as a means to a further end is inherently problematic since the
further goals of punishment are by their very nature one step removed from the
determination of guilt or inno-

[Page 273]

cence. Just as we do not inquire into the
socio-economic effects of a particular remedy for determining parties’
respective rights in civil litigation (see, e.g., Shelfer v. City of London
Electric Lighting Co., [1895] 1 Ch. 287 (C.A.)), it does not seem
possible to evaluate criminality with regard to the end results which
punishment will or will not achieve. Accordingly, if the basis for the
accused’s defence is reducible to compassion for his individual attributes or
predicament, or the ineffectiveness of punishment in rehabilitating him or
deterring future acts, the question raised is the type of remedy and the
fashioning of an appropriate sentence. The concerns embodied in such a defence
are legitimately addressed to the sentencing process but cannot, in my view, be
the basis of a successful defence leading to an acquittal.

This, however, is distinguishable from the
situation in which punishment cannot on any grounds be justified, such as the
situation where a person has acted in order to save his own life. As Kant
indicates, although the law must refrain from asserting that conduct which
otherwise constitutes an offence is rightful if done for the sake of
self-preservation, there is no punishment which could conceivably be
appropriate to the accused’s act. As such, the actor falling within the Dickson
J. category of “normative involuntariness” is excused, not because there is no instrumental
ground on which to justify his punishment, but because no purpose inherent to
criminal liability and punishment—i.e. the setting right of a wrongful
act—-can be accomplished for an act which no rational person would avoid.

Returning to the defence of necessity as a
justification, it may generally be said that an act is justified on grounds of
necessity if the court can say that not only was the act a necessary one but it
was rightful rather than wrongful. When grounded on the fundamental principle
that a successful defence must characterize an act as one which the

[Page 274]

accused was within his rights to commit, it
becomes immediately apparent that the defence does not depend on the immediacy
or “normative involuntariness” of the accused’s act unless, of course, the
involuntariness is such as to be pertinent to the ordinary analysis of mens
rea. The fact that one act is done out of a sense of immediacy or urgency
and another after some contemplation cannot, in my view, serve to distinguish
the quality of the act in terms of right or wrong. Rather, the justification
must be premised on the need to fulfil a duty conflicting with the one which
the accused is charged with having breached.

In discussing justification based on a conflict
of duties one must be mindful of the viewpoint expressed by Dickson J. in Morgentaler
v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616 at p. 678, to the effect that “[n]o
system of positive law can recognize any principle which would entitle a person
to violate the law because in his view the law conflicted with some higher
social value”. This statement, in my view, is clearly correct if the “higher
social value” to which the accused points is one which is not reflected in the
legal system in the form of a duty. That is to say, pursuit of a purely ethical
“duty” such as, for example, the duty to give to charity, may represent an
ethically good or virtuous act but is not within the realm of legal obligations
and cannot therefore validly be invoked as a basis on which to violate the positive
criminal law. This illustration exemplifies the essential proposition that
although “a morally motivated act contrary to law may be ethically justified…
the actor must accept the [legal] penalty for his action”: United States v.
Moylan, 417 F. 2d 1002 (4th Cir. 1969), at p. 1008.

Similarly, Dickson J. in his reasons for
judgment in the present case correctly underlines the fact that a utilitarian
balancing of the benefits of

[Page 275]

obeying the law as opposed to disobeying it
cannot possibly represent a legitimate principle against which to measure the
legality of an action since any violation of right permitted to be justified on
such a utilitarian calculus does not, in Dickson J.’s words, “fit[s] well with
the judicial function”. The maximization of social utility may well be a goal
of legislative policy but it is not part of the judicial task of delineating
right and wrong. The case of Southwark London Borough Council v. Williams, [1971]
Ch. 734 (C.A.), affords an appropriate illustration. In raising a defence
of necessity to a charge of trespass the defendants implicitly argued that a
violation of the rights of the property owner was justified because of the
maximized social utility achieved by their using the property in that otherwise
the defendants would remain homeless and the property unused. Lord Justice
Megaw recognized that it was no part of the adjudicator’s task either to
maximize utility or distribute scarce resources on some criterion of merit as
demanded by the defendants since the distribution of society’s resources is a
political process that must be accomplished by a distributive mechanism
encompassing the entire policy. Lord Denning pointed out that if such claims
became a matter of right for an adjudicative body to determine and enforce, the
very notion of right would be undermined. He said at p. 744: “If
homelessness were once admitted as a defence to trespass, no one’s house could
be safe”.

Accordingly, not only can the system of positive
law not tolerate an individual opting to act in accordance with the dictates of
his conscience in the event of a conflict with legal duties, but it cannot
permit acts in violation of legal obligations to be justified on the grounds
that social utility is thereby increased. In both situations the conflicting
“duty” to which the defence arguments point is one which the court cannot take
into account as it invokes considerations external to a judicial analysis of
the Tightness or wrongness of the impugned

[Page 276]

act. As Lord Coleridge succinctly put it in Dudley
and Stephens, supra, at p. 287: “Who is to be the judge of this sort
of necessity?”

On the other hand, in some circumstances defence
counsel may be able to point to a conflicting duty which courts can and do
recognize. For example, one may break the law in circumstances where it is
necessary to rescue someone to whom one owes a positive duty of rescue (see R.
v. Walker (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 126 (Ont. Co. Ct.)), since failure to act
in such a situation may itself constitute a culpable act or omission (see R.
v. Instan, [1893] 1 Q.B. 450). Similarly, if one subscribes to the
viewpoint articulated by Laskin C.J.C. in Morgentaler, supra, and
perceives a doctor’s defence to an abortion charge as his legal obligation to
treat the mother rather than his alleged ethical duty to perform an
unauthorized abortion, then the defence may be invoked without violating the
prohibition enunciated by Dickson J. in Morgentaler against choosing a
non-legal duty over a legal one.

It must be acknowledged, however, that on the
existing state of the law the defence of necessity as justification would not
be available to the person who rescues a stranger since the absence of a legal
duty to rescue strangers reduces such a case to a conflict of a legal with a
purely ethical duty. Such an act of rescue may be one deserving of no
punishment and, indeed, deserving of praise, but it is nevertheless a culpable
act if the law is violated in the process of the rescue.

As Professor E.J. Weinrib has most astutely
pointed out, rescue scenarios often represent the mirror image of necessity
scenarios; to acknowledge necessity as a justification premised on the

[Page 277]

discharge of the conflicting duty to rescue a
stranger could, without much stretch of the imagination, be turned around so as
to enable a potential rescuee to assert a right to be rescued by any stranger
(Weinrib, “The Case for a Duty to Rescue”, (1980) 90 Yale L.J. 247, at pp.
273-74). By way of illustration, in the classic torts case of Vincent v.
Lake Erie Transportation Co., 124 N.W. 221 (Minn. 1910), it was held that a
ship owner was right in helping himself to the use of a dock owner’s property
during a storm, thus invoking the defence of necessity to a charge of trespass
to the dock. The argument was premised on the notion of conflicting legal
duties and was allowed to succeed in large part due to a previous ruling in Ploof
v. Putnam, 71 A. 188 (Vt. S.C. 1908), in which a dock owner in similar
circumstances was held liable to a ship owner for refusing to grant the ship
access to the dock during a storm. The combined effect of the two cases may be
said to turn the altruistic action into a coercive one in that the rescuer is
not only given a valid justification but the rescuee is perceived as having an
enforceable right. For this reason the common law has refrained from
enunciating either an extended duty to rescue or an expansive right of
necessity. In such circumstances “[t]here may be a moral duty to… [perform a
rescue], but it is not practicable to make it a legal duty” (Home Office v.
Dorset Yacht Co., [1970] A.C. 1004, per Lord Reid at p. 1027).
Rather, persons in need of aid from unknown passersby have been left to “be
relieved by the charitable and the good” (per Lord Denning in Southwark
London Borough Council, supra, at p. 744).

In similar fashion the ethical considerations of
the “charitable and the good” must be kept analytically distinct from duties
imposed by law. Accordingly, where necessity is invoked as a justification for
violation of the law, the justification must, in my view, be restricted to
situations where

[Page 278]

the accused’s act constitutes the discharge of a
duty recognized by law. The justification is not, however, established simply
by showing a conflict of legal duties. The rule of proportionality is central
to the evaluation of a justification premised on two conflicting duties since
the defence rests on the rightfulness of the accused’s choice of one over the
other.

As the facts before the Court in the present
case do not involve a conflict of legal duties it is unnecessary to discuss in
detail how a court should go about assessing the relative extent of two evils.
Suffice it to say that any such assessment must respect the notion of right
upon which justification is based. The assessment cannot entail a mere
utilitarian calculation of, for example, lives saved and deaths avoided in the
aggregate but must somehow attempt to come to grips with the nature of the
rights and duties being assessed. This would seem to be consistent with Lord Coleridge’s
conclusion that necessity can provide no justification for the taking of a
life, such an act representing the most extreme form of rights violation. As
discussed above, if any defence for such a homicidal act is to succeed, it
would have to be framed as an excuse grounded on self-preservation. It could
not possibly be declared by the Court to be rightful. By contrast, the
justification analysis would seem to support those cases in which fulfilment of
the legal duty to save persons entrusted to one’s care is preferred over the
lesser offences of trespass or petty theft: see Mouse’s Case (1608), 12
Co. Rep. 63; Ch. corr., Amiens, April 22, 1898, Ménard’s Case, S.
1899.2.1. The crucial question for the justification defence is whether the
accused’s act can be said to represent a furtherance of or a detraction from
the principle of the universality of rights.

In summary, it seems to me that the category of
“normative involuntariness” into which an act done in the interests of
self-preservation falls is characterized not by the literal voluntariness of
the act but by its unpunishable nature. As such, the act may be exempted from
culpability if it arose in a life-threatening situation of necessity. Where,

[Page 279]

however, a defence by way of excuse is premised
on compassion for the accused or on a perceived failure to achieve a desired
instrumental end of punishment, the judicial response must be to fashion an
appropriate sentence but to reject the defence as such. The only conceptual
premise on which necessity as an excuse could rest is the inherent
impossibility of a court’s responding in any way to an act which, although
wrongful, was the one act which any rational person would commit.

Where the defence of necessity is invoked as a
justification the issue is simply whether the accused was right in pursuing the
course of behaviour giving rise to the charge. Thus, where the act otherwise
constitutes a criminal offence (i.e. it embodies both mens rea and
the actus reus) the accused must show that he operated under a
conflicting legal duty which made his seemingly wrongful act right. But such
justification must be premised on a right or duty recognized by law. This
excludes conduct attempted to be justified on the ground of an ethical duty
internal to the conscience of the accused as well as conduct sought to be
justified on the basis of a perceived maximization of social utility resulting
from it. Rather, the conduct must stem from the accused’s duty to satisfy his
legal obligations and to respect the principle of the universality of rights.

I would dismiss the appeals.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Defences—Second degree
murder—Self defence and provocation—Excessive force—Party intoxicated—Whether
or not qualified defence of excessive force in self-defence available to reduce
charge—Whether or not trial judge’s charge as to qualified defence of
provocation adequate—Whether or not intoxication relevant to
self-defence—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, ss. 34, 212(a).

The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld
appellant’s conviction of second degree murder for the fatal stabbing of his
paramour. Appellant, believing that she intended to kill him when she charged
at him with a knife, tried to stop her and killed her in the ensuing “tussle”.
Both were intoxicated. The following issues arose from the Court of Appeal’s
judgment: (1) whether or not the trial judge ought to direct the jury to a
verdict of manslaughter in circumstances where the accused acted in
self-defence but had used excessive force; (2) whether or not the trial judge’s
charge with respect to the qualified defence of provocation was adequate; and
(3) whether or not the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury to
consider the accused’s intoxication when they decided whether he had acted in
self-defence within the meaning of s. 34 of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The defence of self-defence fails on a
finding of excessive force; the trial judge therefore did not need to direct
the jury to a verdict of manslaughter in those circumstances. The trial judge’s
charge on the qualified defence of provocation was adequate for the jury could
not have been misled by the portion of the charge in question when it is read
in the context of the whole charge on provocation. The trial judge did not err
in his charge to the jury on self‑defence. The defence accorded an
accused by s. 34(1) is not available where the jury

[Page 397]

finds, as it did in this case, that the
accused intentionally used force to cause death. The accused may be found to
have acted in self-defence within the meaning of s. 34(2) even if he were
mistaken in his apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm or if he
mistakenly believed he could not preserve himself from death or grievous bodily
harm otherwise than by the force he used. His apprehension, however, must be
reasonable and his belief based on reasonable grounds. The relevance of
intoxication under s. 34(2) is eliminated and the defence is available to an
intoxicated person if the accused’s perception meets this objective standard.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 146, dismissing an appeal from a conviction
for second degree murder. Appeal dismissed.

Bruce Durno, for the appellant.

John C. Pearson, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal, brought with leave
of this Court, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reasons
for judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Arnup on behalf of that Court, dismissing
the appeal of the accused from the verdict of a jury which had found him guilty
of second degree murder in the killing of the paramour with whom he had shared
an apartment in Toronto.

The facts of this case are not seriously in
dispute and the sordid circumstances which directly preceded the killing have
been so fully and accurately analyzed in the reasons for judgment of
Mr. Justice Arnup that, in my opinion, it is unnecessary to repeat them in
detail for the purposes of disposing of this appeal.

The appellant stands charged that he:

[Page 398]

…on or about the 13th day of May in the
year 1979 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District
of York murdered one Eileen Gertrude Fraser, and thereby committed second
degree murder, contrary to the Criminal Code.

There is no doubt, nor is it denied, that the
said Eileen Fraser came to her death as a result of three blows from a sharp
knife in the hands of the appellant. The events immediately preceding the
stabbing are best described in the appellant’s own evidence from which the
following excerpt is reproduced in the reasons for judgment of the Court of
Appeal ((1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 146, at pp. 150-51):

She was coming out here and she has got
this knife and this look you wouldn’t believe it, the look in her eyes, she was
coming at me and she was charging me fast.

Q. Was she saying anything?

A. Nothing. Not a word. Just coming at me.

Q. What did you do?

A. All I could see was this, the flash of
the knife, that look in her eyes, and tried to bang it away, and I just lashed
out, tried to hit her.

Q. Did you realize at the time you were
carrying anything or were you carrying anything?

A. I just, just wanted to stop her, that is
all. That knife. I just thought she was going to kill me… Just like this, she
turned again. For no reason. No reason. No rhyme or reason. I thought… I
thought and thought and thought what have I said? What have I done? What could
bring this on? And there I am. There she is.

Q. You said you lashed out at her. What do you
mean by that?

A. Just tried to get rid—tried to get the
knife away from me and hit her at the same time. I just—I just hit. I don’t
know, instinct, it is not too clear. Everything was so fast. Just tussling and
that was it then and there she was.

Q. Did you intend to kill her?

A. Certainly not. I loved that woman and…

On cross-examination:

Q. She came out. Was she screaming at you
as she came out the door?

[Page 399]

A. No, she wasn’t screaming—just charged
me—not a word, nothing.

Q. With this knife in her hand?

A. Just came at me.

Q. What was your first reaction?

A. I can’t very well say it here.

It is to be remembered that this incident was
the culmination of some days of verbal abuse between the parties conducted in
loud voices so that the neighbours overheard it and noted that it was largely
conducted by Eileen Fraser who, a short time before, had called out to the
appellant, for no apparent reason, saying: “You son of a bitch, you rotten
bastard”. This example of abuse was later cited by the appellant as a
provocative factor contributing to the state of mind which caused him to “lash
out” at the victim in what turned out to be the fatal assault which gave rise
to the present charge. I am satisfied, however, that there was a sufficient
lapse of time between this abuse and the stabbing so that the two cannot be
related and in any event, the crudity of the abusive insult appears to have
been consistent with the daily conversational exchange between the parties and
accordingly would not necessarily give rise to any violent reaction on the
appellant’s part.

The main defences advanced by the appellant were
provocation and self-defence and this is reflected in the following grounds of
appeal, pursuant to which leave to this Court was granted, which read as follows:

1. Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario err in law in holding
that the Learned Trial Judge was not required to direct the jury that if the
jury found that the Appellant had acted in self-defence but had used excessive
force in self-defence that he was guilty of manslaughter?

2. Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario
err in law in holding that the Learned Trial Judge had adequately instructed
the jury with respect to the qualified defence of provocation?

3. Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario err in law in holding
that the Learned Trial Judge had related the consumption of alcohol to the
subjective element of self-defence?

[Page 400]

At the outset of his judgment in the Court of
Appeal Mr. Justice Arnup had occasion to consider the first of these
grounds, at p. 148, saying:

The… most substantial ground is the failure
of the trial Judge to instruct the jury “that if the appellant acted with
excessive force in self-defence he was guilty of manslaughter”. This submission
raises the question whether there exists in Canada a qualified defence arising from the use of excessive force in
self-defence, leading to a verdict of manslaughter in circumstances which would
otherwise result in a conviction for murder.

This question has been raised and discussed
in two cases in this Court, but it has not been necessary previously to decide
whether this qualified defence should be recognized in Ontario.

Mr. Justice Arnup then proceeds with a
thorough review of the relevant cases in various provincial courts and
concludes with an endorsement of the law stated by Martin J.A. in R. v.
Trecroce (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 202 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 211, where he said:

Where excessive force in self-defence has
been recognized as a substantive doctrine, it would appear that the following
conditions, at least, are necessary to give rise to that qualified defence:

(a) The accused must have been justified in
using some force to defend himself against an attack, real or reasonably
apprehended.

(b) The accused must have honestly believed
that he was justified in using the force that he did.

(c) The force used was excessive only
because it exceeded what the accused could reasonably have considered
necessary.

In adopting the reasoning exemplified in the Trecroce
case the Court of Appeal also followed the judgment of Martin J.A. in R.
v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.), and found the same
reasoning to be supported by the judgment of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in R. v. Basarabas and Spek (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 13. In
conformity with this line of reasoning, Mr. Justice Arnup concluded on
behalf of the Court of Appeal in the present case, at p. 160:

[Page 401]

In the light of the decisions of the Courts
of Appeal of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, and upon consideration
of the careful review of the subject by Martin J.A. in Campbell, supra and
Trecroce, supra, I have reached the conclusion that the doctrine of
excessive force in self-defence rendering the accused guilty only of
manslaughter instead of murder should be recognized in Ontario.

In my opinion the decisions to which
Mr. Justice Arnup refers in this passage are undoubtedly supportive of the
conclusion which he reached and consistent also with the then widely recognized
view of the effect of “the doctrine of excessive force” in a murder case.
Mr. Justice Arnup’s unanimous opinion was delivered on March 9, 1982;
however, the same question was differently decided in this Court in the case of
R. v. Faid which was subject of a unanimous judgment delivered by
Mr. Justice Dickson on March 1, 1983 and now reported at [1983] 1 S.C.R.
265, where he said in the course of his reasons for judgment, at p. 271:

The position of the Alberta Court of Appeal
that there is a “half-way” house outside s. 34 of the Code is, in my
view, inapplicable to the Canadian codified system of criminal law, it lacks
any recognizable basis in principle, would require prolix and complicated jury
charges and would encourage juries to reach compromise verdicts to the
prejudice of either the accused or the Crown. Where a killing has resulted from
the excessive use of force in self-defence the accused loses the justification
provided under s. 34. There is no partial justification open under the section.
Once the jury reaches the conclusion that excessive force has been used the
defence of self-defence has failed.

As this Court is bound by these observations it
is clear to me that, on this basis alone, the first ground of appeal should be
answered in the negative, but it is, in any event, significant that
Mr. Justice Arnup found further ground for supporting the trial judge’s
charge saying, at p. 162:

I conclude that the trial Judge in the
present case did not err in omitting to charge the jury on excessive force in
self-defence. Such a defence was not “revealed by the evidence” and was never
raised by the defence.

[Page 402]

As his second ground of appeal the appellant
challenges the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the jury upon the
qualified defence of provocation. The following language in the charge was
objected to in this Court as it was in the Ontario Court of Appeal:

You will also ask yourselves, was the
provocation such that it would have led a person with the physical and mental
condition of the accused to respond this way?

It was urged by the appellant that such language
invited the jury to wrongly consider the conduct of someone other than the
accused. I agree with Mr. Justice Arnup that although the above passage
may perhaps be open to this criticism when viewed in isolation, the jury could
not have been misled by it when it is read in the context of the whole charge
upon provocation.

The final ground of appeal advanced by the
appellant raises a challenge to the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the
jury upon the defence of self-defence as codified in subs. 34(1) and (2) of the
Criminal Code. Section 34 reads as follows:

34. (1)
Every one who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is
justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to
cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable
him to defend himself.

(2) Every one who is unlawfully assaulted
and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified
if

(a) he causes it under reasonable
apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the
assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes,
and

(b) he believes, on
reasonable and probable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from
death or grievous bodily harm.

In the appellant’s submission, the trial judge
ought to have told the jury, when instructing them under both subsections, that
they must consider the evidence of intoxication in deciding whether they were
left in reasonable doubt about whether the accused had acted within the legal
definition of self-defence.

[Page 403]

Consideration of the appellant’s argument is
complicated by the fact that a concession was made on behalf of the accused in
the court below which is described by Mr. Justice Arnup, at pp. 162-63, as
follows:

Next it was submitted that the trial judge
erred in failing to instruct the jury that the consumption of alcohol was a
factor to be taken into account in considering the subjective elements in
self-defence. The same complaint was made as to the charge on provocation. It
is conceded by counsel that the trial Judge specifically mentioned intoxication
in relation to both self-defence and provocation.

.

In my view, the charge taken as a whole was
adequate in relating intoxication to self‑defence and provocation.
[Emphasis added]

As it is possible to construe the judgment of
the Court of Appeal as depending, at least in part, upon the appellant’s
concession, I have reviewed the portion of the trial judge’s charge devoted to
self-defence and I can find no mention of the accused’s intoxication and any
relevance it might carry. The appellant withdrew his concession before this
Court and full argument was heard upon the issue from both parties.

In my view, nothing now turns upon the
concession for the following reasons. First of all, s. 34(1) is no longer
in issue in this case because the appellant admits that the jury found the
accused possessed the requisite intention for murder according to s. 212(a)
of the Criminal Code. Section 34(1) is not available to an accused
where the jury finds the force he has used was intended to cause death.

In so far as s. 34(2) is concerned, it is my
opinion the trial judge was not required to instruct the jury that the
accused’s intoxication was relevant. The only way drunkenness could arguably be
said to be relevant to s. 34(2) would be if it had induced in the accused a
mistaken appreciation of the facts which, if true, would have justified the
force he used as legitimate self-defence. In other words, it could be argued
that his intoxication is relevant if it induced him to mistakenly apprehend
death or grievous bodily harm or mistakenly

[Page 404]

believe that he could not otherwise preserve
himself from death or grievous bodily harm.

Subsection (2) of s. 34 places in issue the
accused’s state of mind at the time he caused death. The subsection can
only afford protection to the accused if he apprehended death or grievous
bodily harm from the assault he was repelling and if he believed he could not
preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm otherwise than by the force
he used. Nonetheless, his apprehension must be a reasonable one and his
belief must be based upon reasonable and probable grounds. The
subsection requires that the jury consider, and be guided by, what they
decide on the evidence was the accused’s appreciation of the situation and his
belief as to the reaction it required, so long as there exists an objectively
verifiable basis for his perception.

Since s. 34(2) places in issue the accused’s
perception of the attack upon him and the response required to meet it, the
accused may still be found to have acted in self-defence even if he was
mistaken in his perception. Reasonable and probable grounds must still exist
for this mistaken perception in the sense that the mistake must have been one
which an ordinary man using ordinary care could have made in the same
circumstances.

This statutory requirement of reasonableness is
what distinguishes the defence provided by s. 34(2) from the general law
upon mistake of fact expressed in Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2
S.C.R. 120. In the Pappajohn case it was held that an honest, but
mistaken belief in facts which, if true, would render the accused’s act
innocent was sufficient to prevent him from forming the mens rea essential
to all criminal liability; there was no legal necessity that the mistaken
belief be based upon reasonable grounds. It was accepted that intoxication
could potentially induce such a mistake of fact.

The fatal difficulty with the appellant’s
argument in this case is that although intoxication can be a factor in inducing
an honest mistake, it

[Page 405]

cannot induce a mistake which must be based upon
reasonable and probable grounds. The perspective of the reasonable man which
the language of s. 34(2) places in issue here is the objective standard the law
commonly adopts to measure a man’s conduct. A reasonable man is a man in full
possession of his faculties. In contrast, a drunken man is one whose ability to
reason and to perceive is diminished by the alcohol he has consumed.

I should not be taken as saying that the defence
under s. 34(2) can never be available to a person who is intoxicated. An
intoxicated man may hold a reasonable belief, i.e. the same belief a
sober man would form viewing the matter before him upon reasonable and probable
grounds. Where he does so, however, it is in spite of his intoxication.

The requirement of an objective basis for the
accused’s perception of the facts, whether it be mistaken or accurate,
eliminates any relevance that evidence of the accused’s intoxication might have
had to self-defence under s. 34(2). Naturally, if the accused is intoxicated,
he is not deprived of the defence provided by the subsection so long as
the objective test is met by the existence of reasonable and probable grounds
for the accused’s perception of the nature of the assault upon him and the
response required to meet it.

It follows that I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Charge to jury—Burden of
proof—Two versions of events surrounding homicide presented in
evidence—Self-defence—Misdirection—New trial ordered—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

Appellant was charged with first-degree
murder. At trial, two different versions of the circumstances surrounding the
homicide were presented in evidence: that of the accused, corroborated by his
concubine, and that of the witness for the Crown. The trial judge directed the
jury on the rules of law governing self-defence—one of the defences presented
by the accused—and told them the standard and the burden of proof on the Crown
with regard to establishing the facts which constitute the essential components
of the offence, and the standard applicable to any accused with regard to his
defence arguments. Appellant was convicted of second-degree murder and the
Court of Appeal upheld the conviction. This appeal is to determine whether the
trial judge erred in his directions to the jury.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

The trial judge erred in law on the question
of the burden of proof regarding the contradictory versions of the facts in
issue. An accused benefits from any reasonable doubt at the outset, not merely
if the two versions of the facts are equally consistent with the evidence or
valid. Moreover, the jurors are not limited to choosing between the two
versions. Even if they do not believe the accused, they cannot accept the other
version of the facts unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that
the events in fact took place in the manner in which the witness for the Crown
related them. Otherwise the accused is entitled to the finding of fact more
favourable to him provided that it is based on evidence in the record and not
mere speculation.

[Page 571]

Furthermore, the trial judge also erred in
law on the question of the burden of proof when he told the jurors that the
accused had to prove his defence of self-defence beyond all reasonable doubt.
The accused was entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt raised by the
evidence respecting this defence.

Finally, section 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code should not be applied in this case. The Crown did
not show that, if it had been directed in accordance with the law, the jury
would necessarily have brought in a verdict of guilty.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal[1],
dismissing appellant’s appeal from his conviction of second-degree murder.
Appeal allowed.

Michel Proulx and Richard Masson, for the
appellant.

Robert Lévesque, for the respondent.

English version of the judgment of the Court
delivered by

LAMER J.—In this appeal, the applicable
principles of law are well-known and are not in any way at issue. Rather, the
question is whether the trial judge erred in law in his directions to the jury,
and if so, whether his error was such that a new trial should be held. The
Court of Appeal of Quebec
considered that it should not. While agreeing with this conclusion, the Crown
is asking this Court, if necessary, to apply the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code.

Appellant killed a man named Francœur with a
rifle shot. He was charged with first-degree murder, and convicted of
second-degree murder by a jury in New Carlisle, in the Gaspé area.

The incident occurred in the apartment of the
accused’s concubine, Miss Linda Caissy. One Landry, who said he was present in
the apartment when the incident occurred, testified as to the circumstances
surrounding the homicide. According to the accused and his concubine, Landry
was not there, and they both gave the same version of the events leading to the
killing of Francœur, but one which differed from that of Landry.

[Page 572]

Appellant presented five grounds, each charging
that the judge had erred in his directions to the jury. In my opinion, the
first ground, having regard to the burden of proof in criminal proceedings,
succeeds, and requires that this Court order a new trial; it is therefore
unnecessary to deal with the others.

For reasons which it is not necessary to
elaborate, the judge had a duty, which he discharged, to direct the jurors on
the rules of law governing “self-defence”. He also had a duty, as in all cases,
to inform them of the standard and the burden of proof applicable to the Crown,
with regard to establishing the facts which constitute the essential components
of the offence, as well as the standard applicable to any accused with regard
to his defence arguments, in particular that of self-defence.

Appellant argues that he erred in law on these
questions when he dealt with the burden of proof regarding the two versions of
the incident, and regarding self-defence.

The Two Versions

After telling them they had to choose between
the two versions, the judge explained the jury’s task to them as follows:

[TRANSLATION] YOU have heard the analysis
given of the two (2) versions throughout the day, and I do not intend to repeat
it. I will simply say that in deciding how you make your choice, you must have
one thing clearly in mind: you must choose the more persuasive, the
clearer version, the one which provides a better explanation of the
facts, which is more consistent with the other facts established in the evidence.

You must keep in mind that, as the accused
has the benefit of the doubt on all the evidence, if you come to the conclusion
that the two (2) versions are equally consistent with the evidence, are
equally valid, you must give - you must accept the version more favourable to
the accused. These are the principles on which you must make your choice
between the two (2) versions.

(Emphasis added.)

With respect, this direction is in error. The
accused benefits from any reasonable doubt at the outset, not merely if “the
two (2) versions are

[Page 573]

equally consistent with the evidence, are
equally valid”. Moreover the jury does not have to choose between two versions.
It is not because they would not believe the accused that they would then have
to agree with Landry’s version. The jurors cannot accept his version, or any
part of it, unless they are satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt, having
regard to all the evidence, that the events took place in this manner;
otherwise, the accused is entitled, unless a fact has been established beyond a
reasonable doubt, to the finding of fact the most favourable to him, provided
of course that it is based on evidence in the record and not mere speculation.

Self-Defence

The judge told the jurors more than once that
the accused had the benefit of a reasonable doubt at all times, and that the
Crown had a duty to prove each of the component parts of the crime. Dealing
with self-defence, he told them:

[TRANSLATION] I should tell you that here
too, on self-defence, as on all the other defences which he may present, the
accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt in the event you are undecided
whether any one component of the crime has been established.

Further, he said:

[TRANSLATION] In the event you conclude
that the version of Nadeau and that of Linda Caissy should be accepted, you
must examine self-defence: if you accept self-defence, you may bring in a
verdict of acquittal.

In the event you conclude that
self-defence was not established beyond all doubt,
then you must examine the evidence to determine whether, at the time he fired
this shot in the particular circumstances of the case, the accused could have
formed—was capable of forming the specific intent of murder.

(Emphasis added.)

Although the jury requested and received further
directions on other aspects of the law applicable in the circumstances, this
direction was the final one given by the judge on self‑defence. With
respect, it is in error. Any reasonable doubt as regards his being in self‑defence
raised by the evidence enures to the accused, and he certainly

[Page 574]

does not have to show beyond all reasonable
doubt that he was placed in a position of self‑defence.

In all fairness to the judge, I assume he meant
to tell the jurors that, if they were satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt
that the accused was not in a position of self-defence, they should not
thereupon immediately conclude that he was guilty, but should consider whether
he “was capable of forming the specific intent of murder”. I feel certain that this
is what the judge intended and thought he was telling the jury, since the judge
in question is one of experience and great ability. Unfortunately, this is not
what he said, and I can only conclude that the jurors could have been given the
wrong impression as to the burdens of proof; particularly with regard to the
preliminary choice which they could make, and might even have been required to
make, of “the more persuasive … version”.

The Crown suggested that this Court apply
s. 613(1)(b)(iii). I have read the evidence in the record, and I am
of the opinion that the Crown did not show the Court that, if it had been
properly instructed in law, the jury would necessarily have brought in a
verdict of second‑degree murder, as it did.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appeal, and order a new trial on a charge
of second-degree murder.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Res judicata—Issue
estoppel—Separate trials for commission of two robberies—Accused’s statements
ruled inadmissible at first trial—Whether Crown estopped from relitigating the
question of admissibility of accused’s statements at second trial—Whether
“issue estoppel” should extend to findings on voir dire.

Appellant was charged with two counts of
robbery and tried separately on each count. At the first trial, following a voir
dire, statements made by the accused were declared inadmissible and the
accused was acquitted. The second trial took place before a different judge.
Despite the accused’s objections that the Crown was estopped from relitigating
the issue of voluntariness of the statements, the trial judge held a voir
dire and admitted the statements. The accused was subsequently convicted.
His appeal from conviction and sentence was dismissed.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The Crown is not estopped from relitigating
the admissibility of a statement made by an accused and ruled inadmissible by a
judge holding a voir dire in a previous criminal proceeding. In the
absence of a right of appeal for findings on voir dire held during a
preliminary inquiry and in the absence of an autonomous appeal for findings on voir
dire held during trial, it is not desirable to extend the doctrine of res
judicata to such findings and to depart from the traditional approach of
the doctrine in the field of interlocutory findings.

John James, for the appellant.

Peter Martin, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Is the Crown estopped from relitigating
the admissibility of a statement made by the accused which was ruled upon as
inadmissible by a judge holding a voir dire in a previous criminal
proceeding?

That is the issue raised by the facts of this
case.

The Facts

Charged with two counts of robbery in the same
indictment the accused moved successfully for severance. The trial of the first
of the two counts resulted in a directed verdict of acquittal. Indeed, the only
evidence tendered by the Crown was an alleged adoption through nods and
statements of a statement made by a third party. Following a voir dire the
statements were declared inadmissible. The trial for the other count took place
before a different judge, who, over the accused’s objections based on
“estoppel”, held a voir dire and admitted the statements as free and
voluntary. The accused was convicted. At the preliminary inquiry the magistrate,
subsequent to a voir dire, had found the statements admissible.

The Court of Appeal

The judgment of the Court of Appeal of Alberta (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 538, was
written by Moir J.A. and, as usual, is a thorough exposition of the law and
analysis of its application to the facts of the case at bar.

[Page 557]

At first he acknowledged that “issue estoppel”
is part of the criminal law, any doubt there may have existed on the matter
having been settled by the unanimous decision of this Court in Gushue v. The
Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 798.

He then referred to “issue estoppel” as being
derived from the concept of res judicata, and said that it “originates
in the “estoppel per rem judicatam” “aspect of res judicata. As
regards that particular aspect, he quoted Spencer Bower, The Doctrine of Res
Judicata, 2nd ed., by A.K. Turner, London, Butterworths, 1969, that
identifies the supportive policy considerations (referred to as “theories”) of
the doctrine as being “the general interest of the community in the termination
of disputes” (expedit reipublicae ut sit finis litium) and “the right of
the individual to be protected from vexatious multiplication of suits and
prosecutions” (nemo debet bis vexari pro uno et eodem delicto).

Moir J.A., having identified the particular
aspect of the doctrine of res judicata he felt applicable to the case at
bar as being “estoppel per rem judicatam” and its two
aforementioned supportive policy considerations, went on to quote with approval
Spencer Bower as to the constituent elements of estoppel per rem judicatam, as
follows (at p. 542):

The necessary constituents of estoppel
per rem judicatam

19 Any party who is desirous of setting up res
judicata by way of estoppel, whether he is relying on such res judicata as
a bar to his opponent’s claim, or as the foundation of his own, and who has
taken the preliminary steps required in order to qualify him for that purpose,
must establish all the constituent elements of an estoppel of this description,
as already indicated in the general proposition enunciated at the commencement
of this chapter. That is to say, the burden is on him of establishing (except
as to any of them which may be expressly or impliedly admitted) each and every
of the following:

(i). that the alleged judicial decision was
what in law is deemed such;

(ii) that the particular judicial decision
relied upon was in fact pronounced, as alleged;

(iii) that the judicial tribunal
pronouncing the decision had competent jurisdiction in that behalf;

[Page 558]

(iv) that the judicial decision was final;

(v) that the judicial decision was, or
involved, a determination of the same question as that sought to be
controverted in the litigation in which the estoppel is raised;

(vi) that the parties to the judicial
decision, or their privies, were the same persons as the parties to the
proceeding in which the estoppel is raised, or their privies, or that the
decision was conclusive in rem.

He then found as lacking, and fatal to
appellant’s case, two of those constituent elements: “Finality”, and “Identity
of issues”.

On “finality” he said (at p. 543):

From this arises the related issue as to
whether or not interlocutory matters can found an issue estoppel. It seems in
principle they can do so but only for a limited purpose. By its very definition,
an interlocutory issue is not a final judgment. However, a decision on the
interlocutory question may be final and conclusive for the purpose of the
proceedings in which it is adjudicated. Outside of those proceedings, however,
it cannot bind the parties because it was not a final determination of any
issue essential to the verdict.

On “identity” the essence of what he said is in
the following passage of his judgment (at p. 544):

Clearly, the key is to determine whether
the issue sought to be estopped is fundamental to the prior decision. This
contemplates the premise that the prior decision could not have been obtained
without the point in issue being resolved in favour of the party urging the
estoppel. Collateral matters cannot found an estoppel. Only fundamental matters
lead to that result.

and later on, when concluding, he commented on
both elements as follows (at pp. 548-49):

Applying the tests of finality and identity
of issue of this case is all that remains to be done. On the surface it appears
that the ruling made at the earlier trial cannot be challenged; it is to this
extent final and conclusive. However, it is clear that the ruling cannot apply
to the ruling made by the Provincial Court Judges: Kaufman, Admissibility of
Confessions, 3rd ed. (1979), p. 63. Nor

[Page 559]

can the ruling of one trial Judge bind
another where a new trial is ordered: R. v. Hilson (1958), 121 C.C.C.
139 at p. 142, 15 D.L.R. (2d) 725 at p. 727, 28 C.R. 262 at
p. 266. This is so even though, at the first trial the statement was ruled
admissible and the Court of Appeal found nothing wrong with the ruling. This
appears to me to say that it is for the trial Judge to determine admissibility
on the evidence before him and he is not bound by the interlocutory rulings made
at an earlier trial even though the statement is the same.

Further, the identity of issue position is
clearly fatal to the appellant’s position. The issue sought to be estopped must
be clearly and unequivocally decided by the Court in the first proceeding as a
fundamental step in the logic of the decision. The appellant relies upon the
specific finding of the first trial Judge where he specifically held the
statement was not voluntary and therefore inadmissible. It is true the issue on
the voir dire was identical. That is a far cry from establishing that
the decision of the first trial Judge was fundamental to the acquittal. As it
is put by Spencer Bower and Turner (para. 211): “Is the determination… so
fundamental to the substantive decision that the latter cannot stand without
the former”.

The substantive decision is the verdict of
acquittal. The interim ruling merely decided that the statement was not
admissible. It did not decide any substantive rights. It did not decide an
issue of fact or law fundamental to the guilt or innocence of the appellant on
the first robbery charge.

If one approaches the finding upon a voir
dire on the admissibility of statements made by an accused as if it were
the usual interlocutory finding on the admissibility of evidence, where
relevancy and the probative value of facts are central to the determination,
then I agree that such a decision would never enjoy the finality even less the
identity required to bring into play the doctrine of issue estoppel. Indeed,
the circumstances considered by the judge in deciding the admissibility of a
particular piece of evidence are directly related to the facts to be proved in
support of the charge and to the nature of the evidence being adduced.
Admissibility of such evidence is to be

[Page 560]

determined in the light of the factual setting
of each case. Of course there cannot be estoppel and, on this, I cannot but
agree with Moir J.A. But there is, I respectfully submit, a great difference
between such determinations and those where the finding is unrelated to
innocence and guilt and the circumstances being considered have nothing
whatsoever to do with the material or mental elements of the alleged crime.
Such is the case when, for example, the Crown wishes to adduce evidence
electromagnetically obtained (s. 178.11 Cr.C.); as will possibly be the
case for certain findings on evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . And such is also the case for voir dires
on “confessions”.

A voir dire on the admissibility of a statement
made by an accused has been properly coined “a trial within a trial”. (See for
example, Fred Kaufman, The Admissibility of Confessions, 3rd ed.,
Toronto, The Carswell Co. Ltd., 1979, at p. 35.)

The issue is the admissibility of the
statement irrespective of its content. The trial of that issue is held by a
trier other than the trier of fact, and this is so even though they may be the
same physical person: the judge holding the voir dire is acting in a
different capacity than when considering the statement’s probative value as a
trier of fact. The facts relevant to the issue are foreign to the issue of
guilt. They concern the circumstances leading up to and of the making of the
statement and have nothing to do with those of the alleged offence. The accused
may testify and his cross-examination is limited to those facts, and the Crown
cannot ask questions pertaining to the offence, though some judgments have held
that he may, for the sole purpose of assessing his credibility, be asked
whether his statement was true. In fact it is conceivable, were the law to
permit so (and I think in many ways desirable in terms of saving time,
specially that of jurors and witnesses), that the voir dire be held
outside the proceedings dealing with the offence, even before. Though the
state-

[Page 561]

ment itself is tendered as relevant to
innocence or guilt, its admissibility, based on the circumstances surrounding
its being made, is a completely autonomous question. And for that reason, lack
of finality or of identity with an issue necessarily a component of the finding
of guilt or of innocence is to me, with respect, of no relevance in deciding
this case.

The question to be now addressed is,
whether or not the particular nature of these interlocutory findings would justify
an extension of the doctrine so as to apply to them. They have not yet been put
within the reach of the doctrine by most of the common law jurisdictions that
have extended issue estoppel to criminal law (save the States of Illinois in People
v. Williams, 322 N.E. 2d 461 (1975), and Michigan, in People v. Gray, 222 N.W.
2d 515 (1974), and People v. Mann, 280 N.W. 2d 577 (1979), and one
decision in Canada, R. v. Bellisimo (1980), 4 W.C.B. 453 (Ont. Co. Ct.).

Much has been written and said on issue
estoppel and res judicata.

Although res judicata has, since the
decision of this Court in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729,
become a term of art in Canada,
I will refer to it in its broadest and traditional sense.

A clear exposition on the matter may be
found in Martin L. Friedland’s Double Jeopardy, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1969, and more recently in Jacques Fortin’s Preuve
pénale, Montréal, Éditions Thémis Inc., 1984, and need not be repeated here
at any length.

In short, res judicata means
“something that has clearly been decided” and is the reason given by the Romans
and the legal systems stemming from theirs, such as ours, to a doctrine that
strives to achieve the following:

[Page 562]

Having regard to fairness to an accused

(a) that a person not be put in jeopardy once
again after an acquittal (autrefois acquit);

(b) that a person not be punished twice for the
same conduct (autrefois convict and the Kienapple principle);

and, having regard to the efficiency and
reputation of the judicial system,

(c) that matters that have been fully litigated
between parties be not reopened, over and over;

(d) that the scandal of conflicting decisions be
avoided.

This case illustrates the undesirability of
relitigation, as being costly and time consuming, and prone to the risk of
conflicting decisions.

There is no doubt in my mind that if there is a
bar to an extension of the doctrine of res judicata to rulings on
confession voir dires, it does not stem from principle or logic. It is
desirable that we avoid relitigation of the issue and, as in this case, the
risk of conflicting decisions. And, if a voir dire is “a trial within a
trial” logic commands such an extension unless there are overriding reasons not
to do so. In fact, I even think the doctrine could be extended in such cases
beyond its actual application to criminal matters so as to introduce
“mutuality” (i.e. a finding being a bar not only to the Crown but to the
accused when adverse to his interest). Indeed, mutuality of issue estoppel has
been excluded in criminal law because of the Crown’s burden of proving in each
and every case all of the elements of the offence. But as I have already said,
the facts relevant to the finding and the finding itself on such a voir dire
are foreign to the facts to be proved by the Crown as regards the
commission of the offence by the accused; therefore, what would inure to the
Crown through “mutuality” of the finding in no way relaxes its burden of
proving facts.

[Page 563]

Be that as it may, I do not think it desirable
that we extend the doctrine, with or without “mutuality”, to such findings.

To begin with, I cannot see the doctrine develop
so as to include the findings on the voir dires held at preliminaries.
Indeed, when considering the voir dire per se, “the trial” within a “trial”
is no less a “trial” because it is held in the course of a preliminary. But
there is one major reason against the extension: there is no appeal, and error
is generally subject to limited review. This is sufficient to deal with that
aspect.

At the trial level, the situation as regards
appeal is not much better. Though the voir dire is in a sense
autonomous, it is nevertheless totally dependent upon the main trial for its
appeal process. Let us postulate error on the part of the judge in determining
the admissibility of the statement. If the statement is wrongly excluded, even
through error of law, but the accused nevertheless convicted, benefit of the
doctrine of res judicata would then be founded upon an error of law
beyond the reach of redress. Indeed, the Crown has no appeal from that
conviction. Similarly, if the statement is excluded through error of fact, and
the accused acquitted, again the erroneous finding is beyond the reach of the
courts as the Crown’s right to appeal is limited to matters of law.

If mutuality is introduced, matters are even
worse. A statement wrongfully admitted in proceedings resulting in an acquittal
would follow and prejudice an accused throughout all of his other trials.

If we exclude mutuality, all findings at
preliminary inquiries and for the same reason those findings at trial that are
beyond the reach of review through appeal, the doctrine could then only find
application when the statement is excluded, the accused acquitted and the
exclusion is based on an error of law. This offers very little payload in terms
of avoiding relitigation and noth-

[Page 564]

ing or little as regards avoiding the danger of
conflicting decisions.

The change to the law being a major departure
from the traditional approach of the doctrine in the field of interlocutory
findings, I think there is a burden placed upon whomsoever invites the change
to satisfy this Court that there is clear advantage to the administration of
justice in developing the law in this direction.

In the absence of an autonomous appeal of such
findings, I do not think that appellant has made that case.

I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Causing a fire—Proof of
offence—Charge of causing a fire by violating law in place where fire caused
death or damage—Statutory presumption of fire being wilfully set if
non-compliance with fire-prevention or fire-safety law—Whether or not
presumption applicable—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 392(1)(a),(b),
(2).

Appellant, the owner of a Toronto boarding house which burned down
causing four deaths, failed to comply with the City’s fire prevention by-law
and was charged with causing a fire under s. 392(1)(b) of the Code. The
Crown alleged that the loss of life would not have occurred if appellant had
complied with the by-law. The trial judge ruled, as a preliminary matter, that
the “deeming” provision of s. 392(2) did not apply to a charge under s. 392(1)(b).
Appellant was then arraigned and, as the Crown had planned to rely on the
“deeming” provision, was acquitted in the absence of evidence. The Ontario Court
of Appeal reversed the trial judge’s ruling and ordered a new trial. This
appeal was heard without any adjudication on the merits.

Held (Estey J.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Ritchie,
Beetz, Chouinard and Wilson JJ.: Section 392(2) should not be construed as
applying to s. 392(1)(b) since violation of a fire-prevention or
fire-safety law (as provided for under s. 392(2)), is already covered by s.
392(1)(b) as a violation of any law in force where the fire occurred. To
eliminate the distinction between fire-prevention and fire-safety laws and any
other kinds of laws would defeat the clear intention of Parliament.
Section 392(2), however, clearly extended s. 392(1)(a) from acts or
omissions of the accused which were a direct cause of fire to circumstances in
which the accused’s acts or omissions were an indirect cause of fire

[Page 527]

or of resultant death or destruction,
provided a fire-prevention or fire-safety law had been violated.

The “plain meaning” rule of statutory
interpretation supports an application of s. 392(2) to s. 392(1)(a) only
as wilfulness is relevant only under that paragraph and not under
s. 392(1)(b).

Per Dickson
C.J. and Lamer J.: An ambiguity that persists after an analysis through the
application of the canons of construction must be resolved in favour of the
liberty of the subject. This rule applies not only to enactments creating
offences but also to certain enactments curtailing the subject’s liberty in
some other way and to enactments relieving in part the Crown of its usual
evidentiary burden. Since the effect of s. 392(2) is to relieve the Crown in
part of its traditional evidentiary burden and given the persistent ambiguity
of the scope of this section, s. 392(2) must be given an interpretation
favouring the liberty of the subject and so be limited to a charge under s.
392(1)(a).

v. Alter (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 381, applied; R. v. Rist (1976),

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 330, allowing an appeal from an acquittal by
Graburn Co. Ct. J. and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed, Estey J.
dissenting.

Derek A. Danielson, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

The reasons of Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. were
delivered by

LAMER J.—I have read the reasons of my colleague
Madame Justice Wilson and agree that s. 392(2) does not apply to a charge laid
under s. 392(1)(b). Accordingly, I agree that this appeal

[Page 528]

should be allowed and the trial judge’s
acquittal restored.

A reading of s. 392 discloses an ambiguity that
both Martin J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal and my colleague attempt to
resolve by seeking to identify the purpose of the relevant legislation.

I must admit, with respect, that, while I find
merit in both approaches I find none sufficiently compelling to permit me to
state with any certainty which, in my humble opinion, is the right one.

Given the ambiguity which persists after my own
analysis of the section through an application of the canons of
construction of statutes, I resolve the ambiguity by resorting to the rule
enunciated by Cartwright J. (as he then was) in R. v. Robinson, [1951]
S.C.R. 522, where he said, at p. 536:

In my opinion if the words of an enactment
which is relied upon as creating a new offence are ambiguous, the ambiguity
must be resolved in favour of the liberty of the subject, but whether or not
such ambiguity exists is to be determined after calling in aid the rules of
construction.

See also Marcotte v. Deputy Attorney General
for Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108, at p. 115.

This rule does not apply only to enactments
creating offences, but also to certain enactments curtailing in some other way
the subject’s liberty, as was the case in Marcotte, supra, and to
enactments relieving in part the Crown of its usual evidentiary burden. Such
was the case in R. v. Noble, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 632. In that case, the
Court was called upon to interpret s. 237(1)(f) of the Criminal
Code, which creates a presumption in favour of the Crown following the
production of a certificate of an analyst in impaired driving cases.

Ritchie J., speaking for the Court, addressed
the matter as follows, at p. 638:

The effect of s. 237 both before and after
the amendment is to establish the conditions under which the certificate of a
qualified technician is admissible, without further evidence, as proof of the
proportion of

[Page 529]

alcohol in the blood of the accused. These
provisions are obviously designed to assist the Crown in proving its case, and
as they serve to restrict the normal rights of the accused to cross-examination
and saddle him with the burden of proving that the certificate does not
accurately reflect his blood alcohol content at the time of the alleged
offence, they are to be strictly construed and, where ambiguous, interpreted in
favour of the accused.

The effect of s. 392(2) is also to relieve the
Crown of part of its traditional evidentiary burden in criminal prosecutions,
and should, given this persistent ambiguity as to the scope of its application,
be given the interpretation which favours “the liberty of the subject”, which
requires that its application be limited to a charge under s.392(1)(a).

The judgment of Ritchie, Beetz, Chouinard and
Wilson JJ. was delivered by

WILSON J.—This appeal raises a pure question of
statutory interpretation of s. 392 of the Criminal Code. The
section reads as follows:

392. (1)
Every one who causes a fire

(a) wilfully, or

(b) by violating a law in force in
the place where the fire occurs,

is, if the fire results in loss of life or
destruction of or damage to property, guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for five years.

(2) For the purposes of this section, the
person who owns, occupies or controls property in which a fire that results in
loss of life or destruction of or damage to property originates or occurs shall
be deemed wilfully to have caused the fire if he has failed to comply with any
law that is intended to prevent fires or that requires the property to be
equipped with apparatus for the purpose of extinguishing fires or for the
purpose of enabling persons to escape in the event of fire, and if it is
established that the fire, or the loss of life, or the whole or any substantial
portion of the destruction of or damage to the property would not have occurred
if he had complied with the law.

[Page 530]

The facts

The facts giving rise to the problem are that
the appellant, the owner of a boarding house in Toronto, failed to comply with the City’s fire prevention by-law with
respect to fire extinguishers, smoke detectors and fire escapes. The boarding
house burned down on October 5, 1980 and four people died in the fire. The
Crown alleged that this loss of life would not have occurred if the appellant
had complied with the by-law.

The appellant appeared before Graburn Co. Ct. J.
charged on the following indictment:

SAEID ABBAS stands charged that he, on or
about the 5th day of October in the year 1980, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, caused a fire at 24
Caroline Avenue by violating a law in force at 24 Caroline Avenue, Toronto,
Ontario, to wit: City of Toronto By-Law #73/68, which fire resulted in the
death of Frederick James Narapecka and Ernie Cullen and Arthur Burton and
Herbert Rose, contrary to the Criminal Code.

Rather than adducing proof of the Crown’s case
and then arguing the legal issues on a defence motion to dismiss, the parties
requested the court to rule as a preliminary matter on the legal issue of
whether the “deeming” provision of s. 392(2) of the Criminal Code applies
on a charge under s. 392(1)(b). Although Judge Graburn was not completely
satisfied with this procedure, he complied with the request and, following the
decision of Borins Co. Ct. J. in R. v. Alter (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 381,
ruled that it did not. The appellant was then arraigned; the Crown which had
proposed to rely on the “deeming” provision conceded that it had no evidence to
offer, and the appellant was acquitted.

The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of
Appeal which reversed Judge Graburn and ordered a new trial. The appellant
filed notice of appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 618(2)(a) of the Code.
Accordingly there has not yet been an adjudication on the merits.

[Page 531]

Section 392 forms part of Part IX of the Code
entitled “Wilful and Forbidden Acts in respect of Certain Property”. Both
“property” and “wilfulness” are defined terms for purposes of this part of the Code,
the definitions being contained in ss. 385 and 386(1) respectively. In the
absence of the deeming provision of s. 392(2), the word “wilfully” in s.
392(1)(a) would be accorded the meaning given to it in s. 386(1). It
seems clear therefore that s. 392(2) applies to a charge laid under s. 392(1)(a).

In the present case, however, the indictment
does not allege that the appellant “wilfully” caused a fire. It alleges that he
“caused a fire” by “violating a law in force”. It can be a good indictment,
therefore, only in respect of an offence under s. 392(1)(b). Ironically,
the appellant would not seem to have a case if the indictment had charged him
with “wilfully” causing a fire even though it is apparent that in the ordinary
sense of the word his action or inaction was neither wilful nor a cause of the
fire.

2. Interpretation of section 392

The question of statutory interpretation posed
on this appeal has already been considered on two separate occasions, first by
Laycraft J. (as he then was) of the Alberta Supreme Court in R. v. Rist (1976),
30 C.C.C. (2d) 119, and then by Borins Co. Ct. J. in Alter, supra. Whereas
the trial judge in Abbas relied on Judge Borins in holding that s.
392(2) could logically be said to apply only to the offence set out in s.
392(1)(a), the Court of Appeal adopted the reasoning of Mr. Justice
Lay craft and held the “deeming” provision equally applicable to the offence
created in s. 392(1)(b).

In the reasons given by Martin J.A. in the Court
of Appeal (now reported at (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 330) stress was laid
upon the word “caused” in s. 392(2). The subsection was perceived as
designed to provide a connection between the violation of “a law in force in
the place where the fire occurs” (s. 392(1)(b)) and any property damage
or deaths resulting from the fire even although the violation

[Page 532]

could not be said to have actually caused the
fire. This view is most forcefully put forward by Lay craft J. in Rist when
he states at pp. 120-21:

I am of the view, however, that s-s. (2) of
s. 392 is designed to give a statutory definition of causing a fire “by
violating a law in force in the place where the fire occurs”. A person is
deemed “wilfully to have caused the fire” if the violations of the local law
are of the class described in s-s. (2). Without such a definition, many of the
acts described in s-s. (2) would not, in the ordinary meaning of the term, be
such as to “cause” a fire but would merely make its results more calamitous.
The statutory definition given relates to s-s. (1)(b) of s. 392.

With respect, it is difficult to see any
meaningful distinction between paras, (a) and (b) of
s. 392(1) if this view is correct. Yet a distinction was clearly intended.
By s. 392(2) Parliament has clearly extended the offence under s. 392(1)(a)
from acts or omissions of the accused which are the direct cause of a fire to
circumstances in which the accused’s acts or omissions are an indirect cause of
a fire or of the resultant death or destruction. Those acts or omissions,
however, have to constitute violations of fire-prevention or fire-safety laws.
Section 392(1)(b), on the other hand, makes it an offence to cause
a fire by violating any law in force in the place where the fire
occurred if the fire results in death or destruction. To construe s. 392(2) as
applicable to s. 392(1)(b) would make no sense. The violation of a fire‑prevention
or fire-safety law is a violation of “a law in force in the place where the
fire occurs”. It is, in other words, already covered in s. 392(1)(b). I
would respectfully agree with Judge Borins where he says at p. 387 of Alter:

The mischief to which s. 392(1)(a)
and s. 392(2) is directed is [non-]compIiance with fire‑prevention and
fire-safety legislation.

The view adopted by the Court of Appeal in the
present case eliminates the distinction between

[Page 533]

that type of legislation and any other. In this
respect it defeats the clear intention of Parliament.

While the respondent correctly asserts that in
interpreting any statutory provision, including one in the Criminal Code, one
must begin with the proposition that words are to be given their plain meaning
(R. v. Robinson, [1951] S.C.R. 522), the trial judge’s interpretation
seems more consonant with the language used than the interpretation of the
Court of Appeal. The fact that under s. 392(2) violating certain fire safety
laws is made synonymous with “wilfully” causing the fire would appear to be
relevant only to a charge under s. 392(1)(a). As the offence set out in
s. 392(1)(b) requires no element of wilfulness, the relevance to it of a
subsection whose purpose is to deem to be wilful acts which are otherwise
not wilful is, to say the least, dubious. I do not believe, therefore, that the
respondent can derive much comfort from the plain meaning rule in this case.

As Judge Borins noted in Alter, the
intentional setting of a fire (commonly referred to as arson) is dealt with in
ss. 389 and 390 of the Code and the reckless setting of a fire is
covered by the criminal negligence sections 202, 203 and 204.
Section 392 applies to cases other than arson and to conduct which does
not constitute criminal negligence. The offence in s. 392(1)(b) is made
out where the accused has caused the fire itself by violating a law in force in
the place where the fire occurred i.e. any law including the entire
spectrum of non-fire related laws. By contrast, the criterion for culpability
under s. 392(1)(a) is satisfied where the accused has wilfully caused
the fire or where, by virtue of s. 392(2), he is deemed to have wilfully caused
the fire. He is deemed to have wilfully caused the fire if he has breached a
fire‑prevention or fire-safety law and the death or destruction (but not
necessarily the fire itself) would not have occurred if such law had been
complied with.

[Page 534]

Crown counsel put a great deal of emphasis on
the opening words of s. 392(2), submitting that the phrase “For the purposes of
this section” evidences an intention on the part of Parliament to apply the
“deeming” provision to both offences created by the section. In support of this
submission he directed the Court’s attention to sections such as s. 320(4)
of the Code which deems property obtained by means of an N.S.F. cheque
to have been obtained by false pretenses for purposes of s. 320(1)(a).
Were it not for the express reference to s. 320(1)(a), the respondent
argued, such a “deeming” provision would necessarily apply to all of the
offences created by s. 320 (i.e. those created by ss. 320(1)(b),
(c) and (d) as well). By analogy, the argument went, the s.
392(2) “deeming” provision would contain an express reference to s. 392(1)(a)
if it were intended to apply only to that subsection.

What this argument overlooks, however, is that
unlike s. 392 the various paragraphs of s. 320(1) are drafted without
reference to one another or to any words in the section and as such are
completely self-contained. There is no need to refer to the rest of the
section in order to make sense of s. 320(1)(a). It stands on its
own feet. Accordingly, the “deeming” provision of s. 320(4) can coherently be
applied to that paragraph alone. Paragraph (a) of s. 392(1), on the
other hand, cannot coherently be read without reference to the other language
of s. 392(1). It takes the other language to constitute the offence. Therefore,
regardless of the intent underlying the “deeming” provision of s. 392(2), the
draftsman could not possibly have said “For the purposes of paragraph (a)”.
The structure of s. 392 requires the opening words “For the purposes of this
section” even if subsection (2) were intended to apply only to para. (a).
No assistance is to be gained therefore from this phraseology.

3. Conclusion

It seems to me that the interpretation put Upon
s. 392 by the Court of Appeal in overturning the decision of Judge Graburn has
the effect of all but eliminating any distinction between the offences created
by s. 392(1)(a) and s. 392(1)(b). The

[Page 535]

former is effectively subsumed under the latter.
In view of the evident Parliamentary intention to create two distinct offences,
one arising from certain violations of fire-prevention or fire‑safety
laws and the other from violations of other types of law, such an
interpretation seems inappropriate. In addition, the position put forward by
the respondent and adopted by the Court of Appeal does not appear to be
persuasive as a matter of pure statutory interpretation. In deeming certain
fires to have been wilfully caused by the accused, s. 392(2) must logically be
applicable only to the s. 392(1)(a) offence as the criterion of wilfulness is
relevant only to that offence and not to the offence created by s. 392(1)(b).

Since the appellant was charged under s. 392(1)(b),
and the Crown has conceded that it cannot establish the requisite causal
connection between the by-law violations and the fire if s. 392(2) is
inapplicable, the appeal must be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal
set aside, and the trial judge’s acquittal of the appellant restored.

The following are the reasons delivered by

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ALBERTA

Criminal law — Wiretaps — Authorization — Entry
without consent to plant bug — Whether or not authorization implied power to
plant device through illegal means — Whether or not illegal means for planting
device can be sanctioned by term of judge's authorization — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 25(1), 178.1, 178.11(1), (2), 178.12(1), 178.13(1),
(2), 178.16, 178.18(1), 178.2 — Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, s.
26(2).

A judge of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench
gave an authorization to intercept private communications but refused to grant
an order authorizing entry upon private premises to install and to remove the
microphone. The Alberta Government, as a result of this judgment, referred two
questions to the Alberta Court of Appeal raising the issues of (1) whether, in
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code, Parliament intended by necessary
implication to empower police officers to enter private property to install
listening devices when they act under an authorization to intercept private
communications and (2) whether a judge may expressly authorize such entry when
he grants an authorization for an interception of private communications. The
Alberta Court of Appeal answered both questions in the negative.

Held (Dickson and Chouinard JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed
and the two questions should be answered in the affirmative.

Per Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: An authorization given by a
judge under Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code authorizes by necessary
implication any person acting under the authorization to enter any place at
which private communications are to be intercepted

[page 698]

to install or to
service a permitted listening device—provided such entry is required to implement
the particular authorization—unless the authorization includes limitations on
or prohibitions of such entry. A judge in giving an authorization has
jurisdiction to expressly authorize a person acting under the authorization to
enter any place at which private communications are to be intercepted to
install or service a device, provided such entry is required to implement the
particular authorization.

Per Dickson and Chouinard JJ. dissenting:
Parliament did not intend that an authorization to intercept private
communications should accord, by necessary implication, the person acting under
its power to enter any place to install, monitor, repair or remove a listening
device. At common law, entry into a person's private premises without either
consent or specific legal authorization has always been unlawful. Unless
authorized by law, a police officer has no more right than an ordinary citizen
to interfere with a person's property. The Court has recently reaffirmed the
longstanding protection the common law accords to rights of property in Colet v.
The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2, where it unanimously held that a
statutory power to seize firearms did not carry with it, by necessary
implication, a power to enter and search. This decision is a particular application
of a larger canon of statutory interpretation: in general, it will be presumed
in the absence of express statutory language that a legislative body did not
intend to authorize an act unlawful at common law.

While Parliament clearly intended oral communications
should be the subject of interception, there was nothing to indicate that such
communications could not be effectively intercepted without an implied power of
entry. The fact that oral communications could be intercepted more frequently
and more conveniently if a power of entry was inferred does not justify the
implication of such a power. The omission of this power by Parliament from the
otherwise detailed statutory scheme of Part IV.1 is strong indication that it
did not consider such a power either essential or necessary to give effect to
an authorization to intercept oral communications.

The committee reports which were before
Parliament at the time of the introduction of the Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, cannot be used to interpret Part IV.1 of the Code and, in any event, they

[page 699]

do not provide any
substantial support for the view that Parliament intended by necessary
implication to authorize entry in aid of interception.

Subsection 25(1) of the Criminal Code cannot
support a right of entry by the police to effect an authorization to intercept
oral communications; this subjection does not augment the powers of the police
beyond those accorded them by the Criminal Code or at common law.

At common law,
the police have never been entitled to exercise a
general right of entry as part of their powers. Unless specifically authorized
by law, a police officer has no right to enter upon the private property of
another without consent. The situations where entry has been authorized at
common law are exceptional and few in number. R. v. Waterfield, [1963] 3
All E.R. 659 (C.A.), does not stand for the proposition that a power
of entry to private property for the purpose of installing a listening device
can arise simply by virtue of a policeman's general duty to detect crime and
enforce the law. Furthermore, Waterfield provides no assistance where
the conduct of the police is of itself unlawful and has been initiated with
full knowledge of its potential illegality.

Subsection 26(2) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, is a general deeming provision
which cannot supply authority for conduct that is otherwise unlawful and, in
any event, the conditions for its operation are not fulfilled.

Since Parliament has neither explicitly nor
implicitly granted a person acting under an authorization to intercept private
communications a right of entry, there can be no power in a judge to expressly
grant such power as a term of an authorization pursuant to s. 178.13(2). A
judge acting under a statutory scheme is limited by the authority accorded
under the statute.

The two questions posed in this reference
should be answered in the negative.

DICKSON
J. (dissenting)—The
issues this reference presents are (1) whether in
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code Parliament
intended by necessary implication to empower police officers to enter private
property to install listening devices when they
act under an authorization to intercept private communications and
(2) accordingly, whether a judge may expressly authorize such entry when he
grants an authorization for an interception of private communications.

These questions raise the substantial issue of
the limits Parliament intended to impose upon the interception of private
communications by the police in aid of criminal law enforcement. Equally
important, this reference compels the Court to inquire into societal interests
in conversational privacy protected by the Criminal
Code as well as the breadth of every citizen's common law right to
the exclusive and unimpaired enjoyment of property.

I Background

In 1982, an application for an authorization to
intercept private communications was made before Mr. Justice D.C. MacDonald of
the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to s. 178.12(1) of the Criminal Code.

Justice MacDonald gave the authorization after he was satisfied that the requirements
for the grant of an authorization established by s. 178.13(1) 

[page 701]

of the Criminal Code were fulfilled. At the same time, an
order authorizing the entry upon private premises for the purpose of installing
and removing a microphone or microphones was also sought. MacDonald J. refused
to include such power in the authorization and he gave written reasons at a
later date in support of his refusal. See Re Application for Authorization to Intercept
Private Communications (1982),
31 C.R. (3d) 31 (Alta. Q.B.)

Thereafter,
pursuant to s. 27(1) of the Judicature Act, R.S.A.
1980, c. J-1, the following questions were referred to the Alberta Court of
Appeal by order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council (O.C. 84/83), dated
February 2, 1983:

Does an authorization given by a judge under
Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code (Canada), by necessary implication, authorize
any person acting under the authorization to
enter any place at which private communications are proposed to be
intercepted under the authorization for the purpose of installing, monitoring,
repairing or removing any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device?

Does a judge have jurisdiction, in giving an
authorization under Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code (Canada), to expressly
authorize any person acting under the authorization to enter any place at which
private communications are proposed to be
intercepted under the authorization for the purpose of installing,
monitoring, repairing or removing any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or
other device?

For the purpose
of hearing and considering the above questions, words and expressions defined in Part
1V.1 of the Criminal Code (Canada)
have the meanings given to them in that Part.

The Court of Appeal
(McGillivray C.J. and Laycraft, Harradence, Belzil and Stevenson JJ.A.)
answered both questions in the negative: Reference re an Application for an Authorization (1983), 5 D.L.R. (4th) 601. The five
member panel was unanimous in its negative response to the first question. The
majority of the Court also answered the second question in the negative. Chief
Justice McGillivray and Justice Harradence each rendered separate dissenting
reasons for answering the second question in the affirmative.

[page 702]

The Attorney
General of Alberta has now brought an appeal from this decision by virtue of s.
37 of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19, as amended. He seeks
an affirmative answer to both questions. The Attorney General of Canada, as
well as the Attorneys General of Ontario and Manitoba and the Attorney General
of Québec have all
intervened in support of the position advanced by the Attorney General of
Alberta. By order of Chief Justice McGillivray, Mr. R. B. White was appointed
to act as counsel to represent the opposite view; he appeared in this Court as
well.

II Part IV.1 of
the Criminal Code

Prior to the
amendment of the Criminal Code by the Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-74
(Can.), c. 50, the interception of private communications was not regulated by
Parliament. Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code now contains a complete
legislative statement of the legal limits to the invasion of privacy permitted
in the conduct of an investigation.

A review of this
legislation reveals that Parliament has struck a balance between the privacy
interest of the individual and the competing interest of the public in law
enforcement: R. v. Commisso, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 121, at pp. 124-25, per
Lamer J. The interpretation this legislation should receive in light of
this balance of competing interests has been aptly described by Zuber J.A. in
R. v. Welsh and lannuzzi (No. 6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 369:

It is apparent that in enacting the Protection of Privacy Act, 1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, now Part
IV.1 of the Code, Parliament had two objectives.
The first was to protect private communications by prohibiting interception
and to render inadmissible evidence obtained in violation of the statute. The second objective, which balances the first,
was to recognize the need to allow the appropriate authorities, subject to specific controls,
to intercept private communications in the
investigation of serious crime, and to adduce the evidence thus obtained.

This legislation must be viewed and
interpreted with a full, fair and realistic appreciation of both
these objectives.

[page 703]

 The right to
private communication cannot be diluted simply because
unlawful interceptions are made by
honest men whose motives are simply to detect crime.

The main features
of the regulatory scheme Parliament chose to accomplish these competing
objectives are readily apparent. First, a group of indictable offences has been
created prohibiting: (a) the interception of private communications by anyone by
means of any form of listening device (s. 178.11(1)); (b) the purchase, sale or
possession of a listening device (s. 178.18(1)); (c) the disclosure of any
private communication intercepted by the use of any such device (s. 178.2).
Additionally, a court may order punitive damages up to $5,000 be paid to any
person aggrieved by the unauthorized interception of private communication or
the improper disclosure of them. Secondly, Parliament has created, as
exceptions to these prohibitions, procedures subject to judicial control for
the lawful interception of private communications in limited circumstances (ss.
178.11(2), 178.12, 178.13). Finally, Parliament has established rules regarding
the admissibility of evidence obtained by the interception of private communications
(s. 178.16).

The provisions of
Part IV.1 of particular relevance to this appeal are as follows:

178.1 In this Part,

""authorization"" means an
authorization to intercept a private
communication given under section 178.13 or subsection 178.15(2);

""electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical
or other device"" means any device or apparatus that is used or is capable
of being used to intercept a private communication, but does not include a
hearing aid used to correct subnormal hearing of the user to not better than
normal hearing;

[…]

""private communication"" means any
oral communication or any telecommunication made under circumstances in which
it is reasonable for the originator thereof
to expect that it will not be intercepted by any person other than the
person intended by the originator thereof to receive it; 

[…]

[page 704]

178.11 (1) Every one who, by means of an
electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a
private communication is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to
imprisonment for five years.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

(a) a person who has
the consent to intercept, express or implied, of the originator of the private
communication or of the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

(b) a person who intercepts a private
communication in accordance with an authorization or any person who in good
faith aids in any way a person whom he has reasonable and probable grounds to
believe is acting with any such authorization; 

[…]

178.12 (1) An application
for an authorization shall be made ex parte and in
writing to a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction, or a judge as
defined in section 482 and shall be signed by the Attorney General of the
province in which the application is made or the Solicitor General of Canada or
an agent specially designated in writing for the purposes of this section by

(a) the Solicitor General of Canada
personally, if the offence under investigation is one in respect of which
proceedings, if any, may be instituted at the instance of the Government of
Canada and conducted by or on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, or

(b) the Attorney General of a province
personally, in respect of any other offence in that province,

and shall be accompanied by an affidavit
which may be sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer or public
officer deposing to the following matters, namely:

(c) the facts relied upon to justify the
belief that an authorization should be given together with particulars of the offence;

(d) the type of private communication
proposed to be intercepted;

(e) the names, addresses and occupations, if
known, of all persons, the interception of whose private communications there
are reasonable and probable grounds to believe may assist the investigation of
the offence, a general description of the nature and location of the place, if
known, at which private

[Page 705]

communications are proposed to be intercepted
and a
general description of the manner of interception proposed to be used; 

[…]

178.13 (1) An authorization may be given if
the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied

(a) that it would be in the best interests of
the administration of justice to do so; and

(b) that other investigative procedures have
been tried and have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to
succeed or the urgency of the matter is such that it would be impractical to
carry out the investigation of the offence using only other investigative
procedures. 

[…]

(2) An authorization shall

(a) state the offence in respect of which
private communications may be intercepted;

(b) state the type of private communication
that may be intercepted;

(c) state the identity of the persons, if
known, whose private communications are to be intercepted, generally describe
the place at which private communications may be intercepted, if a general description of that place can be given, and
generally describe the manner of interception that may be used;

(d) contain such
terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable in the public interest; 

[…]

III The Issues

The
first issue the reference poses is whether Parliament intended, by necessary
implication, that an authorization given by a judge should accord the person
acting under the authorization power to enter any place to install, monitor,
repair or remove a listening device. The second question asks whether a judge
may, in granting the authorization, expressly empower the police to make such
entry.

Chief
Justice McGillivray initially requested that all counsel address whether the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  had any impact on these
two questions. The Alberta Court of Appeal did not deal with this point and it
was not canvassed in argument before this Court. Consequently,

[page 706]

 in this reference,
I intend to consider only the questions of statutory interpretation raised.

IV The Existence
of Implied Authority 

(A) The Nature of
the Issue

It is the submission
of the Attorney General and his supporting interveners (hereinafter ""the
appellants"") that the power to enter to install a listening device is
accorded by necessary implication to any person acting under an authorization
granted pursuant to Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code. Nothing in Part IV.1 expressly provides that when
an authorization to intercept private communications is made, the power to
enter in aid of the interception is included. The Attorney General of Alberta
has been compelled to ask, therefore, whether the statute produces that result
by implication and to argue accordingly.

The neutral language
used by the Lieutenant Governor in Council belies the real significance of the
first question and the far-reaching consequences of an affirmative answer to
it. Put plainly, the argument is that Parliament intended, although it did not
expressly so specify, to sanction otherwise unlawful conduct on the part of the
police by permitting them to trespass to intercept private communications.

The police are
entitled to take any lawful action in aid of law enforcement. Thus the power of
the police to enter to install a listening device when to do so would involve
no violation of the law cannot be disputed, so long as this does not conflict
with any of the terms imposed in the authorization. There is no need for
Parliament to approve either expressly or by implication an otherwise lawful
entry undertaken by the police and I do not understand the first question to
place this in issue. It is rather the issue of whether Parliament has
authorized an illegal entry that lies at the heart of the question.

The appellants'
claim that police officers are permitted to enter private premises to install
listening devices is broad and indiscriminate. It is worthwhile to examine
briefly the consequences of

[page 707]

accepting that such
a sweeping right exists. The power so granted would go much further than
authorizing surreptitious entry and would allow the police to act openly and
utilize whatever means to achieve entry they found most expedient. Thus, access
could be obtained by forcing doors or windows or through trickery or coercion.
Further, if police acting under Part IV.1 are implicitly authorized to make
entry, s. 25 of the Code
would permit them to
effect such entry by overcoming force a property owner is normally entitled to
assert, to prevent anyone, including the police, from entering the premises
without permission. If the right exists, it must exist in respect of premises
of persons who, at the time the entry is made, are innocent of any offence as
well as those who have more than passing acquaintance with the criminal
process.

(B) The Common Law of Trespass and Statutory Interpretation

Prima facie, every invasion of property, be it ever
so minute and negligible, is a trespass and therefore unlawful. Such trespass
may not amount to crime since ""breaking the close"" simpliciter is not a criminal offence. Nonetheless,
entry into the premises of another without either consent or specific legal
authorization has always been tortious and unlawful. It is an interference with
the common law right to peaceful enjoyment of one's property that has been
recognized at least since Semayne's Case (1604),
5 Co. Rep. 91 a; 77 E.R. 194 (K.B.), where it was said at p. 195: ""That
the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well as for his
defence against injury and violence, as for his repose .... ""

As well, it is the
gist of the following oft-quoted passage from the great case Entick v. Carrington (1765), 2 Wils. K.B. 275; 95 E.R. 807,
at p. 817:

... our law holds the property of every man
so sacred, that no man can set his foot upon his neighbour's close without
his leave; if he does he is a trespasser, though he

[page 708]

does no damage at all; if he will tread upon
his neighbour's ground, he must justify it by law.

The
inviolability of a person's property has from earliest times been vigorously
asserted and resolutely defended by the courts. Unless lawfully authorized, a
police officer has no more right than an ordinary citizen to interfere with a
person's property.

The
long standing protection the law has accorded rights of property was reaffirmed
recently by this Court in Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2. The issue in Colet was whether a statutory power to seize firearms carried with it, by
necessary implication, a power to enter and search. Ritchie J., writing for the
unanimous Court, concluded it did not. In his opinion, the police were not
entitled to invade the private rights of individuals unless they were expressly
authorized to do so.

In
rejecting the argument of the Crown that a right of entry and a power of search
should be implied, Ritchie J. had this to say, at pp. 8 and 9:

In the final analysis this appeal raises the
all important question of whether the property rights of the individual can be
invaded otherwise than with specific statutory authority. It is true that the
appellant's place of residence was nothing more than a shack or shelter which no doubt was considered inappropriate by the
city of Prince Rupert, but what is involved here is the longstanding
right of a citizen of this country to the control
and enjoyment of his own property, including the right to determine who
shall and who shall not be permitted to invade it. The common law principle has
been firmly engrafted in our law since Semayne's
case.... 

[…]

. . . it would in
my view be dangerous indeed to hold that the private
rights of the individual to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property are to
be subject to invasion by police officers
whenever they can be said to be acting in the furtherance of the
enforcement of any section of the Criminal
Code although they are not armed with express authority to justify
their action.

[page 709]

The decision in Colet is a particular application of a larger canon of statutory
interpretation. This canon embodies the presumption in favour of vested rights
(see Duff C.J. in Spooner Oils Ltd. v.
Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board, [1933] S.C.R. 629, at p. 638)
as well as the presumption that express language must be found to demonstrate
that a legislative body intended to authorize an act otherwise unlawful at
common law. On the necessity of express language see also: S.G.G. Edgar, Craies
on Statute Law (7th ed. 1971), pp.
121-22; E.A. Driedger, The Composition of
Legislation (1957), p. 127; P. St.J. Langan, Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th
ed. 1969), p. 116.

The requirement for express language was
recently invoked by the House of Lords in Morris
v. Beardmore, [1980]
2 All E.R. 753. This case raised a question analogous to the one at hand. It
involved the power of a constable to require a person to undergo a breath test
and the constable's purported right to enter and remain on the person's
property to enforce that requirement. The submission was made there, as it is
made here, that because there was no express provision prohibiting such entry
the right should be inferred. Lord Diplock disposed of this argument in these
words, at p. 757:

But, with respect, the boot is on the other leg; if Parliament intends
to authorise the doing of an
act which would constitute a tort actionable at the suit of the person
to whom the act is done, this requires express
provision in the statute ... .

The presumption
is that in the absence of express provision to the contrary Parliament did not intend to authorise tortious conduct ....

See also the opinions of Lord Edmund-Davies,
at p. 759, and Lord Scarman, at p. 763.

To the same effect is the statement of Lord
Keith in Finnigan v. Sandiford, [1981]
2 All E.R. 267 (H.L.), at p. 271, in reference to a purported power to enter,
"" . . . Parliament cannot be taken to have authorised any further inroads
on the rights of individual citizens than it specifically enacted"".

[page 710]

To overcome this Court's decision in Colet and the broad principle of
statutory interpretation it reflects, the appellants advanced several
arguments. I propose now to examine each of these in turn.

(C) The Appellants' Arguments

(1) Right of Entry Essential to Give Effect
to Parliament's Intent

The appellants submit that the authority to
intercept oral communications, as distinct from telecommunications, is
unworkable without the right to enter to install listening devices. Such a
power should therefore be implied.

There has been no material presented to this
Court to support the suggestion that oral communications cannot be effectively
intercepted without the power to trespass to install listening devices. Justice
MacDonald in Re Application for
Authorization to Intercept Private Communications, supra, at p. 46,
refused to ""accept as a fact that without trespassory entry almost all
electronic bugging would be impossible.... "" Mr. Justice Stevenson in the
Court of Appeal labelled this assertion, correctly in my respectful opinion,
""an appeal to convenience"" (at p. 633).

I also find the argument singularly
unpersuasive. Parliament intended oral communications, as well as
telecommunications, should be the proper subject of interception. That much is
made clear by the disjunctive definition of ""private communications""
in s. 178.1; in this regard, see Goldman
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 976.

I am not convinced, however, that the
interception of oral communications contemplated by Part IV.1 cannot be
accomplished without a trespass. It may well be that, absent covert entry,
electronic bugging would be much more difficult, but it is not correct to say
that oral communications cannot be intercepted without a power of entry. See Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427
(1963), at pp. 467-68, per Brennan
J. dissenting.

[page 711]

If the police obtain
the cooperation of a person who does have a legal right of access to a place,
there is no need to commit a trespass to install a listening device. Unlawful
entry can also be avoided when oral communications are intercepted with the aid
of a person fitted with a body pack who enters a place with consent or by the
use of a long range parabolic microphone. It seems to me that there are many
occasions when oral communications can be effectively intercepted without a
power of entry.

The strongest
indication that Parliament considered a power of entry was not essential to
give effect to an authorization to intercept oral communications is the
omission of this power from the extremely detailed provisions of Part IV.1. The
fact that they could perhaps be intercepted more frequently and more
conveniently if there were such a power constitutes, in my view, scant
justification for inferring such a power.

(2) Legislative
Background

The appellants
invited the Court to look at the material which led up to the introduction of
the Protection of
Privacy Act in order to
determine the intention and objectives present to the minds of the legislators.
Particular reference was made to the report of the Canadian Committee on
Correction (the Ouimet Committee — 1969) as well as the minutes of the Standing
Committee of the House of Commons on Justice and Legal Affairs. In their view,
these materials made clear that Parliament was well aware of the fact that
surreptitious entry into private premises for the purpose of concealing
electronic listening devices was an integral part of electronic surveillance.

Several recent
judgments of this Court discuss the admissibility of extrinsic materials where
issues of statutory interpretation are raised: Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714, at pp. 721-24; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [19841 1 S.C.R. 357; Re: Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297. It is clear from
these cases that extrinsic

[page 712]

 evidence is not
receivable as an aid to the construction of a statute. This is of course true
whether or not the case raises a constitutional issue. No direct assistance can
be derived, therefore, from the materials relied upon by the appellant in
deciding whether Parliament intended by necessary implication to authorize
entry.

In any event, I find
the committees' reports inconclusive. Nowhere can I find any substantial
support for the view that the proponents of the legislation intended implicitly
to endorse trespass in aid of authorized interceptions.

I conclude therefore
that the legislative background cannot be used as an aid to the construction of
Part IV.1 and that, in any event, it does not support the appellants' position.

(3)
Dalia v. United
States

Considerable
reliance was placed upon Dalia
v. United States, 441 U.S.
238 (1979), by the parties. Dalia involved
constitutional issues as well as questions of statutory interpretation; I shall
refer only to the latter which closely parallel the questions in the present
appeal.

Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code resembles Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. paras. 2510-2520. Like Part IV.1,
Title III does not expressly authorize covert entry to effect authorized
interceptions. The majority of the Supreme Court of the United States, per Powell J. (Burger C.J., White, Blackmun and
Rehnquist JJ. concurring), held that a power of entry was implicitly included.
Justices Stevens, Brennan and Marshall dissented, finding a covert entry to
install a bug to be unlawful under the statute. Justice Stewart, the ninth
member of the Court, disposed of the matter on constitutional grounds and
therefore did not reach the question of statutory construction.

[page 713]

Justice Powell, for
the majority, gave three reasons for his holding. His first argument was that
Congress had enacted a detailed scheme to authorize interception of private
communications, and there was nothing to suggest that authority was limited to cases in which covert entry
would not be required. The
same could be said about Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code. I agree, however, with the dissenting opinion of
Justice Stevens that this argument actually works the other way. Where a
legislative scheme speaks in considerable detail about most aspects of an
issue, but is silent on one aspect,
that silence is particularly telling. To imply permission from silence, in the
words of Stevens J. at p. 263, ""converts
silence into thunder"". Parliament's silence cannot be taken to sanction
what amounts to breaking and entering. The careful attempt in Part IV.1 of the Code to
circumscribe invasions of privacy cannot be seen as an indication of a
parliamentary intent to legalize break-ins.

Justice Powell's
second argument was that the legislative history of Title III confirmed that
Congress meant to authorize covert entries. The dissenting judges drew exactly
the opposite conclusion. I have already indicated why I do not consider the
legislative context in which Part IV.1 was enacted useful to the resolution of
this case.

Justice Powell
argued finally that a limitation having the effect of prohibiting covert entry
would thwart congressional intention because most bugging requires covert
entries. The difficulty with this argument is that it assumes what it is trying
to prove. If legislative intention is to enable interception of oral
communications by whatever means, prohibition of covert entry indeed thwarts
legislative intention. I am unwilling, however, to make the assumption this
argument requires. I have already
expressed my reasons for concluding that a right of entry is not necessary for the effective
operation of Part IV.1.

[page 714]

I agree with the point made in the dissenting
opinion of Justice Brennan in Dalia that
where private communications have been recorded subsequent to a trespass to
install a listening device two invasions of privacy have taken place. The
listening to the conversation breaches conversational privacy; the illegal
entry breaches physical privacy. A breach of conversational privacy, by itself,
is clearly approved of by Part IV.1, provided an authorization has been
obtained; a breach of physical privacy is not. I am not prepared to infer that
Parliament, by authorizing invasion of privacy in one form, has thereby
authorized invasion of privacy in another form.

I would note that scholarly comment on Dalia has been less than panegyrical:
Reddick and Westin, Covert Police
Break-Ins Create Conflict Among U.S. Circuit Courts, 30 Mercer L.
Rev. 707 (1979); Ruffley, Case Comment:
Dalia v. United States, 57 J. Urb. L. 588 (1980); Latta, No Requirement
of Prior Judicial Approval for Covert
Entry to Effect Electronic Surveillance—Dalia v. United States, 29 De
Paul L. Rev. 165 (1979); Oshinsky, Judicial
Interpretation of Title III—Should Privacy Interests Yield in the Wake of
Congressional Silence on Entries to Install Bugs?, 29 Cath. U.L. Rev. 697 (1980); Breaking and
Entering into Private Premises to Effect Electronic Surveillance: Dalia v.
United States, 39 Md. L. Rev. 754
(1980); Basik, Case comment:
Dalia v. United States, 9 Bait. L. Rev. 308 (1980); Cobb, Covert
Entry, Electronic Surveillance, and the Fourth Amendment: Dalia v. United
States, 40 La. L. Rev. 951 (1980);
McNulty, Dalia v. United States: The Validity of Covert Entry, 65 Iowa L. Rev. 931 (1980).

With the greatest respect, I would reject the
reasoning of the majority in Dalia.

(4) Section 25 of the Criminal Code

The next submission made by the appellants is
that entry to effect an authorization to intercept oral communications is
allowed by s. 25(1) of the Criminal Code. Under this view of the
matter, s.25(1)

[page 715]

 permits
such entry because it is required to accomplish an authorized action of the
police.

Subsection
25(1) provides:

25. (1) Every one who
is required or authorized by law to do
anything in the administration or enforcement of the law

(a) as a private person,

(b) as a peace officer or public officer,

(c) in aid of a peace officer or public
officer, or

(d) by virtue of his office,

is, if he acts on reasonable and probable
grounds, justified in doing what he is
required or authorized to do and in using as much force as is necessary
for that purpose.

The
Alberta Court of Appeal refused to give s. 25(1) the breadth urged by the
appellants. Applying my reasoning in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, Justice Stevenson concluded
at p. 632 that s. 25(1) "" ... affords a protection for required or
authorized acts and the use of force in respect thereof but it begs the
question here which is whether someone acting under an 'authorization' is
required or authorized by law to trespass.""

In Eccles, it was contended that s. 25(1) of
the Criminal Code authorized trespass by
the police in order to effect an arrest. I responded to this argument in the
following terms, at p. 742:

Section 25 does not have such amplitude. The
section merely affords justification to a person for doing what he is required or authorized by law to do in the
administration or enforcement of the law, if he acts on reasonable and probable grounds, and for using necessary
force for that purpose. The question which must be answered in this case, then, is whether the
respondents were required or
authorized by law to commit a trespass; and not, as their counsel contends, whether they were required
or authorized to make an arrest. If they were authorized by law to commit a
trespass, the authority for it must be found in the common law for there is
nothing in the Criminal Code. [Emphasis
added.]

[page 716]

I maintain this
view. Subsection 25(1) does not augment the powers of the police beyond those
otherwise given to them by the Criminal Code or at
common law. Thus, it cannot accord a right of entry. Such a right must be found
in Part IV.1 or at common law. Subsection 25(1) is of no assistance to the
appellants.

(5) The Common
Law Powers of the Police

It was argued that
the common law recognizes certain powers inherent in the execution of a police
officer's duty. These powers, it is urged, would permit the police to engage in
acts necessary to the fulfillment of their duty even though they involve an
otherwise unlawful interference with a person's liberty or property, Reliance
was placed upon Eccles
v. Bourque, supra, and
R. v. Waterfield, [1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.A.), as well as
R. v. Stenning, [1970] S.C.R. 631, and Knowlton v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 443.

If a general power
of entry existed at common law, it would still be necessary to examine whether
such a power could operate in the face of Parliament's failure to include it
expressly in the statutory scheme created to regulate the interception of
private communications.

I would emphasize
that the police have never been entitled to exercise a general right of entry
as part of the powers accorded them at common law. No authority cited to this
Court expressly recognizes such a right. The tenor of the cases the appellants
did raise in argument runs counter to the position advanced. Unless
specifically authorized by law, a police officer has no right to enter upon the
private property of another without consent.

The situations where
entry has been authorized are exceptional and few in number. The common law
always allowed a warrant to search for stolen goods to be granted by a
magistrate: see Chic Fashions (West Wales), Ltd. v. Jones, [1968] 1 All E.R. 229 (C.A.)
Another exception was recognized in Eccles
v. Bourque, supra. In that case,
the appellant had sued three members of the Vancouver

[page 717]

 Police Force for trespass alleged to have been
committed when they entered the appellant's apartment to apprehend a fugitive
for whom outstanding arrest warrants existed. The claim was denied by this
Court on the basis that the police were entitled, in limited circumstances, to
enter private property without consent to effect an arrest. I made the
following statement at p. 744:

I would wish to
make it clear, however, that there is no question of an unrestricted right to enter in
search of a fugitive. Entry can be made against the will of a
householder only if (a) there are reasonable and probable grounds for the
belief that the person sought is within the premises and (b) proper
announcement is made prior to entry.

The appellants, however, rely upon the following
emphasized lines from my reasons in the same case at p. 743:

But there are occasions when the interest
of a private individual in the security of
his house must yield to the public interest,
when the public at large has an interest in the process to be executed. The criminal is not immune from
arrest in his own home nor in the home of one of his friends. So it is
that in Semayne's Case a limitation was put on the
""castle"" concept....

As Ritchie J. recognized in Colet, it is quite clear when these
lines are read in context that they do not create a general right of entry on
the part of the police whenever it can be said that the public at large has an
interest in the process to be executed. The creation of so sweeping an
exception would quickly swallow up the general protection accorded a property
owner at common law from arbitrary invasion. Eccles v. Bourque, supra, creates a limited exception to that
general protection. So viewed, it is authority against the position advanced by
the appellants.

The Waterfield,
Stenning and Knowlton cases
all involved charges of assaulting or obstructing a police officer in the
execution of his duty. Charges were laid as a result of altercations with the
police and the defence was raised that the police were not acting in the
execution of their duty at the time.

[page 718]

The
Court of Appeal in Waterfield,
at p.
661, enunciated the following test for determining the limits of a policeman's
duty:

In the judgment
of this court it would be difficult, and in the present
case it is unnecessary, to reduce within specific limits the general terms in
which the duties of police constables have
been expressed. In most cases it is probably more convenient to consider
what the police constable was actually doing and in particular whether such
conduct was prima facie an unlawful interference with a person's liberty or
property. If so, it is then relevant to consider whether (a) such conduct
falls within the general scope of any
duty imposed by statute or
recognised at common law and (b) whether such conduct, albeit
within the general scope of such a duty, involved an unjustifiable use
of powers associated with the duty. Thus, while it is no doubt right
to say in general terms that police constables have a duty to prevent crime and
a duty, when crime is committed, to bring the offender to justice, it is also
clear from the decided cases that when the execution of these general duties
involves interference with the person or property of a private person, the
powers of constables are not unlimited. [My emphasis.]

R. v. Waterfield does not stand for the
proposition that a power of entry to private property for the purpose of
installing a listening device can arise simply by virtue of a policeman's
general duty to detect crime and enforce the law.

Furthermore,
the Waterfield test provides no
assistance when the police have trespassed to install a listening device. I
cannot accept that conduct of itself unlawful and initiated with full knowledge
of its potential illegality could ever fall within the general scope of a
policeman's duty. As Lord Edmund-Davies recognised in Morris v. Beardmore, supra, at p. 759:

My Lords, I have
respectfully to say that I regard it as unthinkable that a policeman may
properly be regarded as acting in the execution of his duty when he is acting
unlawfully, and this regardless of whether his contravention is of the criminal
law or simply of the civil law.

The
fact that police officers could be described as acting within the general scope
of their duties to

[page 719]

investigate crime
cannot empower them to violate the law whenever such conduct could be justified
by the public interest in law enforcement. Any such principle would be nothing
short of a fiat for illegality on the part of the police whenever the benefit
of police action appeared to outweigh the infringement of an individual's
rights. For the Waterfield
principle to apply, the
police must be engaged in lawful execution of their duty at the time of the
conduct in question.

(6) Section 26 of
the Interpretation
Act

The appellants argue
that s. 26(2) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
I-23, grants an implied power of entry to a peace officer authorized to
intercept oral communications. Subsection 26(2) reads:

26. ...

(2) Where power is given to a person, officer
or functionary, to do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all such powers shall be deemed to be also
given as are necessary to enable the person, officer or functionary to
do or enforce the doing of the act or thing.

The appellants argue
that a police officer is given the power under Part IV.1 to do a certain thing
(i.e. intercept oral communications), thus he is deemed by s. 26(2) to have the
power necessary to do that thing (i.e. to enter surreptitiously to install a
listening device). This proposition was rejected by Mr. Justice MacDonald as
well as by the Alberta Court of Appeal.

I cannot accept this
line of argument either. In Colet v. The Queen, supra, Ritchie J. held that any provision authorizing police officers to enter
private property must do so expressly and s. 26(2) of the Interpretation Act could not be considered as clothing
police officers with such authority. I respectfully agree that a general
deeming provision in the Interpretation
Act cannot supply the
authority for conduct that is otherwise unlawful.

[page 720]

As well, the argument that s. 26(2) supplies the
necessary authority to enter seems to me fundamentally to beg the question. The
very issue is whether Parliament has granted the ""power"" the
subsection refers to as a precondition to its operation. Furthermore, I do not
believe, for reasons already given, that a right of entry is ""necessary""
to permit the police to accomplish the interception of oral communications.

(D) Her Majesty The Queen v. Papalia

Subsequent to the hearing of this appeal, the
Ontario Court of Appeal rendered judgment in R. v. Papalia (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 289. This case
raised in part the very issue presently under consideration. The case against
the accused depended upon evidence of electronically intercepted private
communications. The trial judge admitted evidence of private communications
intercepted on business premises and refused to admit evidence of private
communications intercepted in two automobiles and certain other derivative
evidence. The accused were acquitted and the Crown appealed. The issue on the
appeal was the admissibility of the electronically intercepted evidence under
s. 178.16(1) of Part IV.1.

Brooke J.A. (Arnup and Blair JJ.A. concurring)
concluded that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit the private
communications intercepted in the accused's automobile and the derivative
evidence. The Court of Appeal next considered the trial judge's decision to
admit the private communications intercepted in an office and boardroom located
on business premises of the accused. The listening devices were installed
following surreptitious entry to these premises on two occasions. The enabling
authorization under which the police officers acted specifically provided that
in intercepting private communications, the police officers were authorized
""for such purpose to enter such places as may be necessary in order to
install, monitor or remove"" any listening devices.

[page 721]

In the opinion of
Brooke J.A., the trial judge quite properly held the evidence admissible under
s. 178.16(1) on the basis of the decisions of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in
R. v. Doss, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 97, and the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Lyons (1982), 140 D.L.R. (3d) 223. Brooke J.A. went on to
review the Dass and Lyons decisions as well as the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in the
instant case and that of the United States Supreme Court in Dalia v. United States, supra. He concluded that the interceptions had
been lawfully made within the meaning of s. 178.16(1)(a).

In reaching this
conclusion, Brooke J.A. decided that an authorization carries with it, by
necessary implication, the authority to enter to install a listening device. In his opinion, almost
all instances of
wiretapping and electronic surveillance involved conduct in the nature of
trespass and this includes surreptitious or covert entry. He was persuaded that
Parliament recognized this when the legislation was passed and intended to deal
comprehensively with the problem in Part IV.1 of the Code. Thus, while a judge may specifically authorize
surreptitious entry or other conduct in the nature of a trespass, such express
authorization is unnecessary.

With respect, I cannot
agree. For the reasons already given, I am not persuaded Parliament intended by
its silence to authorize entry by the police to install a listening device. I
conclude therefore that the Ontario Court of Appeal erred in its decision on
this point.

(E) The Statutory
Scheme

I am fortified in my
conclusion that the authority to trespass in order to install a listening
device is not to be found either expressly or by implication in Part IV.1.
Section 178.16, which makes evidence of intercepted conversations prima facie inadmissible, is a logical corollary to s.
178.11(1), which makes it an offence to wilfully intercept a private
communication. Subsection 178.11(2) lists

[page 722]

the number of persons to whom s. 178.11(1) does
not apply, including a person who intercepts a private communication ""in
accordance with"" an authorization. The important point is that outside of
the specifically enumerated exceptions, everyone who willfully [sic] intercepts
a private conversation by means of a device is guilty of an indictable offence.
Parliament has taken great pains in Part IV.1 to lay down an elaborate code
legitimizing conduct otherwise criminal by the terms of s. 178.11(1).

As McIntyre J. recognized, in analyzing the
purpose of Part IV.1 in Goldman v. The
Queen, supra, at p. 994,
""the courts must be astute to limit breaches [of the right to privacy] to
the extent provided by the Code"". The notion of an ""implied""
right to enter private property does not sit easily with that language.

(F) Conclusion on Question # 1

In my view, the decision in Colet v. The Queen, supra, and the classic
principle of statutory interpretation it embodies, are in the end dispositive
of this case. The Court held in Colet, at p. 10, that ""... any provision
authorizing police officers to search and enter private property must be
phrased in express terms"". That reasoning seems to me to apply whether the
right of the police to enter private property is sought for the purpose of
intercepting private communications or seizing dangerous firearms. I am not at
all persuaded that Colet can be distinguished. The right of entry is claimed here for the
same purpose as it was in Colet:
to aid in the enforcement of the criminal law.
Equally, the same justification for inferring the right is advanced: the proper
and effective fulfillment of a judicially granted warrant. Ultimately, the
logic upon which Colet turns is the traditional legal protection accorded private property
and the long-standing refusal of the judiciary to impair that protection where
Parliament has not itself done so expressly.

[page 723]

It follows I would
answer the first question posed in the reference in the negative.

V The Power of
a Judge to Expressly Authorize Entry

The second question
posed is whether a judge may expressly grant a power to enter as a term of an
authorization to intercept oral communications. Paragraph 178.13(2)(d) of Part
IV.1 is relied upon in support of the argument that a judge possesses such
power. I set it out here again for convenience.

178.13

(2) An authorization shall

(d) contain such
terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable
in the public interest; and

The appellants argue
that a judge may grant a right of entry when the interception of oral
communications is authorized, whether or not Parliament intended by necessary
implication that such a power should exist. The majority of the Court of Appeal
concluded that s.178.13(2)(d) could only be construed as words of limitation
and could not therefore be read as authorizing a court to permit a trespass. Chief
Justice McGillivray and Justice Harradence dissented on this point. Each gave
separate reasons for his conclusion that a judge could grant the power to
trespass as one of the terms of an authorization.

Chief Justice
McGillivray held that a judge who grants an authorization has the power to
order that the electronic device may be placed by surreptitious entry or by
trick where the circumstances require such action. He distinguished this
Court's decision in Colet,
noting in particular
that the success of the police operation depends upon a listening device being
planted without the knowledge of the occupier, thus eliminating the element of
invasion and the possibility of confrontation that, in his opinion, concerned
the Court in Colet.

Furthermore, he considered
Parliament well aware that surreptitious entry into private premises

[page 724]

 for the purpose of concealing electronic
devices was often an integral part of electronic eavesdropping. Therefore, when
it allowed the practice of bugging to continue it implicitly intended to allow
surreptitious entry to continue to the extent authorized by the court. Entry to
install a listening device was similar to a policeman standing in a property
owner's flower bed listening at an open window. The serious invasion the
legislation contemplates is not the entry upon a person's property, but the
entry into his mind by intercepting private communication. Once such an
invasion is authorized, the means of accomplishing this invasion are merely
incidental. Thus, he concluded that an authorization does not carry with it the
implicit right of entry; however, a judge may spell out, in describing the
manner of interception, any right to enter or re-enter where the police request
such power and the judge deems it appropriate.

Harradence J.A. considered that a judge could
resort to the common law to permit a peace officer to gain entry to install a
listening device. He frankly noted that this step was an expansion of the
traditionally limited exceptions to a property owner's rights. Such a
judge-made adaptation of police power was justified, in his view, by the
serious challenge to our social order posed by modern day criminal activity. He
concluded, at p. 628:

I am of opinion that if a superior court
judge, on an application for an authorization made pursuant to Part IV.1 of the
Criminal Code, determines that the public weal can only be served by the
interception of private communications and
that effective interception of those communications can only be
obtained by placing a device on private property, then it is his duty to adapt the common law to meet modern conditions by
authorizing a surreptitious entry or
a suitable strategem to effect the installation of a device on that
property.

The power of a judge to grant a power to enter
as a term of an authorization has been considered in other cases as well. In R. v. Dass, supra, at p. 117, Huband J.A., in language obiter, but 'carefully

[page 725]

 chosen, dealt with
this issue in terms that I would, with respect, adopt:

As previously noted, the reference to the
installation of the authorization order is
not a fiat by the courts to violate the laws of the land. I see nothing
in the Criminal Code which gives a judge the power to authorize or condone illegal entry. Crown counsel points to s.
178.13(2)(d), which appears to enable the judge to impose terms and
conditions which he considers advisable in
the public interest. In my view, that provision was not intended as a mechanism
to have the courts authorize illegal acts. The public interest is not
served by acts which violate the civil or
criminal laws of the land. The terms
and conditions could not validly include permission, directly or by implication, to ignore or breach such laws.

In R. v. Lyons, supra, Anderson J.A., dissenting in part,
applied Huband J.A.'s conclusion in the Dass case that an authorization does not give any authority to trespass and an
authorizing judge has no power to authorize or permit the police to act in such
an unlawful manner.

In R. v. Papalia, supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded
that while a judge may include a right of entry as one of the terms of an
authorization, it was not necessary for him to do so; in the opinion of that
court, an authorization by necessary implication accords the police a right of
entry.

In R. v. Hardy (1984), 56 N.B.R. (2d) 417, 146 A.P.R. 417, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal considered whether the trial judge
erred in admitting into evidence private communications which were intercepted
by a room monitoring device surreptitiously placed in the accused's residence.
In that ease, the authorization given by the judge expressly permitted the
police ""where reasonably necessary to enter upon the premises in order to
install, monitor, remove, service, maintain any and all electromagnetic,
acoustic, mechanical or other device that may be required to implement this
authorization"".

[page 726]

The Court agreed that the intercepted private
communications were inadmissible. The Court was, however, divided upon the
power of the authorizing judge to grant a right of entry. Stratton J.A. (Hughes
C.J. concurring) applied the reasoning of Stevenson J.A. in this reference and
concluded that Part IV.1 does not allow a judge to authorize a trespass onto
private property for the purpose of installing a listening device. Angers J.A.
expressed his agreement with the dissenting reasons of Chief Justice
McGillivray. The wording of the authorization was, however, not sufficiently
clear to satisfy him that the judge who granted the order intended to authorize
the precise entry which was effected.

If Part IV.1 does not explicitly or implicitly
legalize a trespass to install a listening device, then as a corollary, there
can be no power in a judge to authorize such an illegality. A judge could never
possess the authority to grant the police powers which Parliament did not
intend them to be able to exercise. When acting pursuant to a statutory scheme,
a judge is limited by the authority granted him by the statute under which he
acts. Parliament has not expressly or by necessary implication, authorized a
right of entry. A negative response to the first question in this reference
compels a negative response to the second.

Before concluding, I would like to make a brief
comment upon Justice Harradence's reasoning that the common law, suitably
expanded, could provide the legal support for the judicial sanction of
surreptitious entry into private premises. With respect, I have the gravest
doubt whether it would ever be appropriate for a judge to look to the common law
for the right to authorize action by the police which the legislation itself
does not expressly or implicitly permit him to authorize; this is especially
true where the statutory scheme is an exhaustive and comprehensive expression
of legislative policy, like Part IV.1 of the Code. Where the judge must not only look outside the statutory
scheme for the right to act in the manner he proposes, but must
""adapt"" the common law to suit his purpose, it seems to me he crosses
the

[page 727]

boundary which separates
the judicial from the legislative function.

I would answer the
second question in the negative.

VI Conclusion

The right to be free
from unwanted intrusion is important and fundamental. It leaves no room for
casual inference of Parliamentary sanction of illegality. When Parliament
declines to sanction expressly what would otherwise be unlawful acts, we should
not assume that it has impliedly given such acts its imprimatur. Nor should we conclude that Parliament intended the
courts to fill a lacuna
legis by writing in
something which Parliament left out. I agree with the following observation of
Lord Scarman in Morris
v. Beardmore, supra, at
p. 763, which seems to me to reach the heart of the present appeal:

... it is not the task of judges, exercising
their ingenuity in the field of
implication, to go further in the invasion of fundamental private rights and liberties
than Parliament has expressly authorised.

If the police, in
order to carry out effectively their difficult and frequently dangerous tasks,
are required to break and enter private dwellings, that right should be sought
from Parliament in express terms, as an amendment to Part IV.1. It is for
Parliament, not the judiciary, still less the police themselves, to fill any
gap in the Criminal
Code.

Until such time as
Parliament speaks specifically on this matter, I am of the view that an
unlawful entry to install a listening device is an unauthorized and unjustified
use of police powers. If the authorization to intercept did purport to sanction
such an entry, the authorization would be invalid in that respect. Judges
simply do not have the power to permit anyone, even police officers, to commit
unlawful acts. It is therefore my conclusion that both questions posed in this
reference

[page 728]

must be answered in
the negative. I would answer them accordingly and dismiss this appeal.

The judgment of
Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

ESTEY J.—Because the answer to question 1 may
be affected by the content of the particular authorization, it is difficult to
answer the question in generality. The manner of interception may be expressed
in very specific terms in one order, whereas the court in another order may
authorize the use of several or all of the devices enumerated in Part IV.1, leaving
open to the investigative agency the choice between these devices, and the
choice between wiretapping with or without interference with equipment inside
the premises, or radio surveillance by electromagnetic devices, or a
combination of these and other devices. A different answer, for example, would
be required where the order specifically authorized the use of a
battery-powered radio transmitter. With that explanation, and for the reasons I
have given in Lyons v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, I would answer the two questions
referred to the Court in the following manner:

Question 1: Yes, provided that such entry is
required to implement the particular authorization and provided that the
authorizing judge does not include in the authorization any limitations on or
prohibition of such entry.

Question 2: Yes, provided that such entry is
required to implement the particular authorization.

No question arose in
Lyons, supra, relating to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  or its application as the trial arose
before the Charter  became part of our Constitution. In
their presentation to this Court, the parties did not advance any submission to
the effect that the Charter
of Rights  had any
application in this appeal. Neither does it appear that any such presentation
was made in the Court of Appeal, although counsel were there

[page 729]

afforded an
opportunity to do so. I therefore have not addressed the relation of the Charter ,
if there be any, to the questions put to the Court of Appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law - Wiretaps - Admissibility of evi­dence -
Interceptions authorized by court - Installa­tion of device involving trespass
- Whether or not interceptions ""lawfully made"" - Whether or not evi­dence
obtained admissible - Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 25, 178.1,
178.11(1), 178.12(1), 178.13(1), (2)(d), 178.16(1).

Evidence - Admissibility - Wiretap evidence - Operation to
obtain evidence involving trespass - Whether or not evidence admissible.

Police officers, authorized to intercept appellants’
pri­vate communications, entered the residence of one of the appellants without
consent to install a room monitoring device. None of the authorizations made
reference to the manner of installing the device. Later, the appellants were
tried and convicted on a charge of conspiracy to import a narcotic.
Conversations intercepted by the monitoring device were introduced in evidence
at trial and held admissible. The Court of Appeal dismissed appellants’ appeals
but a dissenting judge concluded the evidence of the intercepted communications
inadmissible in that the trespass made the interceptions not ""lawfully
made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1) of the Crimi­nal
Code. The appeals were based on this dissenting judgment.

Held (Dickson and Chouinard JJ. dissenting):
The appeals should be dismissed.

Per Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: Part
IV.1 of the Criminal Code, when read as a whole, clearly contemplates,
requires and authorizes, by necessary implication and unavoidable inference,
the placing of a radio device on the premises where the intercept is to be
made, where the use of radio equipment is authorized for the interception of a
private communication. Modern

[Page 634]

surveillance techniques involve the invasion of
property by directed energy to extract private communications and no express
authorization for such ""entry"" on the target premises is found in
Part IV.1. Parliament should not be taken to have authorized the use of
procedures and equipment without, at the same time, supplying the public
officers undertaking these duties with the appro­priate means and authority to
carry them out.

The process of interception is a single undertaking
carried out on authorization orders of the court and cannot be segmented into
legally consequential and legally inconsequential steps. The evidence cannot be
considered admissible on the one hand, and an attendant trespass, on the other,
be left to be dealt with in later proceedings.

Parliament has broadly empowered the courts to
authorize the use of devices to intercept designated communications. Since many
of the devices allowed by the Code could not otherwise function as
interception ""devices"", Parliament cast the section broadly so as to
empower the court in its discretion to authorize the placing of a
""device"" inside the premises designated in the authorization, whether
or not a trespass might occur and whether or not the owner of the premises was
the person whose communications were to be intercepted. Parliament, however,
foresaw the differences in the magnitude in the potential seriousness presented
by the several interception procedures that Part IV.1 allows the court to
authorize. Section 178.13(2)(d), therefore, by requiring the authorizing judge
to include in the author­ization ""such terms and conditions as the judge
consid­ers advisable in the public interest"", creates a judicial safeguard
to balance the bilateral nature of Part IV.1-the shield from, and yet the
instrument permitting, invasions of privacy. The authorization granted here was
sufficiently broad to empower the law enforcement offi­cers both to plant and
to service the device, even when both activities involved a physical entry into
the targeted premises.

lnterceptions, if ""lawfully made"", can be
admitted in evidence. The term, however, given its presence in Part IV.1 (a
mini-Code within the codified criminal law) must be interpreted to mean in
accordance with Part IV.1, as opposed to in conformity with all laws. Logical
impossibilities result if ""unlawful"" is taken to refer to Criminal
Code sections not in Part IV.1, let alone to all other laws. lt was
unreasonable to read s. 178.16 as rendering interceptions inadmissible because
external procedures used in the operation entailed entry which

[Page 635]

may have amounted to trespass. The physical entry
here did not amount to a breach of Part lV.1, and in particu­lar, to a breach
of s. 178.11. Indeed, once Parliament has granted the power to authorize and
once that power has been exercised, the authorized conduct in law would no
longer amount to trespass.

Per Dickson and Chouinard JJ., dissenting:
A private communication that has been intercepted by means of any form of
electronic surveillance is inadmissible pursuant to s. 178.16(1) of the Code
unless the interception was ""lawfully made"".
Thus, for the purposes of Part IV.1, the manner in which the evidence has been
obtained is determinative of its admissibility.

An authorization to intercept private communications
granted pursuant to Part IV.1 does not implicitly carry with it a right of
entry to private premises and a judge does not possess any authority to include
a right of entry as a term of an authorization pursuant to s. 178.13(2). The
entries made by police to install and maintain the listening device for the
purpose of intercepting the pri­vate communications in question were
unauthorized and unlawful.

An interception of private communications accom­plished
by means of an illegal entry to private premises is not ""lawfully
made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1)(a). Parliament intended any
breach of the right of privacy protected by Part IV.1 should be lawful in the
widest sense. There is no justification for limiting the terms of s.
178.16(1)(a) to lawfulness in obtaining the authorization or in listening to
and recording the conversation. The whole process of interception includ­ing
the installation of the listening device, must be lawful.

As a result of the two covert entries, the
interceptions of conversations were not ""lawfully made"" within the
meaning of s. 178.16(1)(a) and therefore ought not to have been admitted as
evidence. It follows that, as the appellants were convicted on the basis of
inadmissible evidence, the appeals should be allowed and new trials directed.

APPEALS from a judgment of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 318, dismissing appellants’ appeals from
their con­viction by Fisher Co. Ct. J. (1979), 52 C.C.C. 113, for
conspiring to import cocaine. Appeals dismissed, Dickson and Chouinard JJ.
dissenting.

Douglas J. A. Rutherford, Q.C., and S. David Frankel, for
the respondent.

The reasons of Dickson and Chouinard JJ. were delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)-The question is whether the trial
judge erred in admitting into evidence certain private communications
intercepted through the use of a room monitoring device installed
surreptitiously by police officers in the

[Page 637]

home of the appellant, Kristine Lyons. The case raises, in part,
the very important issues presented in the Reference Pursuant to Section
27(1) of the Judicature Act, Chapter J-1 of the Revised Stat­utes of Alberta,
1980, as amended, referred by Order in Council (O.C. 84/83) of the Lieutenant
Governor in Council dated the 2nd day of Febru­ary, A.D. 1983, to the Court of
Appeal of Alberta, [1984] 2 S.R.C. 697 (hereinafter the Wiretap
Reference). Judgment in the instant case was delayed pending hearing of
argument upon, and determination of, the Wiretap Reference. As well,
this Court has considered judgments delivered subsequently in two provincial
appellate courts relevant to the Wiretap Reference and the present
appeals. Judgment in the Wiretap Reference is being delivered
concurrently herewith.

I The Facts

Police obtained a series of authorizations and renewals to
intercept private communications of the appellants and other persons at, among
other places, Kristine Lyons’ home, 1207 Nanton Avenue, Vancouver, British
Columbia. The authorizations and renewals collectively covered the period
between August 25, 1977 and February 13, 1978. All of the authorizations
contained the following stipulation:

The type of private communications that may be inter­cepted
are all telecommunications and oral communica­tions.

None of the authorizations made reference to the manner of
installing the listening device. Accord­ingly, none purported to expressly
authorize trespass.

On November 2, 1977 four police officers, with-out consent,
entered the residence at 1207 Nanton Avenue to install a room monitoring
device. They were there about two hours. The transmitter oper­ated continuously
thereafter, and was capable of intercepting not only telephone communications,
but also all conversations within the room. Not all conversations were recorded
by the police. On December 19, 1977, three police officers, without consent,
again entered 1207 Nanton Avenue, to

[Page 638]

change the batteries in the monitoring device. They stayed for
about an hour.

The appellants and one David Fladgate were tried and convicted
before His Honour Judge Fisher on a charge of conspiracy to import a narcotic
(cocaine). At trial, evidence was intro­duced of ten conversations intercepted
between November 6, 1977 and December 30, 1977 by the above-mentioned
monitoring device.

lI The Court of Appeal Decision

The accused appealed their convictions to the British Columbia
Court of Appeal on several grounds. The appeals of Lyons, Prevedoros and
McGuire were dismissed. The Court was unani­mous on all but one of the grounds.
The point of disagreement concerned the issue of whether the trespass to
install the room monitoring device ren­dered the intercepted private
communications inadmissible in evidence.

Hinkson J.A., Macdonald J.A. concurring, wrote for the majority.
He said the trespass did not vitiate the authorization. While any wrongful acts
committed in the carrying out of the authorization could be the subject of
criminal or civil proceedings, such wrongful acts did not affect the admissi­bility
of the evidence of private communications.

Anderson J.A. dissented on this point. He con­cluded that
authorizations to intercept private communications could not and did not
authorize a trespass. He also held that the installation of the monitoring
device was part of the interception. An unlawful trespass made the interception
not ""law-fully made"" and this, by virtue of s. 178.16(1) of the Criminal
Code, rendered the evidence of the private communications inadmissible.
Anderson J.A. would have ordered a new trial. The case reaches this Court by
virtue of Anderson J.A.’s dissent on a point of law (s. 618(1)(a) of the Criminal
Code).

[Page 639]

III The Questions At Issue

The trial in this case arose prior to the procla­mation of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . Therefore, the case raises only ques­tions
of statutory interpretation. The reach of Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code, bearing
the rubric ""Invasion of Privacy"", is at issue.

The majority of the Court of Appeal held that surreptitious entry
to install the listening device did not vitiate the authorization to intercept
com­munications at 1207 Nanton Avenue. Assuming this conclusion to be correct,
it does nothing to resolve the question of the admissibility of the evidence
garnered as a result of this electronic interception.

In considering the admissibility of evidence of private
communications, the starting point is s. 178.16(1) of the Criminal Code:

178.16 (1) A private communication that has been intercepted
is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the communication
or the person intended by the originator to receive it unless

a) the interception was lawfully made; or

b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof;

but evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private com­munication is not
inadmissible by reason only that the private communication is itself
inadmissible as evidence. [Emphasis added.]

For the reasons I have already given in the Wiretap Reference,
it is my view that Parliament did not intend in Part IV.1 of the Criminal
Code to authorize the police to trespass to install a listening device.
Accordingly, an authorization does not implicitly carry with it a right of
entry to private premises. And equally, a judge does not possess any authority
to include a right of entry as a term of an authorization pursuant to s.
178.13(2).

No express authority to trespass to install the listening device
was even purportedly granted in the authorization and renewals obtained by the
police in this case. Since the authorizations do not

[Page 640]

implicitly permit the police to enter a place where they propose
to intercept oral communications, it follows that the two trespasses involving
1207 Nanton Avenue were not lawful.

The question to be resolved is whether the inter­ceptions of
private communications, accomplished by means of the illegal entry to install
the listening device, were ""lawfully made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1)
and hence admissible in evidence.

IV Admissibility of the Intercepted Conversations

ln R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272, the majority of
this Court held that the criterion for determin­ing the admissibility of
evidence was its relevance, not the manner in which it was obtained. Thus,
according to the majority, the fact that evidence had been unlawfully obtained
did not affect admissibility unless the evidence was highly pre-judicial and of
trifling weight. If the Wray rule were to apply, the conclusion that the
trespass to install the listening device was unlawful would not affect the
admissibility of the intercepted private communications.

It may be that s. 24(2)  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  will now modify the rule in Wray. I make no comment one way
or the other on that possibility. It cannot assist the appellants in the
present case. Quite aside from the Charter , however, it is clear that
Parliament has explicitly set aside the Wray rule in the context of
electronic surveillance by enacting s. 178.16(1) (a) which, it will be recalled,
makes a private conversation that has been intercepted inadmissible
unless the inter­ception was lawfully made. For purposes of Part IV.1,
therefore, not only is the manner in which evidence has been obtained relevant
for its admis­sibility, legality has become the sine qua non for
admissibility.

This Court has previously recognized in R. v. Commisso, [1983]
2 S.C.R. 121, that Parliament has enacted in s. 178.16 an exclusionary
rule which is an exception to the general rule that

[Page 641]

unlawfully obtained evidence is nevertheless ad­missible. The
issue in that case, simply put, was whether an authorization to intercept
private com­munications in respect of one offence was suffi­cient to render
lawful interceptions in respect of a different offence. The majority, speaking
through Lamer J., concluded it was; I wrote dissenting reasons for the minority
concluding it was not.

Of importance for the resolution of this case is the unanimous
agreement of the Court that only those private communications which have been
lawfully obtained may be admitted in evidence. Lamer J. recognized the
important concern for individual privacy that moved Parliament to enact s.
178.16, at p. 125:

In order to discourage unlawful invasions of the priva­cy of
citizens, Parliament not only made it an indictable offence but also enacted an
exclusionary rule which is an exception to the general rule that unlawfully
obtained evidence is nevertheless admissible.

To much the same effect, I wrote, at p. 134:

The unique legislative treatment of electronic surveillance
is a reflection of its nature. The modern technolo­gy is both powerful and
unobtrusive. The technology permits massive invasion of the privacy with ease.
It is also indiscriminate about the content of any communi­cation intercepted.
Parliament has determined that this potential constitutes a threat to
individual freedom and the right to privacy. The evidentiary rule of exclusion
fortifies the stipulation that interceptions of private communications are
illegal unless specified conditions are met.

In R. v. Dass, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 97 (Man.C.A.),
Huband J.A. took another view of this requirement of legality. Although holding
that Part IV.1 did not authorize a trespass, he concluded that evidence
obtained thereby was admissible. The essence of his reasoning appears at pp.
115-16:

The fact that there has been a trespass or some other civil
or, indeed, criminal wrong in the planting of the device does not invalidate
the authorization to intercept, and thus does not render the interception
unlawful. The authorization granted by the court is an authorization to

[Page 642]

intercept private communications. How that authoriza­tion is
carried out is not germane to the issue of the admissibility of the evidence
flowing from the intercep­tion. If a trespass has been committed, then those
who have committed the trespass will be answerable in some other criminal or
civil forum.

... if a trespass is committed the evidence thus obtained will
be admissible (subject to the usual rules governing admissibility), since it
was obtained pursuant to an authorization and thus falls under the second of
the four exceptions to the general prohibition against intercep­tions contained
ins. 178.11(2).

The installation of the device is not part of the intercep­tion.
If the installation is unlawful, in that there has been a contravention of
civil or criminal law in the placement of the device, the lawfulness of the
intercep­tion is not affected.

With respect, I cannot agree. In my view Huband J.A.’s
conclusions, which were applied by the majority of the Court of Appeal in this
case, conflict both with the express language of Part IV.l and with the
statutory scheme thereby enacted.

As mentioned earlier, it may well be true, as Huband J.A.
asserts, that a trespass in planting the listening device does not invalidate
the authori­zation to intercept. At most, however, this would allow the person
making the interception to avail himself of s. 178.11(2) in order to avoid
criminal liability for what would otherwise be an indictable offence under s.
178.11(1). With respect, this does not however lead to the conclusion
that the inter­ception was therefore rendered lawful. I see no reason in the
language or in the purpose of Part 1V.I to read the provision in s.
178.16(1)(a) that an interception must be ""lawfully made"" as
refer-ring only to lawfulness in obtaining the authoriza­tion. On the contrary,
in view of the fact that such evidence is prima facie inadmissible and
that the subsection is to be found in the context of a meticulously articulated
set of provisions permitting only a limited breach of the individual’s right of
privacy, these words should be given their full and literal meaning.

[Page 643]

It seems manifest to me that Parliament intended any breach of
the right of privacy, protected by Part IV.1, be lawful in the widest sense. In
my view, absent a valid consent, the surreptitious physical invasion of a home
when undertaken by police for the purposes of installing, maintaining,
repairing, or removing room monitoring devices renders any private
communication that has been intercepted not ""lawfully made"", within
the mean­ing of s. 178.16(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

In my opinion, it is not possible to separate the installation of
the listening device from the process of listening to and recording
conversations, so as to include only the latter in the process of intercep­tion.
This is an artificial and unrealistic distinc­tion. That interception must go
beyond mere lis­tening and recording not only conforms with common sense, it is
a necessary consequence of the wording of s. 178.16(l). The section demands
that the interception be lawfully made. It is the whole process of
interception which is referred to and that must therefore be lawful.
Installation is indis­pensible to interception. It must on any reasonable
reading be part of the making of an interception. An interception
accomplished by means of an unlawful entry cannot have been ""lawfully
made"".

The New Brunswick Court of Appeal has recently reached the same
conclusion on the admissibility of any private communication obtained as a
result of an illegal entry: R. v. Hardy (1984), 56 N.B.R. (2d) 417, 146
A.P.R. 417. In Hardy, the authorization given by the judge expressly
permitted the police to enter the Hardy residence ""where reasonably
necessary"" for the interception of oral communications. The police had
surreptitiously entered and planted a room-monitoring device which allowed them
to intercept the private communications in issue.

Stratton J.A. (Hughes C.J. concurring), decided that Part IV.1 of
the Code did not give any express authority to a judge to authorize a
trespass onto private property for the purpose of installing lis­tening
devices, nor could such authority be

[Page 644]

implied. He concluded the illegal entry of the law enforcement
officers into the Hardy residence ren­dered the intercepted private
communications inadmissible.

In reaching-this conclusion, he made the follow­ing comment,
upon the case at bar and the Dass case, with which I am in respectful
agreement:

As I read these decisions, they seem to turn on a narrow
interpretation of the word ""interception"" so that the conduct of the
police in installing monitoring devices is not part of the interception. I have
difficulty in agreeing with the interpretation that ""interception""
does not include the method of its execution. Rather, I would respectfully
adopt the dissenting view of Anderson, J.A. in the Lyons case that the
""interception"" of a private communication includes not merely the
listening to or recording of a private communication but also the means used to
acquire the private communication.

Angers J.A., in separate reasons, decided that it lay within the
power of a judge acting under s. 178.13 to authorize entry, however, the
particular wording of the authorization was not sufficiently clear to satisfy
him that the entry the police had actually made was authorized by the order
grant-ed. He agreed that the interception was not lawful­ly made and the evidence
was inadmissible.

In R. v. Papalia (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 289, the
Ontario Court of Appeal did not need to decide the question of whether an
unlawful interception renders the private communication so obtained
inadmissible. The unanimous Court held that an authorization, by necessary
implication, carries with it the power to trespass to install a listening
device and therefore the interceptions in issue were lawfully made. It is
notable, however, that Brooke J.A. agreed with the conclusion of Anderson J.A. in
the instant case, that the installation of the listening device is part of the
interception process.

[Page 645]

V Conclusion

I conclude that, as a result of the two covert entries, the
interceptions of conversations at 1207 Nanton Avenue were not ""lawfully
made"" within the meaning of s. 178.16(1)(a) and ought there-fore not to
have been admitted as evidence. It follows that the appellants were convicted
on the basis of inadmissible evidence and I would accord­ingly allow the
appeals and direct new trials for each of the appellants.

The judgment of Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ. was
delivered by

ESTEY J.-The appellants were convicted on a charge of conspiring
to import cocaine into Canada contrary to s. 423(1)(d) of the Criminal Code
of Canada. The issue raised in this appeal turns on the admission into
evidence of intercep­tions made pursuant to an authorization granted under s. 178.13
of the Criminal Code. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
need not be addressed as the trial in this case arose prior to its
proclamation. The interception evidence was obtained pursuant to an
authorization issued by Bouck J. on August 25, 1977 and pursuant to a
subsequent authorization issued by Toy J. on December 16, 1977. The appeal
proceeded in the Court of Appeal and in this Court on the basis of an agreed
statement of facts in which the following salient facts are set forth:

On November 2, 1977, police officers entered the residence
of the Appellant LYONS (which was also, on occasion, that of the Appellant PREVEDOROS),
at 1207 Nanton Avenue, in the City of Vancouver, for the purpose of installing
a device which would permit them to monitor and record oral communications
taking place within the premises.

On December 19, 1977, police officers entered 1207 Nanton
Avenue for the purpose of replacing the batter­ies powering the transmitter and
also to look for a place to install another such device.

The police had not obtained permission of anyone connected
with 1207 Nanton Avenue to enter that residence

[Page 646]

on November 2 and December 19, 1977. They relied solely on
the Authorizations and Renewals which they had obtained.

The regularity in substance and in form of the authorizing orders
is not under challenge. The sole issue arising is whether or not the entry into
the premises of the accused Lyons for the purpose of installing a radio
transmitter and subsequently to renew its batteries rendered inadmissible
evidence of the interceptions subsequently made pursuant to these
authorizations.

The authorization of August 25, after setting out the offences in
respect of which private com­munications may be intercepted, provided:

b) The type of private communications that may be
intercepted are all telecommunications and oral communications.

c) The identities of the known persons whose private
communications may be intercepted are,

(i) Kristine LYONS 1207 Nanton Avenue Vancouver, British
Columbia

The order then continued:

d) The private communications of persons whose iden­tities
are not known as of the date hereof which may be intercepted are,

those persons who resort to or use the premises described in
sub-paragraph (c) hereof, or

those persons who are in communication with the persons
described in sub-paragraph (c) hereof apparently with respect to an offence
mentioned in paragraph (a) hereof

which private communications may be intercepted at any of
the premises hereinbefore described and any place or premises in the Province
of British Columbia resorted to or used by the persons described in
sub-paragraph (c) hereof and in respect of any place of which a general
description cannot be given the manner of interception that may be used is
interception by means of any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device. The private communications of such per-sons as described whose
identities are unknown at the date hereof may be intercepted during the period
for which this authorization is valid notwithstanding that during such period
their identities may become known.

[Page 647]

It will be noted that in subparagraph (d) the order provided that
"" …. the manner of interception that may be used is interception by means
of any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device"". The order
of Toy J. also authorized the interception of the private communications of the
appellant Lyons as well as the appellants Pre­vedoros and McGuire. This order
differs somewhat from the first authorization in matters not conse­quential to
these proceedings.

The trial judge admitted ten interceptions made with respect to
the appellants and others from November 6, 1977 to December 30, 1977.

The majority of the Court of Appeal [(1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 318]
speaking through Hinkson J.A., after reviewing the judgment of this Court in Goldman
v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 976, concluded at p. 328 that "" …. even
where the police have committed a trespass to install a room-monitoring device,
…. the evidence is admissible"". The majority also concluded at p. 329:

When in the course of doing so the police commit acts which
amount to wrongful acts, such acts may give rise to civil or criminal
proceedings against them. But such acts do not vitiate the court order
authorizing the inter­cept. Therefore the evidence is admissible pursuant to s.
178.16(1) of the Code.

Anderson J.A. dissented for the reason that an interception
pursuant to an authorization is only admissible as evidence if it is
""lawfully made"" in the words of s. 178.16(1)(a), infra, of the
Criminal Code and that such is not the case where the
interception results from trespass.

In my opinion, an ""interception"" is only
""lawfully made"" if it is made in accordance with the authorization
granted. The ""interception"" of a ""private communica­tion"" is
not merely ""listening to or recording a private communication"" but
includes the means used to ""acquire"" the ""private
communication""... .

Furthermore, Anderson J.A. was of the view that the authorizing
court had no power to authorize

[Page 648]

the police to act in an unlawful manner and conse­quently,
whether or not the order expressly author­ized or implicitly permitted
trespass, the result is the same: the evidence obtained by the intercep­tion is
inadmissible. In part this conclusion was reached by interpreting the words
""manner of interception"" as they are found in s.
178.13(2)(c) to mean ""a lawful manner of interception"". The position
in dissent is succinctly stated, at p. 348:

In summary, I would hold as follows:

(I) Private communications are not admissible unless
""the interceptions were lawfully made"", namely, in accordance with
the authorizations granted.

(2) The ""interception"" process includes the mode
of execution or procedure set out in the authorization including the
installation and maintenance of moni­toring devices.

(3) A police officer does not act in accordance with an
authorization when he carries out the instructions of the authorizing judge in
an unlawful manner, namely, by unlawfully trespassing to install and maintain
the monitoring devices.

The determination of the issue raised in this appeal depends upon
the construction placed upon Part IV.I, particularly ss. 178.l, 178.11, 178.12,
178.13 and 178.16 of the Criminal Code. These provisions are as follows:

178.1 In this Part,

""authorization"" means an authorization to
intercept a private communication given under section 178.13 or subsection
178.15(2);

""intercept"" includes listen to, record or acquire
a communication or acquire the substance, meaning or purport thereof;

""private communication"" means any oral communica­tion
or any telecommunication made under circum­stances in which it is reasonable
for the originator thereof to expect that it will not be intercepted by any
person other than the person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

[Page 649]

178.11 (1) Every one who, by means of an elec­tromagnetic,
acoustic, mechanical or other device, wilfully intercepts a private
communication is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to impris­onment
for five years.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to

(a) a person who has the consent to intercept,
express or implied, of the originator of the pri­vate communication or of the
person intended by the originator thereof to receive it;

(b) a person who intercepts a private communica­tion in
accordance with an authorization or any person who in good faith aids in any
way a person whom he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe is acting
with any such authorization;

(c) a person engaged in providing a telephone, telegraph or
other communication service to the public who intercepts a private
communication,

(i) if such interception is necessary for the purpose of
providing such service,

(ii) in the course of service observing or random monitoring
necessary for the purpose of mechanical or service quality control checks, or

(iii) if such interception is necessary to protect the
person’s rights or property directly related to providing such service; or

(d) an officer or servant of Her Majesty in right of Canada
in respect of a private communication intercepted by him in the course of
random moni­toring that is necessarily incidental to radio fre­quency spectrum
management in Canada.

178.12 (1) An application for an authorization shall be made
ex parte and in writing to a judge of a superior court of criminal
jurisdiction, or a judge as defined in section 482 and shall be signed by the
Attorney General of the province in which the application is made or the
Solicitor General of Canada or an agent ….

(b) the Attorney General of a province personal­ly, in
respect of any other offence in that province,

[Page 650]

and shall be accompanied by an affidavit which may be sworn
on the information and belief of a peace officer or public officer deposing to
the following matters, namely:

c) the facts relied upon to justify the belief that an
authorization should be given together with particulars of the offence;

d) the type of private communication proposed to be
intercepted;

e) the names, addresses and occupations, if known, of all
persons, the interception of whose private communications there are reasonable
and probable grounds to believe may assist the inves­tigation of the offence, a
general description of the nature and location of the place, if known, at which
private communications are proposed to be intercepted and a general description
of the manner of interception proposed to be used;

178.13… .

(2) An authorization shall

(a) state the offence in respect of which private
communications may be intercepted;

(b) state the type of private communication that may be
intercepted;

(c)state the identity of the persons, if known, whose
private communications are to be inter­cepted, generally describe the place at
which private communications may be intercepted, if a general description of
that place can be given, and generally describe the manner of interception that
may be used;

(d) contain such terms and conditions as the judge considers
advisable in the public interest; and

(e) be valid for the period, not exceeding sixty days, set
forth therein.

178.16 (1) A private communication that has been intercepted
is inadmissible as evidence against the originator of the communication or the
person intended by the originator to receive it unless

(a) the interception was lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly con­sented to the admission thereof;

[Page 651]

but evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of
information acquired by interception of a private communication is not
inadmissible by reason only that the private communication is itself
inadmissible as evidence.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the judge or magistrate
presiding at any proceedings may refuse to admit evidence obtained directly or
indirectly as a result of information acquired by interception of a private
communication that is itself inadmissible as evidence where he is of the
opinion that the admis­sion thereof would bring the administration of jus­tice
into disrepute.

(3) Where the judge or magistrate presiding at any
proceedings is of the opinion that a private communication that, by virtue of
subsection (1), is inadmissible as evidence in the proceedings

(a) is relevant to a matter at issue in the proceedings, and

(b) is inadmissible as evidence therein by reason only of a
defect of form or an irregularity in procedure, not being a substantive defect
or irregularity, in the application for or the giving of the authorization
under which such private com­munication was intercepted,

he may, notwithstanding subsection (1), admit such private
communication as evidence in the proceedings.

Part IV.1 was introduced into the Criminal Code by
1973-74 (Can.), c. 50. There were sub­stantial amendments enacted in 1976-77
(Can.), c. 53. That which concerns this appeal is the amendment to
s. 178.13(2), supra, which prior to 1977 read:

178.13.. .

(2) An authorization shall

…

(c) state the identity of the persons, if known, whose
private communications are to be inter­cepted and where the identity of such
persons is not known, generally describe the place at which private
communications may be intercepted or, if a general description of that place
cannot be given, generally describe the manner of intercep­tion that may be
used;

It will be seen that prior to the amendment, it was only
necessary to describe the place where the

[Page 652]

interception was to be undertaken where the iden­tity of the
persons whose private communications were to be intercepted was unknown. More
impor­tantly, it was only necessary to generally describe the manner of
interception when the place of interception could not be given. Under the
present form of the subsection, all this information must be given and the
obligation to advise as to the manner of interception is not conditional upon
any other knowledge or information in the possession of the person seeking the
authorization. This would appear to reveal a much more specific legis­lative
intent with reference to the breadth of au­thority assigned by Parliament to
the court in granting interception authorizations, and a com­mensurate
entitlement in and a burden on the court to know the scope of investigation to
be authorized.

The plan of Part IV.1, the ""Invasion of Privacy""
provisions of the Criminal Code, is directed both to protecting, and to
invading, the privacy of the individual. The very presence of Part IV.1 in the Code
is a recognition of these opposing needs in relation to criminal law which,
of course, falls exclusively in the domain of Parliament under s. 91(27) of the
Constitution Act. By the 1973-74 enactment of Part IV.l, Parliament
extended to the Criminal Code some provisions with reference to
interception of communications which thereto-fore were found in part in the Radio
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. R-1, and these coupled with extensive provisions which
take a much broader approach to the matter of privacy form a mini-Code, Part
IV.1, under the heading ""Invasion of Privacy"".

Much has been written about the proper con­struction and
application of Part IV.l of the Code. lt is unnecessary to review the
ground covered by this Court in Goldman, supra, and by the Ontario Court
of Appeal in R. v. LeSarge (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 388, and R. v.
Welsh and lannuzzi (No. 6) (1977), 15 O.R. (2d) l, 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363, 74
D.L.R. (3d) 748. The very issue facing the Court in this appeal arose in the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Dass, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 97 where that
Court concluded (per Huband J.A., at p. 115):

[Page 653]

The fact that there has been a trespass or some other civil or,
indeed, criminal wrong in the planting of the device does not invalidate the
authorization to intercept, and thus does not render the interception unlawful.
The authorization granted by the court is an authorization to intercept private
communications. How that authoriza­tion is carried out is not germane to the
issue of the admissibility of the evidence flowing from the intercep­tion. If a
trespass has been committed, then those who have committed the trespass will be
answerable in some other criminal or civil forum.

With respect, I do not accept the reasoning which leads to this
conclusion. The process of intercep­tion is a single undertaking carried out
under the authorization orders of the court and cannot be segmented into
legally consequential and legally inconsequential steps. The interception must
be carried out in conformity with the Code and the orders issued
thereunder in order to qualify the material received on interception for
admission as evidence. The evidence in issue here may therefore be admissible
under the provisions of s. 178.16 if the Court is empowered, expressly or by
necessary implication, to authorize the placing of the trans­mitting device by
entry into these private premises and if the authorization here expressly or by
neces­sary implication grants authority so to do. Neither Part IV.1 nor the
orders herein issued expressly authorize entry by the officers into the
premises mentioned in the order for the installation of the radio device. The
question therefore reduces itself to this: can the terms of Part IV.1 and the
authori­zations be properly construed as permitting the installation of this
radio device in the manner outlined above? Presuming the implied authority can
properly be found in the sections of the Code and the court orders, the
evidence would be admissible.

For convenience I repeat the definition of ""pri­vate
communication"" in s. 178.1 of the Code:

""private communication"" means any oral communica­tion
or any telecommunication made under circum­stances in which it is reasonable
for the originator thereof to expect that it will not be intercepted by any

[Page 654]

person other than the person intended by the origina­tor
thereof to receive it.

That definition includes the word ""telecommunica­tion""
which in turn is defined in the Radio Act, supra, s. 2, the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, s. 28, the Canadian Radio-television
and Telecommunications Commission Act, 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 49, s. 2 as:

""telecommunication"" means any transmission,
emission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or
intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual or other electromagnetic
system.

In s. 287(2) of the Criminal Code the words ""by
wire"" are omitted. The offence of interception of a private communication
refers to interception ""by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic,
mechanical or other device"". The expression ""electromagnetic,
acoustic, mechanical or other device"" was in turn defined in s. 178.1 as:

""electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other
device"" means any device or apparatus that is used or is capable of being
used to intercept a private communi­cation....

The definition of ""telecommunication"" refers to the
"" . . . reception of . . . sounds . . . by . . . radio, visual or other
electromagnetic system"".

It was not argued that the transmitter planted by the police in
the premises of the appellant Lyons was not ""an electromagnetic ...
device"". It was also not challenged that the operation of the device
produced a transcript of a ""private com­munication"".
It is also either agreed or not contested that the authorizations complied with
paras. (a) and (b) of s. 178.13(2); and that each order authorized the
""interception by means of any elec­tromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or
other device"".

This then brings one to s. 178.16 to determine whether or not the
intercepted private communica­tion is admissible as evidence ""against the
origina­tor of the communication"". Admissibility only
results if:

[Page 655]

(a) the interception was lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or the person intended by the
originator to receive it has expressly consented to the admission thereof.

We are concerned only with para. (a) and particu­larly with the
words ""lawfully made"". We are not concerned with subs. (3) of this
section because it was not argued nor indeed could it have been argued in these
circumstances that an unauthor­ized entry, if that is the correct description
in law of the action taken here, is ""an irregularity in procedure"".
The second issue therefore reduces itself to an interpretation and application
in the circumstances of this appeal of the words ""lawful­ly made"". In
reality this is only an independent issue if the words mean something other
than `made in accordance with Part IV.1 of the Code’.

Before examining these Code provisions in detail a word
should be said about trespass, a subject prominent in the submissions in this
Court and in the judgments below. Trespass, in its broad scope, is but one of
the considerations which must be taken as having been within parliamentary con­templation
in the adoption of these extensive meas­ures. Trespass in its most ancient
form, more properly trespass vi et armis (by force and arms), involved
direct interference with the person. Even­tually other forms of trespass, in
particular tre­spass quare clausum fregit (involving the physical act of
breaking the ""close"" around the individual’s land or premises), and trespass
de bonis asportatis (relating to personal property) were developed to cover
certain particular wrongs. The action for trespass gradually expanded to
embrace wrongs suffered as the result of the exercise of indirect force. The
ancient form of trespass also gave rise to the ""action on the case""
and from this the concept of intellectual trespass developed, thus further
extending the plaintiff’s rights with respect to indirect or non-physical
wrongs. From the fertile ground of trespass likewise sprang the action in assumpsit
from which in turn came the present action in contract. In the simple
Anglo-Saxon community the breach of a recognized right was a

[Page 656]

trespass, including the right to rely on another’s promise.

Eventually, trespass was narrowed down in the common law to the
immediate damage caused by the act complained of, whereas consequential injury
was identified as an action upon the case: Fifoot, History and Sources of
the Common Law: Tort and Contract (1949), at p. 185; Fleming, The Law of
Torts (6th ed. 1983), at p. 15. In the circumstances arising in this case,
one must be concerned with the consequences, if any, of trespass above the
surface of the land, that is in open space. Whether mere entry into air space
amounts to trespass has been a matter of some debate in the law. An earlier
general rule stating that an action did arise under the maxim that breach of
the close includes its vertical extension has been referred to as a
""fanciful phrase"" of ""dubious ancestry"":
Fleming, The Law of Torts, supra, at p. 42. It has, for example, been
deter-mined that firing objects across property in air space was not actionable
unless as a nuisance: Clifton v. Bury (1887), 4 T.L.R. 8; whereas
if the object and, perhaps, in the alternative, the force, contacted a surface,
the action was in trespass: Pickering v. Rudd (1815), 4 Camp. 219, at p.
220, per Lord Ellenborough. In more modern writings, the action of
trespass has been assigned to a lesser function in the field of tort giving
rise to a remedy only for material damage sustained by an occupier as the
direct result ""of another’s activity involving an entry,
whether personal or by means of animate or inanimate objects"":
Fleming, The Law of Torts, supra, at p. 36. Trespass is largely the subject
of civil law rather than criminal law (see Glanville Williams, Textbook of
Criminal Law (1978), p. 894).

We are not here directly concerned, be it remembered, with
determining whether the con-duct of those who invoked the authorization order
and intercepted these personal communications was either tortious or criminal.
We are only concerned

[Page 657]

with the admissibility of the information thereby harvested.

lt is generally an acceptable starting point in examining
legislation involving the invasion of individual rights to restate Semayne’s
Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91 a. The invasion here is of privacy and this
concerns both the personal aspects and the property aspects of privacy. The
inviolable nature of the private dwelling is a basic part of our free society.
This concept has long been a bulwark against tyranny of the state be it
organized as an absolute monarchy or as a democratic state under a
constitutional monarch. Indeed for three hun­dred years the concept that a
person’s home is his castle has been the defence of the citizen in an endless
variety of challenges brought against him in the name of the state. Semayne has
been the shrine of his or her privacy. The concept recog­nizes an internal
security but also an external dependence. The home is not a castle in
isolation; it is a castle in a community and draws its support and security of
existence from the community. The law has long recognized many compromises and
outright intrusions on the literal sense of this concept: for example, the right
of the community to search on proper authorization; the right of pursuit; the
right of eminent domain; the right of the community in applying zoning
restrictions and safety standards; the compulsory participation in community
established health facilities including sewer and water systems; and many more.
Most of these intrusions carry inspection rights of varying modes and degrees.
As Dickson J. (as he then was) put it in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 739, at p. 743:

there are occasions when the interest of a private
individual in the security of his house must yield to the public interest, when
the public at large has an interest in the process to be executed.

The community interest in crime detection and suppression also
inevitably entails intrusion on the castle concept. Part IV.1 is a recognition
of the technical realities of the age of communications as they affect crime
detection and prevention in particular,

[Page 658]

and the right to privacy in general. It represents a balance
selected by Parliament of these conflicting concepts and interests. Intrusion
into privacy is an obvious and inevitable concomi­tant of an authorized crime
detection procedure. Explicitness is a requirement before legislation may
properly be found to be intrusive of these basic rights. However, the need to
express the obvious is not present in the canons of statutory interpretation.

There are four general interception procedures available under
the definition of authorized devices under Part lV.1 which are widely discussed
in the literature in this country and in the United States concerning the
subject of interception of personal communications. These four procedures are:

(a) telephone wiretapping;

(b) radio eavesdropping;

(c) acoustic eavesdropping, active and passive; and,

(d) microwave and laser beam eavesdropping.

Telephone wiretapping in some forms requires personal entry by
the interceptor into the designated premises for the purpose of installing
equipment. Radio eavesdropping, involving the use of trans­mitters, necessarily
involves personal entry into the designated premises for the purpose of their
instal­lation in the vicinity of the anticipated personal communications.
Active acoustic devices and microwave and laser beam eavesdropping neces­sarily
entail the direction into and onto the desig­nated premises of energy in the
form of electro­magnetic waves, or acoustical waves in the case of acoustic
devices. Thus, all forms of eavesdropping (other than passive acoustic
eavesdropping by means of parabolic and other like microphones) entail either
the personal entry into the premises by the interceptor or his collaborators
for the purpose of installing equipment; or the invasion of the premises in
question by directing at those premises energy in the form of electromagnetic
waves. It should be added in connection with acoustic interception that
acoustic eavesdropping,

[Page 659]

unassisted by long-range reception devices, also entails personal
entry into premises or onto the land immediately adjoining for the purpose of overhearing
conversations. That is the procedure of interception of personal communications
in its oldest and most basic form.

Where the intercept is done by means of inter­cepting telephone
wires leading to and from the premises, no personal entry by the interceptor is
necessarily made into the named premises. For an interception to be made by
means of a radio device, the device, a small transmitter, must be placed inside
the premises where it is anticipated that the private communication, that is
the conver­sation, will take place. A hybrid intervention occurs where personal
entry is made into the prem­ises for the purpose of inserting a device into the
telephone instrument on the premises which enables the interceptor, by
thereafter directing electrical energy into the building over the tele­phone
wires as and when desired, to ""electrically remove"" the telephone
from its hook and thereby convert the telephone into a room listening device
similar to a radio bug. Thereafter, the device can be turned on and off
repeatedly and indefinitely without any further personal entry by the intercep­tor.
Where the private communication is picked up and recorded by acoustical means,
that is by long-range directional acoustical devices, no personal entry is
necessarily required depending on the situs of the conversation being
intercepted. New modes of physical entry occur where the private com­munication
is intercepted by means of devices such as ""coherent lasers""
employing electromagnetic forces beamed onto and into buildings which record
and translate vibrations on window panes or walls so as to intercept
""private communications"" taking place inside the building. No
personal entry by the interceptor is required. (See Studies for the National
Commission for the Review of Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and
Electronic Surveillance, Washington: 1976 (""NWC Commission
Studies""), at p. 182, and Encyclopedia Britannica, Micropaedia,
Ready Ref­erence and Index, vol. III, at p. 841). Technically this is an entry
into or a trespass against the

[Page 660]

premises in question, particularly if the sensor is physically
attached to the outer wall of the prem­ises or a common wall between the
premises and another property. It would be a strange result indeed if a court
were required to construe the words of the section in such a way as to render
evidence inadmissible if obtained and recorded by radio, or if obtained by the
recording of vibrations in the enclosure of the premises by energy directed
from outside the lands and premises, but not if withdrawn from the building by
an invasive use of the telephone wires leading into the building or by
detection of vibrations in a common wall. Further-more, s. 178.11 throughout
refers to all manner of devices, acoustic, mechanical, electromagnetic
""and others"". By the clearest possible inference the authorization
may refer to and authorize the use of one or more of these devices.

Radio as a method of interception entails, in its most common
form, the installation of a transmitter at the site where the private
communication to be intercepted is to take place. By the definitions included
in and related to Part IV.1, radio is included in the authorized interception
techniques so that its use is embraced in the provisions which are necessarily
broad and in the terminology there employed which is designedly embracive of
these diverse techniques. As will be seen, a detailed analysis of the wording
of the section happily produces a result consonant with the general purport of
Part IV.1.

Wiretapping, the use of telephone wires and equipment by which
the telephone company provides telephone service to its subscribers, is per­haps
the most common interception procedure or device. Indeed, the expression
""wiretapping"" appears to be used generically in the present day
community to cover all manner of interception of private communications. Two
methods of eaves-dropping via telephone are described at p. 158 of the NWC
Commission Studies:

[Page 661]

Telephone audio eavesdropping can be accomplished by two
methods that involve connecting various electron­ic devices to this system
[i.e. the telephone system]. The first and most widely publicized method uses
wiretap paraphernalia which intercepts conversations directly from the
telephone wires and requires no entry into the target premises. The second
method is that which uses a portion of the telephone system for room
eavesdropping and usually requires physical entry into the premises.

Wiretapping is only feasible where telephone service is being
provided to the place where the interception is to be made. No mention of a
tele­phone number is made in the authorization of August 25, 1977. Telephone
numbers are men­tioned in the second authorization. A private com­munication
between persons named in the authori­zation and other persons includes by
definition an oral exchange or conversation which occurs by means of the
telephone situated on the premises identified in the authorization and the
telephone at the other end of the conversation. The authorized interceptor taps
into the pair of telephone wires coming out of the premises by attaching a
receiver somewhere on those wires outside the premises at a point where the
interceptor can listen to and, if desired, make a recording of the conversation
be­tween a person on the designated premises and a person situated somewhere
else and using the tele­phone service connected to those premises. The
telephone company, of course, is not authorized by the subscriber at either end
of the call to make use of or to permit use of the telephone wires and
equipment for this purpose. If the interceptor taps the wire at a point outside
the boundaries of the property identified in the authorization as the place
where the interception is to be made, then no trespass in the sense of personal
entry by the interceptor is committed against the property under surveillance.
The result, however, is that the voice of the person who participated in the
private communication inside the wiretapped premises has been overheard and
recorded without his knowl­edge or authority. The interceptor has by tele­phone
entered the privacy of the dwelling, or other place where the person is
situated, and recorded his or her private telephone conversation. The privacy
of the parties to the private communication

[Page 662]

has been invaded. If the interceptor tapped the lines of the
phone company without that com­pany’s consent, other violations of rights may
have occurred. As between the interceptor and the person whose private
communication has been intercepted, what has in reality occurred? The
interceptor has, through the agency of the tele­phone equipment, caused a
current, an electron flow, to be passed through equipment in use by the person
under investigation in a telephone subscri­ber’s dwelling so as to allow the
acoustical waves produced by the person using the phone to be impressed in
analogue form on the current in the phone wires. The current bearing in
electrical ana­logue the acoustic waves produced by the voice of the
interceptee leaves the premises and travels to the point where the interceptor’s
equipment retrieves the signal and reconstitutes the voice of the interceptee
and that of the person at the other end of the telephone conversation, in
acoustic form. The interceptor can at the same time record the electrical
analogue for acoustical reproduction of the private communication at a later
time. A variation of this procedure enables the interceptor to send a current
into the premises by means of the telephone wires and thereby switch on the micro-phone
in the telephone unknown to the occupants so as to enable the interception of
any oral com­munications which occur in the vicinity of the electronically
activated telephone. By directing an electrical current into the premises, the
interceptor can, in effect, convert the telephone into a `bug’ for
eavesdropping in the room. For a more detailed description of the physical
events occurring during this process, see NWC Commission Studies, supra, at
p. 160; and David Watt, Law of Elec­tronic Surveillance in Canada
(1979), at pp. 181-84. No one suggested in this Court, none of the courts
below has suggested, and no case has been drawn to the attention of this Court,
where it has been decided that this process would not be within the terms of
Part IV.1 or that this most common of all interception procedure could not be
authorized under Part IV.1. Yet there has been the clearest trespass against
the premises, in the civil law sense of that term, by the deliberate direction
of an electrical current into those premises in order to transport out of the
premises the private communication

[Page 663]

of the person speaking inside the prem­ises. All of this was
unauthorized by the telephone company, by the subscriber to the telephone
service, or by the person whose private communica­tion was, by this device,
intercepted. The electrical current acts as a boomerang thrown across the
subscriber’s property and retrieved by the intercep­tor after it has picked up
the personal communica­tions of any inhabitants. The electronic equivalent
employing physical force in the form of an electric current nonetheless amounts
to an ancient trespass quare clausum fregit. Parliament has clearly
granted authority for issuance of an authorization to intercept, in this
manner, private communica­tions at designated premises. Nothing in the Code requires
the consent of the telephone company whose system is thus invaded by the
interceptor.

The same result can be achieved by the use of acoustical, light
or radio waves originated and received by the interceptor off the lands and
prem­ises described in the surveillance authorization. See a compendium of such
techniques gathered in the NWC Commission Studies, supra, at p. 152, and
pp. 168-83. Again the result in law is simple civil trespass on the property
named in the authori­zation unless the legislation has authorized such
procedures. Indeed, high intensity microwaves so employed must amount to
trespass to the person, entailing, as they do, physical discomfort and injury.
See NWC Commission Studies, supra, at p. 177. It follows, at least as
regards wiretapping and interception by energy directed into the prem­ises,
that no trespass occurs, and even if it does, it is authorized by Part IV.1 and
no cause of action arises.

Part IV.l contemplates at least three fundamen­tal processes or
devices which may be employed in the interception of a private communication:
elec­tromagnetic (radio, telephone and optical), acous­tic and mechanical
devices. There is no particular

[Page 664]

provision relating to each of these special types or forms of
communication. All are embraced in the same general provisions. It is therefore
clear that Parliament, in Part IV.1, is legislating with refer­ence to the
employment of any equipment or procedure relating to the electromagnetic spec­trum
(ranging as it does through the spectrum from radio waves to light waves), the
acoustic vibrations above or below and including the range of the human ear,
and to mechanical devices, for the purpose of intercepting oral (and other) com­munication
occurring anywhere. This is broad legislation embracing in these extensive
provisions the use of a wide range of radio, telephone, optical and acoustical
devices for listening to and record­ing private communications as broadly
defined. It is not ""wiretapping"" legislation,
nor eavesdropping legislation, nor radio regulation. It is the regula­tion of
all these things and ""any other device"" that may be used to intercept
intelligence reasonably expected by the originator not to be intercepted by anyone
other than the intended recipient. The scheme of regulation includes the
judicial authori­zation to intercept issued in response to a request for
permission to intercept personal communica­tions by any device contemplated by
the Code, supported by the requisite information as specified in the
regulation. Part IV.1 has authorized the use of all such procedures. They
involve the invasion of property by directed energy for the purpose of
extracting private communications occurring therein or thereon, yet no express
authorization of the essential ""entry"" on to the premises under
surveillance is to be found in the provisions. Parlia­ment should not be taken
to have authorized the use of procedures and equipment without, at the same
time, supplying the public officials undertak­ing these duties with the
appropriate means and authority to carry them out. This, in my view, Parliament
has done by authorizing the employment of apparatus, some of which necessarily
entails such forms of ""entry"".

[Page 665]

Part IV.1 did not issue from Parliament in an era of primitive
communications. It must be read and applied with an awareness of the community
it seeks to regulate. It was not the age of smoke signals or even simple
telephony into which these extensive regulations were launched. Neither are the
forces of criminal investigation, which are brought under the umbrella of these
regulations, faced with the simpler task of bygone days. Rather they are
contending with techniques employed by the criminal elements in a community
equipped with all the modern paraphernalia of electronic communications. The
reasonable needs of the com­munity for adequate crime detection services util­izing
modern technology, as well as the reasonable need of the community for
protection from these new techniques, are considerations which must have been
in the forefront of the parliamentary mind. Part IV.1 seeks to embrace these
twin reali­ties produced by modern interception techniques. At the same time,
Parliament must be assumed to have taken into account the size and complexity
of present-day criminal operations, particularly in the field of drug
trafficking. In my view, Parliament has clearly revealed in Part IV.1 an intent
to embrace all these conditions in a comprehensive network of regulations, and
in my reading of these provisions, it has succeeded in so doing.

Having established the offence of unauthorized interception of
personal communications, Part IV.1 proceeds to lay out the exceptions of
consent and authorization. The procedure prescribed for obtaining an
authorization is detailed in s. 178.12. The application must be made to a judge
of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction (other forums not here relevant
are omitted) by the Attorney General of a province or by the Solicitor General
of Canada or their respective agent, and shall be supported by an affidavit of
a peace officer or public officer setting forth the factual basis for the
belief that an authorization should be given together with particulars of the
offence under investigation, and ""the type of private com­munication …. to
be intercepted"". The affidavit is required to set out as well:

[Page 666]

(a) the person the interception of whose private
communication is believed on reasonable grounds may assist the investigation of
the offence in question;

(b) a general description of the nature and loca­tion of the
place (if known) ""at which private communications are proposed to be
intercepted""; and,

(c) ""a general description of the manner of inter­ception
proposed to be used"".

Section 178.13 provides the authority to the judge to issue the
authorization. There are two threshold considerations which must be met:

(a) that the authorization requested would be in the best
interests of the administration of justice; and,

(b) that other investigative procedures have been tried and
have failed, or would be unlikely to succeed, or the urgency is such that it
would be impractical to carry out the proposed investigation using only other
investigative procedures.

The authorization then must include;

(a) the identity of the person whose private com­munications
are to be intercepted if that be known;

(b) a general description of the place at which the private
communications may be intercepted if that can be done; and

(c) a general description of the manner of inter­ception
that may be used.

Finally, and in my view most importantly, s. 178.13(2)(d) directs
that the authorization shall ""contain such terms and conditions as the
judge considers advisable in the public interest"". The
foregoing are the terms of Part IV.1 which deal with the application for
authorization and the contents of the authorizing order itself.

Thus we come to the interception procedure employed in these
proceedings. The interceptor, acting under the authorization, deposited on the
premises named in the order as the place where the interception was to be made,
a battery-powered radio transmitter. This device performed the same

[Page 667]

function as the telephone in the simple wiretap example above.
The radio transmitter produced the same electrical analogue, albeit on a radio
frequency, as did the telephone microphone, and again the interceptor, by means
of a radio receiver located off the premises, converted the radio fre­quency
analogue back to an acoustical representa­tion of the private communication in
the same way as the interceptor did in the wiretap procedure described above.
In the first instance, the entry was committed by sending into the premises,
without any revealed authority from the owner of the premises or the owner of
the telephone system, an electrical current which transported the private
communication out of the premises. In another mode of interception mentioned
earlier, the inter­ceptor directed light or radio energy into and onto the
premises and made the interception of private communications by extracting such
communica­tions from the reflected energy returning to the interceptor. The
person who placed the radio transmitter in the premises entered and may have
thereby trespassed against the lands and premises of the owner or the person
entitled to possession. All these forms of transgression against the prem­ises
named in the authorization are inherently and obviously means contemplated in
Part IV.1 for invoking the authority granted by Parliament for the interception
of private communications if judi­cially authorized.

It is to be noted that when the owner or person entitled to
possession of the premises in question is not a person named in the
authorization as being under surveillance and is not the person whose private
communication is intercepted, other impor­tant considerations may arise but
with which nei­ther s. 178.16 nor this appeal are concerned. If none of the
persons named in the authorization has an interest in the property where the
interception is made, then there is no right in them to complain of the
trespass to real property as such a right is limited to the owner or person in
possession of the properties subjected to the trespass. There is no indication
on the record here whether the authori­zation names the owner or person in
possession as

[Page 668]

one of the persons whose private communications may be
intercepted.

In my view, the provisions of Part IVA when read as a whole
clearly contemplate, require and authorize, by necessary implication and
unavoid­able inference, the placing of a radio device on the premises at which
the intercept is to be made, where the use of radio equipment is authorized for
the interception of a private communication. I therefore would answer the
initial question, which arises at this point in the analysis of Part IV. 1, by
concluding that Parliament has thus empowered a court to authorize the use of a
radio device, such as was used here, for the purpose of intercepting a
designated private communication. Since the device could not otherwise function
as an intercep­tion ""device"", Parliament has cast the section broadly
so as to empower the court in its discretion to authorize the placing of the
""device"" inside the premises designated in the authorization whether
or not what would otherwise be a trespass to someone’s lands and premises may
occur and whether or not the owner of such lands and prem­ises is the person
whose private communication is to be intercepted. Once Parliament empowers a
court to authorize such action, and the court does so, there is no trespass in
law.

There are, of course, differences in magnitude in the potential
seriousness of the several interception procedures which Part IV.1 empowers a
court to authorize. For example, it is one thing for a judge to authorize the
arrogation by law enforcement officers of a person’s private phone lines for
purposes wholly unauthorized by the subscriber or the telephone company, for
the purpose of making an interception by telephonic means on the designated
premises. It is quite another thing to authorize an investigator to make
clandestine entry in the night into a private dwelling, perhaps owned by a
stran­ger to the alleged criminal activity. It takes no imagination to foresee
that serious consequences could follow. The public interest might be damaged
far out of proportion to any gain to the

[Page 669]

community in crime prevention and detection. These considerations
are discussed in the Report of the National Commission for the Review of
Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance, (Washington,
1976) (""NWC Report"", at pp. 42-44). In my view, all this was
foreseen by Parliament when it included s. 178.13(2)(d) which requires the
authorizing judge, when granting the authorization, to include in the
authorization ""such terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable
in the public interest"".

The issuing court must be alert to the need for a complete
demonstration of the necessity for the intercepting procedure. By its nature
the radio transmitter or bug picks up all communications in its area. It is
indiscriminate. Unlike the simple wiretap, all communications occurring in a
room or other area within its listening range are picked up and relayed to the
interceptor. It does not confine itself to telephone calls to or by designated
individuals. Its installation is a more serious inva­sion of privacy than the
basic wiretap installation. The latest studies in the United States indicate
that due to technical problems, unreliability of equipment and problems which
might arise upon the installation of the device, radio devices are seldom the
subject of authorization: see NWC Report, supra, at p. 44. The telephone
instrument, when modified to emulate a bug, raises the same considerations. The
nature of the place of intercep­tion may also require special precautions by
the authorizing court. Equally obvious is the danger associated with the use of
microwave and laser beams directed at the designated premises. The courts,
therefore, must perform carefully and thor­oughly their duty under s.
178.13(2)(d) and pre-scribe terms and conditions which may be advis­able in the
public interest under which these invasive devices may be installed. This
judicial function is the essential safeguard of the public interest in the
bilateral operations of Part IV.1 which must at once be both a shield against,
and an instrument for, the invasion of privacy. It is for the court to ensure
the balancing of these interests

[Page 670]

within the plan prescribed by Parliament.

Third party occupants of premises who are directly affected by
the installation of these devices, including those persons who may inno­cently
accost the installer, will be in the same position at law as individuals are
generally under the Code in their relationship to the law enforcement
process. Their rights in civil law are affected by these provisions of the Code
in the same way as in the case of investigative procedures elsewhere
established in the Code. Procedural and substan­tive criminal law has
long been construed in this country to include the regulation of direct and
inevitably related consequences of criminal law investigation activities. This
will include those per-sons who own or are entitled to be in possession of the
affected premises. Civil liability of the law enforcement authorities engaged
in the proper exercise of the authority granted under the order of
authorization is likewise affected and controlled by the provisions of the Criminal
Code. These provisions of the Code, s. 40, for example, will apply
to the performance of the duties under Part IV.1 of the law enforcement
agencies in the same manner as such provisions apply in the case of like
actions taken under other provisions of the Code by the criminal
investigating agencies.

The power of authorization being found to reside in the section,
the next question is to deter-mine if the authorizations issued by the judges
in these proceedings are sufficiently broad to empow­er the action taken by the
law enforcement officers in placing the radio apparatus in the private prem­ises
and in renewing the batteries in that apparatus on another occasion, both
involving personal entry into the premises designated in the authorization.

An application may or may not expressly state an intention to
enter the designated premises. In interpreting the order of authorization many
of the

[Page 671]

considerations bearing on the interpretation of the terms of Part
IV.1, already discussed, apply to the terms of the order issued. Much of the
terminology of the order, as here, cornes directly from Part IV.1. The request
by the investigating agency for the authorization in the first instance, as
also was the case here, will follow the form and content of s. 178.12 and the
other provisions of Part IV.1. The court will understand the identical language
used in the application as in the Act as carrying the same meaning and will
imply the same conse­quences. Thus a request to install, amongst other
apparatus, a radio device, will necessarily entail its installation in or upon
the designated premises. Where the premises are a dwelling or any place (other
than a hotel room, perhaps), entry for the purpose of installation is a
concomitant to the use of such a device. This is expressly stated or taken for
granted in the legal literature in the United States over the last twenty-five
years and in Canadian writings as well. Professor Stanley A. Cohen, Invasion
of Privacy (1983), at p. 193:

Room or house bugs should be available in appropriate
circumstances. Covert entry in order to install and remove such devices is a
necessary concomitant of such a grant of power.

The judge may in response to such application issue an order in
broad terms, as was done here, or may particularize a type of device or devices
and their mode of employment. Either type of order is foreseen by the wording
of ss. 178.12(1)(e) and 178.13(2)(c); that is, ""generally describe the
manner of interception that may be used"". Having regard to the pattern of
Part IV.l, the breadth of authority granted to the court, the importance of the
subject matter, and the vitality of the role of the court in the legislative
plan as the guardian of the public interest, explicit response by the court to
the application for authority to intercept in many cases will require the
prescription of ""terms and conditions advisable in the public
interest"" pursu­ant to para. (2)(d) of s. 178.13.

[Page 672]

The courts responsible for these orders of authorization must be
ever concerned with the impact of these orders on members of the commu­nity who
will obviously be directly affected by them. An order in general terms
following the wording of the appropriate subsection of Part IV.1 will not
invalidate the order or affect the admissi­bility of the evidence gathered.
Much to be pre­ferred, however, in many circumstances, would be a specific
description of the apparatus to be employed, the manner of interception, and
the terms and conditions appropriate to the action as revealed by the
information contained in the application for authority to intercept.

The authorization orders, supra, issued herein in my view
clearly authorized the interception of these private communications whose
admissibility is now in issue. The manner of interception ""that
may be used is interception by means of any electromagnetic, acoustic,
mechanical or other device"". This occurs in all the authorizing orders.
The persons whose private communications may be intercepted are those who
""resort to or use the premises"" described in the order. There is no
mention in the orders of Bouck J. or Toy J. that only private communications
which occur on the telephone on those premises may be intercepted. As already
observed, there are no telephone num­bers indicated for any of the premises at
which interception may be made in the authorization order of Bouck J. The
authorization being in the terms of the empowering section and not including
any limitation on the person authorized with refer­ence to the range of
electromagnetic devices which may be used, and there being no terms of the
authorizing order which exceed the authority granted under the Code, there
is no valid reason to read down the authority which permits the use of
electromagnetic devices and which devices include, as already discussed, the
radio apparatus here used. As already discussed, radio apparatus of this type
can only intercept private communications if installed in the premises. Of
simple necessity, therefore, is the result that installation of such a device
is permitted by the Code and in turn by the order. For the reasons
discussed above in connec­tion with the form and content and proper interpretation

[Page 673]

of Part IV. 1, I conclude that the orders herein issued by the
chambers judges, and under which the evidence in question was gathered, fully
comply with Part IV.1 and necessarily entail, by clear and irresistible
implication, the entry into the premises designated in the order for the
purpose of installing this radio device and the renewal batteries.

The third question remains to be answered: Is an interception
made by any or all of these means ""lawfully made"",
presuming the authorizing order in turn permits such interception? How much of
such conduct by criminal investigating forces can be authorized under Part
IV.I? Section 178.12(1)(e) and s. 178.13(2)(c) refer to ""the manner of
interception proposed to be used"" (in the former section) and
""the manner of intercep­tion that may be used"" (in the latter
section). The devices that may be used include ""electromagnetic
... or other device"". This clearly includes the ""device""
employed by the interceptor here, the radio transmitter. These provisions
clearly contem­plate the use of radio in these procedures. Had the police used
an intermediary or stool pigeon (such as an acquaintance or a person pretending
to be a utility company representative) to place the radio transmitter, usually
referred to as a bug, on the premises, a different kind of invasion of rights
might take place. If the stool pigeon were a friend or confidant or guest of
the person being investigated, neither a breach of the criminal law nor of any
right in the civil law which would give rise to a cause of action would appear
to have occurred. The private communication would be captured as was the case
here and transmitted out of the premises. The element of consent by one party
to the communication would, of course, be there present.

""Lawfully made"", in my respectful view,
refers to an interception made in accordance with the

[Page 674]

only authority to be found in the law, namely Part IV. I. An
interception made in conformity with an authorization, the terms of which
comply with Part IV. 1, is ""lawfully made"". No one has
suggested either in argument here or in any case cited that the legislative
sovereignty under s. 91(27) of the Constitution Act cannot support the
granting of a complete, lawful basis for an interception made by use of radio
in the manner here employed. The offence-creating provisions of Part IVA fall
within criminal substantive law, the evi­dence provisions fall within substantive
criminal law and criminal procedure, and the process of issuance of the
authorization falls within criminal procedure. Conversely, no suggestion has
been made that any provincial enactment could render unlawful an investigation
properly authorized under the Code provisions. No other federal legis­lation
to such effect has been identified. If the Code provision properly
construed empowers a judge to authorize an interception by means involving
personal entry (as I have found to be the case), the interception is, when made
pursuant to such authorization, ""lawfully made"".

What then is the effect in law of the entry into the premises by
the interceptor designated in the authorization for the installation of the
radio transmitter. Trespass is not by that name the subject of any
offence-creating provisions in the Criminal Code. Illegal entry of
private premises is of course the basis for offences in ss. 306, 307 and 308
(breaking and entering and being unlawfully in a dwelling house with intent to
commit an indictable offence). In the case of the latter sec­tion, the presence
in the house must be ""without lawful excuse"" but the entry need not
have been either a breaking or an entry with intent to commit an indictable
offence, so long as the latter intent is formed after entry. Section 73 of the Code
makes it an offence (forcible entry) to enter property in the possession of
another ""in a manner that is likely to cause a breach of the peace or
reasonable apprehension of a breach of the peace"". A provi­sion closer to
the circumstances here arising is found in s. 173 of the Code which
makes it an

[Page 675]

offence to ""loiter ... or prowl ... at night upon
the property of another person near a dwelling house situated on that property"".
Again the offence is conditional upon the presence by the accused on such
property ""without lawful excuse"". The resistance to a forcible entry
and trespass is authorized by ss. 40 and 41.

The term ""lawfully made"", when it appears in a
codification of criminal law, favours the conclusion that it means ""not
contrary to criminal law"". It would not be construed without something
more in the phrase, as meaning ""made in conformity with all
laws"". For example, it would be an extension of the ordinary
meaning of those words in their con-text in the Criminal Code to adopt
an interpreta­tion ruling the interception to be unlawfully made because it
contravened the laws of copyright; or because it invaded a civil right such as
the right to privacy; or indeed, because the act of interception constituted a
tort such as deceit or trespass where the tort in question has no presence in
the Crimi­nal Code in the form in which the tort in question was
committed. This would appear to be a proper interpretative approach for several
reasons. Sec­tions 178.12 and 178.13 authorize interception generally,
including by means of acoustic and elec­tromagnetic devices. Some of these
interception devices entail civil trespass falling short of person-al entry by
the interceptor onto the designated premises; others entail a preparatory
entry. As we have seen, today’s technology includes the inter­ception of oral
communications inside a private dwelling by directing into or onto that
dwelling, acoustic and electromagnetic waves, including light waves, and
electron streams over telephone and electricity lines. By means of this
activity across the premises in question, the interceptor is able to draw out
from the premises oral communi­cations conducted therein. The Criminal Code empowers
a court to authorize such procedures. It is unreasonable, in my view, to read
s. 178.16 of Part IV.1, a mini-Code of interception regulation, as rendering
the content of such interception inad­missible by reason of the fact that the
use of

[Page 676]

almost all of those procedures entails a mode of entry into the
premises amounting in civil law to trespass.

By virtue of s. 178.11, the interception is crimi­nal if it
amounts to a wilful interception of a private communication. The issue on
admissibility then resolves itself into the simple question: does the personal
entry into the premises of the inter­ceptor, for the purpose of installing the
device, amount to a breach of Part IV.l, namely s. 178.11? That, in turn, takes
the inquiry into ss. 306 and 307, supra, and to the other sections of
the Code discussed in connection with those sec­tions. By those
provisions the offence is committed if entry is made with intent to commit an
indict-able offence. This requirement in turn leads back to s. 178.11 and the
question as to whether the intended interception was ""lawful"",
and whether it is authorized under ss. 178.12 and 178.13. The trail is equally
circular if one starts the inquiry at s. 73 or s. 173 of the Code, supra.

Further support for my conclusions may be found by considering s.
287 of the Criminal Code which provides in part:

287. (1) Everyone commits theft who fraudulently,
maliciously, or without colour of right,

(b) uses any telecommunication facility or obtains any
telecommunication service.

Section 287(2) of the Code repeats virtually ver­batim the
definition of ""telecommunication"", which we have already found in
other federal legislation, supra. The interceptor, in the ordinary
wiretap interception, ""uses [a] telecommunication facility"".
It is arguable that he has done so ""with-out colour of
right"" unless Part IV.1 by necessary implication authorizes the
""use"" of such ""telecom­munication"" facility. Whether the
officer has ""used"" the telecommunication facility may be a matter of
debate. In the simple factual sense, he has done so by connecting his
interception device

[Page 677]

to the phone wires which he then ""uses"" to acti­vate
(or ""actuate"" as it appears in the United States
literature, supra) his receiver. The intercep­tor, at the same time, is
""using"" the whole tele­communication facility including the telephone
instrument in the designated premises, the. tele­phone at the other
end of the line, and the connect­ing wires, as well as any intermediate
telephone exchanges and equipment through which the voice path may pass. It is
only because the interceptor does not speak and that he is not a subscriber
that he could not be said to ""use"" the telecommunica­tion facility.
It would be difficult for an accused who connected receiving equipment to the
""tele­communications facility"" (the telephone wires) in order to
record data passing over the system, to deny a ""use"" of such facility
only because the accused has not made use of the facility’s voice communication
capacity.

It might be argued that the interceptor acted ""without
colour of right"". Here the use of tele­phone tapping apparatus is not
expressly granted. If the interceptor may make a wiretap under colour of right
with a wiretapping device, so it may be that the radio transmitter was
installed ""with colour of right"". If that is so, the authorization
may be the basis for defence under s. 287. It would be curious if that were so,
but still not a ""lawful"" basis for the making of an
interception under s. 178.11(1).

The Radio Act raises similar problems. The use of a radio
transmitter, which is the bug in these proceedings, is prohibited by that Act
unless li­censed under the statute. There is nothing to indi­cate any authority
under the Radio Act for the interceptor here to operate this
transmitter, nor is there any claim that the device is exempt under s. 3(2) of
the Act by reason of its limited power. All these considerations go to the test
of admissibility of evidence so received under s. 178.16(1), that is

[Page 678]

""was the interception lawfully made?"" Similarly the
term ""lawfully"" cannot mean in accordance with any and all laws. The Copyright
Act might be infringed by recording some private communica­tions. This
would not render the evidence inad­missible, and nor would interception by
means which might give rise to a cause of action in civil law. I conclude that
""lawfully made"" means made in accordance with Part IV.l,
""Invasion of Priva­cy"", the mini-Code regulating the manner and
extent of invasion.

Part IV.1 was recently before the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Papalia (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 289. In those proceedings the authorization
order expressly authorized entry into ""such places as may be necessary in
order to install, monitor and remove any electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical
or other devices ...."" The manner of interception there authorized was
""by the use of audio trans­mitter and receiver, an electromagnetic,
acoustic device sometimes referred to as a microphone and amplifier installed
at or near ... "" the designated premises. Acting under this authorization,
radio devices were installed in two automobiles and an electromagnetic device
was connected to telephone wires inside the designated premises so as to use
that instrument for the interception of private communications in the same
manner as in the case of a radio bug. Covert entry was gained into these
premises for that purpose. The radio devices were likewise installed in the two
cars without the owners’ knowledge or consent. The court held the interception
thereby made to have been lawfully made and therefore admissible in evidence.
Brooke J.A., speaking on behalf of the court, stated:

... almost all instances of wire-tapping and electronic
surveillance involve conduct in the nature of trespass and this includes
surreptitious or covert entry. Without the consent of the owner, to interfere
with a telephone

[Page 679]

line, telephone receiver or transmitter or switching
equipment is a trespass .... I am convinced that Parlia­ment understood this
when this legislation was passed and intended to deal with the whole problem by
estab­lishing an acceptable scheme through the use of an authorization granted
by a judge only when it was genuinely necessary to do so judged on the criteria
laid down by Parliament to permit this invasion of privacy which carried with
it the necessary invasion of a private right.

Brooke J.A. then went on to conclude that it was not necessary to
expressly authorize such entry or conduct on the part of the law enforcement
agent ""when he grants the authorization to conduct elec­tronic
surveillance"" because such surveillance can be carried out only ""if
conduct such as that referred to is resorted to. The authorization carries with
it authority for the police officer to resort to conduct in the nature of a
trespass including entry to install the device necessary to conduct the
authorized electronic surveillance and the officer’s conduct in so doing is
lawful"".

To like effect are the observations of Chief Justice McGillivray
speaking in dissent in the Court of Appeal of Alberta in the Reference re an
Application for an Authorization (1983), 5 D.L.R. (4th) 601. The
Chief Justice there conclud­ed that the distinction between wiretapping and
bugging was known to and understood by Parlia­ment when Part IV.l was enacted.
Parliament also appreciated, in the Chief Justice’s view, that con-duct in the
nature of trespass, including surrepti­tious entry, was an integral part of
electronic eavesdropping.

I find further support for my conclusions on the questions
discussed above in the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Dalia
v. United States, 441 U.S. 238 (1979), where the Court examined Title III
of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.,
§2510-2520, which permits courts to authorize electronic surveillance by
government officers in specified situations.

[Page 680]

The origin of Part IV.1 is obvious when one observes its
remarkable similarity to Title ill. Title IlI prohibits the interception and
disclosure of ""wire communications"" or ""oral communica­tions""
(defined terms roughly equivalent to ""pri­vate communications""
in Part IV.l) except where a party to the communication consents, or where the
interception is made pursuant to a valid authorization obtained from a judge of
competent jurisdiction. Under §2518 of Title III an authoriz­ing judge must in
the authorization specify: the identity of the person, if known, whose communi­cations
are to be intercepted; the place where authority to intercept is granted; a
particular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted,
and a statement of the particular offence to which it relates; the identity of
the agency authorized to intercept, and of the person authorizing the
application for the authorization; and the period of time for which the
authorization is granted. Under Title III the authorizing judge may allow an
interception through the use of any ""electronic, mechanical or other
device"".

As is the case in our Part IV.1, no mention is made in Title lII
of entry to the named premises as a means of facilitating an interception. How-ever,
there are two differences between Title III and our Part IV.1 which must be
noted. Firstly, Title Ill contains no provision similar to our s. 178.13(2)(d)
which allows an authorizing judge to impose conditions in the authorization
which the judge considers advisable in the public interest. Secondly, any
authorization under Title III must contain a provision specifying that the
interception shall be conducted in such a way as to minimize the extent of the
communications intercepted.

In Dalia, supra, the United States Supreme Court concluded
at the outset (at p. 248) that ""The Fourth Amendment [to the United States
Constitution] does not prohibit per se a covert entry performed for the
purpose of installing otherwise legal electronic bugging equipment"".
In response to the petitioner’s contention that Con­gress had not given the
courts statutory authority

[Page 681]

to approve covert entries for the purpose of install­ing
surveillance equipment, Powell J., delivering the majority opinion of the
Court, said at pp. 249-50:

Title III does not refer explicitly to covert entry. The
language, structure, and history of the statute, however, demonstrate that
Congress meant to authorize courts-in certain specified circumstances-to
approve electron­ic surveillance without limitation on the means neces­sary to
its accomplishment, so long as they are reason-able under the circumstances.
Title III provides a comprehensive scheme for the regulation of electronic
surveillance, prohibiting all secret interception of com­munications except as
authorized by certain state and federal judges in response to applications from
specified federal and state law enforcement officials .... Although Congress
was fully aware of the distinction between bugging and wiretapping ... Title
III by its terms deals with each form of surveillance in essentially the same
manner.... Orders authorizing interceptions of either wire or oral
communications may be entered only after the court has made specific
determinations concerning the likelihood that the interception will disclose
evidence of criminal conduct .... Moreover, with respect to both wiretapping
and bugging, an authorizing court must specify the exact scope of the
surveillance undertaken, enumerating the parties whose communica­tions are to
be overheard (if they are known), the place to be monitored, and the agency
that will do the monitoring.

Nowhere in Title III is there any indication that the
authority of courts under §2518 is to be limited to approving those methods of
interception that do not require covert entry for installation of the
intercepting equipment.

After examining the legislative history of Title III, the Court
concluded, at p. 252:

...,one simply cannot assume that Congress, aware that most
bugging requires covert entry, nonetheless wished to except surveillance
requiring such entries from the broad authorization of Title III, and that it
resolved to do so by remaining silent on the subject. On the con­trary, the
language and history of Title III convey quite a different explanation for
Congress’ failure to distinguish

[Page 682]

between surveillance that requires covert entry and that
which does not: Those considering the surveillance legislation understood that,
by authorizing electronic interception of oral communications in addition to
wire communications, they were necessarily authorizing surreptitious entries.

The majority of the Court concluded that Con­gress meant to
confer upon the courts the power to authorize covert entries ""ancillary to
their respon­sibility to review and approve surveillance applica­tions under
the statute"" (p. 254), and held that the surveillance order
need not include a specific authorization to enter covertly the premises
described in the order.

The majority of the Court therefore held that covert entry did
not render evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization inadmissible
under §2515 of Title III, which reads as follows:

§2515 Prohibition of use as evidence of intercepted wire or
oral communications

Whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no
part of the contents of such communica­tion and no evidence derived therefrom
may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or
before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body,
legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a
political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of that information would be in
violation of this chapter.

In an earlier case, United States v. Scafidi, 564 F.2d
633 (1977), the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, held that an
order grant­ing authorization to ""bug"" private
premises car­ried with it authority for secret entry to place and maintain the
device. With reference to this issue Moore J., for the Court, stated at p. 640:

Once a judicial officer is convinced by the facts presented
to him that electronic surveillance will aid in

[Page 683]

the detection of crime, his authorization that it be used
should then transfer to the appropriate police agency the decision as to the
precise mechanical means whereby the order is to be carried out. If the
instrumentality to be used is a ""bug"", the placing of such a bug must
of necessity be in the hands of the persons so authorized. And such placing
will have to be surreptitious, for no self-respecting police officer would
openly seek permis­sion from the person to be surveilled to install a
""bug"" to intercept his conversations.

It would be highly naive to impute to a district judge a
belief that the device required to effect his bugging authorization did not
require installation.

It is significant that the statute, generally so detailed in
its supervisory requirements, makes no mention of any need for a separate entry
order. That the statute requires general supervision by the courts over the bug­ging
operation does not even impliedly impose on them the practical enforcement
steps.

I am of the opinion, notwithstanding the differ­ences that do
exist between Title III and Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code, that the
approach adopted in the above two cases in the courts of the United States is
equally applicable to the legislation in force in this country. A helpful
discussion of the two enactments appears in Watt, Law of Electron­ic
Surveillance in Canada, supra, at p. 128.

In the judgment of McDonald J. in Re Applica­tion for
Authorization to Intercept Private Com­munications, [1982] 6 W.W.R. 533, 31
C.R. (3d) 31, his Lordship, at pp. 546 and 47 respectively, queried whether the
understanding by the United States legislators that authorizing interceptions
necessarily meant surreptitious entry as mentioned in Dalia, supra, necessarily
applied to the Canadi­an legislators.

There is much discussion in the courts below and in the course of
argument in this court based upon materials which originated in Committees of
Parliament of Canada, Hansard, and some ma­terials and texts which relate to
matters discussed during the legislative process leading to the pas-sage of
Part IV.1. This Court, in Re Anti-lnfla­tion Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, had
occasion to

[Page 684]

deal with the use to which this kind of material can be properly
put. As Laskin C.J. said, at p. 387:

The material offered by the Attorney-General of Canada
concerned the social and economic conditions under which the Anti-Inflation
Act was passed and the evils with which it purported to deal.

To the same effect is the discussion by Beetz J., at pp. 470-71,
concerning the use of policy statements and other material tabled in the House
of Com­mons and in Committees of the House. This ma­terial is not considered by
the courts in arriving at the proper construction to be placed upon lan­guage
used by the Legislature, but only with refer­ence to the aims of the
legislating body and the evils with which it was then contending. See also Lower
Mainland Dairy Products Board v. Turners Dairy Ltd., [1941] S.C.R. 573, per
Taschereau J., as he then was, at p. 583; Home Oil Distributors, Ltd. v.

take recourse is other judgments dealing with the same subject matter, in this
case the nature of electromagnetic apparatus and the invasive characteristics
of pre­sent-day communication technology: see Buck v. Jewell-LaSalle Realty
Co., 283 U.S. 191 (1931), per Brandeis J., at pp. 200-01; Reference

analysis and assessment of technical and specialized knowledge generally to
texts, encyclopedias, professional jour­nals and like sources, all as discussed
and illustrat­ed in Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed. 1940), vol. 1, at pp.
21-22; Phipson on Evidence (12th ed.), paragraphs 46-60; and Cross on
Evidence (5th ed.), at pp. 154-160.

[Page 685]

Before the Protection of Privacy Act was enacted (1973-74
(Can.), c. 50) several articles and texts had been written and reports made on
the subject of wiretapping and electronic eavesdrop-ping. Actually the first
federal wiretapping legisla­tion is found in the statute incorporating the Bell
Telephone Company, 1880 (Can.), c. 67, s. 25, which made the interception of a
message trans­mitted on the company’s telephone lines, a misdemeanour. In 1965,
the government of the day had appointed the Canadian Committee on Corrections.
The Committee delivered its report, gen­erally called the Ouimet Report, to the
government in 1969. Recommendations were made in this Report and, as stated in
Morris Manning, The Protection of Privacy Act (1974), at pp. 4-5,
""Those recommendations were clearly adopted by Parliament"".
The Ouimet Report clearly recog­nizes throughout its study the distinction
between the use of wiretap and the use of electronic bug­ging equipment for
intercepting private communi­cations. The Committee defined these terms as
follows, at p. 81:

The term wiretapping is commonly used to describe the
listening in on conversations on the telephone through the use of electronic
equipment and other devices. Electronic eavesdropping or ""bugging"" is
a term commonly used to describe forms of eavesdropping other than wiretapping.

One of the common forms of eavesdropping involves the
placing of a concealed device in a specific location to receive and transmit
conversations.

After reviewing very limited provincial statutory regulation of
wiretapping (in Manitoba and Alber­ta, telephone legislation), the Committee
observed, at pp. 82-83:

Wiretapping is presently used by police forces in the
investigation of suspected criminal activities. The extent to which it is used
is not known. It is obvious, however, that electronic eavesdropping other than
wiretapping is

[Page 686]

used extensively in the investigation of certain kinds of
suspected criminal activity.

The Committee is of the view that federal legislation
controlling the use of wiretapping and electronic eaves-dropping in law
enforcement is required.

Throughout its Report, when discussing the sub­ject of
surveillance, the Committee always recog­nised the distinction between
wiretapping and elec­tronic eavesdropping. In its recommendations concerning
the extent of legislative control required, the Committee stipulated that the
judi­cial order of authorization should ""specify in detail the person or
persons whose conversations are to be intercepted, the place or places and the
facilities in respect of which the order is made ... "" (at p. 86). The
Committee, having prescribed the terms and conditions to be included in the
authorization then turned to the question of the ""Admissibility of
Conversations Obtained through Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance""
and reported, at p. 88:

The Committee is of the view that illegally
intercepted conversations should not be admissible against an accused at his
trial and that this principle of exclusion should apply to evidence derived
through such illegal interception.

(Emphasis in original.)

Clearly the Report was directed to the exclusion of evidence
gathered without authorization or conformity to the authorization as provided
in the proposed legislation.

Prior to the Ouimet Report there had been other writings and
studies in Canada dealing with this subject matter. See Report of the
Proceedings of the National Conference on the Prevention of Crime, Centre
of Criminology, University of Toronto, June 1965, at p. 70; Stanley M. Beck, Electronic
Surveillance and the Administration of Criminal Justice (1968), 46 Can. Bar
Rev. 643; British Columbia Report of the Commission of Inquiry
Into Invasion of Privacy (1967), (the

[Page 687]

""Sargent Report"") at pp. 30-31; Inquiry
Re Magistrate Frederick J. Bannon and Magistrate George W. Gardhouse (1968),
(the ""Grant Report"") at pp. 11-24; N.M. Chorney, Wiretap-ping
and Electronic Eavesdropping (1964-65), 7 Crim. L.Q. 434; and David A.
Cornfield, The Right to Privacy in Canada (1967), 25 U. of T. Fac. L.
Rev. 103. The courts had also considered the evidentiary ramifications of
police investiga­tions which made use of radio and recording devices: R. v.
Steinberg, [1967] 1 O.R. 733.

In the United States these investigative techniques came into use
much earlier and were discussed in the United States Supreme Court for the
first time in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 (1928). The
decision of that court in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967),
influenced con­gressional action undertaken shortly thereafter for the
regulation of wiretapping and electronic sur­veillance. There was considerable
literature on the subject. That bearing directly on the issue raised in these
proceedings may be found in Alan F. Westin, Science, Privacy and Freedom:
Issues and Pro­posals for the 1970’s, 66 Columbia Law Review 1003 (1966);
and that author’s text Privacy and Freedom (New York 1970); and Dash,
Schwartz and Knowlton, The Eavesdroppers (1959), at pp. 35-285; Kalven, The
Problems of Privacy in the Year 2000, Daedalus, Summer 1967, at pp. 876-77.
Government action began in earnest at the federal level with the appointment of
a presidential commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice
which reported in 1967. This report (at p. 201) clearly recognizes the
difference in vital characteristics between wiretap-ping and eavesdropping, as
did the proposed legis­lation annexed thereto which largely survived and
appears in United States Code at Title III. In the following year
Congress enacted the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Public
Law, 90-351, 82 Stat. 197 (1968), Title 111, Wiretapping and Electronic
Surveillance (now 18 U.S.C., §2510-2520).

[Page 688]

All of this Canadian material, and no doubt much of the United
States literature, judicial and legislative activities, were before Parliament
during the legislative process which began in 1969. (As observed in the Manning
text, supra, our Act follows very closely the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968.) The House of Commons Standing Committee on
Justice and Legal Affairs, after a review of the subject matter, reported to
the House of Commons in March of 1970. The Committee made numerous recommen­dations
relating to both wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping, and did so after
extensive hearings. A government study was undertaken in April 1971 into the
whole question of privacy and a report was filed in December 1972 under the
name ""The Task Force on Privacy and Computers"". In June of
1971 the Minister of Justice introduced the first bill relating to privacy.
This was followed by a like bill introduced in 1972 which was referred to and
examined by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs which also
conducted hearings and reported to the House of Commons in 1972. That bill died
on the order paper and was followed by the introduction of the present Act in
April 1973 where again the matter was referred to the Standing Committee on
Justice and Legal Affairs. Once again the Committee conducted hearings and
reviewed the bill and reported to the House recommending several amendments.
During this three-year period the subject matter of privacy was examined by the
Senate in much the same way. An illustration of the depth of these prolonged
studies is found in the testimony of Professor James R. Thompson, Northwestern
University School of Law, before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal
Affairs, May 27, 1969, p. 1042:

Wiretapping-that is, interception and disclosure of
telephone conversations-is a Federal crime [in the United States] ....
Eavesdropping is a different matter. It may be divided into two kinds-that
which involves trespassory invasion of protected premises for example the
planting of a `bug’ in a home, or the insertion of a

[Page 689]

`spike’ mike into a common wall, and non-trespassory
actions, e.g. merely listening on one side of a common wall or aiming a
parabolic microphone at an open window.

The learned author of The Protection of Privacy Act, supra, observed,
at p. 3:

The Act in its present form was given most careful
consideration by both the House of Commons and its Standing Committee on
Justice and Legal Affairs. Both bodies studied the Act section by section and a
reading of the voluminous debates and reports provides an excel-lent view of
our parliamentary process in action.

Lengthy parliamentary contact with this matter is shown by the
five statutes, supra, enacted over many years and dealing with the
definition and regulation of telecommunication. Professor Beck, whose article, supra,
was mentioned many times in the Commons Committees’ Reports during the
process leading up to the 1974 Act, describes the state of affairs in 1968, at
p. 650:

To sum up, the limited number of public disclosures of
police use of electronic surveillance in Canada does not indicate limited use.

For a more detailed description of the devices available in
Canada for interception of private communications at that time, see Beck, supra,
p. 651, where the use of radio devices is discussed in detail. A similar
discussion occurs in the Sargent Report, supra, at pp. 30-31. The use of
microwave transmissions directed at premises under surveillance to withdraw
therefrom private conversations is likewise discussed in the Beck article, supra,
at p. 652.

Bearing in mind the amount of material gath­ered in the extensive
legislative process leading up to the enactment of the Protection of Privacy
Act in 1973, 1 must adopt the comments made by Chief Justice McGillivray in
the Reference re an Application for an Authorization, supra, at p. 614:

[Page 690]

In light of the record quoted above I have difficulty in
accepting the commission’s conclusions that Parliament was not well aware that,
apart from the isolated cases, the placing of transmitter devices on premises
occupied by a suspect would be expected to be done either by surreptitious
entry or by a trick.

It is not clear from the judgment of McDonald J., supra, at
p. 535, precisely what the investigating agency sought from the chambers judge;

The agents sought to have me make an order permitting the
interception of communications by microphone, and I granted the order in that
regard.

A microphone is, of course, incapable by itself of intercepting
anything and may be used in associa­tion with other equipment for both
wiretapping and eavesdropping. The judgment does not reveal the use proposed.
The learned judge then refused to authorize entry to install a
""microphone"". The court may there have been dealing with a
micro-phone designed to convert a telephone into a room-listening device
energized from outside the prem­ises, or a radio device. If the latter, the
authoriza­tion of interception by such device without means of installation is
futile. Later in his reasons, the use of ""the microphone""
was limited to circumstances where it could be installed without
""trespass"". Presumably, this refers to personal trespass by the
interceptor against the property or person of the interceptee. No example or
illustration was given of ""acceptable entry"" except,
perhaps, in a hotel room before the guest arrives.

Chief Justice McGillivray, as discussed earlier, took a different
approach. He read the legislation in the light of the evil that Parliament was
seeking to redress. Mr. Justice Clements, in the same court, in R. v.
McQueen (1975), 25 C.C.C. 262, expressly applied to ss. 178.16(1)
the same reason­ing as the Chief Justice so as not to extend the application of
that provision ""to absurd lengths and hamper normal police
investigation to an

[Page 691]

extent that would seriously jeopardize the public interest in the
detection of crime"".

When seeking the proper interpretation of these provisions one
should ask if Parliament must be taken as intending to give an authority to the
investigating forces which could not be put to use. The invocation of powers
granted under Part IVA in aid of crime detection serves no purpose if the
authorization granted relates only to isolated pieces of equipment without any
direction or authorization that it be employed in association with authorized
devices for interception either by wiretapping or for electronic or acoustic
surveillance. It is one thing to leave too much to the discretion of the
investigative agency but quite another to stultify the whole undertaking.

It might be noted that the interpretations which I believe should
be placed upon Part IV.1 are also consistent with the provisions of s. 25(1) of
the Criminal Code and s. 26(2) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. I-23, although apart from these provisions my conclusions would still
stand. These sections read in part as follows:

25. (1) Every one who is required or authorized by law to do
anything in the administration or enforcement of the law

(a) as a private person,

(b) as a peace officer or public officer,

(c) in aid of a peace officer or public officer, or

(d) by virtue of his office,

is, if he acts on reasonable and probable grounds, justi­fied
in doing what he is required or authorized to do and in using as much force as
is necessary for that purpose.

26... .

(2) Where power is given to a person, officer or
functionary, to do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all such powers
shall be deemed to be also given as are necessary to enable the person, officer
or func­tionary to do or enforce the doing of the act or thing.

[Page 692]

Section 26 of the Interpretation Act was con­sidered by
this Court in Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2. The issue there
before the Court was whether a warrant to seize firearms issued pursuant to s.
105(1) of the Criminal Code as it then was (now s. 101(1))
authorized the officers acting under it to enter onto the property of the
person named in the warrant and search for firearms. With respect to s. 105(1),
which empow­ered the court to issue only a warrant to seize, this Court drew a
distinction between the authority to seize and the power to enter upon premises
for such a purpose. Ritchie J., delivering the judgment of this Court, stated
at pp. 9-11:

In support of the contention that the authority to seize
included authority to search, the respondent drew atten­tion to the provisions
of s. 26 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970 c. 1-23, and in so doing
contended that the power to search was a necessary ingredient of the power
""to seize"". Section 26(2) of the Interpretation Act reads as
follows:

(2) Where power is given to a person, officer or
functionary, to do or enforce the doing of any act or thing, all such powers
shall be deemed to be also given as are necessary to enable the person, officer
or functionary to do or enforce the doing of the act or thing.

As I have indicated, I am of the opinion that any statutory
provision authorizing police officers to invade the property of others without
invitation or permission would be an encroachment on the common law rights of
the property owner and in case of any ambiguity would be subject to a strict
construction in favour of the common law rights of the owner. This is made
plain from the following excerpt from Maxwell on Interpreta­tion of
Statutes, 12th ed., at p. 251 where it is said:

Statutes which encroach on the rights of the sub­ject,
whether as regards person or property, are sub­ject to a strict construction in
the same way as penal Acts. It is a recognised rule that they should be
interpreted, if possible, so as to respect such rights, and if there is any
ambiguity the construction which is in favour of the freedom of the individual
should be adopted.

It appears to me to follow tha[t] any provision authoriz­ing
police officers to search and enter private property

[Page 693]

must be phrased in express terms and the provisions of the Interpretation
Act are not to be considered as cloth­ing police officers by implication
with authority to search when s. 105(1) and the warrant issued pursuant thereto
are limited to seizure. The extensive number of sections of the Criminal
Code to which reference was made by the trial judge and which expressly
include the dual authority ""to search"" and ""to seize"" are
enough in themselves to indicate that the deeming provisions of s. 26(2) of the
interpretation Act are not applicable to the circumstances.

I am satisfied to adopt the reasoning of Mr. Justice Toy and
I share his view that a wide distinction exists between the meaning of ""to
seize"" and that of ""to search"". As Mr. Justice Toy has pointed
out, it is demonstrable that when Parliament sought to include the right to
search in providing for the authority to seize, it did so in specific terms ...

Nowhere in Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code or anywhere else
in the Code, however, is a distinc­tion made between
""interception"" of a private communication and entry for the purpose
of effect­ing the interception. Reasoning applicable to the well-recognized
distinction between search and sei­zure is not applicable to the present case.
Further-more, by virtue of s. 178.13(2)(c) an authorization must contain a
general description of the place at which the interception is to be made and
the manner of interception to be used. Part IV.l empowers the court to authorize
the interception of private conversations at specified locations by some
methods which of necessity require covert placing of electronic devices; and
all methods of interception included in Part IV.l involve some form of physical
invasion of the premises, as discussed supra. The Code provisions
relating to search and to seizure persistently distinguish be­tween these two
activities as was pointed out in Colet, supra. On the other hand, as was
pointed out by Chief Justice McGillivray in the Reference re an Application
for an Authorization, supra at pp. 609-10:

Here there is no element of invasion, no challenge to a
protesting occupier .... The success of the operation is that the transmitter
is planted without the knowledge of the occupier.

[Page 694]

Here the authority is not to seize or to search, but to
intercept private communications at a particular place.

The operation being regulated by Parliament in Part IV.1 was the
interception of conversations, a separate, distinct and complete transaction.
Parlia­ment did not divide into parts or phases, nor are there contrasting
measures elsewhere in the Code relating to these activities, as is the
case with the search provisions and the seizure provisions in the Criminal
Code.

Similarly, I am of the opinion that the recent decisions of the
House of Lords in Finnigan v. Sandiford and Clowser v. Chaplin, reported
to­gether at [1981] 2 All E.R. 267, and Morris v. Beardmore, [ 1981 ]
A.C. 446, are not applicable in this case.

It is the impact on and the significance of Part IV.1 in our
criminal law system that leads me to the interpretations which I have placed
upon these provisions. The importance of Part IV.l is the recognition by
Parliament of the need to curtail, or at least bring under positive control,
the practice of eavesdropping by one means or another. The necessary result of
such legislation is the express and implied recognition of invasion of citizens’
rights. This is the important crux of s. 178.1, et seq. It is the
invasion of the mind through the covert discovery and recording of the voice,
that is, that makes the powers granted in these provisions so significant in
our community. It is the entry into the mind by the power to intercept private
com­munications and not the entry into or upon per-sons’ property that is of
significance. I find the words of Chief Justice McGillivray in the Refer­ence
re an Application for an Authorization, supra, very apt (at p. 612):

Once that invasion was authorized the means were merely
incidental.

Once the power is granted by Parliament to authorize, and once
the authorizing power has been exercised, that which might have given rise to
tortious action in the past would no longer do so;

[Page 695]

the authorized conduct would not in law amount to trespass.

In summary, I can find no special limitation in Part IV.1 on the
use of radio devices for the interception of private communications. These
devices are clearly included in the permitted forms of interception. A radio
device of the type here employed, by its very characteristics, requires
installation at the situs of the private communica­tion. Apart from that
specific reality in the case of radio, all other forms of retrieval of private
com­munications from inside buildings entail some degree of physical presence
in the sense of invasion of the designated premises by physical forces. The
very fact that the authorization must include the place at which the
interception is to be made and a description of that place, must alert the
authoriz­ing authority to the nature and manner of the proposed interception.
The Code goes on to require the order of authorization to specify a
manner of interception as was done in the orders here. I believe that a court,
in issuing an authorization under Part IV.1, should, in the exercise of its supervisory
function, designate the type of device or devices which may be employed and the
proce­dures and conditions which, in the circumstances revealed in the
application, are necessary or advis­able in the public interest. The absence of
such detail does not go to the validity of the order because in many
circumstances only the general clauses of the subsections themselves will be
appropriate. My observation is intended to give emphasis to the importance of
the judicial role in the program of privacy regulation as prescribed by
Parliament in these provisions. I cannot but con­clude that Parliament
intentionally adopted a broad and, at the same time, detailed code of
provisions for the controlled interception of private communications, including
interception in the manner which here occurred. It is for the judiciary to
protect the public interest and to maintain in the authorizing process the
balance between the two competing elements inherent in the regulation of the
invasion of privacy in the detection of crime. Third party occupants and their
relationship to the officers engaged in installing these devices will be
governed by those provisions in the Code relating to the position of law
enforcement officers in the

[Page 696]

execution of their duties generally. The position of the
occupants under civil law will be affected by Part IV.1 in the same way as
other provisions in the Code may affect the rights in individuals
affected by law enforcement operations. Since 1977 a greater burden has been
placed upon the court to know the nature of the proposed intercep­tion and the
manner in which such interception is to be made. This in turn enables the court
to prescribe the terms and conditions which shall be considered advisable in
the public interest in all the circumstances surrounding the proposed
interception.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeals.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NEW
BRUNSWICK

Criminal law—Police—Powers to arrest without
a warrant—Use of firearm—Pursuit across provincial border—Police officer firing
shots at suspect’s car—Territorial jurisdiction—Whether police officer used his
firearm in a careless manner without lawful excuse—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, ss. 25, 26, 84(2) [1976-77 (Can.), c. 53, s. 3], 233(4), 449 and
450 [R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 2, s. 5], 771(1).

Appellant, a member of the Quebec Police
Force, crossed the provincial boundary in pursuit of a vehicle believing the
driver had just committed the offence of dangerous driving. Despite several
warnings, the driver refused to stop. As a last resort, appellant fired two
warning shots. The driver eventually stopped but sped off as the appellant
approached his vehicle on foot. The appellant fired three more shots at the
car’s rear tires. The driver escaped. A New Brunswick provincial court judge convicted appellant of using his revolver
without lawful excuse in a careless manner. This judgment was overturned by the
Court of Queen’s Bench but restored on appeal. This appeal raised several
questions: (1) whether appellant was a peace officer authorized to arrest
without a warrant in New Brunswick; (2) whether appellant was protected by s. 25(4) of the Code
and (3) whether appellant used excessive force.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Appellant could arrest without a warrant as
he had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was committing the offence
of dangerous driving. He therefore started his chase in Quebec qua a police officer with the
protection afforded to him under s. 25(4) of the Code. He still had
this protection at the time he used his gun in New
 Brunswick. As a matter of law, a peace officer who has
lawful authority to arrest a person under s. 450

[Page 313]

in one province and is pursuing that person,
retains, for the purpose of s. 25(4), his status of a peace officer in
another province inasmuch as the pursuit had commenced lawfully in his
jurisdiction and as long as such pursuit is fresh. The police officer should,
as did the appellant, endeavour to contact the local peace officers as soon as
possible, even during the pursuit, circumstances permitting. Once the local
authorities have taken over the pursuit, he ceases to be a peace officer and
becomes then a person assisting peace officers under s. 449(1)(b),
and, as such, will continue enjoying the protection of s. 25(4). The
reasonableness of appellant’s conduct must be assessed in the light of the
state of mind of a reasonable person reacting not to what was discovered after
the incident but to what the driver’s conduct in escaping suggested might be
discovered upon immediate arrest. Here, the driver persisted in his flight notwithstanding
all the warnings. The Court of Queen’s Bench found that the force resorted to
under the circumstances was not excessive. That finding was one of fact with
which this Court could not and should not interfere.

(1981), 35 N.B.R. (2d) 23, 88 A.P.R. 23, 22 C.R. (3d) 263, setting aside a
judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench (1980), 31 N.B.R. (2d) 668, 75 A.P.R.
668, allowing the accused’s appeal from his conviction in Provincial Court on a
charge of careless use of a firearm without lawful excuse. Appeal allowed.

J. Roger McIntyre, for the appellant.

Paul Thériault, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—This Court is the fourth and the third
in appeal, to determine and deal with the issues arising out of an incident
that started in Quebec and finished in New Brunswick involving a

[Page 314]

member of the Quebec Police Force and a New Brunswick taxi driver.

Following this incident, the police officer was
charged in New Brunswick for having, without lawful excuse used his revolver
“in a careless manner contrary to and in violation of s. 84(2)(b)
of the Criminal Code”, while the taxi driver was charged in Quebec with
dangerous driving contrary to s. 233(4) of the Criminal Code. We do
not know what happened to the latter charge. This appeal concerns only the
former.

At trial, the constable was convicted by a
Provincial Court Judge. He appealed to the Court of Queen’s Bench and was
acquitted. The Crown appealed to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal which
allowed the appeal and restored the conviction. The constable now asks this
Court to restore the acquittal entered by the Court of Queen’s Bench. I think
he should succeed.

The Facts

The primary facts, as found by the trial judge,
are not disputed, and were accepted by the Summary Conviction Appeal Court
Judge, and are as follows.

On February 12, 1979, an off-duty taxi driver,
one Roger Chassé, left his residence in Campbellton, New Brunswick, to go to
Cross Point, in the Province of Quebec, to make a few purchases. He then
proceeded home and was taken in chase in Quebec by appellant, a Quebec police
officer. The reasons for this chase are related by the trial judge as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The testimony established
that the accused is a member of the Quebec Police Force, stationed at
Matapédia, Province of Quebec. In the course of his duties he stopped an
automobile driven by one Lucius Landry at the entrance to the bridge leading
from Cross Point to Campbellton, on the Quebec side. While he was questioning
the driver of the vehicle he had stopped, he saw a taxi coming toward him at
high speed. The driver who had been stopped, Lucius Landry, noticed nothing
unusual: he thought everything was just as usual. As the vehicle, which we now
know was a taxi driven by Roger Chassé, was approaching the bridge, the accused
said that it was being driven on the left side

[Page 315]

of the road, the police car and Landry’s
car being parked on the right side of the road at the entrance to the bridge.
When the accused looked in the direction in which the taxi was travelling, he
saw a van coming and said he expected there would be a collision, but that the
van pulled to the right to allow the taxi to pass. He then returned to his car
and set off in pursuit, travelling at speeds up to 70 mph on the
interprovincial bridge. The speed of the taxi was not determined. On arriving
at the intersection of Subway and Roseberry Streets in Campbellton, N.B.,
the accused, who was driving an unmarked car without a red light, said he drove
up beside the taxi using his siren and trying to stop it. The driver of the
taxi made certain gestures toward him with his finger and continued going,
turning onto Minto Street and slowing to a stop at Minto and Arran. On arriving
at Arran and Gerrard streets, the officer stated that he passed the taxi and
stopped, got out of his car, and the taxi tried to bump his vehicle. He then
reversed, drove around him and drove off to the south along Gerrard Street, and
from there onto Dover Street, where he was travelling at a speed of up to 70
mph. He then turned onto Tingley Crescent, which is a residential area, and
when he turned this corner the accused took out his 38 revolver and fired two
warning shots into the air. The chase continued around Tingley Crescent and the
taxi stopped at a point which was later found to be the taxi driver’s
residence. The accused jumped out of his car and ran toward the taxi with his
gun in his hand. The taxi began moving and the accused then fired three shots
at the taxi, puncturing a tire and making two holes in the mudguard. The
accused then lost contact with the taxi and reported the case to the R.C.M.P.

As I deal with this appeal I will occasionally
refer to a few undisputed facts disclosed in evidence which were not mentioned
in the trial judge’s narrative. Considering his approach to the issues arising
in this case, he probably did not think them of any relevance.

The Judgments

Before summarizing the judgments we should bear
in mind that the Court of Queen’s Bench was sitting as a Summary Conviction
Appeal Court, that the appeal was determined on the transcript of the record
and that the Queen’s Bench Justice’s right to determine matters of fact was no
less but no more than that enjoyed by a Court of Appeal under Part XVIII of the
Code in dealing with facts where leave has been granted to appellant on

[Page 316]

grounds involving questions of fact. It also
should be remembered that the New Brunswick Court of Appeal was limited to
questions of law (s. 771(1) Criminal Code), as is this Court.

The charge is under s. 84(2):

84. …

(2) Every one who, without lawful excuse,
uses, carries, handles, ships or stores any firearm or ammunition in a careless
manner or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons

(a) is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment

(i) in the case of a first offence, for two
years, and

(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent
offence, for five years; or

(b) is guilty of an offence
punishable on summary conviction.

The relevant powers of arrest without warrant by
a peace officer are set out in s. 450(1):

450. (1) A
peace officer may arrest without warrant

(a) a person who has committed an
indictable offence or who, on reasonable and probable grounds, he believes has
committed or is about to commit an indictable offence,

(b) a person whom he finds
committing a criminal offence, or

(c) a person for whose arrest he has
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a warrant is in force within
the territorial jurisdiction in which the person is found.

Those of the citizen at s. 449(1) and (3):

449. (1) Any
one may arrest without warrant

(a) a person whom he finds
committing an indictable offence, or

(b) a person who, on
reasonable and probable grounds, he believes

(i) has committed a criminal offence, and

(ii) is escaping from and freshly pursued
by persons who have lawful authority to arrest that person.

[Page 317]

(2) …

(3) Any one other than a peace officer who
arrests a person without warrant shall forthwith deliver the person to a peace
officer.

Dangerous driving is covered at s. 233(4):

233. …

(4) Every one who drives a motor vehicle on
a street, road, highway or other public place in a manner that is dangerous to
the public, having regard to all the circumstances including the nature,
condition and use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time is
or might reasonably be expected to be on such place, is guilty of

(a) an indictable offence and
is liable to imprisonment for two years, or

(b) an offence punishable on
summary conviction.

The right given persons to resort to force and
the justification they may invoke when having done so, if criminally prosecuted
as a result of arresting others, is grounded in s. 25 of the Code, the
more relevant portions being s. 25(1), (3) and (4):

25. (1)
Every one who is required or authorized by law to do anything in the
administration or enforcement of the law

(a) as a private person,

(b) as a peace officer or
public officer,

(c) in aid of a peace officer
or public officer, or

(d) by virtue of his office,

is, if he acts on reasonable and probable
grounds, justified in doing what he is required or authorized to do and in
using as much force as is necessary for that purpose.

(2) …

(3) Subject to subsection (4), a
person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force
that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless he
believes on reasonable and probable grounds that it is necessary for the
purpose of preserving himself or any one under his protection from death or
grievous bodily harm.

[Page 318]

(4) A peace officer who is proceeding
lawfully to arrest, with or without warrant, any person for an offence for
which that person may be arrested without warrant, and every one lawfully
assisting the peace officer, is justified, if the person to be arrested takes
flight to avoid arrest, in using as much force as is necessary to prevent the
escape by flight, unless the escape can be prevented by reasonable means in a
less violent manner.

The Trial Court

The trial judge decided that the police officer
was not empowered to arrest without a warrant. To this end he referred to
s. 450(1)(a) which in my opinion, has no application here, and he
made no reference to s. 450(1)(b). This, however, was not detrimental
to the accused’s position because the test a police officer must meet, in order
to be empowered to arrest without a warrant under s. 450(1)(a) is,
to the extent that it differs, at least as easily satisfied as that under
s. 450(1)(b).

He then (I have taken the liberty of rearranging
the order of presentation of the issues that Court addressed) set out the test
under s. 450(1)(a) as follows (he quoted without giving
references the following text)[1]:

[TRANSLATION] In order to constitute
reasonable and probable grounds, it is not sufficient if the peace officer acts
“in good faith”; his belief must be based on reasonable and probable grounds (Hopper
v. Clark (1911), 40 N.B.R. 568, C.A.). A mere suspicion or the desire to
obtain information cannot be a basis, in the event the accused refuses to
answer, for an arrest without a warrant (Koechlin v. Waugh and Hamilton (1957),
118 C.C.C. 24, C.A. Ont.). The peace officer must have come to the conclusion
that any ordinary person (the average man) would have made the same deduction
in the same circumstances.

Applying this test, with which I would not take
issue, to those facts of the case which he narrated, he concluded:

[TRANSLATION] Based on these events, which
occurred on the ramp leading to the bridge, it must be proven that Roger Chassé
committed a criminal offence.

[Page 319]

Having thus added a requirement to the test he
had previously enunciated, that is proof that Chassé had committed the crime of
dangerous driving, he then made a finding that Chassé had not committed the
offence.

[TRANSLATION] After having heard the
accused’s testimony, I cannot accept the suggestion that Chassé was driving
dangerously.

And it is on the basis of this conclusion that
he then found, as a fact, that the accused “did not have reasonable and
probable grounds to arrest Chassé without a warrant”.

In other words, in his view, while a peace
officer’s belief in the commission of the offence must be based on reasonable
and probable grounds, such grounds for arrest under s. 450 cannot exist if
it is found, as he did, that the offence was in fact not committed. It follows
as of necessity that this would be equally applicable to a citizen acting under
s. 449. Having made this finding, he did not, which was the only thing
left to do, assess the accused’s conduct in the light of the duty of care set
out in the charging section, s. 84(2). Instead, he found that, in any
event, the force resorted to by the accused was excessive, referring to
s. 26 of the Code, and found him guilty.

It is far from clear whether he was making this
finding in the light of s. 25(4) or of s. 25(3) of the Code, or
of both, though it would appear that he was by then dealing with the accused qua
citizen making an arrest and no longer qua peace officer dealing
with someone taking flight to avoid arrest, as is suggested from the following
passages of his judgment.

[TRANSLATION] As the facts show, Chassé’s
identity was easily established and the pursuit itself was pointless.

Officer Roberge is not covered or
exonerated by s. 450 of the Criminal Code, and his status in New Brunswick
at the time he fired the shots at Chassé’s car was no different from that of an
ordinary citizen.

Even if the court had to apply ss. 25 and
26 of the Code to the accused, by using excessive force he did not meet the
standard required by those two sections, and is therefore criminally
responsible for his actions.

[Page 320]

And later on:

[TRANSLATION] Even if the accused had made
the correct assumption, and I have found that he did not, then s. 26 of
the C.C.C. applies and in view of all the circumstances, the description of the
taxi, its licence number and the identification of the driver I find that,
whether or not he had the authority to make an arrest in hot pursuit without a
warrant, he exercised excessive force by using a firearm without justification
in a reckless manner without lawful excuse.

The Court of Queen’s Bench

Quite properly the justice in appeal took his
facts from the trial judge. He took issue with the test for arresting without a
warrant set down by the trial judge and proceeded to enunciate what he
considered the proper test as follows:

The question is not whether the accused in
fact had reasonable and probable grounds but whether he honestly believed he
had the reasonable and probable grounds to justify his course of action.
‘Reasonable and probable grounds’ are not invoked to support an information or
a breathalizer demand but to substantiate a defence of justification. Any doubt
on this question of fact must be given the accused.

(Emphasis added.)

Having found error of law on the part of the
trial judge as to the test applicable he then proceeded, as he was perfectly
entitled to do, to making his own finding, applying to the facts what he
considered the proper test:

On this point and even though I did not
hear the witnesses give their evidence, upon reading the transcript I am of
opinion that the appellant honestly believed that the actions of the
taxi driver constituted the offence of dangerous driving for which he could
arrest without warrant and therefore he was in hot pursuit of a person in
breach of the Criminal Code.

(Emphasis added.)

Finding that the police officer had retained his
status of a peace officer even in New Brunswick, invoking R v. Shyffer (1910),
17 C.C.C. 191, he stated the next question thus “whether the appellant used
excessive force for which he would be

[Page 321]

criminally liable under s. 26 of the Criminal
Code”. He then found as a matter of fact that under the
circumstances the police officer’s conduct did not “constitute excessive force
so as to render one criminally responsible”. Though he made no mention
specifically of s. 25(4), it is evident that he was assessing Roberge’s
conduct in the light of the powers given a peace officer acting under
s. 25(4). Indeed, had he dealt with the matter under s. 25(1) and (3)
he did not need to concern himself with whether Roberge was then acting as a
peace officer, because the offence alleged against Chassé is an indictable
offence, one for which a citizen may under s. 449 arrest without a
warrant. This would bring Roberge within s. 25(1) and (3), irrespective of
whether he was a peace officer or not. The rest of his judgment deals with the
degree of carelessness required for an offence under s. 84(2), a matter he
did not need to deal with in view of his previous findings.

The Court of Appeal

That Court’s approach to the matter is totally
different and I must say, with the greatest of respect, somewhat puzzling. The
Court of Appeal took issue with the Queen’s Bench Justice varying the
conclusion of fact made by the trial judge to the effect that constable Roberge
was not authorized to arrest without a warrant, thereby implicitly agreeing
with the test upon which the trial judge had predicated that finding. Indeed they
said:

[TRANSLATION] After a careful reading of
the transcript of this case, I find no reason to disagree with the impressions
of the trial judge or his view of the facts. In a situation such as this a
higher court must rely on the facts and the general view of the case taken by
the trial judge.

They then approached the case by formulating the
issue as follows:

[TRANSLATION] In disposing of this appeal,
I find it is sufficient to examine the actions of the accused per se, without
regard to the complications of having to decide as to the extent of the
authority conferred on peace officers acting in a foreign territory. For all
practical

[Page 322]

purposes, it is sufficient to decide the
question of whether, in light of the circumstances surrounding the incident,
the accused “used a firearm in a careless manner without lawful excuse”. Put
even more simply, would the accused have been guilty of the offence if the
territorial jurisdictions of New Brunswick and Quebec had been the same and the
accused had been a peace officer for these territories?

A reading of this passage of their judgment
gives the impression that the Court of Appeal was of the view that officer
Roberge’s status in New Brunswick was of no relevance (that is whether he was a
peace officer, authorized to arrest without a warrant or not), and that a
finding of guilt under s. 84(2)(b) could therefore be made without
a consideration of whether he retained the protection of s. 25(4) or at
least s. 25(3). But that does not appear to have been what they meant.
Later on in their judgment they reformulated the question as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The question which the
appellate judge should have asked is therefore whether, when the accused
decided to use his firearm, he was reasonably justified in doing so in light of
the circumstances as a whole. The trial judge answered this question by saying:

At this particular time and place, however,
I find as a fact that the accused did not have reasonable and probable grounds
to arrest Chassé without a warrant…

(Emphasis added.)

It would therefore appear that the Court of
Appeal, having accepted the trial judge’s conclusion that the situation was not
one where an arrest could be made without a warrant, by either a citizen or a
peace officer, dealt with the matter as such, and concluded that using a gun
under the circumstances of the case was carelessness within s. 84(2)(b)
and that Roberge had no lawful excuse. This is borne out by their concluding
remarks where they say:

[TRANSLATION] Contrary to the finding of
the appellate judge, I consider that there was negligence by respondent in
using his firearm, and that, in light of the circumstances as a whole, no
lawful excuse was established.

[Page 323]

There are many ways to approach this case as is
well illustrated by the three judgments below.

As this Court and the Court of Appeal are
limited to matters of law, and the Court of Queen’s Bench limited to some
degree from interfering with the trial judge’s findings of fact, I propose to
approach the case as follows.

As a first step we should consider whether the
trial judge’s finding that constable Roberge could not arrest Mr. Chassé
without a warrant was predicated on an error of law. If the answer is no, the
trial judge’s finding cannot be reversed, that ends the matter, and constable
Roberge’s conviction will stand. Indeed, if Roberge could not arrest without a
warrant qua police officer or qua citizen, his use of the
revolver to try to stop Chassé’s car comes, in my view, well within the type of
carelessness contemplated by s. 84(2)(b). But if the trial
judge’s finding is predicated on error of law, then we must, before accepting
the Court of Queen’s Bench finding to the contrary that Roberge could arrest
without a warrant, first see if the Queen’s Bench finding is the result of the
proper test in law.

The test under s. 450(1)(b)

This Court, in R. v. Biron, [1976] 2
S.C.R. 56, laid down the test to be applied when determining whether a peace
officer is arresting (to use the words of s. 450(1)(b)) “a person
whom he finds committing a criminal offence”. Speaking for the majority,
Martland J. (Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon and de Grandpré JJ. concurring), said the
following (at p. 72):

My view is that the validity of an arrest
under this paragraph must be determined in relation to the circumstances which
were apparent to the peace officer at the time the arrest was made.

and further on (at p. 75):

The power of arrest which that paragraph
gives has to be exercised promptly, yet, strictly speaking, it is impossible to
say that an offence is committed until the party

[Page 324]

arrested has been found guilty by the
courts. If this is the way in which this provision is to be construed, no peace
officer can ever decide, when making an arrest without a warrant, that the
person arrested is ‘committing a criminal offence’. In my opinion the
wording used in para, (b), which is oversimplified, means that
the power to arrest without a warrant is given where the peace officer himself
finds a situation in which a person is apparently committing an offence.

(Emphasis added.)

Laskin C.J.C., dissenting, (Spence and Dickson
JJ., concurring), would have laid down the following test, adopting that of
Culliton C.J.S. in Attorney General for Saskatchewan v. Pritchard, (1961),
130 C.C.C. 61, 35 C.R. 150, 34 W.W.R. 458, where he had said (at pp. 65‑66
C.C.C, p. 154 C.R. and p. 462 W.W.R.), quoting that passage at
p. 61 in the Biron decision:

While a peace officer has no right to
arrest without a warrant a person he finds committing an offence unless an
offence was in fact committed, nevertheless even if the officer was in error
in so arresting, if he acted on reasonable and probable grounds he is given
protection under s. 25 of the Code.

(Emphasis added.)

The disagreement between the judges of this
Court in Biron was as regards the test when applicable to a party
resisting arrest. I have underlined the test the minority recognized as
applicable to the arresting officer when he is the accused. The majority would
have the same test for the arresting party and the party being arrested. As
regards the accused arrestor, I see no disagreement even though the majority
refer only to apparently committing. Indeed, I do not read the test laid down
by Martland J. as suggesting that it is sufficient that it be “apparent” to the
police officer even though it would be unreasonable for the police officer to
come to that conclusion. Surely it must be “appar-

[Page 325]

ent” to a reasonable person placed in the
circumstances of the arresting officer at the time.

This is no different than what Culliton C.J.S.
had said in Pritchard, an officer acting “on reasonable and probable
grounds”. Therefore this Court in Biron was unanimous as regards the
test for the arresting officer when he is the accused.

As Culliton C.J.S.’s formulation uses words with
which lawyers and courts are more familiar and which furthermore are resorted
to in the same section at s. 450(1)(a) I suggest we adopt that
wording rather than that resorted to by the majority which comes from Lord
Denning, M.R. in Wiltshire v. Barrett, [1965] 2 All E.R. 271 at pp.
273-74.

The Trial Judge’s Test

I have already set out earlier the passages of
his judgment where he enunciates the test. He had originally laid down the test
correctly (“The peace officer must have come to the conclusion that any
ordinary person (the average man) would have made the same deduction in the
same circumstances.”) but then erred in law by applying to the accused
arresting officer the test the minority of this Court in Biron would
have applied when trying the person resisting arrest, when he said:

[TRANSLATION] Based on these events, which
occurred on the ramp leading to the bridge, it must be proven that Roger Chassé
committed a criminal offence.

This error of law provided grounds for the Court
of Queen’s Bench to substitute its findings of fact on that issue. The Court of
Appeal was bound by that finding, as will be this Court, if the Court of
Queen’s Bench applied the proper test.

The Court of Queen’s Bench Test

That Court stated the test as follows:

The question is not whether the accused in
fact had reasonable and probable grounds but whether he honest-

[Page 326]

ly believed he had the reasonable and
probable grounds to justify his course of action.

With respect, though closer to the proper test
than the trial judge, the Court erred by introducing into the test the
availability of a putative justification that Stuart, (Don Stuart, Canadian
Criminal Law, 1982, Carswell, Toronto) defines as, at p. 381:

…situations where the accused genuinely
believed that his act was justified in law but, on the facts as he believed
them to be, no such legal justification existed.

I agree with Stuart’s further comments on the
subject where he says (at pp. 381-82):

Consider the case of a police officer who
genuinely but totally unreasonably believes that he can do anything with legal
impunity if his primary aim is to enforce the law. The law has always placed a
limitation in the form of a test of reasonableness. The law must continue to
distinguish this area of justifications as a particularly delicate area in
which value choices have to be reflected and in which some objectivity is
inevitable. Our present law of justifications does not admit of any concept of
putative justification41, It is often recognized that the situation
must be judged on the facts perceived by the accused, usually on reasonable
grounds, but this is quite different from the assertion that both the facts and
law must be judged on the accused’s perception.

41 In Parrot (1979) 51 C.C.C. (2d) 539
at 545-46 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused
at 51 C.C.C. (2d) 539n (S.C.C.)) it was expressly held that a mistaken belief
as to one’s legal obligation does not constitute a lawful excuse.

The Court of Appeal having not made its own finding
on the issue, though entitled to do so because of that error of law on the part
of the Court of Queen’s Bench, it is now incumbent upon this Court to do so.

Having read the record, I am of the view that,
under the circumstances of this case, constable Roberge’s assessment of the
situation to the effect that Mr. Chassé was committing the criminal
offence of dangerous driving was made on reasonable and probable grounds (i.e.,
Mr. Chassé would

[Page 327]

have appeared to a reasonable person, placed in the
same circumstances, to be committing that offence).

To arrive at this conclusion I take care not to
try the issue as if Mr. Chassé was on trial for dangerous driving, as I
suspect, from reading his judgment, the trial judge might have done. When
determining what the constable saw, and when weighing the evidence, any
contradiction giving rise to a reasonable doubt must inure to the benefit of
the accused who is, as might be easily forgotten, in this case, the police
officer. Mr. Chassé is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt
when tried for that offence, but equally so is constable Roberge when he sits
in the prisoner’s dock.

Therefore, the contradictions in the evidence
between Mr. Chassé and constable Roberge as to what happened, which might
well be properly resolved in Chassé’s favour at his trial, I resolved here in
Roberge’s favour.

I took, as I am bound to, the trial judge’s
narrative of the facts which should be completed by adding the following which,
in my view, tend to support Roberge’s version of what he saw at the bridge and
which is not contested.

Mr. Chassé admitted to having had a couple
of beers in the morning around 10 o’clock. The purchase made in Quebec was a
case of beer and some cheese. Chassé, after driving away with a punctured tire
and having abandoned his car on the Trans-Canada Highway, took a taxi home,
carting with him his case of beer. A neighbour’s daughter, one Suzanne McGrath,
saw him get out of the taxi carting his case of beer and stated:

[TRANSLATION]

Q. Did you notice anything else?

A. Yes, he was carrying a case of beer. I
thought he had been drinking from the way he was walking.

Q. I assume you have seen Mr. Chassé
walk on other occasions?

A. Yes.

Q. I have no further questions.

[Page 328]

Chassé’s son, Claude, said the R.C.M.P. arrived
at their house some fifteen minutes after his father. He and his mother advised
Chassé not to give a statement but rather to go to bed because they thought he
had too much to drink. These facts, though not conclusive, are relevant as
supporting the accused’s version as to the kind of driving he witnessed at the
entrance of the bridge. His driving after crossing the bridge is also
supportive of that prior to crossing. True, he explains it as resulting from
fear, alleging that he did not know Roberge was a Quebec police officer. But
any doubt as to the truthfulness of this explanation must be resolved in favour
of Roberge. Chassé did not use his radio to call for help, he only used it when
he was on the Trans-Canada Highway, with a punctured tire, to call a taxi to go
home, carting his case of beer. He did not go to the police. Prior to the
puncturing of his tire, he drove through the intersections of Arran and
Minto streets; had he turned right he could have gone to the taxi stand, or
left, and he would be at the R.C.M.P. station. His explanation as to why he did
not in this way take refuge from Roberge is, to say the least, nebulous.
Witness the following passage of his testimony:

[TRANSLATION]

Q. I see—you were upset, you were afraid.
Now when you saw this fellow leave the bridge and follow you, and you got to
the intersection of Water, or rather Roseberry, and Subway, if you had
turned left, wouldn’t that have taken you to the R.C.M.P. station?

A. Yes.

Q. It was nearby?

A. If I turned right it would take me to
the stand. If I turned left it would take me to the police station.

Q. Yes. Why didn’t you go to either of
these places?

A. I was going to the stand, but there were
too many cars behind me, there were cars behind, and when I saw that, I cut
away, that is when I cut away and took Minto.

Q. I see.

A. There were other cars.

[Page 329]

Q. But you were going to go to the stand?

A. I was no longer on that side.

Q. Okay. Then you did not think of going to
the police station?

A. I did not think of going to the police
station, the road was right there.

Q. Yes, but you were being pursued by a
maniac, you were afraid, you were upset: the best place in the world to go was
the police station.

A. The taxi stand was good also.

Q. The stand was good also.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. But you did not go there?

A. There were cars, and as a result—

Q. There were cars, okay. When you went
onto Minto Street and came to the intersection of Arran and Minto, if you
turned to the left it would take you to another police station close by?

A. A little further on, yes.

Q. A little, but not very far.

A. No.

Q. R.C.M.P. County Detachment, wasn’t it?

A. (Inaudible).

Q. Yes. But you didn’t think of going
there: that would have been a good place to go.

A. I was going home.

Q. Pardon?

A. I was going home.

Q. What kind of action could have been
taken at home, sir, that a dozen members of the R.C.M.P. who were sitting there
in their station could not give you? What greater protection did you have at
home?

A. I was at home, okay?

Q. If you were afraid that some kind of
maniac was following you, instead of going home would you not have had better
protection by making a left turn and going to the police station?

A. Yes, that would have been a good idea.

Q. Why didn’t you go there? You wanted to
go home?

A. Yes.

His explanation as to the siren is as nebulous
as that regarding his not going to the police. Finally, it is difficult to
accept that a taxi driver of long experience, who is called upon to drive
customers

[Page 330]

to the Quebec side and who, living on the
border, goes frequently to Quebec for personal reasons, as he did in this case
to buy beer, does not recognize the uniform of the Quebec Police Force.

As a result, I agree with the Court of Queen’s
Bench Justice, sitting on appeal, that Roberge had reasonable and probable
grounds to believe that Chassé was committing the offence of dangerous driving,
and that he therefore started his chase in Quebec qua a peace officer
with the protection afforded him under s. 25(4).

The next question we must then deal with is
whether at the time he used his gun in New Brunswick he still had the
protection of s. 25(4) as he is not a peace officer under the laws of New
Brunswick, and he was not assisting a peace officer of that province. This question
is of some importance, as the protection afforded an arresting citizen under
s. 25(1) is, by s. 25(3), much more limited than that under
s. 25(4). Furthermore, whatever is justified for the purpose of making an
arrest under s. 25(1) is in itself, quite apart from the limitations set
out in s. 25(3), somewhat more limited than what is justified “to prevent
the escape by flight” in order “to avoid arrest”.

Angers J., of the Court of Queen’s Bench, relied
on R. v. Shyffer, supra, and concluded that he still was a peace
officer. That case is of little help. Clement J., of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia, seems to have taken as being the law applicable to his case,
as it had been conceded by the parties, that (at p. 192) “the police of
one province can arrest without warrant a person charged with having committed
a crime in another province only where the crime is one for which the accused
could have been arrested without warrant in the province where the crime was
committed, or where the accused is escaping fresh pursuit: Criminal Code
ss. 30, 33 and 649.”

[Page 331]

The difference between s. 649 of the Criminal
Code in 1910 and s. 449(1)(b) of today’s Code are, for
the purpose of the question we are now considering, of no consequence.

649. Any one
may arrest without warrant a person whom he, on reasonable and probable
grounds, believes to have committed a criminal offence and to be escaping from,
and to be freshly pursued by, those whom the person arresting, on reasonable
and probable grounds, believes to have lawful authority to arrest such person.

That section did not (nor does today’s
s. 449(1)(b)) support the proposition advanced in Shyffer.
I have searched to no avail for authority on the matter. In any event, my
view is that, in a country such as ours, where there are over 15,000 kilometres
of interprovincial and territorial frontiers, it is unreasonable to make so
drastic a variance in the protection afforded our police officers under
s. 25 when they are in pursuit of a criminal (most pursuits often involve
crimes more heinous than the one under consideration in this case) dependent
solely upon the officer crossing a border. True, a mistaken belief on the part
of the officer that he is still within his province will afford him the
protection of s. 25(4). On the other hand, even if he does know he has
changed provinces, it is in my view, seriously and unnecessarily hampering
police work to reduce a peace officer to the rank of an ordinary citizen and to
limit, by taking away part of his protection under s. 25, through a
variation of the nature and purpose of what he is authorized to do, the force
he is entitled to use dependent upon his moving a few feet further in pursuit
of a criminal.

Under s. 25(1), the purpose is to arrest,
while under s. 25(4) the purpose is to prevent escape from immediate
arrest. As I have already said, this difference of purpose has a direct bearing
on the nature of the force the reasonableness of which is to be assessed.

This case, where Chassé could have been easily
arrested later on in the day using the licence plates of the taxi he was
driving to identify him provides an illustration. As a citizen, if such were
Roberge’s status, he would not have (except if he were assisting a peace
officer) been justified in the circumstances resorting to any force, and his
course of

[Page 332]

action would have been to report the matter to
the local police. Arrest did not require carrying on the dangerous pursuit, let
alone using a revolver to immobilize the car. As a peace officer, if that be
his status, immediate arrest justified his persistence in the pursuit and the
eventual use of his revolver as a final resort to immobilize the car. I cannot
accept that the policy considerations that brought about s. 25(4) should
be defeated by placing the police officer in jeopardy upon the mere crossing of
a provincial border. The policy might be more easily understood had Chassé been
found driving a getaway car after committing a hold-up; or, upon arriving at
home, had he reported his car stolen and denied he had been driving it,
specially so if the car had been involved in a hit and run incident where a
pedestrian was killed. Indeed, immediate arrest, and the need for pursuit as a
means to that end are essential to policy considerations that should not be
defeated by stripping peace officers in the middle of a chase of their
protection under s. 25(4).

I would therefore find that as a matter of law a
peace officer who had lawful authority to arrest a person under s. 450 in
one province and is pursuing that person, retains, for the purpose of
s. 25(4), his status of a peace officer in another province inasmuch as
the pursuit had commenced lawfully in his jurisdiction and as long as such
pursuit is fresh.

I would add one reservation.

The police officer should endeavour to contact
the local peace officers as soon as is possible, even during the pursuit,
circumstances permitting. Once the local authorities have taken over the
pursuit, he ceases to be a peace officer and becomes then a person assisting
peace officers under s. 449(1)(b), and, as such, will continue
enjoying the protection of s. 25(4).

This, to me, seems a desirable temporary
extension of his peace officer status which logically fills

[Page 333]

in a gap between the time when he would
otherwise cease to be a peace officer and when he becomes a person assisting
peace officers.

Angers J. was in my view right in law when
assessing the reasonableness of Roberge’s use of his firearm. In making his
assessment on the facts of the case, he found that the force resorted to under
the circumstances was not excessive, which by implication means that the force
had become “necessary to prevent the escape by flight” and that “the escape
[could not] be prevented by reasonable means in a less violent manner”. That
finding is one of fact with which this Court cannot and should not interfere,
unless we find that his conclusion is unreasonable and cannot be supported by
the evidence, keeping in mind that this Court is limited to matters of law. His
conclusion could be said to be unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence as
a matter of law only if we find that there is no evidence upon which such a
finding could reasonably be made. This is clearly not the case. Roberge had
more than once attempted to stop the car by signalling, activating his siren,
overtaking and blocking the car with his own, all to no avail. Furthermore, the
escalation of force resorted to was not disproportionate to that of the
suspicion Chassé must have created in Roberge’s mind as he persisted in his
flight notwithstanding all those warnings. He behaved, especially after the
warning shots, as if risking being shot was better for him than what might be
discovered if apprehended. Roberge’s conduct must be assessed in the light of
the state of mind of a reasonable person reacting not to what was discovered
after the incident but to what Chassé’s conduct in escaping suggested might be
discovered upon immediate arrest. Short of requiring that he give up immediate
arrest and opt for eventual arrest, an alternative he needed not in
law revert to, I am unable to say that there is no evidence upon which the
judge could predicate his finding that the means resorted to by Roberge for an
immediate arrest were not excessive. Furthermore, during the chase he had,
using his radio, contacted the Quebec Police Station and requested that the
R.C.M.P. in New Brunswick be alerted. When Chassé drove off with the punctured
tire, constable Roberge, on his way to the R.C.M.P. station, saw an officer of
that

[Page 334]

force and immediately reported the incident to
him.

A final observation. I should not want my
comments in support of the policy considerations that justify, in my opinion, a
distinction being made under s. 25(1) and s. 25(4), by which I extend
temporarily a peace officer’s status, to be considered as being in any way a
comment supporting or taking exception to the wide powers given peace officers
in dealing with flight from arrest under s. 25(4). Section 25(4) is a
codification of the old common law applicable to fleeing felons, offenders that
would in those days, if found guilty, most certainly be executed. Many
suggestions have been made to Parliament as regards this frightful arsenal
peace officers enjoy (see, amongst others, the Ouimet Committee Report),
particularly concerning offences that do not indicate dangerousness on the
part of the offender, such as shoplifting, fraud, gambling. We have extended to
all indictable offences a common law principle that was intended to be applied
only to felons. This is a choice Parliament has made and which the courts
cannot defeat.

To conclude, I would therefore allow the appeal,
quash the Court of Appeal’s judgment and restore the acquittal entered by the
Court of Queen’s Bench.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Defences—Self-defence—Use of
excessive force—Charge to jury—Whether use of excessive force in self-defence
reducing murder to manslaughter—Whether trial judge failed to instruct jury on
manslaughter—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 34, 37, 212.

Criminal
law—Defences—Provocation—Provocation not raised by defence—Charge to
jury—Whether trial judge erred in failing to instruct jury as to
provocation—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 215.

The Alberta Court of Appeal set aside
respondent’s conviction and ordered a new trial. It held that the trial judge
did not adequately instruct the jury on a possible verdict of manslaughter
arising from “excessive use of force” in self-defence and from provocation.
This appeal is to determine whether the trial judge erred in failing to
instruct the jury on these issues.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Where a killing resulted from the use of
excessive force in self-defence the accused loses the justification provided
under s. 34 of the Code and the defence of self-defence fails. It
does not follow automatically that the verdict must be murder. Unless it is
shown that the killing was accompanied by the intent required under
s. 212(a) of the Code, it remains a killing without intent, i.e.
manslaughter. Here, the difference between murder and manslaughter was
properly explained to the jury. In any event, where lack of intent to cause
grievous bodily harm is not even argued, the failure to repeat the murder/manslaughter
distinction cannot constitute an error. As to the second issue, the trial judge
rightly decided to refrain from putting the defence of provoca-

[Page 266]

tion to the jury. There was no evidence
produced on which a jury could decide that the accused acted out of sudden
provocation, killing in the “heat of passion”, as required by s. 215 of
the Code.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Alberta,
[1981] 5 W.W.R. 349, 61 C.C.C. (2d) 28, 30 A.R. 616, setting aside respondent’s
conviction for second degree murder and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed.

Jack Watson, for the appellant.

A. Clayton Rice, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question presented is whether the
trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury as to a possible verdict of
manslaughter arising from (i) “excessive use of force” in self‑defence,
(ii) provocation.

I

The respondent, Donald Faid, was charged that he
did unlawfully murder Robert Wilson and did thereby commit first degree murder.
He was tried before judge and jury, convicted of second degree murder and
sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until he had
served 13 years of this sentence. On appeal, the Court of Appeal of Alberta,
speaking through Harradence J.A., set aside the conviction and ordered a new
trial on the charge of second degree murder ([1981] 5 W.W.R. 349). The Court
held that the

[Page 267]

charge of the trial judge was exemplary in
dealing with the issue of justification of the use of force in self-defence but
that the judge had failed to direct the jury on the question of manslaughter if
the accused lost the absolute shield of justification through “excessive use of
force”, and this non-direction amounted to misdirection. The Court held further
that although counsel for Faid had not presented the defence of provocation, it
was the duty of the trial judge to place before the jury any defence reasonably
raised by the evidence. In the view of Harradence J.A., speaking for the Court,
there was evidence warranting a charge on provocation (at pp. 357-58):

Where the potential for a verdict of
manslaughter exists, the jury must be given the opportunity of considering that
verdict and the defence upon which it rests. Even where the circumstances of
the case indicate that a verdict of manslaughter based upon provocation seems
improbable, (as in this instance, where the testimony of the accused suggested
that he stabbed the accused [sic] to prevent him obtaining
another weapon), the issue of manslaughter must still be put to the jury.

II

The Evidence

The evidence disclosed that Wilson and Faid were
involved in the sale of drugs, that Wilson had threatened Faid and Wilson had a violent temper. Following a party at which Faid was informed
that Wilson was going to put a
“contract” out on him Faid returned to the trailer he shared with Wilson. When he arrived Wilson was asleep. At approximately 1:00
p.m. Wilson awoke and went into
the living room where Faid was sitting. Both men were in bathing suits. During
the conversation which followed, Faid inquired whether Wilson had put out, or was going to put out, a “contract” on him.
According to Faid he started to leave but Wilson blocked his way. The evidence of Faid as to what occurred
thereafter may be summarized as follows. Wilson hit Faid twice on the side of the head. Faid

[Page 268]

hit Wilson and Wilson fell over a coffee table. Wilson got up with a long-bladed boning
knife in his hand. Where the knife came from was not clear from the evidence. Wilson came toward Faid. Faid gave Wilson a “side kick”. Wilson fell back onto a chesterfield. Faid
grabbed a crescent wrench from the top of a television set. The wrench had been
used for changing the television channels as the channel selector was missing.
Faid hit Wilson on the back of
the head a number of times with the wrench, trying to knock Wilson out. The wrench slipped from Faid’s
hand. Faid then tried to grab Wilson’s hand which held the knife. Faid was on
top of Wilson on the chesterfield. After further struggle Faid got the knife
from Wilson and told Wilson “there was no need to go on, because I had the
knife and as far as I was concerned, the fight should have ended”. Wilson was
growling like an animal, trying to get up. Faid noticed a spear gun on the far
side of the chesterfield. In Faid’s words “it appeared to me that he was going
for that, he was trying to get up, and that was when I stabbed him. I stabbed
him to stop him. I was afraid that if he got loose he was going to kill me… I
stabbed him again and he fell to the floor, and the next thing I remember, I
was standing in the kitchen. I don’t remember stabbing him a third time”.
Wilson was dead. He had been stabbed three times in the back. No spear gun was
found or noted to be in the trailer when the police went there. Faid testified
he had acted in self-defence. His examination-in-chief ended with this passage:

Well, all I can say is that I never wanted
to kill him. I only stabbed him to stop him. At the time I did what I thought I
had to do and if I had a chance to do the same thing over again, I would still
have to react and to—maiming him to protect my life, because as far as I was
concerned, there was no other alternative that I could have used, just to stop
what he was trying to do. Only, as I look at it, it was very foolish of me to
try to hide things, especially burning the body. I don’t feel that I have
committed first degree murder, a murder of any sort, the only thing I can see I
am guilty of is trying to

[Page 269]

stay alive, and I don’t feel that I should
die in prison. That’s all I can say.

Following the killing Faid tried to remove any
trace of the event. He rented a “Rug Doctor” to clean the blood from the rug,
he took the chesterfield to the local dump, burned certain articles in the burn
barrel, disposed of the knife and wrench along a highway, and, finally, took
Wilson’s body to a country road, covered it with gasoline and set it ablaze. He
said that he was trying to “hide all things that were involved with this”.

Some two weeks later Faid was arrested for drug
trafficking. He gave a number of inconsistent statements, obviously intended to
mislead the police and later made a number of admissions as to relevant facts.
One of the police officers testified that Faid made the comment “He ripped me
off, he ripped everybody off, the fucker deserved it”. At trial, Faid denied
making this remark.

Faid was described by one of the police
witnesses as being 6 feet 3 inches tall and perhaps 240 pounds. He put himself
at 6 feet and 225 pounds. Two of the witnesses described Wilson as 5 feet 8½
inches tall, and 155 pounds, according to one witness, or 170 pounds according
to the other witness. Faid said that Wilson was roughly an inch shorter than
himself and that Wilson wore size 34 pants to his own size 38. A fingerprint
form entered as an exhibit recorded Wilson’s height and weight at 5 feet 10
inches, 190 pounds.

The theory of the Crown was that Faid
deliberately killed Wilson in order to resolve a dispute over money which had
arisen earlier. The theory of the defence was self-defence. Addressing the jury
prior to calling defence evidence counsel for the defence said:

The defence here, so you understand, is the
defence of self-defence, that the killing of Mr. Wilson by Donald Faid was
done in self-defence.

The two main issues left to the jury were (i)
whether Faid killed Wilson with the intent con-

[Page 270]

templated in s. 212 of the Criminal Code
and (ii) whether Faid was legitimately acting in self‑defence. The
jury resolved both issues adversely to Faid.

III

Excessive Use of Force in Self-Defence

It was, as I have said, the view of the Court of
Appeal that a manslaughter verdict was open in circumstances where an accused
used excessive force in self-defence. In such circumstances an accused might
lose the absolute shield of justification entitling him to an acquittal
pursuant to s. 34 of the Code but he would not be guilty of murder.
The “half-way house” shelter of manslaughter was available to him. The Court
followed two earlier decisions of the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.
Fraser (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 503 and R. v. Gee (1980), 55 C.C.C.
(2d) 525.

In R. v. Brisson, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 227,
this Court had occasion to consider whether a jury should find an accused
guilty only of manslaughter, and not murder, if they found the accused had used
excessive force in defending himself. The result was indecisive.
Mr. Justice Beetz, Mr. Justice Chouinard and Mr. Justice Lamer
shared my view that there is no special rule to the effect that death caused by
the use of excessive force in self-defence can only be manslaughter, though the
facts on which the defence of self-defence was unsuccessfully sought to be
based may in some cases go to show that the defendant acted under provocation
or that, although acting unlawfully, he lacked the intent to kill or cause
grievous bodily harm. In such cases a verdict of manslaughter would be proper.
In Brisson the Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice Ritchie agreed,
was of opinion that there was no evidence upon which the trial judge could have
left to the jury the issue of self-defence, let alone any issue of excessive
self-defence as a basis for a verdict of manslaughter. Mr. Justice
McIntyre, with whom Justices Martland and Estey agreed, in separate

[Page 271]

reasons, expressed a similar view.

In Brisson I sought to explain why, in my
opinion, a verdict of manslaughter, except in the circumstances to which I have
earlier alluded, is not available where an accused acting in self-defence, as
described in s. 34 of the Code, causes a death by the use of an
excess of force. I am still of that opinion. The position of the Alberta Court
of Appeal that there is a “half‑way” house outside s. 34 of the Code
is, in my view, inapplicable to the Canadian codified system of criminal
law, it lacks any recognizable basis in principle, would require prolix and
complicated jury charges and would encourage juries to reach compromise
verdicts to the prejudice of either the accused or the Crown. Where a killing
has resulted from the excessive use of force in self-defence the accused loses
the justification provided under s. 34. There is no partial justification
open under the section. Once the jury reaches the conclusion that excessive
force has been used the defence of self-defence has failed. It does not follow
automatically, however, that the verdict must be murder. The accused has become
responsible for a killing. He has no justification on the basis of
self-defence, but unless it is shown that the killing was accompanied by the
intent required under s. 212(a) of the Code, it remains a
killing without intent, in other words manslaughter. If the jury considers that
excessive force has been used, and has resulted in a death, they must then ask
themselves whether the accused in causing the killing possessed the intent
described in s. 212(a) of the Code, that is, an intent to
kill or cause bodily harm likely to cause death. If they are satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the intent was present, they should find the accused
guilty of murder. However, in the event they found no such intent existed, or
had a doubt as to its existence, they should convict of manslaughter. This
conviction would rest upon the fact that an unlawful killing had been committed
without the intent required to make it murder under s. 212(a).

[Page 272]

After instructing the jury with respect to the
elements of the justification provided by s. 34(2) the trial judge said:

If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable
doubt on all the evidence that the accused did not kill Wilson in circumstance
which conform with any of the situations of self-defence in law, as I have
explained them, then the Crown has proved that the blows with the wrench and
the knife by Faid against Wilson were not justified. In that event, the defence
of self-defence is not available to the accused.

Earlier in the charge the trial judge explained
the difference between murder and manslaughter in these terms:

Now if you cannot find that Faid has the
intent required for murder as I have explained it to you, then you may find
that he is guilty of manslaughter and not murder.

It may be that the trial judge’s charge to the
jury would have been better for expressly pointing out, after outlining the
elements of the s. 34(2) defence, that a verdict of murder does not
automatically follow a finding that the s. 34(2) defence is unavailable because
the accused used excessive force in self-defence. The trial judge might then
have explained that the jury could convict of either murder or manslaughter,
depending upon their finding as to the presence or absence of the intents
required to be proved by s. 212(a). In my opinion, however,
the failure to repeat the murder/manslaughter distinction does not constitute
error. The only defence put forward in this case was self-defence. Faid denied
that he intended to kill Wilson; understandably, however, he did not contend
that in stabbing Wilson in the back three times, he did not intend to cause
bodily harm likely to cause death. Indeed, he admitted “I did what I thought I
had to do… maiming him to protect my life”. The jury found Faid guilty of
murder. The difference between murder and manslaughter was properly explained
to them. The jury evidently concluded that Faid intended to kill or cause
bodily harm likely to cause death. Indeed, the facts in this case permit no
other conclusion. In my opinion the result would be the same no matter how
often the trial judge repeated the murder manslaughter distinction. In any
event, where lack of intent to cause grievous bodily harm is not even

[Page 273]

argued, it cannot be error for the trial judge
to fail to repeat, for the sake of emphasis, that unintentional killing is
manslaughter, but not murder.

I add this observation. The suggestion that the
trial judge’s charge might have been improved by repeating the
murder/manslaughter distinction might seem reasonable because of the uncertain
state of the law, after Brisson, with respect to the availability of a
manslaughter verdict where a s. 34 defence fails only because the accused
employed excessive force in defending himself. Uncertainty as to the
availability of a verdict of manslaughter on this basis might have made it
desirable, perhaps, to indicate unequivocally that manslaughter is available,
and is the proper verdict, where proof of intentional killing is lacking. But
the uncertainty that makes this clarification helpful exists in the minds of
lawyers steeped in Brisson and like cases, not in the minds of jurors.
This jury was told that intentional killing was murder, and that unintentional
killing was manslaughter. They found Faid guilty of murder. I see no reason for
suspecting that the jury could have convicted for murder while harbouring any
reasonable doubt as to intent.

A final point: in explaining s. 34(2) to
the jury the trial judge made the following observation:

…even if the accused intended to cause death
or grievous bodily harm, his actions may have been justified as self-defence
under Section 34(2) of the Criminal Code.

Two interpretations of s. 34(2) are
possible: (i) the one taken by the trial judge, namely, that s. 34(2)
provides a justification against an intentional killing done in self-defence;
and (ii) that s. 34(2) is not applicable in an intentional killing
situation,

[Page 274]

and provides no defence to an intentional
killing, because the purpose of the section is to justify force which would
otherwise be unlawful, the force so justified being the force referred to in
s. 34(1), namely, a force not intended to cause death or grievous bodily
harm likely to cause death. It may be that the trial judge’s interpretation is
the correct one, when one reads s. 34(2) together with s. 37 of the Code.
It is not necessary to decide the point in this case, however, because even
if the trial judge’s interpretation is erroneous, the error worked to Faid’s
advantage, insofar as this interpretation of s. 34(2) made the defence
therein provided available to Faid, which it would not be if the other
interpretation is the correct one.

With respect, I conclude that the Court of
Appeal of Alberta erred in finding misdirection in the failure of the judge at
trial to instruct the jury that they could bring in a verdict of manslaughter
if they found that s. 34 was not available to the accused by reason of
excessive use of force.

IV

Provocation

It is commonplace that the fact that an accused
does not raise a defence does not relieve the trial judge from the duty of
putting the matter before the jury, where there are facts in evidence for the
jury to consider. In the case at bar counsel for the accused did not raise
provocation as a defence. Indeed the record would indicate that he deliberately
refrained from doing so. At the conclusion of the charge the court asked
counsel whether he had any comments about the charge. The record reads:

Mr. Barker: No, my Lord. Well I wonder
if you might—you brought manslaughter to their attention, but I am wondering if
you might also point out manslaughter in relation to provocation, and the two
blows, evidence of the two blows struck by Mr. Wilson upon Mr. Faid.
As I recall you opened the possibility of manslaughter to them based upon—

[Page 275]

The Court: Faid did not—

Mr. Barker: Possess the necessary
intention. That would be plain to them, but there is the evidence and I didn’t
bring it in my charge for a very good reason, and if I may rely on the Court to
do that if you see fit, based on the two blows that were struck by
Mr. Wilson, according to Mr. Faid. I would ask that you do that,
otherwise I have no further submission to make.

The Court: Thank you.

The judge declined to recall the jury stating,
in respect of the foregoing, and in respect of the points raised by Crown
counsel:

The Court: Gentlemen, I have the view that
when the jury is charged that they assimilate better the total effect, the
impact of the explanations and the reviews than in circumstances when they are
brought back; and although I think there may be some merit in the particular
points raised, but taking the matter in balance it is my view that I will not
re-call the jury, and the charge will stand.

Provocation as a defence to a charge of murder
in Canada is governed by s. 215 (1), (2) and (3) of the Criminal Code which
provides as follows:

215. (1)
Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter
if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation.

(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool.

(3) For the purposes of this
section the questions

(a) whether a particular wrongful
act or insult amounted to provocation, and

(b) whether the accused was deprived
of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he received,

are questions of fact, but no one shall be
deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that he had a
legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him to do in
order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to
any human being.

The law, properly in my view, recognizes a
lesser degree of culpability in a person who is provoked to the extent of
losing his self-control and who kills

[Page 276]

in the heat of passion. It was pointed out by
Viscount Simon, however, in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions (1941),
28 Cr. App. R. 65, at p. 74 that “It is not all provocation that will
reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter. Provocation, to have that result
must be such as temporarily deprives the person provoked of the power of
self-control, as the result of which he commits the unlawful act which causes
death.” As Rand J. said in R. v. Tripodi, [1955] S.C.R. 438, at
p. 443:

What s. 261 of the Code [now
s. 215] provides for is “sudden provocation”, and it must be acted upon by
the accused “on the sudden and before there has been time for his passion to
cool”. “Suddenness” must characterize both the insult and the act of
retaliation. The question here is whether there was any evidence on which the
jury, acting judicially, could find the existence of “sudden provocation”.

I take that expression to mean that the
wrongful act or insult must strike upon a mind unprepared for it, that it must
make an unexpected impact that takes the understanding by surprise and sets the
passions aflame. What was there of that here?

There are two key elements to a defence of
provocation reducing what would otherwise be culpable murder to manslaughter.
The person causing death must have done so (i) in the “heat of passion”, caused
by (ii) “sudden provocation”. Whether the accused was provoked to lose his
self-control is a question of fact for the jury. Where an accused testifies
that he killed impulsively in hot blood it must be left to the jury to decide
whether he is to be believed or not. There is, however, the preliminary
question to be decided by the judge as a question of law, namely, whether there
was any evidence produced on which a jury could decide that the accused acted
in the heat of passion. The question as to whether or not there is any evidence
is for the court, but subject to that the following matters are both questions
of fact for the jury, namely, (i) the sufficiency of the particular wrongful
act or insult to cause an ordinary person to be deprived of self-control, and
(ii) whether the accused was actually deprived of his

[Page 277]

self-control by such act or insult: per Kellock
J. in Taylor v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 462, at p. 472.

Professor Glanville Williams in his Textbook
of Criminal Law (1978), at p. 480, makes the point that in order to
have the defence of provocation the defendant must have killed because he was
provoked, not merely because provocation existed. There must be a causal
connection between the provocation and the killing.

As the Court of Appeal of Alberta stated in its
judgment in the case at bar, the nature of the evidence required to leave the
defence of provocation with the jury was set down by this Court in Parnerkar
v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449, approved by the full Court in R. v.
Squire, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13. In Parnerkar Fauteux C.J. said (at
p. 454):

The function assigned to the jury with
respect to the particular facts mentioned in s. 203(3) [now
s. 215(3)] does not in any way differ from the function they have to
decide all other questions of fact, whether these facts constitute elements of
a crime or elements of an excuse or a justification for a crime charged. Indeed
and in all of the cases, the valid exercise of the function of the jury is,
according to the very words of the oath of office taken by them, to give a
verdict according to evidence. They cannot go beyond the evidence and resort to
speculation nor, of course, would it be proper for the trial judge to invite
them to do so. If, then, the record is denuded of any evidence potentially
enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially to find a wrongful act or insult
of the nature and effect set forth in s. 203(3)(a) and (b),
it is then, as a matter of law, within the area exclusively reserved to the
trial judge to so decide and his duty to refrain from putting the defence of
provocation to the jury.

There is nothing, either expressed or
necessarily implied, in the language of s. 203(3) to indicate an intention
of Parliament to modify the principle according to which the sufficiency of
evidence, which is an issue only where there is some evidence, is a question of
fact for the jury and the absence of evidence is a question of law for the
trial judge.

[Page 278]

In the present case the question is whether
there was any evidence potentially enabling a reasonable jury acting judicially
to find that Faid was deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation
that he alleged he received. Counsel for Faid referred only to the two blows
which Faid testified to. The Court of Appeal of Alberta said (at p. 357):

In this case the appellant testified that
during his conversation with Wilson in the trailer, Wilson confirmed that he
had or was going to place a “contract” on the appellant’s life, and inquired
with a smile what he, the appellant, intended to do about it. The appellant
further testified that he was immediately attacked by Wilson, firstly with
blows, and subsequently with a knife, on his attempt to leave the trailer after
this conversation.

The Court went on to say that the circumstances
of this case indicated that a verdict of manslaughter seemed improbable where
the accused stabbed the deceased to prevent him obtaining another weapon.

There can be no doubt that a reasonable jury
acting judicially could find a blow to the head or a knife attack to be a
wrongful act or insult of the nature and effect set forth in s. 215 (3).
Provocation no doubt existed here but that is not the end of the inquiry. The
critical question to be answered in this case was whether there was any evidence
that Faid was provoked. Was there any evidence of passion or that he “acted
upon” the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool? We have only his evidence on the point and nowhere in that evidence
does one find any suggestion that as a result of the blows or other conduct of
Wilson he was enraged, or that his passions were inflamed, or that he killed in
heat of blood. There was no evidence of “a sudden temporary loss of control
rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make him or her for the
moment not master of his mind” which is, as Devlin J. said in R. v. Duffy, [1949]
1 All E.R. 932, of the essence of provocation. The defence throughout, the only
defence, was self-defence. Faid, on his version, was using measured force to

[Page 279]

resist the force being used against him.

The absence of evidence of passion is probably
understandable. It would have been fatal to the defence of self-defence to say
that, if the self-defence plea failed, then, in the alternative, Faid stabbed
Wilson in the heat of passion while deprived of the power of self-control.

Let us return briefly to the evidence. According
to his narrative Faid received two blows and responded by punching Wilson and
knocking him over the coffee table. Faid did not then attack Wilson. On the
contrary Wilson arose with a knife, Faid “side kicked” Wilson, knocked him down
again, and then had recourse to the crescent wrench:

That’s when I very quickly just reacted,
grabbed the crescent wrench, ran over to him and it him on the back of the head
a number of times, as I was trying to knock him out. I figured that if I could
knock him out that would be it and I could leave, there would be no further
fighting.

There is no suggestion in this that Faid was
provoked to homicidal actions. After the struggle Faid was on top of Wilson.
Faid had the knife. His testimony continues:

When I got the knife away from him and told
him that it was—that was it, there was no need to go on, because I had the
knife and as far as I was concerned, the fight should have ended, because it
didn’t make sense for him to try and get up, because I wasn’t about to stab
him.

Again there is no evidence that Faid acted out
of provocation. According to Faid, Wilson appeared to be attempting to get a
“spear gun” and, as a result:

I stabbed him to stop him, I didn’t stab
him to kill him. I stabbed him once and it didn’t seem to affect him at all… I
stabbed him in the upper back, which was the only thing that was open to me, I
didn’t stab him there because his heart was there or any reason like that, I
just stabbed him.

In his later evidence, Faid said:

[Page 280]

He was going towards that general direction
[of the spear gun]. I would have taken that he was trying to get it. I was also
taking it that he was trying to get up.

There is not a vestige of evidence to support an
argument that Faid killed in the heat of passion. No doubt for this reason
counsel for Faid refrained from addressing any such argument to the jury.

I conclude with a passage from the judgment of
my brother McIntyre in Olbey v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1008 which
seems apt (at p. 1022):

It will be recalled that the appellant did
not raise the defence of provocation at trial but relied on self-defence. It
may be observed here that at no time did the appellant say that he had been
provoked into violent conduct by the words and conduct of the deceased. In
fact, his description of events goes far to negate any suggestion of
provocation. His evidence reveals an attack, described clearly and with some
detail, to which he reacted, not on the sudden, but by defending himself. When,
according to his evidence, he saw the deceased put his hand inside his sweater,
he considered that the deceased was reaching for a gun and, in fear of his
life, he shot and killed him. This describes a calculated and rational series
of defensive acts, not a sudden reaction in the heat of passion.

In the circumstances I do not think that the
question of the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) arises. There is
simply no evidence capable of supporting or “conveying any sense of reality” to
a defence of provocation. Faid said that it was self-defence which led him to
kill Wilson. The jury rejected that claim. There is no evidentiary foundation
sufficient to convey reality to a fall-back position based on provoked killing
in the “heat of passion”.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal of Alberta and restore the judgment of conviction in the
Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta. As the respondent appealed both conviction
and sentence to the Court of Appeal and was successful on the appeal as to
conviction that Court did not have occasion to consider the appeal as to
sentence. I would refer the matter back to the Court of Appeal of Alberta to hear
and dispose of the sentence appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Cross-examination of
Crown witness—Trial judge erred in precluding questions concerning witness’
outstanding indictment—Whether error a substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

Appellant, who was convicted of second degree
murder, put forward several allegations on appeal, among them, that the trial
judge erred in precluding cross-examination by the defence of a Crown witness
with respect to an outstanding murder charge preferred against that witness by
the same police department that had laid the present charge against the
appellant. The Court of Appeal, applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code,
dismissed the appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

Cross-examination of a Crown witness
concerning an outstanding indictment against that witness is proper and
admissible for the purpose of showing a possible motivation to seek favour with
the prosecution. Here, the trial judge erred in precluding defence counsel from
pursuing this line of questioning. The provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code could not be applied to this case. It could not be
said with the necessary degree of finality that, without that error, the jury
as reasonable men, could not have done otherwise than find the appellant
guilty.

Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, considered; Koufis v. The King, [1941]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing
appellant’s appeal from his conviction of second degree murder. Appeal allowed.

[Page 260]

Alan D. Gold, for the appellant.

David Watt, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought with leave
of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing the
appeal of the appellant from his conviction of the offence of second degree
murder entered after a trial held before Mr. Justice Osler sitting with a
jury at the assizes of the Supreme Court of Ontario at Ottawa on a charge that
he

… on or about the 3rd day of February,
1978, at the City of Ottawa in the said Judicial District, did unlawfully kill
one Douglas Castle and thereby committed first degree murder, contrary to the
form of the Criminal Code of Canada, Section 218.

The reasons for judgment from which this appeal
is taken are to be found in the following “Disposition” endorsed on the Notice
of Appeal by Jessup, J.A. on behalf of the Court of Appeal:

DISPOSITION
OF APPEAL

We would dismiss the appeal for the reasons
argued in the Respondents [sic] factum, and in particular that the
verdict was reasonable and that any errors in the admission or exclusion of
evidence caused no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

Initially some inconvenience was occasioned in
this Court by reason of the fact that the respondent’s factum was not included
in the material submitted and formed no part of the Case on Appeal; however,
with the co-operation of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, it was found that the
submissions made here on behalf of the respondent were virtually identical with
those submitted in “The respondents [sic] factum” to which Jessup, J.A.
referred and it was apparent that the central points at issue as described in
the factum of the appellant in this Court were:

Whether the learned trial judge erred in
precluding defence cross-examination of a Crown witness concerning an
outstanding charge of murder against the witness.

[Page 261]

Whether the learned trial judge erred in
not granting a motion for a directed verdict on the charge as laid at the close
of the Crown’s case prior to calling on the defence to call evidence, or
alternatively erred in not amending the charge from first to second degree
murder at that point.

Whether the learned trial judge erred in
failing to caution the jury of the danger of acting on the uncorroborated
evidence of the disreputable witnesses Miehm and Assaly.

Whether the Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in applying
Section 613(1)(b)(iii) in the circumstances.

The question of whether or not any of the errors
alleged to have been made by the learned trial judge are such as to warrant
this appeal being decided in favour of the appellant is of course to be
considered in light of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code which
provides that:

613. (1) On
the hearing of an appeal against a conviction… the court of appeal

…

(b) may dismiss the appeal where

…

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of
the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the
appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred;

This section falls to be considered in
light of the decision of this Court in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965]
S.C.R. 739, which was carefully considered in the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia in R. v. Miller and Cockriell (1976), 24 C.C.C. (2d) 401 where
Robertson J.A. wrote the principal judgment of the court and particular
reference was made to the judgment of Spence J. at p. 755 of the Supreme
Court of Canada Report where he said:

Therefore, this Court must apply the test
set out in the aforesaid cases and, to quote again from Brooks v. The King [(1927),
48 C.C.C. 333 at p. 358, [1928] 1 D.L.R. 268 at p. 271, [1927] S.C.R. 633]:

… the onus was upon the Crown to satisfy
the Court that the jury, charged as it should have been, could

[Page 262]

not, as reasonable men, have done otherwise
than find the appellant guilty.

I think it desirable to deal with the above
issues in the order in which they are presented.

The first issue has to do with the evidence of
the Crown witness Miehm and the validity or otherwise of the ruling made by
Mr. Justice Osler precluding his being cross-examined relating to an
outstanding indictment preferred against him in a different case and not
disposed of at the time of the Titus trial.

It is not by any means impossible that the
jury’s verdict might have been affected if they had known the facts of Miehm’s
background and the motive which it afforded him to favour the prosecution’s
case. The burden lies upon the Crown to prove that the verdict would necessarily
have been the same, and I cannot say with any finality that that would have
been so had Osler J. permitted the cross-examination on Miehm’s pending trial
for another murder. The judge’s ruling in this regard reads as follows:

In this matter, a witness called by the
Crown has been examined-in-chief and has admitted to a number of prior
convictions. On cross-examination, Counsel for the accused now wishes to ask
the witness whether he is not, at this time, facing a serious criminal charge
laid against him by the same police department that laid the charge now before
the Court and faced by Mr. Titus.

While there appears to be no direct
authority on the point, by analogy with the well‑known decision in Koufas
vs. The King [sic] it seems to me it would be wrong to expose the
witness to such a question. Within the discretion of a trial judge, it is
virtually never permitted to Counsel to cross-examine with respect to charges
laid or pending but not finally dealt with. Section 12(1) of the Evidence
Act is clear authority for the way in which previous convictions may be put to
a witness and, treating the matter completely at large, it seems to me that,
conviction having been dealt with in the section, it was not the intention of
Parliament that a charge should expose a witness to the same procedure. To
request such questions would be to run directly contrary to the practice
governed by the basic presumption that all persons are innocent until proved
guilty, and the prejudicial effect with respect to the witness

[Page 263]

might be very considerable. As a matter of
logic, it cannot properly be stated that the laying of a charge affects the
character of a witness, and it would not, in my view, be proper to investigate
such an occurrence in the present circumstances. I should add that the charge
laid is said to be in no way related to the offence now before the Court, or to
the events surrounding that offence.

The questions may not at this stage be put
to the witness.

The case of Koufis, to which the learned
trial judge was obviously referring, is reported in [1941] S.C.R. 481 and is
concerned with the cross-examination of the accused in relation to prior
convictions and it has no relevance to the position of a Crown witness other
than the accused. It should furthermore be observed that s. 12(1) of the Canada
Evidence Act is concerned with examination of a witness relating to
previous convictions. It is to be remembered that in the present case Miehm was
neither an accused nor was it proposed to question him concerning a previous
conviction but rather to inquire as to his having been indicted although not
yet tried. In this regard I am satisfied that the appellant was on sound ground
in submitting that cross-examination of a Crown witness concerning an
outstanding indictment against that witness is proper and admissible for the
purpose of showing a possible motivation to seek favour with the prosecution.

I think it essential to stress the purpose for
which the cross-examination is permitted, namely, in order that the defence may
explore to the full all factors which might expose the frailty of the evidence
called by the prosecution. That the accused as he stands in the prisoner’s box
on trial for murder is deemed to be innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt is one of the fundamental presumptions inherent in the common
law and as such the accused is entitled to employ every legitimate means of
testing the evidence called by the Crown to negative that presumption and in my
opinion this includes the right to explore all circumstances capable of
indicating that any of the prosecution witnesses had a motive

[Page 264]

for favouring the Crown. In my opinion the
outstanding indictment preferred against the witness by the same police
department that had laid the present charge against Titus constitutes such a
circumstance and accordingly I am of opinion that the learned trial judge did
indeed err in precluding defence counsel from pursuing this line of
questioning.

As to the second issue raised by the appellant
concerning the alleged error of the trial judge in failing to grant the
appellant’s motion for a directed verdict, I am of opinion that this was indeed
an error which might have affected the appellant’s decision to call no evidence
at the close of the Crown’s case, but any such error was corrected in the final
address to the jury by the trial judge which included the following direction:

Counsel have put it to you, and I formally
instruct you as a matter of law, that there could be no conviction for first
degree murder in this case.

I should say also as to the third alleged error
that I cannot find the verdict to have been affected by any failure of the
trial judge to further caution the jury as to the danger of acting on the
uncorroborated evidence of Miehm and Assaly. This is not an end of the matter
however, as the first error remains outstanding and in my view it cannot be
said with the necessary degree of finality that if the judge had not erred in
failing to permit the cross-examination of Miehm the jury, as reasonable men,
could not have done otherwise than find the accused guilty.

With the greatest respect for the Court of
Appeal, I am accordingly of opinion that this is not a case to which the
provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code are
applicable.

It follows that I would allow this appeal on the
first issue and direct that a new trial be held.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Murder—Respondent charged with
second degree murder—Evidence establishing first degree murder—Whether or not
accused can be convicted of lesser included offence when evidence establishing
guilt of the greater offence—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 212, 213,
214, 247, 511.

Respondent, although originally charged with
First degree murder, was committed to trial, at the Crown’s request following
the preliminary hearing, on the lesser offence of second degree murder. At
trial, however, respondent’s description of the circumstances surrounding the
murder prompted the Crown to ask the judge to charge the jury with respect to
constructive murder arising from unlawful confinement—an offence classified as
first degree murder. Respondent, using a loaded rifle, had “persuaded” everyone
at his girl friend’s house to leave. When the girl’s hysteria continued, even
after he put the rifle in a different room, respondent retrieved it and shot
her. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the respondent’s appeal from his
conviction of second degree murder and ordered a new trial; appellant appealed
that decision.

Held (Ritchie
and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Dickson,
Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: A conviction for second degree murder
can be maintained when that offence has been charged even though the accused,
by operation of statute, would have been guilty of first degree murder if so
charged. The indictment need state only the legal character of the offence and
not the exact section or sections of the Code. Sections 212
and 213 set out the elements of murder. To prove second degree murder, the
Crown had to prove one of the requisite intents set out in s. 212, or that
the accused had caused death during the commission of an offence set out in
s. 213—here, forcible confinement—

[Page 125]

while using a weapon and during which death
ensued as a consequence. Section 214 is subservient to ss. 212 and 213, and
only classifies murder as first or second degree for sentencing purposes. The
jury’s primary and essential determination was whether or not murder had been
committed pursuant to ss. 212 or 213, and to this end considerations of the
distinction between first and second degree murder were irrelevant. The trial
judge did not need to make any reference in his charge to the jury to a finding
of first degree murder pursuant to s. 214(5)(a) when the accused
did not face the charge.

Even though the charge was reduced to second
degree murder, respondent was not entitled to assume that he could not be tried
for “murder by forcible confinement with a gun” because s. 214 made that
offence first degree murder. The evidence established the factual underpinning
of the charge and the charge to the jury could have been anticipated. The
accused was never in jeopardy of a conviction of first degree murder and was
not prejudiced in having to meet a first degree murder test.

The trial judge did not err in charging the
jury on the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his
actions for he clearly identified it as one of common sense and not of law, and
he clearly indicated the jury was not required to draw the inference. The trial
judge properly allowed the Crown’s cross-examination in respect of alleged
incidents of earlier assault in view of the fact that Farrant had put his
non-violent character in issue in earlier testimony. There is nothing in the
evidence to support the contention that the trial judge, in the exercise of his
discretion, erred in ruling the accused’s statement to police voluntary and
admissible.

Per Ritchie
and Wilson JJ. (dissenting): The conviction for second degree murder
cannot be maintained when the respondent was charged with second degree murder
which required a specific intent and the jury was instructed on first degree
murder that required no such intent. The accused was prepared to address the
“intents” required to prove second degree murder but not the question of
forcible confinement that was central to the issue of constructive murder. The
prejudice caused the accused occurred because the element of

[Page 126]

intent required for conviction on the lesser
offence of second degree murder was not a prerequisite for conviction on
constructive murder.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal (1981), 9 Sask.
R. 7, allowing an appeal from a conviction and ordering a new trial. Appeal
allowed, Ritchie and Wilson JJ. dissenting.

Kenneth W. MacKay, for the appellant.

Benjamin Goldstein, Q.C., and Robert
Jackson, for the respondent.

The reasons of Ritchie and Wilson JJ. were
delivered by

WILSON J. (dissenting)—I share the
view of the members of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal that the jury’s verdict
in this case cannot stand.

It is not necessary for me to review the events
leading up to the tragic death of sixteen year old Shannon Russell. My
colleague, Mr. Justice Dickson, has already done so. I wish merely to make
a few observations about ss. 212, 213 and 214 of the Criminal Code and
their application to the facts of this case.

It is common ground, I believe, that while
s. 212 requires a mental element in respect of the death, s. 213 does
not. The only intent required for a murder conviction under s. 213 is the
intent to commit the offence in the course of committing which the death
ensued. Applying that to this case, the intent required to be proved against
the respondent for a conviction under s. 213 was the intent to forcibly
confine Shannon. If that intent were proved, then the respondent would be
guilty of the offence of constructive murder under s. 213.

Section 214 classifies murder. It states that it
is either first or second degree. It is first degree if planned and deliberate.
It is also first degree if, even although not planned and deliberate, death

[Page 127]

occurred inter alia in the course of
forcibly confining. Murder that is not first degree is second degree.

The respondent was charged with second degree
murder. Since he admitted that he caused Shannon’s death, the only issue for
the jury was whether he had either of the intents required by s. 212.
Indeed, from the opening of the trial to the conclusion of the evidence, this
was expressed by all parties, including the presiding judge, to be the sole
issue before the Court. If he had the required intent, it was murder. If not,
it was manslaughter. However, at the close of the evidence, after a week of
trial, counsel for the Crown for the first time took the position that the jury
should be instructed with respect to s. 213(d) of the Code to
which defence counsel strenuously objected. The trial judge, however, charged
the jury on s. 213(d) and instructed them that if they found
that Shannon’s death occurred
while the respondent was forcibly confining her, then they could find him
guilty of murder because he had a gun. At no time, however, did he tell them
that, of course, that would be first degree murder with which the accused was
not charged.

In my respectful view the issue in this case is
not which is the controlling section of the Code, s. 214 or ss. 212
and 213. Nor is it whether s. 214 is substantive in terms of
distinguishing distinct offences of first and second degree murder or merely
classifying them for sentencing purposes. I think the issue is: can the
conviction for second degree murder be maintained when the respondent was
charged with second degree murder which required a specific intent and the jury
was instructed on first degree murder that required no such intent. I think it
cannot. The accused, having been charged with second degree, was entitled to
plead and conduct his defence on the basis that the Crown had to prove one of
the intents under s. 212. This was the case he came prepared to meet. He
denied having either of these intents and testified that the gun simply went
off. The jury,

[Page 128]

however, may have convicted him, in light of the
judge’s charge, on the basis of having an entirely different intent, namely, an
intent to forcibly confine and this he was not prepared to meet. We cannot be
sure on what basis the jury convicted him. We do know that, after retiring,
they came back with questions as to what constituted confinement.

It is, in my view, specious to say that the
respondent cannot claim to be prejudiced by a conviction on a lesser charge
where the evidence supports a greater one. I think, with all due respect, that
this misses the point. On the basis of the charge laid the respondent was not
vulnerable to a conviction on proof only of an intent to forcibly confine. One
of the intents under s. 212 had to be proved against him. This is not the
case of an accused charged with a lesser included offence being convicted of
the lesser offence where on the evidence he would also have been guilty of the
greater offence. One of the elements required for a conviction on the lesser
offence of second degree murder, i.e. intent, is not a prerequisite for
a conviction of constructive murder. This is what, in my view, caused real
prejudice to the respondent. Had he appreciated that he might be convicted
under s. 213 he might either not have testified at all or presented
evidence to negate the intent to forcibly confine. Moreover, had the issue of
forcible confinement been raised by the indictment his counsel might well have
mounted an argument that what happened in this case did not amount to “forcible
confinement” within the meaning of s. 247 at all. One might well ask
whether, if Shannon had not been killed, the respondent would have been charged
with forcible confinement under s. 247(2) which seems to be directed to
forcible confinement in a kidnapping or hostage-taking context.

[Page 129]

I would dismiss the appeal for these reasons as
well as for those given by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.

The judgment of Dickson, Estey, McIntyre,
Chouinard and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question is whether the trial
judge erred in charging the jury on s. 213, the so-called “constructive
murder” provision of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34. Section
213 embodies the concept that when a weapon is used in the course of certain
specified criminal acts and death results, the accused is treated as if the mens
rea for murder existed and the homicide is murder. The unintended or
accidental lethal act is murder because the actus reus of homicide is
present and the killing is neither justifiable nor excusable. Rightly or
wrongly, since the time of Coke, the law has imported to such acts the mental
element for murder (Coke’s Institutes (1977), vol. 3, p. 56). See
also Hale, Pleas of the Crown (1st Am. ed. 1847), vol. 1, pp. 424-503,
Foster, Foster’s Crown Cases and Crown Law (3d Ed. 1792), at pp. 256,
258 and 308, Blackstone, Blackstone Commentaries, vol. 4, pp. 192-93 and
200‑01, East, Pleas of the Crown (1896), vol. 1, p. 255, and
Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England (1883), pp. 57 and 75.
Coke gives this example: If A, meaning to steal a deer in the park of B, shoots
at the deer, and by the glance of the arrow kills a boy hidden in the bush,
that is murder although A had no intent to hurt the boy. East discusses the
subject under the rubric “Homicide in the prosecution of some act or purpose
criminal or unlawful itself; wherein death ensues collaterally to or beside the
principal intent.”

It might be observed in passing that the
constructive murder rule has been the subject of protracted criticism: Willis
(1951), 29 Can. Bar Rev. 784; Edwards (1960-61), 3 Cr. L.Q. 481; Hooper
(1967-78), 3 U.B.C. L. Rev. 55; Sedgwick (1955), 33 Can. Bar Rev. 63; Burns and
Reid (1977), 55 Can. Bar Rev. 75. As Stuart states in his recent

[Page 130]

work on Canadian Criminal Law, at
p. 223, the vital issue of whether there was a culpable mind respecting
death is simply predetermined and withdrawn from the jury. Section 212 requires
mental culpability in respect of death; s. 213 does not. A killing in the
course of the specified offences may be murder even though the offender never
intended that result. All that is required is the mens rea for the
lesser offence. See R. v. Swietlinski, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956, at
p. 967. In England the Homicide Act, 1957 did away with the rule.
The rule may seem harsh but it is not the function of this Court to consider
the policy of legislation validly enacted. So long as the
section continues in our Criminal Code it must be given effect in
accordance with its terms.

The Facts

The tragic incident which gave rise to the
present proceedings arose out of the fatal shooting in the City of Saskatoon on
the evening of Friday, September 14, 1979 of Shannon Russell, aged sixteen. She
was shot by Rolan Farrant, aged seventeen. Shannon and her friend Shelly Thomas
had spent the day together. Early in the evening they went to a friend’s house
for a party. Farrant arrived later. He and Shannon were childhood friends. They
had been “going steady” for four years. Between 8:15 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. Farrant
drank four bottles of beer and had four or five drags, or “tokes” as he called
them, from a pipe of marihuana. Farrant and Shannon talked alone. There was
evience of an argument. In his statement to the police Farrant said “She didn’t
like the way I treated her, I didn’t like the way she was treating me. We just
haven’t been getting along lately”. Then Shannon and her friend left. They went
to Shannon’s house. Other friends arrived. Farrant phoned Shannon. He wanted to
come over and talk to her. She told him she did not want to talk with him as
her friends were there. He told her that he was coming anyway, and that he was
bringing a rifle. Upon arrival, he approached the house from the rear, leaving
the rifle in his vehicle. He met two of his friends on the back porch and asked
them to leave so he could talk to Shannon

[Page 131]

alone. He went inside and ordered everyone to
“go have a coffee for half an hour”. No one left. He went out the back door,
loaded the rifle, and returned to the house with it. Then, as the trial judge
expressed it, “with the persuasiveness of the rifle” they all left. The
witnesses at trial said that Farrant “motioned with his gun” for everyone to
leave. One of Shannon’s friends, Mary Kennedy, grabbed Shannon by the arm and
“told her that she should come with us”. Mary said that Farrant “told me to let
go of her arm and just leave the house”. Shannon was “crying and shaking and
sitting on one of the couches”. Shaun Russell, Shannon’s brother, testified in
part as follows:

Q. And just tell us where he went and
everything you remember about what was said.

A. He came into the living room and
crouched down beside Shannon.

Q. I think you’re going to have to speak up
louder.

A. Crouched down beside Shannon and said,
you come outside, I want to talk to you, something like that.

Q. Okay.

A. She said, no or something like that, I
can’t remember what she said. She said no.

Q. And something else?

A. Yeah, and something else.

Q. And then what did he say?

A. I’m going to make you, something like
that.

and later in his evidence:

Q. Okay, and do you recall any other
conversation when he came back in?

A. Mary said, Shannon would you come out
with me and he said, no stay and he also told Chuck to take his beer with him.

Mary Kennedy said:

He came into the house and he just stood at
the entrance of the living room and he turned to Shannon and said, you better
come with me, and she said, I’m not going with you anywhere. As he turned to us
and told us that we should go for coffee for half an hour and then he

[Page 132]

turned to Shannon and said something about
being serious and then he left. And then Darby and Chuck, they came back into
the house and we decided we should, you know, we should all go for coffee and
take Shannon with us and then Ronny [Farrant] came back into the house and he
had a gun with him and he was yelling, everybody get out of the house right
now, I just want to talk to Shannon. So everybody started leaving and… And as
we left I grabbed Shannon by the wrist and I told her that she should come with
us and Ronny told me to let go of her and just leave the house. So that’s what
I did.

Charles Thompson gave the following evidence:

Rolan returned with a gun. He asked us to
leave, told me to take my beer with me and one of the girls, I’m not sure which
one it was, tried to pick up Shannon and tell her, she said to Shannon, you’re
coming with us then Rolan pointed the gun in the direction of that person and
then we left through the front door.

Everyone left except Farrant and Shannon. There
is only the evidence of Farrant as to what happened next. He testified that
Shannon was crying and hysterical. He put this down to the presence of the
rifle, so he took it out to the kitchen and set it down. He returned to
Shannon, crouched beside her and attempted to pull her hands away from her face
so he could talk to her. She was still hysterical. He went to the kitchen and
brought the rifle back. He could not decide what to do. Then, suddenly, “the
gun just went off”. The shot proved fatal. In his statement to the police he
said simply that he “went back to the kitchen and got the rifle”, and “I shot
her”. He telephoned the operator and told her to call the police as he had just
killed his girl friend. A second shot was fired in an unsuccessful attempt by
Farrant to commit suicide.

II

Procedural History

Farrant was charged with first degree murder. At
the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry the Crown requested a committal for
trial on the lesser offence of second degree murder, and the accused was
committed for trial on that charge. A jury

[Page 133]

convicted him on second degree murder. Farrant
appealed his conviction and the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ordered a new
trial. The Crown, with leave of this Court, now appeals that decision.

III

The Section 213 Point

The appeal concerns the operation of s. 213
and, incidentally, s. 212 and 214 of the Criminal Code. Stripped of
non-essentials these three sections read as follows:

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

(a) where the person who causes the
death of a human being

(i) means to cause his death, or

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or
not.

213. Culpable
homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while
committing or attempting to commit… an offence mentioned in… 247 (kidnapping
and forcible confinement),… whether or not the person means to cause
death to any human being and whether or not he knows that death is likely
to be caused to any human being, if

…

(d) he uses a weapon
or has it upon his person

(i) during or at the time he commits or
attempts to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

214. (1)
Murder is first degree murder or second degree murder.

…

(5) Irrespective of whether a murder is
planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder
in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person

(a) while committing or
attempting to commit an offence under section… 247 (kidnapping and forcible
confinement)

…

(7) All murder that is not first degree
murder is second degree murder.

[Emphasis added.]

[Page 134]

Two other sections of the Code should
be mentioned. Section 247 provides in part:

(2) Every one who, without lawful
authority, confines, imprisons or forcibly seizes another person
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five
years.

[Emphasis added.]

Section 511 reads:

511. No
person shall be convicted for the offence of high treason or first degree
murder unless in the indictment charging the offence he is specifically charged
with that offence.

In adopting the words “means to” in s. 212(a)(i)
and s. 212(a)(ii) Parliament introduced the element of intent.
Culpable homicide is murder under this section if the Crown proves either
that the accused meant to cause death, or meant to cause bodily harm that he
knew was likely to cause death, and was reckless whether death ensued or not.

On the other hand, s. 213, the
“constructive murder” section, does not require proof of such an intent.
Section 213 makes this apparent by the use of the words “whether or not the
person means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that
death is likely to be caused to any human being”. If, for example, a person
uses a weapon, or has one upon his person, in the course of committing the
offence of forcible confinement under s. 247 of the Code, and if
death ensues as a consequence, then the culpable homicide is murder. The only
intent with which the court is concerned in these circumstances, is the intent
unlawfully to confine.

At the close of evidence at Farrant’s trial, the
Crown asked the judge to charge the jury with respect to s. 213 of the Code,
based on “the accused’s own evidence of wishing to use the gun or rifle to
clear the house out and keep the girl there so he could talk to her”.
Mr. Goldstein, counsel for Farrant, replied that he was aware of the
section, but was confident that the matter would not be raised, since “at no
time until this moment either at the preliminary inquiry, either at the opening
address of my learned friend and neither in the charge” was there any
indication that the accused was being charged with the com-

[Page 135]

mission of an offence under s. 213. He
contended that “as a matter of fairness”, apart from the law, it would be a
grave injustice to proceed in the direction sought by the Crown. Secondly, he
submitted that in this case there was no intent to confine against anyone’s
wish, and even if there were, it had been abandoned. In reply Crown counsel
said that she had not intended to make s. 213 a main part of her argument
until she heard the evidence of Farrant. She referred to the following passages
from his evidence:

Q. You decided that you were going to take
the rifle and you were going to go over there and you were going to make her
talk to you whether she wanted to stay or not, isn’t that true?

A. I wouldn’t quite say it that way, no.

Q. You wouldn’t quite say it that way?

A. No I wouldn’t.

Q. That’s essentially true, isn’t it?

A. It would be essentially, but it’s not
the way I would think, no.

Q. That’s not the way—you perhaps don’t
think the way I put my words together, but the meaning is the same isn’t it?

A. Deep down the hard cold meaning would be
the same, but the fact of what’s going on in my mind and somebody else’s mind
is two different things.

…

Q. And you wanted to talk to her?

A. Yeah, when I phoned her that was the
situation.

Q. You’ve already agreed that you were
going to make her talk to you, right?

A. After that phone call, yes.

Q. You were going to make her talk to you
using that rifle?

A. Well, if it was necessary I guess because
I brought it there, that would be true.

The court ruled that:

Taking into consideration the extracts from
the transcript of the cross-examination of the accused and the facts generally,
I have come to the conclusion that I must, as a matter of law, put that
section to the jury because I’m satisfied that a ruling as to the
applicability

[Page 136]

of the section is based on facts and
those facts are for the jury to decide.

The judge charged the jury that they must find
Farrant guilty of either second degree murder or manslaughter. There was no
other verdict open to them. After referring to sections 218(1), 205 and
212 of the Criminal Code the judge addressed the issue of constructive
murder:

In this particular case there is another
way the offence of murder may be committed at law. Common parlance we use for
it is “constructive murder”. And this is found in another section 213 and
again I will read you the pertinent section.

Having done so, he went on to say:

So the question you must determine first of
all is whether or not this accused was confining Shannon Russell. If you do so
find, I suggest to you that there has been no indication that he had any lawful
authority to so confine her so you don’t have to concern yourself about the
portion that says “without lawful authority”. The second requirement is that
there must be a death of a human being and I think you will find that this did
take place. But most important is the third requirement, and that is that the
death must be caused while he was either committing or attempting to commit the
offence of unlawful confinement. If you accept the evidence of the accused that
when he was in the home after the others had left that he took the weapon and
put it in the kitchen when Shannon Russell became hysterical and returned to
simply talk to her, you must ask yourself the question, was he forcibly
confining her or attempting to do so at the time he retrieved the weapon and
fired the fatal shot. Was there a confinement at that time or an attempt at
confinement, or had he abondoned (sic) any confinement or ideas of
confinement he originally had and simply wanted to talk to Shannon. And again,
unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was either
committing the act of forcible confinement or attempting to do so, you must
give the accused the benefit of that doubt and not find him liable under this
particular section. But on the other hand, if you are satisfied, you may find
that it was murder. And in that case you may find so whether or not he meant to
cause her death or meant to cause her bodily harm that he knew was likely to
cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not.

[Page 137]

The judge pointed out to the jury that the
defence rejected the theory of the Crown that the act of forcible confinement
was being committed or attempted when the fatal shot was fired:

If there was any forcible confinement at
most it was when the accused had the rifle in his hand and told Shannon she was
to stay. But thereafter the confinement was abandoned, counsel on behalf of the
defence says, and the rifle was taken and put in the kitchen and all the
accused wanted to do was talk. It was only when the talking failed that the
fatal shot was fired. Defence says that the theory of the Crown that this was
constructive murder simply does not apply to these facts. And if you accept the
evidence of the accused that he did take the rifle to the kitchen and only
returned for the purpose of talking to Shannon, I would agree with counsel for
the defence that you may find that the section does not apply, but it is
your decision on the facts as you have heard them. And once again I must warn
you, you must be satisfied that the accused was attempting or committing that
offence and satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt before you can apply Section
213.

The matter was addressed again later in the
charge:

I suggest you first consider whether the
Crown has established to your satisfaction the offence of murder under Section
213 that is commonly called constructive murder. Before you convict under this
section you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the death
actually took place during or at the time the offence of forcible confinement
was either being committed or attempted. If you conclude that there never was
an attempt to forcibly confine Shannon, that the use of the gun was only to
clear the others out of the house, or that any force to confine Shannon was
abondoned (sic) when he took the gun into the kitchen, or even
have a reasonable doubt that in the circumstances there was a forcible
confinement, you must not find the accused guilty under this section. If you
are so satisfied, however, that is the end of your task you are free to find
the accused guilty of second degree murder.

The trial judge instructed the jury at length on
s. 212 of the Code and on the intents necessary to found a
conviction under that section.

[Page 138]

The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that the
trial judge had erred in two respects:

(1) to instruct the jury as to their right to
bring in a verdict on a charge which was neither disclosed nor included in the
indictment, was to charge the jury upon a matter of which the appellant was
unaware at the time he pleaded;

(2) by failing to instruct the jury that if they
found the appellant guilty of murder pursuant to s. 214(5)(a), then
in law, the verdict must be one of guilty of first degree murder.

It should be mentioned at this point that the
trial judge in his charge at no time made any reference to a finding of guilty
of first degree murder pursuant to s. 214(5)(a) of the Criminal
Code. With respect, I cannot see why he should have entered into a
discussion of first degree murder when the accused did not face that charge.

In delivering judgment on behalf of the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, Culliton C.J.S. said:

When the trial opened, the appellant was on
trial for second degree murder. To establish that offence the onus was on the
Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had caused the
death of Shannon Russell and in so doing had one of the requisite intents as
set out in Section 212. It was admitted the appellant had caused the death of
Shannon Russell. Thus in determining whether or not he was guilty of second
degree murder the sole issue before the jury was did he, at the time, have one
of the intents as set out in Section 212, necessary to prove that offence.

With respect, the learned Chief Justice defines
the position too narrowly. To establish the offence of second degree murder the
onus was on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the uncontested fact
that Farrant had caused the death of Shannon Russell, and, either

(a) that he had one of the requisite intents set
out in s. 212, or

(b) that he had caused her death while
committing or attempting to commit one of the offences specified in
s. 213, in this case forcible confinement within s. 247, while

[Page 139]

using or having on his person a weapon and that
death ensued as a consequence.

With all due respect to the Saskatchewan Court
of Appeal, I find no error in the trial judge’s charge to the jury. The accused
Farrant was charged with second degree murder contrary to s. 218(1) of the
Criminal Code:

218. (1)
Every one who commits first degree murder or second degree murder is guilty of
an indictable offence and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.

Murder, like other offences in the Criminal
Code, such as theft, may be committed in one of several ways. Culpable
homicide may be murder under either s. 212 or s. 213. Both
sections begin with the words “Culpable homicide is murder where”. Farrant
was charged with murder. He might fall foul of either section. There was
evidence upon which the jury could find a forcible confinement, and the trial
judge was correct in stating that, as a matter of law, he was obliged to put both
s. 212 and 213 to the jury.

The main issue raised in this appeal is the
possibility of a conviction for second degree murder as charged, where, by
operation of statute, the evidence discloses that the accused would have been
guilty of first degree murder had this latter offence been charged. More
particularly, does an offence of second degree constructive murder pursuant to
forcible confinement exist having regard to s. 214(5)(a), which
provides:

214. …

(5) Irrespective of whether a murder is
planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder
in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person

(a) while committing or
attempting to commit an offence under section… 247 (kidnapping and forcible
confinement)…

The Crown contends that the Court of Appeal
erred: 1) in finding that the charge of second degree constructive murder
pursuant to a forcible

[Page 140]

confinement was not disclosed in the indictment;
and 2) in requiring that constructive murder pursuant to a forcible confinement
is necessarily first degree murder. The Crown’s argument is that s. 214 of
the Criminal Code is merely a classification section, and that the
definition of culpable homicide which is murder is found in ss. 212 and 213.
The Crown says that when charging an accused with murder there is no onus to
specify in the indictment whether it intends to rely upon s. 212 or
s. 213. In ordering a new trial on second degree murder the Saskatchewan
Court of Appeal restricted the proceedings to a consideration of s. 212,
murder with intent. The practical result of the Court of Appeal decision, the
Crown contends, is an interference with the discretion of the Crown in the
choice of charges it will lay.

The respondent Farrant argues that constructive
murder pursuant to a forcible confinement is first degree murder. Therefore an
instruction with respect to s. 213 must necessarily be an instruction with
respect to first degree murder, a charge which does not appear in the
indictment. The wording of s. 214(5)(a), according to the
respondent, is not permissive, but mandatory and conclusive. In order to
convict on constructive murder pursuant to forcible confinement, first degree
must be charged. First degree murder was not charged, and the accused says he
was prejudiced by having to answer to a first degree murder test under
s. 214(5)(a).

Section 214, however, is not the
section which sets out the elements of the offence of murder. This is done
in ss. 212 and 213. Section 214 does not create a distinct and independent
substantive offence of first degree constructive murder pursuant to forcible
confinement. The section is subservient to ss. 212 and 213; it classifies
for sentencing purposes, the offences in s. 212 and s. 213 as either
first or second degree murder. The importance of the distinction between first
and second degree murder is that first degree murder carries with it a
mandatory life sentence without eligibility for

[Page 141]

parole for twenty-five years (s. 218,
s. 669(a)). A conviction for second degree murder also carries with
it a mandatory life sentence, but parole may be granted after ten years of
imprisonment unless the jury recommends a greater number of years.

With respect, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
erred in stating that:

The great distinction between murder under
Section 214(5)(a) and second degree murder under Section 212, is that to obtain
a conviction under the former it is not necessary to establish either of the
intents required for the conviction of second degree murder under Section 212.

There is no distinction between s. 214(5)(a)
and s. 212 based upon intent. The presence or absence of intent is the
distinction between s. 212 and s. 213, not s. 214. Intent is an
element of the offence of murder under s. 212, be it first or second degree.
The distinction between first and second degree murder in s. 214 is not
based upon intent; it is based upon 1) the presence of planning and
deliberation (s. 214(2)); 2) the identity of the victim (s. 214(4)); or 3) the
nature of the offence being committed at the time of the murder (s. 214(5)).
The primary and essential determination for a jury to make is whether murder
has been committed, either under s. 212 or, where the evidence warrants
it, under s. 213. Considerations of the distinctions between first and
second degree murder are irrelevant in making this preliminary determination.
Once the offence has been found, it is then classified.

To argue that s. 214 is controlling in a
situation such as the present one is to confuse the sections which set out
the elements of the offence of murder with the classification process provided
in s. 214. The classification in s. 214 functions within

[Page 142]

the context of sentencing and is not
determinative of the substantive offence of murder.

Counsel for the respondent laid much emphasis on
the imperative language of the English version of s. 214(5). The French
version is much less so. The relevant portion reads:

(5) Est assimilé au meurtre au premier degré,
le meurtre…

In my view a conviction for second degree murder
can be maintained when that offence has been charged even though the accused
person by operation of statute would have been guilty of first degree murder if
he had been charged with that greater offence. Recent years have seen a certain
relaxation in the formalism attendant upon criminal proceedings. An indictment,
such as this one, charging second degree murder need not specify the exact
section or sections of the Criminal Code which constitute an
offence. It is sufficient that it state the legal character of the offence (see
R. v. McKenzie, [1972] S.C.R. 409).

There was, in my opinion, no error in the trial
judge’s charge to the jury. The verdict returned by the jury was equally
consistent with a finding of intent under s. 212 as it was with a finding
of constructive murder under s. 213.

IV

Fairness at Trial

Although I am of the view that the law and the
facts warranted, and indeed required, a charge upon s. 213 of the Code,
there remains the question of whether, once the Crown had decided to reduce
the charge to second degree murder, Farrant was entitled to assume that he
could not be tried for “murder by forcible confinement with a gun”, because
s. 214 makes that offence first degree murder. Although not expressed in
these terms, implicit in Farrant’s objection is the suggestion that at trial
the case for the defence was conducted on the basis of that assumption; that
Crown witnesses were cross-examined, and his own

[Page 143]

testimony given, on the basis that evidence of
intent to forcibly confine Shannon Russell was irrelevant. Farrant complains
that by instructing the jury that they might convict him of murder under
s. 213, the trial judge erred by exposing him to conviction for a crime
that had not been charged against him.

I do not think this complaint can be maintained.
Counsel was aware of s. 213 of the Code, and, with a client facing
a murder charge, he knew or ought to have known, that the Crown could rely upon
this section if the evidence afforded a factual base for forcible
confinement.

In her opening address Crown counsel recounted
events leading up to the shooting from which one could take it that forcible
confinement might be part of the Crown’s case. Take, for example, this passage:

All the young people including Shannon made
preparations to leave. Within a minute or two Ronny Farrant came back into the
house carrying a rifle. He told everyone to get out and leave Shannon. Mary
Kennedy tried to pull Shannon by the arm and Ronny told her to let go and get
out of the house. As the group left Shannon was sitting on a chair crying alone
with the accused.

When all of the evidence was adduced, including
that of the accused on cross-examination, one could say that the necessary
factual underpinning was present.

It was open to the defence at any time before or
during trial to ask for particulars with a view to determining whether forcible
confinement was in issue. Failing a negative response to such request counsel
could anticipate that s. 213 might arise.

Furthermore, when Crown counsel moved the court
to charge on s. 213 it was open to the defence to ask for the recall of
witnesses, or the calling of additional witnesses, to refute the allegation of
forcible confinement. Counsel in argument before the trial judge and before
this Court, failed to indicate in what way he would have conducted

[Page 144]

the case differently had he known that
s. 213 of the Code was to be invoked. He did not say “I would have
done this or I would not have done that, had I known”. All that can be said is
that he did not expect the Crown to rely on s. 213. Neither did the trial
judge, as his comments disclose. Nonetheless, on the facts, and the law,
s. 213 was applicable.

There is in my view no merit in the argument
that the accused was prejudiced in having to answer to a first degree murder
test under s. 214(5)(a). He was not charged with first degree murder; he
could not have been convicted of first degree murder (s. 511 of the Criminal
Code); he was never in jeopardy of such a conviction. It is difficult to
understand how an accused could be prejudiced by a conviction on a lesser
charge where the evidence supports a greater one. The accused, from the
beginning, is at less risk.

V

Supplementary Issues

Several additional issues were raised in the
Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan with which that Court did not deal because of
its decision on the main point.

First, that the judge erred in law in charging
the jury of “…the presumption that (a) man intends the natural consequences of
his actions”; and that the jury must bear “…in mind that one basic inference is
that everyone is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his or her
actions”. The judge made it abundantly clear however that this was a
proposition of common sense and not one of law. He said:

You may proceed on the common sense
proposition that most adult people usually intend the natural consequences of
their acts, but you must consider the state of mind of this accused at the
material time and decide whether he, and he alone, intended or was reckless of
the natural consequences of his acts.

[Page 145]

Earlier in the judgment he had said:

It is an inference that you may draw. And
if on all the facts of the case it is in your opinion not a correct inference
that the accused intended those natural consequences of his act, then it should
not be drawn.

I do not find error.

Second, that the judge, having ruled against
permitting the prosecutor to adduce “similar fact” evidence, erred in
permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine the accused about alleged incidents
of assault which purportedly occurred many months prior to the date of the
offence charged. During examination in chief Farrant testified:

Well, think about it now there’s no way I
would, you know, it’s not my character to be violent, you know, use violence or
a rifle, you know, to get my own way. That’s not my character.

The judge allowed the Crown to cross-examine in
respect of alleged incidents of earlier assault. I do not think he erred in so
doing, having regard to the fact that Farrant had put his non-violent character
in issue in earlier testimony.

Third, the judge erred in law in ruling the
statement taken from the accused by the police to be a voluntary one and
admissible in evidence, in light of the surrounding circumstances and the
existing law. I have read the evidence carefully and I find nothing to support
the contention that the trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, erred
in law in admitting the statement.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan and restore the verdict at trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal
law—Evidence—Admissibility—Interception of private communications—New offence
suspected during course of investigation—New offence not specified in renewed
authorization—Whether communications intercepted after renewal and relating to
new offence admissible—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (as amended by
1973-74 (Can.), c. 50, s. 2; 1976-77 (Can.), c. 53, ss. 7 to 12), ss.
178.1, 178.2, 178.11, 178.12, 178.13, 178.16, 178.22.

Appellant was convicted of conspiring to
possess counterfeit money. At trial, the evidence relating to the offence was
adduced through lawful interceptions of private communications made pursuant to
a renewed authorization that related only to narcotics offences. Prior to the
renewal, the police had suspected that the appellant was conspiring to possess
counterfeit money but did not apply for an authorization to intercept
communications with respect to that offence. The majority of the Court of
Appeal held the evidence inadmissible and quashed the conviction. This appeal
is to determine whether an authorization to intercept private communications in
respect of one offence is sufficient to render lawful interceptions in respect
of a different offence, in circumstances where the interceptions in respect of
the different offence were anticipated at the time the authorization was
obtained.

Held (Ritchie,
Dickson, Chouinard and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.: When an authorization to
intercept private communications is lawfully obtained—i.e. pursuant to
and in compliance with s. 178.13 of the Criminal Code—any
intercepted conversation which discloses evidence relating to offences not
specified in the authorization is admissible in support of charges relating to
those offences. The interception need not be “unanticipated”.

[Page 122]

The distinction between “anticipated” and
“unanticipated” interception is nowhere to be found in s. 178.16(3.1) of
the Code.

(2d) 65, allowing appellant’s appeal from his conviction for conspiracy to
possess counterfeit money. Appeal allowed, Ritchie, Dickson, Chouinard and
Wilson JJ. dissenting.

J.D. Taylor, for the appellant.

Marc Rosenberg, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

LAMER J.—The accused was tried and convicted by
a jury in Vancouver of
conspiring to possess counterfeit money. He appealed his conviction to the
British Columbia Court of Appeal and an acquittal was entered. Craig J.A.,
dissenting on a question of law, would have upheld the conviction. The Crown is
now appealing to this Court as of right pursuant to s. 621(1)(a) of
the Criminal Code of Canada.

THE FACTS

The facts need not, for the purpose of this
appeal, be set out fully. The evidence adduced against the accused was
essentially that of telephone conversations intercepted by the police through
the use of “wiretapping equipment”. It is agreed by all that if this evidence
is, as was found by the Court of Appeal, inadmissible, then the Crown’s appeal
should fail and the acquittal stand; if to the contrary then the jury’s
conviction should be restored.

[Page 123]

The police had started out investigating
narcotics offences and, on May 14, 1976, were authorized under s. 178.13 of the Criminal Code to
intercept the private communications of persons other than the accused. As a
result of interceptions, the police became suspicious that the brother of the
accused and others were involved in a conspiracy with respect to counterfeit
money. On July 9, 1976, the “narcotic authorization” was renewed. Prior to this
renewal, the police had consulted Crown counsel with the object of applying for
an authorization under s. 178.12 to intercept communications with respect
to the counterfeiting offence. They were advised by the Crown that this was not
necessary. The evidence relating to the conspiracy to possess counterfeit
money, the admissibility of which is at issue in this case, was adduced through
interceptions that were made pursuant to the renewed authorization for the
investigation of the narcotic conspiracy.

Of importance in this appeal is the fact that it
was admitted by all that the authorizations and renewals were properly
obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code and that
no witnesses need be called to prove their validity. It is further admitted
that on or about July 4, 1976, the investigators suspected that co-conspirators
named Gallo and Magisano were conspiring with Remo Commisso with respect to
counterfeit money, and suspected that Gallo and Magisano were using the code
word “ceramics” for counterfeit money, but did not believe they had grounds for
applying for an authorization until July 9, 1976, the date of the renewal.
Finally, respondent admits that the police officers were continuing a bona
fide investigation on the suspected heroin offence at the time they heard
the conversations they adduced in evidence in the counterfeit charge.

THE LAW

Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code is titled
“Invasion of Privacy”. This chapter was introduced in 1974. However uncertain
the state of the law prior

[Page 124]

to that enactment, Parliament for the protection
of the citizens’ privacy then made it a crime to wilfully intercept a private
communication by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanic or other
device. Recognizing however the need to assist the police in the detection of
crime, Parliament has under certain circumstances and under judicial control
set out procedures under which interceptions may be lawful. The police, when
investigating certain offences, may be authorized by a judge to invade the
privacy of certain citizens, if the conditions set out in s. 178.13 are
met. (I am referring to the law as it was at the time of the interception.)

178.13 (1)
An authorization may be given if the judge to whom the application is made is
satisfied that it would in the best interests of the administration of justice
to do so and that

(a) other investigative
procedures have been tried and have failed;

(b) other investigative
procedures are unlikely to succeed; or

(c) the urgency of the matter is
such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence
using only other investigative procedures.

(2) An authorization shall

(a) state the offence in respect of
which private communications may be intercepted;

(b) state the type of private
communication that may be intercepted;

(c) state the identity of the
persons, if known, whose private communications are to be intercepted and where
the identity of such persons is not known, generally describe the place at
which private communications may be intercepted or, if a general description of
that place cannot be given, generally describe the manner of interception that
may be used;

(d) contain such terms and
conditions as the judge considers advisable in the public interests; and

(e) be valid for the period,
not exceeding thirty days, set forth therein.

(2.1) The Solicitor General of Canada or
the Attorney General, as the case may be, may designate a person or persons who
may intercept private communications under authorizations.

(3) Renewals of an authorization may be
given from time to time by a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction
or a judge as defined in section 482 upon

[Page 125]

receipt by him of an ex parte application
in writing signed by the Attorney General of the province in which the
application is made or the Solicitor General of Canada or an agent specially
designated in writing for the purposes of section 178.12 by the Solicitor
General of Canada or the Attorney General, as the case may be, accompanied by
an affidavit of a peace officer or public officer deposing to the following
matters, namely:

(a) the reason and period for
which the renewal is required, and

(b) full particulars,
together with times and dates, when interceptions, if any, were made or
attempted under the authorization, and any information that has been obtained
by any interception,

and supported by such other information as
the judge may require.

(4) A renewal of an authorization may be
given if the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied that any of the
circumstances described in subsection (1) still obtain, but no such
renewal shall be for a period exceeding thirty days.

In order to discourage unlawful invasions of the
privacy of citizens, Parliament not only made it an indictable offence but also
enacted an exclusionary rule which is an exception to the general rule that
unlawfully obtained evidence is nevertheless admissible:

178.16 (1) A
private communication that has been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence
against the originator of the communication or the person intended by the
originator to receive it unless

(a) the interception was
lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or
the person intended by the originator to receive it has expressly consented to
the admission thereof;

but evidence obtained directly or
indirectly as a result of information acquired by interception of a private
communication is not inadmissible by reason only that the private communication
is itself inadmissible as evidence.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1),
the judge or magistrate presiding at any proceedings may refuse to admit
evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of information acquired by
interception of a private communication that is itself inadmissible as evidence
where he is of the opinion that the admission thereof would bring the
administration of justice into disrepute.

(3) Where the judge or magistrate presiding
at any proceedings is of the opinion that a private communica-

[Page 126]

tion that, by virtue of
subsection (1), is inadmissible as evidence in the proceedings

(a) is relevant to a matter
at issue in the proceedings, and

(b) is inadmissible as
evidence therein by reason only of a defect of form or an irregularity in procedure,
not being a substantive defect or irregularity, in the application for or the
giving of the authorization under which such private communication was
intercepted,

he may, notwithstanding
subsection (1), admit such private communication as evidence in the
proceedings.

(3.1) A private communication that has been
intercepted and that is admissible as evidence may be admitted in any criminal
proceeding or in any civil proceeding or other matter whatever respecting which
the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction, whether or not the criminal
proceeding or the civil proceeding or other matter relates to the offence
specified in the authorization pursuant to which the communication was
intercepted.

(4) A private communication that has been
lawfully intercepted shall not be received in evidence unless the party
intending to adduce it has given to the accused reasonable notice of his
intention together with

(a) a transcript of the private
communication, where it will be adduced in the form of a recording, or a statement
setting forth full particulars of the private communication, where evidence of
the private communication will be given viva voce; and

(b) a statement respecting
the time, place and date of the private communication and the parties thereto,
if known.

(5) Any information obtained by an
interception that, but for the interception would have been privileged, remains
privileged and inadmissible as evidence without the consent of the person
enjoying the privilege.

It is agreed by all that, though the enactment
of s. 178.16(3.1) was subsequent to the interception, the section is
applicable in the determination of this appeal.

As appears from a reading of the section, a
private communication is admissible as evidence if the interception was
lawfully made, and it is lawfully made if pursuant and in compliance with an
authorization under s. 178.13.

[Page 127]

Accused takes the position that a private
communication is inadmissible “on the trial of one offence when it is obtained
after renewal of an authorization for a different offence at a time when there
were grounds to obtain an authorization for the offence with which the accused
is being tried”. Accused in taking this position reads s. 178.16(3.1) as
rendering admissible only “windfall” evidence and argues that it was not
intended “to render admissible private communications relating to an offence
which was not unexpected”.

McKay J. at trial disagreeing said:

It seems to me that in light of the
concession that the investigation into the heroin conspiracy continued on after
June 30th, 1976, and in light of the fact that the disputed evidence in this
case was discovered while valid renewals relating to the heroin conspiracy were
in existence, that the reasoning in Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6) applies,
and that the evidence is admissible, and I so hold.

R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6) reported at (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 is a decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal. Zuber J.A. writing for the Court (Jessup, Arnup, Martin and
Wilson JJ.A.), when dealing with the issue relevant to this case,
concluded in the following terms, at pp. 373-74:

In my opinion, an interception complies
with both the Code and the authorization if it is made in respect to a
stated offence, i.e., for the purpose or object of investigating or
gathering evidence with respect to the named offence. The fact that the pursuit
of the objective of the authorization reveals evidence of other crimes does not
affect the lawful character of the interception. It cannot be said that the
evidence in this case is rendered inadmissible on this ground.

Prior to his conclusion, where no mention of a
distinction between “windfall” and “anticipated” evidence is made, he had
reviewed Canadian case law and then referred to an American case, United

[Page 128]

States v. Cox, 449
F.2d 679 (10th. Cir., 1971), and quoted Doyle Cir. J., at pp. 686-87:

Once the listening commences it becomes
impossible to turn it off when a subject other than one which is authorized is
overheard. It would be the height of unreasonableness to distinguish between
information specifically authorized and that which is unanticipated and which
develops in the course of an authorized search such as that involved here.
It would be irrational to hold that officers authorized to listen to
conversations about drug traffic, upon learning that a bank robbery is to
occur, must at once close down the project and not use the information to
prevent the robbery since the information is tainted. It would be demoralizing
to allow the bank to be robbed while the investigators stood by helpless to
prevent the occurrence. Harder cases can be imagined. For example, in
electronic surveillance of organized criminals involved in gambling,
information might be intercepted disclosing a conspiracy to commit murder.
Surely the officials must be empowered to use this information notwithstanding
the lack of specific prior authorization.

(Emphasis added.)

Zuber J.A. then added:

The force of these words is not diminished
by the procedural and constitutional differences which interlace this case.

The fact that s. 178.16(3.1) was
subsequently enacted and that no such distinction as that suggested by Circuit
Judge Doyle is to be found in the section should not be overlooked.

In the second line of subs. (3.1) it is stated
that an intercepted communication that is “admissible as evidence may be
admitted … whether or not the criminal proceeding … relates” to an offence
different than the one mentioned in the authorization. If the word “admissible”
is construed as meaning “admissible under the preceding subsections of
178”, then the section means nothing because Iannuzzi has already
interpreted unanticipated evidence revealing new offences as being included in
s. 178 prior to subs. (3.1). Consequently, the inclusion of subs. (3.1) of
the expression

[Page 129]

“may be admitted” necessarily adds something to
s. 178. If it adds the concept that the unanticipated statement (unlike Iannuzzi)
is related to suspected offences under investigation when the authorization is
taken out, then the effect of subs. (3.1) may be to make unnecessary any
compliance with s. 178 with reference to this second offence.

In the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
Lambert J.A., reading R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy (1977), 39 C.R.N.S. 135, R.
v. Miller and Thomas (No. 4) (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 128, and also R. v.
Welsh and Iannuzzi as adopting a distinction between “anticipated” and
“unanticipated” evidence said:

In short, it is my opinion that the rule
which permits the introduction of evidence with respect to an offence not
specified in the authorization, but which turns up unexpectedly in the course
of the interception, does not extend to evidence with respect to an offence
that is being investigated at the time of the authorization or at the time of a
renewal and that is intercepted after that authorization or that renewal. To
decide otherwise would permit a single authorization to spread to offences and
persons never contemplated by the authorizing judge who is charged with the
responsibility for applying the rigorous tests established by the Protection of
Privacy sections of the Criminal Code.

Craig J.A., reading R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy differently
took the following position:

I think that once a Court has authorized an
interception any intercepted conversation which discloses any criminal offence
is admissible in evidence in support of a charge relating to that offence even
though the authorization did not specifically authorize an interception for the
offence which has been incidentally disclosed in the interception.

I agree with Craig J.A., and I am of the view
that this appeal should succeed. The distinction that we are invited to make is
not found in the wording of s. 178.16(3.1) which is unambiguous.

[Page 130]

This is all the more significant as that
section was enacted after R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy and R. v.
Welsh and Iannuzzi. There are however other equally compelling reasons to
support Craig J.A.’s view.

The exclusionary rule’s purpose is to discourage
unlawful invasions of privacy. If the privacy is being invaded through a lawful
interception the exclusionary rule has lost its purpose. It is not the subject
matter of conversations that is sought to be protected, but the privacy of
those conversing. This is assuming, as is not contested in this case, that the initial
authorization had been lawfully obtained in good faith, that the investigation
on heroin, as was conceded, was still going on, and that the renewal for that
offence had been lawfully obtained. That admission by the respondent as regards
the renewal is of capital importance. Indeed for the renewal to be lawful the
judge must be given at the time of the renewal under s. 178.13(3) an
affidavit setting out, amongst other information,

…

(b) full particulars,
together with times and dates, when interceptions, if any, were made or
attempted under the authorization, and any information that has been
obtained by any interception,

(Emphasis added.)

The material before us does not reveal whether
the judge was told by the police that they had grounds to ask for a separate
authorization for a counterfeiting offence. But given the admission by
respondent, this case must be decided on the assumption that the judge was
informed through the affidavit of what was heard as regards that offence. It
might well be, though this need not, should not and is not decided on this
appeal, that if the police, on a renewal, were not to reveal such information
in this affidavit, the renewal might have been obtained irregularly, the
subsequent interceptions unlawful and any evidence obtained through such
interceptions may be inadmissible, be it evidence of the offence stated in the
authorization, or a fortiori, of any other offences, subject of course
to the discretion given judges under the

[Page 131]

section to admit unlawfully obtained
evidence.

To decide otherwise and to follow Lambert J.A.’s
reasoning would in my view create great difficulties. As one of many possible
illustrations, the following: The R.C.M.P. is lawfully intercepting on a heroin
investigation and unexpectedly overhears evidence of a murder.
Simultaneously the Municipal Police Force is investigating counterfeiting and
that very same murder but have been denied an authorization to intercept for
the murder but authorized for the counterfeiting. They also overhear evidence
of that murder. Under one authorization it is admissible but not under the
other?

Furthermore, what about the offences for which
an authorization to intercept can never be obtained because they are not listed
under s. 178.1. Were we to follow Lambert J.A.’s position, if evidence of
such an offence in the course of a lawful interception is revealed unexpectedly
it is admissible, as s. 178.16(3.1) does not distinguish between those
offences and those for which an authorization may be obtained. But if it is
expected, that evidence would be privileged even though the police officers
could not under the law obtain an authorization. Logic would then command that
s. 178.16(3.1) be limited only to proof of other offences listed at
s. 178.1 as open to interception. That position was adopted in R. v.
Patterson, Valois and Guindon (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 352. That in my view
would be reading a great deal into s. 178.16(3.1). To exclude evidence
pertaining to “unlisted” offences would in no way further the purpose of the
Act which is to protect the citizen from invasion of his privacy. That is being
achieved by s. 178.1 through denying the invasion where the sole purpose
is investigating one of those “unlisted” offences.

[Page 132]

I would therefore allow the appeal, quash the
acquittal entered by the Court of Appeal and restore the conviction.

The reasons of Ritchie, Dickson, Chouinard and
Wilson JJ. were delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The issue is
whether an authorization to intercept private communications in respect of one
offence is sufficient to render lawful interceptions in respect of a different
offence, in circumstances where the interceptions in respect of the different
offence were anticipated at the time the authorization was obtained.

I The Facts

An authorization in respect of narcotics
offences was renewed for a second time on July 9, 1976. It is conceded that, in
so far as the narcotics offences are concerned, the authorization and renewals
were properly obtained, and that the investigation into the narcotics offences
continued after July 9, 1976. The accused Cosimo Commisso was not named in the
narcotics authorization nor in the renewals, nor was he suspected by the police
of being involved in the narcotics offences.

Prior to obtaining the second renewal, the
police became suspicious of a separate counterfeiting operation involving some
of the same people. By the date of the second renewal, the police thought they
had enough information to obtain an authorization in respect of the
counterfeiting offence. They did not make an application, however, because they
were advised by Crown counsel that this was not necessary. Cosimo Commisso was
not then suspected by the police of being involved in the counterfeiting
offence. The authorization and the renewals with respect to the narcotics
offences contained “basket clauses” which brought unknown persons within their
scope. The interceptions introduced in evidence against Cosimo Commisso were
all made subsequent to July 9, 1976.

[Page 133]

II The Exclusionary Rule

Cosimo Commisso’s conviction for conspiracy to
possess counterfeit money can only be supported if the wiretap evidence was
properly admitted. The majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
directed an acquittal be entered on the basis that the trial judge had erred in
admitting the evidence. The admissibility question depends on whether the
interceptions were lawfully made, that is to say, pursuant to the July 9, 1976
renewal.

In R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272, the
majority of this Court decided illegally obtained evidence was admissible
unless highly prejudicial and of trifling weight. The Crown relies in part on
this and similar cases. With respect, in my view these authorities are of no
assistance here. We are not here dealing with common law but with a highly
structured statutory scheme. Parliament has clearly changed the common law rule
where interceptions of private communications are involved. Illegally obtained
evidence of private communications is generally inadmissible. The current
s. 178.16(1) reads in part as follows:

178.16 (1) A
private communication that has been intercepted is inadmissible as evidence
against the originator of the communication or the person intended by the
originator to receive it unless

(a) the interception was
lawfully made; or

(b) the originator thereof or
the person intended by the originator to receive it has expressly consented to
the admission thereof;

…

The only exceptions are consent and the
discretion under present s. 178.16(3) (former s. 178.16(2)) to admit
despite non-substantive defects or irregularities. Neither exception could
apply in this case. The only question is whether the interceptions

[Page 134]

sought to be introduced against Commisso were
lawfully made.

The unique legislative treatment of electronic
surveillance is a reflection of its nature. The modern technology is both
powerful and unobtrusive. The technology permits massive invasion of the
privacy with ease. It is also indiscriminate about the content of any
communication intercepted. Parliament has determined that this potential
constitutes a threat to individual freedom and the right to privacy. The
evidentiary rule of exclusion fortifies the stipulation that interceptions of
private communications are illegal unless specified conditions are met.

III The Balancing of Interests

Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code, on
Invasion of Privacy, balances two competing interests. Zuber J.A. of the
Ontario Court of Appeal expressed this aptly in R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi
(No. 6) (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 363 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 369:

…Parliament had two objectives. The first
was to protect private communications by prohibiting interception and to render
inadmissible evidence obtained in violation of the statute. The second
objective, which balances the first, was to recognize the need to allow the
appropriate authorities, subject to specific controls, to intercept private
communications in the investigation of serious crime, and to adduce the
evidence thus obtained.

This legislation must be viewed and
interpreted with a full, fair and realistic appreciation of both these
objectives. The right to private communication cannot be diluted simply because
unlawful interceptions are made by honest men whose motives are simply to
detect crime. On the other hand, this legislation is not a legal briar patch
calculated to frustrate the legitimate aims of the prosecution.

The privacy interest is not served only by the
fact that s. 178.11 generally prohibits the interception of private
communications. In addition, s. 178.2 creates a separate offence of
disclosing a private communication. A person’s privacy is invaded when a
private communication is intercepted. A person’s privacy is invaded still
further if

[Page 135]

that intercepted private communication is
subsequently revealed to others. It is not appropriate to say that once a
private communication has been intercepted, whatever interest there was in
privacy has been lost. The privacy interest has a dual aspect. The question is:
when is that privacy interest lawfully superseded?

Part IV.1 makes it clear that the privacy
interest can be superseded in the interests of crime detection. Electronic
surveillance is a useful and legitimate tool of police investigation of serious
crime, but not in all circumstances. Electronic surveillance is an
investigative procedure of last resort. This is especially apparent in the
wording of s. 178.12(1)(g)ands. 178.13(1):

178.12 (1)
An application for an authorization shall be made ex parte and in
writing…

and shall be accompanied by an affidavit,
which may be sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer or public
officer deposing to the following matters, namely:

…

(g) whether other
investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or why it appears they
are unlikely to succeed or that the urgency of the matter is such that it would
be impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only other
investigative procedures.

178.13 (1)
An authorization may be given if the judge to whom the application is made is
satisfied

(a) that it would be in the best
interests of the administration of justice to do so; and

(b) that other investigative
procedures have been tried and have failed, other investigative procedures are
unlikely to succeed or the urgency of the matter is such that it would be
impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only other
investigative procedures.

Whether electronic surveillance is proper in a
given case is stipulated to be a matter for judicial determination and not a
matter for the police to decide.

[Page 136]

IV Section 178.16(3.1)

Subsequent to the interceptions in this case,
Parliament enacted s. 178.16(3.1). Despite the timing, counsel for
Commisso agrees the subsection could apply:

178.16. …

…

(3.1) A private communication that has been
intercepted and that is admissible as evidence may be admitted in any
criminal proceeding or in any civil proceeding or other matter whatever
respecting which the Parliament of Canada has jurisdiction, whether or not
the criminal proceeding or the civil proceeding or other matter relates to
the offence specified in the authorization pursuant to which the
communication was intercepted.

(Emphasis added.)

The Crown contends that subs. (3.1) makes the
evidence in this case admissible. I cannot agree. Subsection (3.1) imposes
a threshold requirement that the intercepted communication be admissible as
evidence. This relates back to s. 178.16(1) which provides that the
evidence is inadmissible unless the interception was lawfully made. Section 178.16(3.1)
simply restates the question: was the interception lawfully made. It does not
provide the answer.

It is true s. 178.16(3.1) does contemplate
evidence that will on occasion be admissible although it does not relate to the
offence specified in the authorization. The same can be said of
s. 178.22(2)(d) and (e), which have been in force since the
introduction of Part IV.1:

178.22 (1)
The Solicitor General of Canada shall, as soon as possible after the end of
each year, prepare a report…

…

(2) The report referred to in
subsection (1) shall, in relation to authorizations and interceptions made
thereunder, set forth

…

(d) the number of persons
identified in an authorization against whom proceedings were commenced at the
instance of the Attorney General of Canada in respect of

(i) an offence specified in the
authorization,

[Page 137]

(ii) an offence other than an offence
specified in the authorization but in respect of which an authorization may be
given, and

(iii) an offence in respect of which an
authorization may not be given;

(e) the number of persons not
identified in an authorization against whom proceedings were commenced at the
instance of the Attorney General of Canada in respect of

(i) an offence specified in such an
authorization,

(ii) an offence other than an offence
specified in such an authorization but in respect of which an authorization may
be given, and

(iii) an offence other than an offence
specified in such an authorization and for which no such authorization may be
given,

and whose commission or alleged commission
of the offence became known to a peace officer as a result of an interception
of a private communication under an authorization;

Neither s. 178.16(3.1) nor
s. 178.22(2) gives any help in defining or identifying of the occasions on
which an interception in relation to a non-specified offence will be regarded
as pursuant to the authorization.

Section 178.16(3.1) was enacted subsequent to R.
v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6), supra; R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy (1977),
36 C.C.C. (2d) 257 (B.C.C.A.); and R. v. Miller and Thomas (No. 4) (1975),
28 C.C.C. (2d) 128 (B.C. Co. Ct.), all of which held that an unanticipated interception
in relation to an offence not specified in the authorization was nonetheless
lawfully made. If it be assumed that s. 178.16(3.1) was enacted in
confirmation of these cases, the section nonetheless says nothing about
the situation that was not addressed in these cases—anticipated
interceptions.

V The Requirement to Specify the Offence

Counsel for the Crown makes the following submission:

It is respectfully submitted that the whole
premise of the legislation permitting interception of private communications
and their subsequent admission into evi-

[Page 138]

dence is that it is the conversation of persons
sought to be protected, not the subject matter of the conversations that
is sought to be protected.

(Emphasis added.)

My reading of the statute is to the contrary.
The subject matter of the communication is indeed a critical factor. Section
178.2, which generally prohibits disclosure of a private communication,
contains no provision that once interception of certain persons is authorized,
everything may be disclosed. More importantly, the provisions regarding the
application for and the giving of an authorization are throughout linked to a
specified offence. This applies equally to the wording at the time the
interceptions were made as to the current wording.

(Emphasis added.)

[Page 140]

On the appellant’s argument, once an
authorization is validly obtained in respect of one offence, it is sufficient
to cover interceptions in respect of any other offence. This would render the
language directed toward the specified offence essentially meaningless. That
cannot, in my view, be the proper construction of the statute.

It is clear there is a particular reason for
linking an authorization to a specified offence or offences. Electronic
surveillance has been deemed by the statute to be an investigative procedure of
use only when other investigative procedures have been tried and failed, or are
unlikely to succeed, or are impractical because of the urgency of the matter
(s. 178.13(1)(b)). Whether electronic surveillance is in fact justified
can only be determined in relation to a specific offence. The result of the
Crown’s argument would be that electronic surveillance could and would be used
in respect of an unspecified offence even where other investigative procedures
could still prove fruitful. That is not consistent with s.178.13(1).

VI The Anticipated/Unanticipated Distinction

The majority of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal based their decision on a distinction between two different
circumstances in which an interception could be made in respect of an offence
not specified in an authorization. They concluded that while an unanticipated
interception respecting another offence was made pursuant to authorization, an anticipated
interception respecting another offence was not, and hence was inadmissible. It
was on this ground that Lambert J.A. distinguished R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi
(No. 6), supra, R. v. Rouse and Mclnroy, supra, R. v. Miller and Thomas (No.
4), supra.

In R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6), Zuber
J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal made the following comment, at p. 373:

[Page 141]

American Courts have had a longer
experience in this area of law. The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets
Act of 1968, Title III, 18 U.S.C. §2510 et seq., 82 Stat. 211, is
generally similar to Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code. The question of
interception of communications which disclose evidence related to offences
other than the one named in the authorization has attracted comment in American
cases. In United States v. Cox (1971), 449 F.2d 679, Doyle C.J.,
speaking for the United States Court of Appeals, 10th Circuit, said at pp. 686-7:

Once the listening commences it becomes
impossible to turn it off when a subject other than one which is authorized is
overheard. It would be the height of unreasonableness to distinguish between
information specifically authorized and that which is unanticipated and
which develops in the course of an authorized search such as that involved
here. It would be irrational to hold that officers authorized to listen to
conversations about drug traffic, upon learning that a bank robbery is to
occur, must at once close down the project and not use the information to
prevent the robbery since the information is tainted. It would be demoralizing
to allow the bank to be robbed while the investigators stood by helpless to
prevent the occurrence. Harder cases can be imagined. For example, in
electronic surveillance of organized criminals involved in gambling,
information might be intercepted disclosing a conspiracy to commit murder.
Surely the officials must be empowered to use this information notwithstanding
the lack of specific prior authorization.

The force of these words is not diminished
by the procedural and constitutional differences which interlace this case.

(Emphasis added.)

Elsewhere in United States v. Cox, the
10th Circuit United States Court of Appeals reiterated that it was directing
its attention to the question of unanticipated interceptions, at p. 687:

…we do not [uphold the statute] upon the
basis that the nature and probable consequence of authorized wiretapping is
discovery of unanticipated and undescribed communications. The very nature of
this form of invasion is conducive to producing unexpected information.

[Page 142]

American cases distinguish between anticipated
and unanticipated interceptions primarily on the basis of good faith; United
States v. Marion, 535 F.2d 697 (2nd Cir., 1976); United States v.
Brodson, 528 F.2d 214 (7th Cir., 1975); United States v. Aloi, 449
F. Supp. 698 (E.D.N.Y., 1977); United States v. Pine, 473 F. Supp. 349
(D. Md., 1978). The Crown concedes that if the authorization for the specified
offence were obtained in bad faith, the authorization would be invalid and not
cover unspecified offences. However, the Crown sets the good faith test too
low. The Crown submits that an authorization is obtained in good faith as long as
there is a bona fide investigation into the specified offence. In my
view, that is insufficient. I would also say that there would be bad faith, and
an abuse of the statutory scheme, where the police, although investigating both
the specified and unspecified offences, were primarily interested in the
unspecified offence for which they could not get an authorization. In most
cases it would be virtually impossible to prove that the police were more
interested in the unnamed than the named offence. The only viable way to
control what American cases label “subterfuge searches” is to say that if an
offence is suspected at the time an authorization or renewal is given, an
authorization must specify that offence. If it does not, a communication with
respect to that offence is not lawfully intercepted in accordance with an
authorization. The above-cited American cases adopt this view by equating good
faith with inadvertance.

The American cases must, of course, be
approached with some caution because of the different statutory and
constitutional underpinnings. Is there any basis in the Canadian statute for
drawing a distinction between anticipated and unanticipated interceptions? I
think the answer is in the affirmative. Note the particular wording of
s. 178.13(2)(a):

178.13 …

…

[Page 143]

(2) An authorization shall

(a) state the offence in respect
of which private communications may be intercepted;

(Emphasis added.)

In R. v. Welsh and Iannuzzi (No. 6), supra, the
Ontario Court of Appeal interpreted “in respect of” to mean for the purpose or
object of investigating the named offence (at pp. 373-74). If interception is
for that purpose, it is lawful. Where the police suspect a crime in addition to
the named offence, the interceptions have a dual purpose. In the present case
interceptions purportedly under the July 9, 1976 renewal were made both in the
search for evidence of narcotics offences and in the search for evidence of
counterfeiting offences. I would say the former was authorized, the latter was
not.

VII Conclusion

I conclude that where the police suspect an
offence at the time of an application for an authorization or renewal, an
interception is not lawfully made in accordance with an authorization unless
the suspected offence is specified. The statute demands specification of the
offence to enable a judicial determination of whether electronic surveillance
is a proper tool of crime detection. If the interception has not thus been
given judicial approval, the statute mandates that the privacy interest in
preventing disclosure is paramount.

I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the order
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal directing that an acquittal be entered.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NEW
BRUNSWICK

Criminal law—Procedure—Separate
informations—Joint trial—No jurisdiction to try together separate
informations—New trials ordered.

Appellants were charged in separate
informations of hunting with a light contrary to s. 24 of the New Brunswick Game Act. Another
person was also charged in a third information of wilfully obstructing police
officers in the execution of their duty contrary to s. 118(a) of the
Criminal Code. All charges arose out of the same incident. By agreement
between the counsel of the prosecution and counsel for the defence, the
defendants were tried together. The appellants’ convictions in Provincial Court were upheld by the Court
of Queen’s Bench and the Court of Appeal. This appeal is to determine whether
the trial judge had jurisdiction to try more than one information at the same
time.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and new trials ordered.

Even with the consent of counsel of the
parties, a trial judge is without jurisdiction to try together separate
informations or indictments. The principle applies to charge laid under the Criminal
Code or under provincial statutes unless those statutes expressly provide
otherwise.

APPEAL from a judgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal
(1981), 37 N.B.R. (2d) 72, 97 A.P.R. 72, dismissing the accused’s appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Queen’s Bench, Trial Division (1980), 33 N.B.R. (2d)
50, 80 A.P.R. 50, upholding the convictions of the accused. Appeal allowed.

Gary A. Miller and J. Brian Neill, for
the appellants.

Paul Thériault, Q.C. for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—The two appellants were charged in
separate informations with hunting game by means or with the assistance of a
light, contrary to the provisions of s. 24 of the Game Act, R.S.N.B.
1973, c. G-1. The informations were identical save only for the name of the
person accused in each one. A third person, Beulah Phillips, was charged in a
third information with wilfully obstructing police officers in the execution of
their duty contrary to the provisions of s. 118(a) of the Criminal
Code. All charges arose out of the same incident. By consent all three
defendants were tried at the same time on common evidence. The two appellants
were convicted and their appeal was dismissed in the Court of Appeal. Beulah
Phillips did not appeal to this Court and her position is not relevant to these
proceedings.

At trial and in the Court of Appeal the matter
was disposed of on the merits. In this Court, the

[Page 163]

merits were not argued. Instead, new grounds not
raised below were advanced and they may be most conveniently set out by quoting
from the appellants’ factum, where it is stated:

The conviction of the Appellants was made
without jurisdiction in that their trial was a nullity for the reasons that:

(a) Each of the Appellants was charged in a
separate information for an offence contrary to section 24 of the New
Brunswick Game Act and each of their trials was held together with no
motion being made to read in the evidence heard in relation to one charge as
constituting the evidence on the other charge;

(b) Each of the Appellants was tried with
one Beulah Phillips who was charged with an offence contrary to
section 118 of the Criminal Code of Canada, and there is no
jurisdiction for a Provincial Court Judge to try a Criminal Code offence
together with an information charging an offence under the New Brunswick Game Act.

It should be noted that no objection was taken
to the informations themselves. Each information charged one accused with one
offence. Counsel for the appellants argued, however, that the fact that the
trial judge tried the informations together, even though the parties consented,
rendered the whole proceedings void. Alternatively, it was contended that,
whatever the result of a joint trial of two informations under the Summary
Convictions Act of New Brunswick, the joinder at trial of the third information under the Criminal
Code was fatal. Counsel for the Crown contended that, at most, the joinder
for trial of the separate informations was a mere irregularity against which
the court had the power to relieve. Since it was asserted that no prejudice was
shown and that there was clear evidence of the guilt of the appellants adduced
before the trial judge, the Court should dismiss the appeals.

There is judicial support for the appellants’
position that there is no jurisdiction to try more than one indictment or
information at the same time. In Crane v. Public Prosecutor, [1921] 2
A.C. 299,

[Page 164]

two accused charged on separate indictments were
tried together. Although it is permissible at common law to charge two accused
jointly on the same indictment, the House of Lords held that a single trial on
more than one indictment was a nullity. Lord Atkinson said, at p. 321:

When an accused person has pleaded “Not
guilty” to the offences charged against him in an indictment, and another
accused person has pleaded “Not guilty” to the offence or offences charged
against him in another separate and independent indictment it is, I have always
understood, elementary in criminal law, that the issues raised by those two
pleas cannot be tried together.

This principle was applied in R. v. Dennis;
R. v. Parker, [1924] 1 K.B. 867, where it was held in the Court of Criminal
Appeal that a single trial could not be held on more than one indictment even
with the consent of the parties. Jurisdiction cannot be conferred by consent.

The rule has been followed in Canada in cases of
multiple accused: R. v. Theirlyock (1928), 50 C.C.C. 296 (Alta. C.A.); R.
v. Hart and Kozaruk (1929), 51 C.C.C. 145 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Sargent (1943),
79 C.C.C. 384 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Gray (1947), 4 C.R. 363 (Ont. C.A.); Kezar
v. The Queen (1960), 132 C.C.C. 54 (Que. C.A.). It has also been applied in cases of a single accused charged on
more than one indictment or information: R. v. Cassidy (1927), 49
C.C.C. 93 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Longo (1941), 76 C.C.C. 142 (Ont.
C.A.); R. v. Johns (1945), 84 C.C.C. 213 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Elkins (1961),
35 C.R. 314 (B.C.C.A.); Brown v. The Queen (1961), 46 M.P.R. 321
(N.B.C.A.). The rule has been used to quash convictions on summary conviction
offences under provincial statutes: R. v. McDonald (1928), 50 C.C.C. 65
(Ont. Co. Ct.); R. v. Bannister (1954), 19 C.R. 419 (Ont. Co. Ct.); Peterson
v. Peterson, [1970] 5 C.C.C. 315 (Ont. H.C.); R. v. Armstrong (1977),
28 N.S.R. (2d) 431 (Co. Ct.). The overwhelming weight of authority in Canada,
based upon the Crane case, supra, is against a joint trial of
more than one indictment or information.

[Page 165]

A trial proceeds on the basis of one indictment
or one information which may or may not, according to the relevant statutory
provisions, contain more than one count. Early text writers referred to the
indictment as the foundation of the record, that is, the document by which
proceedings are commenced. Stephen’s History of the Criminal Law of England,
vol. 1, 1883, states at p. 274:

The indictment is the foundation of the
record in all criminal cases, and is indeed the only document connected with
the trial which in all cases is in writing. It is in the form of a statement
upon oath by the grand jury that the prisoner committed the offence with which he
is charged.

And at page 275:

It is enough to say that in all common
cases the pleadings in a criminal trial have always consisted, and still
consist, of an indictment engrossed on parchment, and a plea given by the
accused person orally in open court, of guilty or not guilty.

In all of the earlier writings on the subject of
indictments and informations and the procedures involved in their presentment
and trial, it was assumed that trial proceedings were founded upon a single
indictment or information. From very early times in England it was possible to join more than one person as an accused in an
indictment: see Blackstones Commentaries, vol. 4, 18th. ed., 1829, at
p. 301, where an indictment is described as a written accusation against
“one or more persons”. This practice has been followed in Canada. I have not, however, found any
early authority for the joinder for trial of more than one information or
indictment.

The Crane rule against the joinder for
trial of separate indictments or informations has recently been questioned in Canada. In R. v. Levesque, [1967] 2
C.C.C. 49 (Que. C.A.), one
accused was charged on two separate indictments with two separate offences
arising out of the same transaction. The offences could have been charged as
separate counts on one indictment (see s. 520 of the Criminal Code).
Since counsel consented to

[Page 166]

the joint trial and since there was no prejudice
to the accused it was held that the joint trial amounted only to an
irregularity which was corrected by consent. Convictions on the two separate
indictments were upheld. This case is, of course, distinguishable from the case
at bar in that it involved the joint trial of two indictments against one
accused. The present case involves two informations against two separate
accused.

In R. v. Kennedy; R. v. Dowdall (1971), 3
C.C.C. (2d) 58, the Ontario Court of Appeal (MacKay, Kelly and Arnup JJ.A.)
refused to apply the Crane principle in a case where two accused were
charged on separate informations with offences arising out of the same
transaction. The two informations were tried together by consent. The first
issue before us in the case at bar was exactly the issue raised in the Kennedy
case.

In Kennedy, Kelly J.A. observed that the
two appellants were engaged in a joint entreprise and that they could have been
jointly charged under the Criminal Code. He went on to point out that,
had they been so charged, the course of their defence would have been the same
and that no prejudice would have resulted. He considered that, since any number
of persons can be jointly charged with the commission of the same offence and
since, under the Criminal Code, several offences can be included in one
information (with the power of a judge in a proper case to order separate
trials of separate accused persons), the joinder of the informations in one
trial was a mere irregularity. As there was no prejudice to either accused, the
convictions were upheld. Kelly J.A. was of the view that the provisions in the
present Code were expressive of an intention to encourage joint trials
where no prejudice would result. He considered that narrow technical objections
should not

[Page 167]

obstruct this process. He said, at p. 63:

The anomalous situation disclosed by this
appeal is that the appellants, who were tried in a manner to which their
counsel agreed, at a trial to the conduct of which they have raised no other
objection, seek to have the convictions nullified solely because both
appellants were not charged in a single information.

I am fully conscious of the fact that many
cases have held that jurisdiction if otherwise absent cannot be conferred by
consent. I do not attempt to support the convictions on that basis. Rather do I
question the universality of the rule that essays to state that any joint trial
of two indictments is a nullity.

The authorities on which it is sought to
support the appeal have their origin in times long before the advent of the Code.
In view of the extensive provisions in the Code for the joinder of
offences and offenders, subject to the overriding power of the Court to order
separation when justice requires it, I do not consider that what occurred in
these cases resulted in the proceedings being of necessity a nullity—there was
at most an irregularity, the gravity of which is to be measured by the extent
to which the fair trial of the accused persons was prejudiced. Since neither
appellant suffered any prejudice in the defence advanced by him, it follows in
my view that the irregularity is one with respect to which this Court may invoke
the provision of s. 592 (1)(b)(ii) (am. 1968-69, c. 38,
s. 60(1)) of the Code.

Arnup J.A., in expressing agreement with Kelly
J.A., said at p. 67:

I am further of the view that procedural
changes in the Criminal Code, including those mentioned by my brother
Kelly, have been such as to enable one to discern a legislative intention that
criminal procedure should be expeditious, convenient, sensible and not unduly
technical, but subject always to the overriding duty of the Court to ensure
that the interests of the accused are fully protected and that his right to a
fair trial is in no way prejudiced. A similar policy is in general discernible
from the more recent decisions of the criminal Courts both in England and in Canada.

He went on to observe that the rule against the
joint trial of separate informations was ‘judgemade’ and could be relaxed and
modified with

[Page 168]

changing attitudes and conditions. He recognized
the existence of authorities heretofore considered to be binding upon the
courts, but did not feel that the requirements of stare decisis bound
the court to set aside the convictions “because the proceedings were initiated
by two pieces of paper instead of one, even though we are completely satisfied
that there was not the slightest prejudice to either accused nor any reason to
question the correctness, on the facts, of their conviction”.

The Kennedy case has not been uniformly
followed in Canada. In 1980,
the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the convictions of one accused based on two
informations tried together in the case of R. v. Torangeau (1980), 53
C.C.C. (2d) 574, since there was no prejudice to the accused. Apart from that
case, however, it is interesting to note that only one case was cited to us in
which Kennedy was applied to uphold convictions based on one trial of
separate informations. In R. v. Yeadon (1979), 36 N.S.R. (2d) 271, the
Nova Scotia County Court upheld two convictions under the provincial Motor
Vehicles Act even though the single accused was tried on two separate informations
at the same time. The provincial Act incorporated the summary conviction
procedures of the Criminal Code. Another Nova Scotia County Court judge
declined to follow Kennedy in R. v. Armstrong, supra, as did the
British Columbia Supreme Court in R. v. Mansell and Veilleux (1971), 18
C.R.N.S. 398. Even the lower courts of Ontario have declined to follow the decision of their own Court of Appeal
in Kennedy: see R. v. Kosowan (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 73 (Ont.
H.C.), and R. v. Burns (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 316 (Ont. Co. Ct.).

The question before this Court may be simply
stated. Should we accept the reasoning of the

[Page 169]

Ontario Court of Appeal in Kennedy and
discard the rule enunciated in Crane which has been generally accepted
in Canadian courts since that time, or should we confirm the rule in Crane as
a correct statement of the law to be applied in Canada?

In answering this question, I say at the outset
that I am in full agreement with the learned justices of the Ontario Court of
Appeal when they say that joint offenders should be jointly charged and jointly
tried. I agree that any prejudice which may arise upon such a joint trial is
guarded against by the exercise in a proper case of the judicial power to sever
counts and order separate trials. That is precisely what is provided for in the
Criminal Code, both for indictable and summary conviction offences and,
in the case of indictments, it has been the law for centuries. Approving such a
proposition does not, however, touch the question facing us here or which faced
the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Kennedy case.

The difficulty with the question in this case is
that a criminal trial has for centuries proceeded on the basis of one
indictment or one information. So basic to the law of criminal procedure was
this principle that the early text writers found no need even to comment on it,
although the principle is implicit throughout their writings (see, for example,
Stephen’s History of the Law of England and Kenny’s Outlines of
Criminal Law, 19th ed., 1966). It is not, therefore, surprising that Lord
Atkinson in the Crane case, supra, referred to the principle as
‘elementary’.

I would be reluctant to rest my decision in this
case solely on the basis of ancient practice. I agree with the Ontario Court of
Appeal that there is no reason why we should be required to be bound by
authority which serves no real purpose and rests upon no sound principle
applicable in a modern society. We must not, however, cast aside rules merely
because they are of long standing or

[Page 170]

because they may seem in certain cases to be
inconvenient. Can it be said then that the rule against joint trials of
separate indictments or informations serves no purpose and is based on no sound
principle?

The joinder of two or more indictments or
informations for trial raises fundamentally different problems from those which
arise in the joint trials of several persons accused under one indictment or
information. An elaborate procedure is provided under the Criminal Code covering
joint trials but no such procedure is to be found to deal with questions
arising upon a joinder of indictments. Consider, for example, the application
of the rule that an accused person is not compellable as a witness at his own
trial. Where two accused are charged on separate indictments or informations
and tried together in one proceeding there is nothing to prevent the Crown from
calling one accused as a witness to testify with respect to the indictment or
information charging the other accused because, in respect of that indictment,
he does not enjoy the protection accorded an accused person. The risk of
prejudice is immediately apparent and the Crown would in this way obtain an
advantage not permitted or even contemplated by the Code provisions. It
could be argued no doubt that the evidence so given would be admissible only
against the co-accused but on what principle it could be so limited may be
somewhat obscure. Certainly any protection the witness might claim under
s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, would be
rendered completely illusory. Such protection against the use of the evidence
against him applies only to future proceedings and not to those in progress
when the evidence is given. One may consider as well the case of an accused
charged in two separate indictments or informations with different offences. It
may be advantageous for him to testify with respect to one charge but not to
the other. Such an advantage is lost if both indictments are tried together.
This problem to be sure may arise where an accused is charged with separate
counts on one indictment or information, but where this occurs he enjoys the
protection of the detailed procedural provisions of the Code relating to
severance. While in retrospect, that is to say,

[Page 171]

from the vantage point of the appellate courts,
it may be possible in any given case to conclude that no prejudice resulted
from a joinder for trial of two indictments or informations, it would be
impossible for a trial judge to foresee at the outset of the trial all possible
consequences of such a joinder. The dangers then of prejudice and injustice are
such that they outweigh any advantage or consideration of efficiency thought to
be gained by the joinder.

It should also be pointed out that the common
law rule against joint trials of separate indictments or informations has been
incorporated by implication into the Criminal Code. Throughout the Code,
reference is made to trial on the indictment or the information.
Even the provisions in relation to multiple counts and severance indicate that
a trial is to proceed on one indictment or information. If it had been
contemplated by Parliament that more than one information or indictment could
be tried at the same time, these provisions for joinder or severance would have
been unnecessary.

In my opinion, therefore, the rule expressed in
the Crane case and generally accepted in Canadian courts should be
followed. I would hold that a trial judge is without jurisdiction to try
together separate informations or indictments under the Criminal Code. This
result will not complicate or delay the due administration of justice. There
are adequate means provided in the Criminal Code for the joinder of
accused and for the joinder of counts to avoid having to conduct more trials
than are necessary. Even at the beginning of a trial, where there are separate
informations or indictments that should have been charged jointly, it is open
to the trial judge in his discretion to permit the amend-

[Page 172]

ment of one document to include the charges or
accused from the other in a proper case: see Morena v. R.; Iacampo v. R., [1977]
C.A. 140.

As noted earlier, the appellants in the present
case were charged under a provincial statute and the procedures of the Summary
Convictions Act of New Brunswick govern. In my view, the same reasoning above with respect to the Criminal
Code applies to provincial statutes unless those statutes expressly provide
otherwise. No such provision may be found in the New Brunswick Act.

For the above reasons, it is my opinion that
this appeal should be allowed, the convictions set aside, and new trials
ordered on the separate informations. It is therefore unnecessary to consider
the second ground of appeal.

Appeal allowed and new trials ordered.

S.R. Fainstein, for the respondent.

The following is the judgment delivered by

THE COURT—These are applications for judicial
release or stay of sentence made by the applicants, Kristine Lyons and John
Prevedoros, pending the judgment of this Court on their respective appeals in
which judgment was reserved on June 23, 1983.

Following the hearing of these appeals in this
Court, the applicants made applications for judicial release to the Court of
Appeal of British Columbia
pursuant to s. 608 of the Criminal Code of Canada. These applications were heard by Hinkson J.A. in Chambers and
dismissed. Review

[Page 632]

was then sought under s. 608.1 and the
application for review was declined by the Chief Jutice of British Columbia. It is against this
background that these applications now before this Court must be considered.

If it be assumed that this Court had
jurisdiction to respond to these applications (as counsel for the applicants
have so ably argued), this Court would decline to grant the orders sought but
in doing so would wish to be understood as construing the decision of Hinkson
J.A. in denying judicial release as one which is based directly on the
circumstances of these applicants and not as an application of a general
proposition that judicial release should not be granted upon a reserve of
judgment in an appeal by the Supreme Court of Canada.

These applications are therefore denied.

Applications denied.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Procedure—Private
prosecution—Stay of proceedings—Mandamus to compel hearing on
informations—Whether Attorney General has power to stay proceedings any time
after laying of information—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended, ss.
2, 455, 455.3, 503, 508.

Appellant laid informations before a Justice
of the Peace alleging the commission of indictable offences. Prior to the commencement
of the hearing by the Justice of the Peace to determine whether process should
issue, the Attorney General stayed the proceedings pursuant to his authority
under s. 508 of the Criminal Code. The Supreme Court of Ontario denied
appellant’s application for an order for mandamus directing the Justice of the
Peace to proceed with a hearing under s. 455.3 of the Code and the Court
of Appeal upheld the decision. This appeal is to determine whether the Attorney
General is empowered by s. 508(1) to direct a stay of proceedings after an
information has been received but before the Justice of the Peace has completed
an inquiry under s. 455.3.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

Section 508 of the Criminal Code did
not empower the Attorney General to stay proceedings at any time after an
information was laid. The power to stay starts only after a summons or warrant
is issued. The laying of an information does not amount to the “finding of an
information”; an information is found only after the Justice of the Peace has
made a decision to issue process. The power to stay, while necessary,
encroaches upon a citizen’s fundamental and historical right to inform under
oath a Justice of the Peace of the commission of a crime. Parliament has seen
fit to impose upon

[Page 145]

the justice an obligation to “hear and
consider” the allegation and make a determination. In the absence of a clear
and unambiguous text taking away that right, and considering a text of law that
is open to an interpretation that favours the exercise of that right while
amply accommodating the policy consideration that supports the power to stay,
the right should be protected.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Appellant Dowson applied to a Justice
of the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order of mandamus directed to a Justice
of the Peace to proceed with a hearing pursuant to s. 455.3 of the Criminal
Code on nine charges: three of forgery, three of uttering forged documents,
and three of conveying false messages. The application was dismissed as was
also his appeal from that decision to the Court of Appeal. Dowson now appeals
to this Court.

On April 25, 1980, the appellant laid an
information before a Justice of the Peace concerning allegedly forged letters.
Under s. 455.3 of the Criminal Code a justice who receives an
information (other than an information laid under s. 455.1) shall hold a
hearing to determine whether process should issue against the accused. At the
request of the Attorney General of Ontario, this

[Page 146]

hearing was adjourned to permit the Attorney
General to complete his investigation into the matter.

On June 26, 1980, a new information was laid
and received. It charged an officer of the R.C.M.P. with forgery, uttering
false documents and conveying false messages contrary to ss. 326(1), 330 and
324 of the Criminal Code. The hearing under s. 455.3 was again adjourned
and eventually resumed on October 30, 1980. At this time, counsel for the
Attorney General of Ontario, pursuant to s. 508 of the Code, directed
the clerk of the court to make an entry on the record that the proceedings were
stayed by direction of the Attorney General. His Worship Justice of the Peace
Allen refused the appellant’s application for an adjournment and discontinued
the proceedings.

The appellant then applied for the order of
mandamus.

STATUTORY PROVISIONS

455. Any one who, on reasonable and
probable grounds, believes that a person has committed an indictable offence
may lay an information in writing and under oath before a justice, and the
justice shall receive the information, where it is alleged

(a) that the person has committed,
anywhere, an indictable offence that may be tried in the province in which the
justice resides, and that the person

(i) is or is believed to be, or

(ii) resides or is believed to reside,
within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice;

(b) that the person, wherever he may
be, has committed an indictable offence within the territorial jurisdiction of
the justice;

(c) that the person has, anywhere,
unlawfully received property that was unlawfully obtained within the
territorial jurisdiction of the justice; or

(d) that the person has in his
possession stolen property within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice.

455.3 (1) A
justice who receives an information, other than an information laid before him
under section 455.1, shall

(a) hear and consider, ex parte,

(i) the allegations of the informant, and

(ii) the evidence of witnesses, where he
considers it desirable or necessary to do so; and

[Page 147]

(b) where he considers that a case
for so doing is made out, issue, in accordance with this section, either a
summons or a warrant for the arrest of the accused to compel the accused to
attend before him to answer to a charge of an offence.

508. (1) The
Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may, at any
time after an indictment has been found and before judgment, direct the
clerk of the court to make an entry on the record that the proceedings are
stayed by his direction, and when the entry is made all proceedings on the
indictment shall be stayed accordingly and any recognizance relating to the
proceedings is vacated.

(2) Proceedings stayed in accordance with
subsection (1) may be recommenced, without laying a new charge or preferring a
new indictment, as the case may be, by the Attorney General or counsel
instructed by him for the purpose giving notice of the recommencement to the
clerk of the court in which the stay of proceedings was entered, but where no
such notice is given within one year after the entry of the stay of
proceedings, the proceedings shall be deemed never to have been commenced.

(Emphasis added.)

The appellant raised two issues:

1. Is the Attorney General of Ontario empowered
by s. 508(1) of the Criminal Code to direct a stay of proceedings after
an information has been received but before the Justice of the Peace has
completed an inquiry under s. 455.3 to determine whether process should issue
against the accused?

2. Are The Ministry of the Attorney General
Act and The Crown Attorneys Act ultra vires in so far as they
authorize the Attorney General of Ontario to direct a stay of proceedings after
an information has been laid but before the Justice of the Peace has completed
an inquiry under s. 455.3?

At the hearing before this Court, the Crown took
the position that it did not rely on provincial legislation to support its
position. This being so, we are left with only the first issue.

[Page 148]

THE JUDGMENTS

Supreme Court of Ontario

Montgomery J. concluded that “All criminal
proceedings are commenced by the laying of an information. Once proceedings are
commenced, the Attorney General may intervene and conduct or stay proceedings.”
He relied on The Department of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 116, The
Crown Attorneys Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 101, the historical origins of the
expression “finding an indictment” in 1886, R.S.C. 1886, c. 174, s. 2, paras. (c.)
and (d.), and, amongst others, R. v. Leonard, ex parte Graham (1962),
133 C.C.C. 262, a decision of the Court of Appeal of Alberta, and the fact that
the Attorney General was the “chief law officer for the Crown and the duly
constituted public authority charged with the responsibility for the
administration of justice in the province”.

The Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal, per Howland C.J.O.
adopted the reasons of Montgomery J. and added three observations of its own.
They are essentially as follows:

(1) Any ambiguity in the expression “an
indictment has been found” is resolved by the definition of “indictment” in s.
2 and by the context in which the expression occurs, especially s. 508(2). This
section provides that proceedings stayed in accordance with s. 508(1) “may be
recommenced, without laying a new charge or preferring a new indictment”. It
thus assimilates laying a charge with finding an indictment.

(2) Under s. 732.1 the Attorney General has the
power to stay proceedings any time after the laying of an information which
charges a summary conviction offence. It would be anomalous to deny him this
power with respect to indictable offences, especially since he is charged by
statute with the ultimate responsibility for the conduct of prosecutions: see The
Crown Attorneys Act, ss. 11 and 12.

[Page 149]

(3) As Chief law officer of the Crown, the
Attorney General has always had the power to control the issue of process in
the name of the Crown. His decision is not reviewable by the courts.

Section 2 of the Criminal Code defines
“indictment” and “count”:

“indictment” includes

(a) information, presentment and a
count therein

(b) a plea, replication or other
pleading, and

(c) any record;

“count” means a charge in an information or
indictment;

Section 503 defines the expression “Finding an
indictment”

503. For the
purposes of this Part, finding an indictment includes

(a) preferring an indictment, and

(b) presentment of an indictment by
a grand jury.

As the Attorney General can stay under s. 508
“at any time after an indictment has been found and before judgment”, when
substituting the word “information” for the word “indictment” the question to
be answered in order to address the issue is whether an information is “found”
upon the mere “laying” of the information or only when the Justice of the Peace
has decided to issue a process, warrant or summons, following a hearing under
s. 455.3.

Appellant takes issue with the Alberta Court of
Appeal’s decision in R. v. Leonard, ex parte Graham, supra, and takes
the primary position that the Attorney General cannot enter a stay of
proceedings while the matter is in Provincial Court. In that case the issue before the Court was whether the Attorney
General could intervene to withdraw an information for an indictable offence
that had been laid by a private prosecutor. In obiter Smith C.J.A.,
rendering judgment for the Court said, at p. 266:

[Page 150]

My view is that the included meaning of the
word ‘information’ in s-s. (20) of s. 2 of the Code is applicable and
relevant, and is not doubtful or ambiguous and I therefore consider that in the
case of a preliminary hearing of an information for an indictable offence, s.
490 must be read as meaning what it would mean if the word ‘information’ were
substituted therein for the word ‘indictment’. In other words, for this
purpose, the word ‘indictment’ therein, in my view, must be read as
comprehending not only an indictment but also an information. The word
‘information’ in s-s. (20) of s. 2, cannot refer to a criminal information
because criminal informations have been abolished by s. 488 of the Criminal
Code.

Appellant refers us to two publications, one
written prior to the Leonard decision (D.E. Greenfield, “The
position of the stay in Magistrate’s Court”, (1961-62) 4 Crim. L.Q. 373) and a
more recent one in 1974 (Connie Sun, “The Discretionary Power to Stay Criminal
Proceedings”, (1974) 1 Dalhousie L.J. 482). I have read these articles and have
found therein nothing to convince me that I should disagree with that passage
of Smith C.J.A.’s remarks that I have first quoted.

Appellant’s subsidiary position, supported by
intervener, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, one with which I am in
agreement and would so find, is that, because a prosecution commences only
after the Justice of the Peace has made a decision to issue process, an
information has been found only after that decision.

Before substantiating this finding, I should
like to comment on Montgomery J.’s reference to the predecessor sections
defining “indictment”, “count” and “finding an indictment” prior to the Code
of 1953-54. I do not know to what extent reliance was put on the wording of
those sections from 1886 to 1953. Indeed Montgomery J. does not say. As I am of
the view that the wording of the predecessor sections is no longer since 1953
of any relevance to the question we have to answer, I must assume that
Montgomery J.’s reference to them is an indication that he was of a contrary
view.

There is no need to reproduce here the text of
those sections as they evolved over the years but it is sufficient to look at
them as they read in 1886, a

[Page 151]

text specifically referred to by Montgomery
J., and in 1927, the form in which those definitions were till the enactment of
the Code of 1953.

Revised Statutes of Canada 1886, c. 174:

2. …

…

(c.) The expression ‘indictment’
includes information, inquisition and presentment as well as indictment, and
also any plea, replication or other pleading, and any record;

(d.) The expression ‘finding of the
indictment’ includes also the taking of an inquisition, the exhibiting an
information and the making of a presentment;

Revised Statutes of Canada 1927, c. 36:

2. …

…

(17) “indictment” and “count” respectively
include information and presentment as well as indictment, and also any plea,
replication or other pleading, any formal charge under section eight hundred
and seventy-three, and any record;

…

5. In this
Act, unless the context otherwise requires,

(a) finding the indictment includes
also exhibiting an information and making a presentment;

(b) having in one’s possession
includes not only having in one’s own personal possession, but also knowingly,

(i) having in the actual possession or
custody of any other person, and

(ii) having in any place, whether belonging
to or occupied by one’s self or not, for the use or benefit of one’s self or of
any other person.

2. If there are two or more persons, and
any one or more of them, with the knowledge and consent of the rest, has or
have anything in his or their custody or possession it shall be deemed and
taken to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.

[Page 152]

The definition of “indictment” in 1927 no longer
included inquisitions nor did “finding an indictment” include “the taking of an
inquisition”. An inquisition was a reference to a Coroner’s inquest and, as no
one could as of the time of codification any longer be tried upon a Coroner’s
inquisition, reference to an inquisition was omitted from the Code of
1892. That is the only essential difference between the texts of 1886 and those
of 1927, save the addition in 1927 of the words “any formal charge under
section eight hundred and seventy-three” to the definition of indictment, which
was a reference to the charge before the petit jury in the provinces where
there was no grand jury (at the time, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta).

As for the word “information”, in 1886 it had
three possible meanings. It could mean that which was before a justice for
offences punishable by summary conviction, that upon which a preliminary
inquiry was held, or a criminal information. A criminal information was a
device whereby the grand jury was avoided and was a presentment by the
Sovereign or of a citizen and the Sovereign of an accusation to the petit jury.
This procedure was limited mainly to misdemeanours and though rarely if ever
employed in this country (See R. v. Wilson (1878), 43 U.C.Q.B. 583) was
officially abolished in 1953. As for “exhibiting an information” (an expression
that at first sight might suggest something prior to the decision of issuing a
process) its primary and most usual meaning was in regard to such “criminal
informations”. “Exhibiting” meant in civil law the commencement of a suit and
in criminal law the exhibiting of an information meant the commencement of a
trial for a misdemeanour before a petit jury by way of a “criminal
information”. It had nothing to do with Justices of the Peace at a preliminary
inquiry. (See Stroud, Judicial Dictionary, vol. 3, 4th ed., London,
Sweet & Maxwell Ltd., 1973, at p. 1362. See also Blackstone, Commentaries
on The Laws of England, vol. IV, 18th ed., 1829, where commenting on
criminal informations he says, at p.

[Page 153]

308: “The informations that are exhibited in the
name of the king alone, are… .”)

Exhibiting informations also had in the last
century a secondary meaning. Jowitt, The Dictionary of English Law, London,
Sweet & Maxwell Ltd., 1959, at p. 968, refers to the matters as follows:

Proceedings before justices of the peace in
matters of a criminal nature are commenced by an information, which is a
statement of the facts of the case made by informant or prosecutor, sometimes
verbally, sometimes in writing, and either with or without an oath; when not
upon oath, the information is said to be exhibited.

(Emphasis added.)

In my view, this latter meaning could not have
been the one intended in s. 5 of the Code of 1927 defining “Finding of
the indictment” as including “the exhibiting of an information”. Indeed, there
is no reason to preclude informations that are sworn and consider only those
that were not as amounting to indictments “found”. That would not make any
sense. In fact, were it not for the 1953-54 amendments to the Criminal Code it
could be seriously questioned whether the word “information” in the Code definition
of indictment even before 1953 meant anything other than a “criminal
information”. In any event, even assuming that information did include those
before justices, reference to these old sections derived as they are from
ancient practice would still leave us facing the original question of if and when
an information may be found. The fact that Parliament, when abolishing criminal
informations in 1953, deleted the words “exhibiting an information” but left
the word “information” in the definition of indictment, clearly indicates that
information, whatever the word may have included in the predecessor sections,
as of then referred to those

[Page 154]

informations before Justices and those only, as
there existed as of then none else.

For these reasons I do not, with respect, think
that anything turns upon the predecessor sections. However, reference to the
historical evolution of the powers enjoyed by the Attorney General in the
charging process to which I shall allude shortly is of prime importance.

Now to consider the views of the Court of
Appeal.

With respect, I do not find compelling the first
and third reasons upon which they predicated their conclusion. As regards the
first of those reasons, all that s. 508(2) says is that you need not start all
over to recommence the proceedings. It does not follow that laying a new
information would amount to the “finding of an information”. If the Attorney
General does choose to start all over, he will of necessity have to lay an
information. Prior to the addition in 1972 of s. 508(2) to what is now s.
508(1), there was uncertainty as to whether you had to prefer a new charge or
whether you could start the proceedings again by carrying on at the point the
proceedings were stayed. (See R. v. Mitchel (1848), 3 Cox C.C. 93; see
also R. v. Rosser (1971), 16 C.R.N.S. 321, at p. 326, for a
review of the authorities.)

The Court of Appeal’s third reason was expressed
as follows:

Since the decision of the Justice of the
Peace to proceed with the charges involves the issue of process in the name of
the Sovereign, it would seem appropriate that the Attorney-General as the chief
law officer of the Crown should have the power to prevent the use of such
process where he considers that the proceedings should be stayed. This involves
an executive decision which historically, and now by statute, has been vested
in the Attorney-General. This decision is not reviewable by the Courts and is
one for which he is in turn accountable to the Legislature or to Parliament, as
the case may be.

[Page 155]

The right of a private citizen to lay an
information, and the right and duty of the Attorney‑General to supervise
criminal prosecutions are both fundamental parts of our criminal justice
system.

There is nothing there said with which I take
issue. However, with respect, I fail to see why the conclusion dictated by
these remarks would of necessity be that the law should be interpreted as did
the Court of Appeal. Indeed, prior to that determination by the Justices of the
Peace, there being no summons or warrant issued, one could say that the process
is not yet put into operation. Furthermore, when the Attorney General in the
exercise of his supervisory power over criminal prosecutions chooses to prevent
the use of the criminal process, as is his right, his accountability to the
Legislature would be much greater if he acted after the Justice of the Peace
has determined that there is cause to issue process.

The power to stay is a necessary one but one
which encroaches upon the citizen’s fundamental and historical right to inform
under oath a Justice of the Peace of the commission of a crime. Parliament has
seen fit to impose upon the justice an obligation to “hear and consider” the
allegation and make a determination. In the absence of a clear and unambiguous
text taking away the right, it should be protected. This is particularly true
when considering a text of law that is open to an interpretation that favours
the exercise of that right whilst amply accommodating the policy consideration
that supports the power to stay. When one adds to these considerations the fact
that, apart from the court’s control, the only one left is that of the
legislative branch of government, given a choice, any interpretation of the
law, which would have the added advantage of better ensuring the Attorney
General’s accountability by enhancing the legislative capacity to superintend
the exercise of his power, should be preferred.

An historical review of the evolution of the
Crown’s power to avoid the preliminary inquiry or the grand jury indicates an
intent on the part of Parliament to increase the Attorney General’s
accountability. The most recent manifestation of

[Page 156]

this evolution is found in the amendments
brought to the Crown’s power to by-pass a preliminary inquiry and to prefer
indictments directly before a grand or petit jury. Prior to 1969, not only the
Attorney General but his agent, and the Deputy Attorney General, and any one
with the written consent of the Attorney General could prefer an indictment
directly.

The 1969 amendments first took out of the list
of those who could indict, even following a preliminary inquiry, the Deputy
Attorney General because he was not considered as being an agent of the
Attorney General. As for by-passing a preliminary inquiry or a discharge, his
agents or others, even with his written consent, can no longer do so. The
Attorney General himself or a person authorized by the court are the only ones
that can now prefer directly. I can see no reason why we should not when
possible interpret the law in compliance with this clear attitudinal trend on
the part of Parliament. Furthermore, to say that an information is found only
once a determination to issue a process is made is not inconsistent with the
procedure by indictment. We are here unfortunately dealing with legal
expressions which were developed in the grand jury system and as a result a
certain degree of transposition is required. Under the grand jury system (which
still exists in Nova Scotia) a
bill was preferred before the grand jury. If it found a true bill it presented
the indictment to the court. Prior to a true bill the Attorney General could
not under the common law stay the proceedings by entering a nolle prosequi. The
power to stay and limitation thereto were codified in this country in 1892 by
s. 732:

732. The
Attorney General may, at any time after an indictment has been found against
any person for any offence and before judgment is given thereon, direct the
officer of the court to make on the record an entry that the proceedings are
stayed by his direction, and on such entry being made all such proceedings
shall be stayed accordingly.

[Page 157]

2. The Attorney-General may delegate such
power in any particular court to any counsel nominated by him.

The procedure by indictment where there is no
grand jury in fact does away, though we still speak of preferring an
indictment, with the two stages of preferral and presentment. “There is but one
act, that act being the placing by the appropriate authority of ‘an indictment
in writing setting forth the offence’ before the trial court. This act
constitutes the commencement of the trial and is a combination of the steps of
preferral and presentment.” (Dickson J. for the Court in R. v. Chabot,
[1980] 2 S.C.R. 85, at p. 992.)

Under this procedure the Attorney General makes
the determination in the stead of the grand jury, and the next step is for the
court to issue the process to bring the accused before the court to answer the
charge. When the proceedings are commenced by an information the informant in a
sense “prefers” the information and the Justice of the Peace decides whether or
not to “find” the information and then the next step is to issue the process to
bring the accused before him. The Justice of the Peace then plays the same role
as the grand jury, as regards the finding of grounds to issue a process and
that of the trial court to issue a process following a preferment or
presentment.

The Attorney General’s power to stay starts as
of the moment a summons or warrant is issued.

Though this approach is not without logic, I
must admit that were it the only reason for adopting this course I should have
to adopt the second reason advanced by the Court of Appeal and dismiss this
appeal. Indeed the second observation made by the Court of Appeal cannot be
discarded easily, and accordingly I have felt great hesitation in concluding
that this appeal should be allowed. In fact, it is when addressing the third
observation made by the Court of Appeal, (the Attorney General’s historical
control of the process), that I have preferred a policy consideration,
desirable accountability, to the advantage of avoiding differ-

[Page 158]

ent approaches, one for indictable offences and
the other for summary conviction offences. The disparity between stays for
summary convictions and those for indictable offences is undesirable and could
not have been intended by Parliament. Such an anomaly is not, unfortunately so
infrequent in the field of criminal procedure. Our lexicon is archaic and no
longer corresponds to current institutions. Our changing sections are
unfortunately often the result of patchwork on the part of draughtsmen.
Furthermore, it is difficult for the courts to inject some logic and cohesion
in a system where, as regards the charging process, the exception has become
over the years the rule, where the exceptional procedures of direct indictment
without a grand jury for the Northwest Territories is now, save in Nova Scotia, the system for the whole country. When faced with the choice
between uniformity of procedure and greater political accountability for the
exercise of a necessary but no less dangerous discretion to circumvent the
courts and deny a citizen his right to bring another to court, I think I
should, pending Parliament’s decision to speak out in modern terms, prefer the
latter and suffer some anomaly in the law which I imagine is temporary.

For these reasons I would allow the appeal, and
order that a mandamus issue and be directed to his Worship Justice of the Peace
Allen to proceed with a hearing pursuant to s. 455.3 of the Criminal Code on

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Corruption—Fraud upon the
government—Conspiracy—Elements of offence—Form of the indictment—Agreement to
receive benefit as consideration for cooperation, assistance and exercise of
influence not proven—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C‑34,
s. 110(1)(a), (d).

In 1965, respondents Giguère, Belhumeur,
Dionne and another person bought the shares of Publicor Inc. which held all the
outstanding shares of Canadian Advertising Agency Ltd. Although the advertising
agency’s financial position was poor at the time, it improved considerably
shortly after the takeover. A major part of this improvement resulted from
contracts with the federal government. The Agency made use of Giguère’s
political contacts in the federal government. Giguère also continued to arrange
meetings between government officials and the Agency’s representatives after
the sale of his shares to his partners in 1967. Respondents were later indicted
on three counts of conspiracy to offer or accept a “benefit as consideration
for cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence” on the government;
the indictments are related to the awarding of advertising contracts to the
Agency. Respondents were acquitted at trial and the Crown’s appeal was
dismissed.

Held (Wilson
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Dickson
and Chouinard JJ.: The trial judge erred in assuming that there was in
law no “benefit” unless Giguère had been given more than fair market value for
his shares. The entire purchase price constituted a benefit within the meaning
of s. 110(1)(a) and (d) of the

[Page 449]

Code. To be
illegal however the benefit must be in consideration for cooperation,
assistance or exercise of influence. It is in this context that the matter of
fair market value becomes relevant. If a person is given fair market value or
more for his shares, it is pertinent to investigate to determine what is being
paid for. If the payment is for a past or future intervention by a person of
the nature proscribed by s. 110, an illegal benefit has been conferred. Here,
the worth of the Agency’s shares increased because of contracts with the government.
If those contracts could be attributed to Giguère’s influence, the payment for
Giguère’s shares could amount to payment for that influence. The trial judge
did not make the necessary findings and inferences of fact to make such a
determination because he wrongly thought fair market value to be the only
issue.

The trial judge also erred in his treatment
of fair market value. In determining whether Giguère’s shares were purchased at
fair market value, it was the sum effectively received by Giguère, and not the
cost to the donor, that the trial judge had to take into account.

The trial judge was also wrong in concluding
that Giguère’s opening doors or arranging meetings did not constitute
cooperation or assistance under s. 110. Opening doors or arranging meetings
does not by itself constitute “exercise of influence”. However, if someone
opens doors and arranges meetings as a first step in an effort by another to
secure a government contract, that is indeed assistance or cooperation in
connection with the transaction of business with government within s. 110(1) (a)
and (d).

Finally, although the indictment read for
“cooperation, assistance and exercise of influence”, the Crown did not
need to prove all three elements. An accused is liable for conviction on any
part of the indictment that constitutes an offence. Therefore, a conviction
should follow if the Crown proved a conspiracy to pay Giguère a benefit in
consideration for cooperation or assistance but not for the exercise of
influence. In the case at bar, the trial judge found no proof of any agreement
that Giguère cooperated, assisted or exercised influence. Such an agreement was
an essential ingredient of the offences as charged. Consequently, despite the
trial judge’s errors of law concerning the constituent elements of an offence
under s. 110(1) of the Criminal Code, the respondents were
entitled to have their acquittals

[Page 450]

affirmed as the trial judge made sufficient
findings of fact to support the verdict.

Per Mclntyre
and Lamer JJ.: The Court of Appeal committed no error of law in dismissing the
appeal by choosing not to interfere with the trial judge’s findings that there
was no discussion nor agreement as to “future services” and to consider the
word “services” used by him as encompassing any activity contemplated under s.
110(1)(a) of the Code.

Per Wilson J.,
dissenting: The trial judge misdirected himself as to the constituent
elements of the offence under s. 110 of the Code. In particular, he
failed to appreciate that an agreement to open doors and arrange meetings in
return for a “benefit” could constitute cooperation or assistance within the
meaning of the section. Because of this error he made no finding of fact as to
whether there has been such an agreement and accordingly a new trial should be
ordered.

The judgment of Dickson and Chouinard JJ. was
delivered by

DICKSON J.—What are the elements of an offence
under s. 110 of the Criminal Code, proscribing frauds upon the
government? That general question lies at the heart of this case. The more
particular question is whether, despite any errors of law, the trial judge’s
findings of fact are such as to entitle the several accused to an acquittal.

I The Facts

The accused were tried without a jury before
Labrosse J. and were acquitted on three counts of conspiracy. The Crown’s
appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal (Lacourciere, Houlden, Goodman JJ. A.)
was unanimously dismissed. The Crown appeals to this Court by leave.

The three counts on the indictment are as
follows:

1. Louis de Gonzague Giguere, David
Belhumeur, Jean P. Dionne, Canadian Advertising Agency Limited and Publicor
Ltd. stand charged that between the first (1st) day of January, nineteen
sixty-five (1965) and the thirty-first (31st) day of December, nineteen
seventy-three (1973), at the City of Ottawa in the Judicial District of Ottawa‑Carleton
in the Province of Ontario and elsewhere in Canada, they unlawfully did
conspire together and with Leon Simard and with another person or other persons
unknown to have the said Louis de Gonzague Giguere, a person having or
pretending to have influence with the Government of Canada or with an official
of the Government of Canada, accept for himself a benefit, to wit, eighty-seven
thousand dollars ($87,000.00) more or less, as consideration for cooperation,
assistance and the exercise of influence in connection with matters of business
relating to the Government of Canada, to wit, the awarding of contracts for
advertising services by the Government of Canada to Canadian Advertising Agency
Limited, contrary to Sections 423(1)(d) and 110(1)(d) of the Criminal Code
of Canada.

2. Louis de Gonzague Giguere, David
Belhumeur, Jean P. Dionne, Canadian Advertising Agency Limited and Publicor
Ltd. stand charged that between the twelfth (12th) day of September, nineteen
sixty-eight (1968)

[Page 452]

and the thirty-first (31st) day of December
nineteen seventy-three (1973), at the City of Ottawa in the Judicial District
of Ottawa-Carleton in the Province of Ontario and elsewhere in Canada, they
unlawfully did conspire together and with Leon Simard and with another person
or other persons unknown to have Canadian Advertising Agency Limited and
Publicor Ltd. give to the said Louis de Gonzague Giguere, an official, to wit,
a member of the Senate of the Parliament of Canada and to have the said Louis
de Gonzague Giguere accept a benefit, to wit, twenty thousand seven hundred
dollars ($20,700.00) more or less, as consideration for cooperation, assistance
and the exercise of influence in connection with matters of business relating
to the Government of Canada to wit, the awarding of contracts for advertising
services by the Government of Canada to Canadian Advertising Agency Limited,
contrary to Sections 423(1)(d) and 110(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of
Canada.

3. Louis de Gonzague Giguere, David
Belhumeur, Jean P. Dionne, Canadian Advertising Agency Limited and Publicor
Ltd. stand charged that between the first (1st) day of January, nineteen
sixty-five (1965) and the thirty-first (31st) day of December, nineteen
seventy-three (1973), at the City of Ottawa in the Judicial District of Ottawa‑Carleton
in the Province of Ontario and elsewhere in Canada, they unlawfully did
conspire together and with Leon Simard and with another person or other persons
unknown to have the Canadian Advertising Agency Limited and Publicor Ltd. give
to the said Louis de Gonzague Giguere, an official of the Government of Canada,
to wit, a Director of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, an agency
of the Government of Canada, and for the said Louis de Gonzague Giguere to
accept a benefit, to wit, an undetermined amount of money and other valuable
consideration not exceeding eighty-seven thousand dollars ($87,000.00) more or
less, as consideration for cooperation, assistance and the exercise of
influence in connection with a matter of business relating to the Government of
Canada, to wit, the awarding of contracts for advertising services by the
Government of Canada on behalf of the said Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation, contrary to Sections 423(1)(d) and 110(1)(a) of the Criminal
Code of Canada.

At trial, the Crown conceded that counts 2 and 3
are simply variants of count one, and that this Court’s decision in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 29 precluded conviction on more than one
count.

[Page 453]

The disposition of this case depends largely on
what precisely were the trial judge’s findings of fact. I will consider that
aspect later in these reasons. At this stage, I will undertake only a brief
review of the uncontested facts.

Louis de Gonzague Giguère, during the period set
out in the first count, (January 1, 1965 to December 31, 1973), was chief organizer
of the federal Liberal party in the Province of Quebec. Throughout this period, the
Liberal party was in power at the federal level. From 1963 until September
1968, Giguère was a director of Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Since
September 1968 Giguère has been a Senator. At the material times David
Belhumeur was a chartered accountant and a businessman. Jean Dionne was also a
businessman, involved primarily in the food sector. Canadian Advertising Agency
Limited (“Canadian Advertising”) was an old French Canadian advertising agency
that did work for the federal Liberals during elections. Publicor Ltd. held all
of the outstanding shares of Canadian Advertising.

In 1965 Canadian Advertising was in poor
financial condition. The majority shareholder of Publicor, Arthur Fontaine, was
terminally ill. He wanted to sell. His primary concern was to have Canadian
Advertising continue as a French Canadian company. He was prepared to sell his
interest in Publicor for $1, if the new purchasers would take over
responsibility for a $100,000 bank overdraft. The minority shareholders of
Publicor were also prepared to sell; their selling price was $22,500.

In September 1965 the sale of Publicor, and
hence Canadian Advertising, was completed. The purchasers were the three
individual accused, Giguère, Belhumeur and Dionne, as well as one Léon Simard.
Simard is an unindicted co-conspirator and one of the Crown’s chief witnesses.
The four new owners each paid $5,625 for the purchase of the minority
shareholdings and each acquired 25 per cent of the shares of Publicor. The

[Page 454]

$100,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by
Simard, Belhumeur and Dionne, but not by Giguère. No one was ever called upon
to pay on the guarantee. A “cash flow” of $48,000 was put into Canadian
Advertising by way of a loan. Simard loaned $12,000; the remaining $36,000 was
loaned by a company called Air Food Caterers (AFC). From October 1965 onward
AFC was a company owned 42.5 per cent by Belhumeur, 37.5 per cent by Dionne,
and 20 per cent by Giguère.

Although Giguère was initially listed on the
records of Publicor as a shareholder, the records were changed shortly after
the September 1965 acquisition. Thereafter, Giguère’s shares were held by a
nominee, Paul Boudreau, an unnamed co-conspirator and Crown witness. Boudreau
had been a director and officer of Canadian Advertising; he was in charge of
the day-to-day operations of Canadian Advertising from shortly before the
takeover in 1965 until the spring of 1968, when he left Canadian Advertising.

After the takeover in 1965, the financial
position of Canadian Advertising improved considerably. A major part of this
improvement resulted from contracts with the federal government. Giguère had
contacts in the federal government of which the Canadian Advertising did make
use.

In late 1967 Giguère informed the other three
shareholders that he wished to sell his shares in Publicor. Giguère wanted
$100,000 for his quarter interest. Belhumeur, the accountant, did an
evaluation, without taking account of goodwill, and concluded Giguère’s shares
were worth approximately $52,000. Belhumeur, Dionne and Simard offered $67,000,
including $15,000 for goodwill. Giguère was not satisfied. It was finally
agreed that Giguère would get $67,000, plus $5,000 a year for five years—a
total of $92,000. The $5,000 a year was to be paid not by Belhumeur, Dionne and
Simard, but by Canadian Advertising as either salary or expenses. Canadian
Advertising would claim the salary or expenses as

[Page 455]

a deduction for income tax purposes, so the
effective cost would be $2,500 a year rather than $5,000. These would not be
legitimate company deductions, but, as the trial judge noted, the accused are
not charged with conspiring to evade taxes.

The $67,000 was actually paid to Giguère through
Canadian Advertising. Canadian Advertising was shortly thereafter reimbursed by
Simard and AFC. Belhumeur’s and Dionne’s two-thirds of the $67,000 was charged
back to them by AFC. In the same transactions the loans to Canadian Advertising
of $12,000 by Simard and $36,000 by AFC were retired.

The $5,000 a year was paid in different ways.
For about two years, Canadian Advertising paid a salary to Françoise Demers,
Giguère’s personal secretary. Demers was not an employee of Canadian
Advertising. It is conceded that a salary was paid to Demers rather than to
Giguère because Demers was in a lower tax bracket. Demers turned the money over
to Giguère. The practice of paying a salary to Demers stopped after an
inspection by the tax department. Thereafter, moneys were paid to Giguère by
way of expenses. Over the five years, the amount paid by Canadian Advertising
to Giguère, directly or indirectly, was approximately $25,000.

There is uncontradicted evidence that Giguère,
after the sale of his shares, arranged meetings between government officials
and representatives of Canadian Advertising, and also that Giguère put in a
good word for Canadian Advertising with at least one Cabinet Minister.

The factual question in this case is: what was
the nature of the agreement surrounding the sale of Giguère’s shares.

[Page 456]

II The Law

The charges are conspiracy to contravene s.
110(1) of the Criminal Code. The first count relates to s. 110(1)(d),
the second and third to s. 110(1)(a):

110. (1)
Every one commits an offence who

(a) directly or indirectly

(i) gives, offers, or agrees to give or
offer to an official or to any member of his family, or to any one for the
benefit of an official, or

(ii) being an official, demands, accepts or
offers or agrees to accept from any person for himself or another person,

a loan, reward, advantage or benefit
of any kind as consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise of
influence or an act or omission in connection with

(iii) the transaction of business with or
any matter of business relating to the government, or

(iv) a claim against Her Majesty or any
benefit that Her Majesty is authorized or is entitled to bestow,

whether or not, in fact, the official is
able to cooperate, render assistance, exercise influence or do or omit to do what
is proposed, as the case may be;

…

(d) having or pretending to
have influence with the government or with a minister of the government or an
official, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept for himself or another
person a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration
for cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission in
connection with

(i) anything mentioned in subparagraph
(a)(iii) or (iv), or

(ii) the appointment of any person,
including himself, to an office;

(Emphasis added.)

Section 110(1)(a) relates to public
officials, s. 110(1)(d) to persons having or pretending to have
influence with the government. In respect of count one (s. 110(1)(d) the
trial judge found, and it is not contested, that Giguère’s position as chief
organizer of the federal Liberal party in the Province of Quebec made him a
person having influ-

[Page 457]

ence with the government. In respect of counts
two and three Giguère’s position, respectively, of Senator and Director of
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, made him an official. (However,
Belhumeur and Dionne testified that they were not aware that Giguère was a
director of Central Mortgage and Housing until late 1967 when Giguère indicated
he wanted to sell his shares.) No questions of statutory interpretation arise
in relation to these elements of the offences. The matters in dispute are the
meanings in both s. 110(1)(a) and (d) of
(i) “benefit… as consideration for”, and of (ii) “cooperation, assistance,
exercise of influence”.

(i) “Benefit… as consideration for”

At trial, Labrosse J. assessed “benefit” within
s. 110(1)(a) and (d) exclusively in terms of
whether Giguère had been given fair market value for his shares. The Ontario
Court of Appeal seemed to agree. In my view, with respect, Labrosse J. erred in
this regard. I also think he erred in his treatment of fair market value.

Labrosse J. assumed that there was, in law, no
benefit unless Giguère had been given more than fair market value for his
shares. This Court’s decision in Doré v. Attorney General of Canada,
[1975] 1 S.C.R. 56, would suggest otherwise. Doré, a CBC employee, was paid a
salary by other companies for writing scripts. These companies then sold the
scripts to CBC upon Doré’s recommendation. One of the issues in the case was
whether the salary constituted a benefit under s. 110(1)(c), which
reads:

110. (1) …

(c) being an official or
employee of the government, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept from
a person who has dealings with the government a commission, reward, advantage
or benefit of any kind directly or indirectly, by himself or through a member
of his family or through any one for his benefit, unless he has the consent in
writing of the head of the branch of

[Page 458]

government that employs him or of which he
is an official, the proof of which lies upon him;

Doré took the position that the salary was not a
benefit because he was only being paid the fair market value of his labour. The
salary was held, however, to constitute a benefit. Pigeon J. said this, at p.
780:

Clearly, the fact that a sum of money or
other value represents only the equivalent of the benefits conferred does not
prevent it from being “a commission, reward, advantage or benefit”. The words
“commission” and “reward” suggest the idea of compensation for services
rendered.

I think the same reasoning applies to a purchase
of shares. The entire purchase price is a benefit. That does not, however,
necessarily connote an illegal benefit.

Section 110(1)(a)and (d) does
not make it illegal to receive a benefit as such; the benefit must be as
consideration for cooperation, assistance, and the like. It is in this
context that the matter of fair market value becomes relevant. As Pigeon J.
noted in Doré, supra, at p. 780, the question whether the sum
paid exceeds the value given may be important in deciding if it was given as
consideration for any of the matters mentioned in s. 110(1). If a person is
given more than fair market value for his shares, it may lead to an inference
that something else is also being bought, and the something else may be within
s. 110.

Even if only fair market value is given,
however, the inquiry is not ended. Fair market value tends to be within a range
than a fixed value. If the person is given an amount at the upper end of the
range, it is appropriate to ask why. If the reason is to obtain an intervention
in the future by the person of the nature proscribed by s. 110, an illegal
benefit has been conferred.

It is also pertinent to look to the past to
determine what is being paid for when only fair market

[Page 459]

value is received. In the present case the worth
of the shares of Canadian Advertising, and hence Publicor, had been increased
between 1965 and 1967 because of contracts with the federal government. If obtaining
these contracts could be attributed to Giguère (and Labrosse J. made no finding
of fact on this point) payment for the shares could amount to payment for
Giguère’s intervention. Section 110, of course, creates mens rea offences;
what matters is whether the accused Giguère was to be paid for past
interventions.

The matters referred to in the two preceding
paragraphs require findings and inferences of fact, none of which was made by
the trial judge, because he thought the only issue was fair market value.

I said earlier that I was also of the opinion
Labrosse J. erred in his treatment of fair market value. He concluded his
discussion on that topic with the following:

The seller started at one hundred thousand
dollars ($100,000.00) and the buyers at fifty‑two thousand ($52,000.00).
Then taking into consideration the tax implications, they settled on
approximately seventy-nine thousand five hundred dollars ($79,500.00), of which
amount remaining shareholders were paying sixty-seven thousand dollars ($67,000.00)
as the balance would be paid as an expense of the agency.

In all the circumstances as they existed at
the time, I am satisfied that Giguère’s shares were not purchased at an
inflated price.

Labrosse J. decided that $79,500 was fair market
value, but that was not the selling price. I have great difficulty in agreeing
that illegal tax consequences can be taken into account in determining the
purchase price paid, but that is beside the point. The focus of s. 110 is the
government official or the person having or pretending to have influence. It is
that person’s integrity which is at issue and what matters is the amount that
person is supposed to receive. It is the value in the hands of the recipient,
not the cost to the donor, that counts. Giguère was supposed to receive
$92,000. The question in the present case is whether

[Page 460]

$92,000 was fair market value. The trial judge
made no finding of fact on this point.

I therefore conclude Labrosse J. made errors of
law in respect of “benefit… as consideration for” which caused him to fail to
make certain important findings of fact.

(ii) “Cooperation, assistance, exercise of
influence”

It is undisputed that “cooperation, assistance,
exercise of influence” are alternate modes of committing an offence under s.
110. An act or an omission of the nature contemplated in s. 110 are, of
course, other modes but with these we are not here concerned. Proof of one mode
is sufficient to constitute an offence. However, the counts on the indictment
in the present case all read “cooperation, assistance and the exercise
of influence”. The Crown conceded at trial that the word “and” was conjunctive,
and it was being alleged the agreement was in respect of all three.

During the course of his reasons Labrosse J.
said this:

On the wording of the indictment, the words
cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence must be taken
conjunctively. In my view, this is the strongest argument advanced by the
defence. There was no evidence from any of the numerous witnesses that Giguere
exercised influence in respect of the government contracts received by the
agency. I accept that exercise of influence would mean to affect a decision, or
do something that could affect the decision, but there was no evidence that any
decision to award a contract to the agency was affected by the intervention of
Giguere. The evidence was that he opened doors. There was evidence that he
arranged appointments to permit the representatives of the agency to make
presentations to government officials and in my view, this is not what is
contemplated by section 110 of the Code.

This passage contains three propositions of law:

[Page 461]

(1) opening doors or arranging meetings does not
constitute exercise of influence under s. 110;

(2) opening doors or arranging meetings does not
constitute cooperation or assistance under s. 110;

(3) the inclusion of “and” in the indictment
required the Crown to prove all three, “cooperation, assistance, exercise of
influence”, to obtain a conviction.

I think that Labrosse J. was right on the first
point, but in error on the latter two.

(a) Exercise of Influence

All parties in this case agree that “influence”
means to affect a decision. But what kind of decision? Respondents argue the
decision must be the actual decision to award a contract. The Crown argues that
a decision to hold a meeting is sufficient; opening doors and arranging
meetings is an exercise of influence under s. 110.

It must be noted the word “influence”
appears twice ins. 110(1)(d):

110. (1) …

(d) having or pretending to
have influence with the government or with a minister of the government
or an official, demands, accepts or offers or agrees to accept for himself or
another person a reward, advantage or benefit of any kind as consideration for
cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission in
connection with

(i) anything mentioned in subparagraph (a)(iii)
or (iv), or

(ii) the appointment of any person,
including himself, to an office;

(Emphasis added.)

Prima facie, the
word means the same thing in both places. I will deal firstly with the initial
appearance of the word. A person “having or pretending to have influence”
clearly includes persons outside government—that distinguishes s. 110(1)(d)from
s. 110(1)(a). If arranging a meet-

[Page 462]

ing is influence, a non-government person who
could do no more than arrange a meeting would fall within the ambit of s.
110(1)(d). If, for example, a lawyer arranged a meeting with a
government official as part of the services for which he was paid, he would
commit an offence under s. 110(1)(d).That cannot be correct. The
threshold which must be passed before falling foul of s. 110(1)(d) must
be higher.

The general purpose of s. 110 is to preserve the
integrity of government. Those connected with government are meant to carry on
the business of government without favours being bought by those who deal with
government. The focus of s. 110 is those who have a real connection with
government. Section 110(1)(a) maintains this focus by being limited
to “officials”, i.e. those who are actually part of government.
Section 110(1)(d), although including people outside government,
must be limited to those who have, or pretend to have, a significant nexus with
government. Someone outside government who has no more “clout” than to be able
to arrange a meeting with a government official has at best a tangential
connection with government. That is not the type of person whose actions s. 110
is trying to control. In my view, a person having influence with government is
a person who could affect, for example, a decision by government to award a
contract, and correspondingly a person who pretends to have influence is a
person who pretends he could affect such a government decision.

Having thus defined “influence” in the first line
of s. 110(1)(d), I think that “exercise of influence” in the rest
of s. 110, i.e. in both s. 110(1)(a) and (d), must
be defined accordingly. There is nothing in the context that would suggest the
word “influence” changes its meaning in different parts of the same section. I
therefore agree with the respondents as to the meaning of the words “exercise
of influence”. In the present case it would mean actually affecting the
awarding of an advertising contract to Canadian Advertising.

[Page 463]

(b) Cooperation, Assistance

Labrosse J. thought that cooperation and
assistance within s. 110(1)(a) and (d) were something less
than the exercise of influence—otherwise he would not have attributed any
significance to the “and” in the indictment. He also assumed, however, that
cooperation and assistance were something more than opening doors and arranging
meetings. This is not only apparent from the passage quoted above, but also
from Labrosse J.’s treatment of similar fact evidence, all of which he ruled
inadmissible. The Crown sought to adduce evidence that Giguère had been
employed by Kruger Pulp & Paper Limited to open doors of the federal
government. The evidence was held not to constitute similar fact evidence
because it was not evidence of anything criminal.

Labrosse J. appears to have adopted the argument
made by counsel for Giguère at trial that the words “cooperation, assistance”
must be read in the context of “exercise of influence”, and thus signify a
higher level of intervention than the ordinary meaning of the words would
convey. That argument was not pressed in this Court.

In my view, if someone opens doors or arranges
meetings as the first step in an effort by another to secure a government
contract, that is indeed assistance or cooperation in connection with the
transaction of business with government within s. 110(1)(a) and (d).
That is simply giving the words their ordinary meaning.

Labrosse J. took a contrary view on the basis
that opening doors or arranging meetings is something perfectly legitimate,
happening frequently. The error in this approach is in examining particular
elements of s. 110 in isolation. By itself, opening doors or arranging meetings
is certainly not a crime. The problem arises only when two conditions meet: (i)
when a benefit is given, offered or demanded for the opening of doors or
arranging of meetings respecting the matters listed in s. 110(1), and (ii) the
person who receives or demands it is an official or one having or pretending to
have influence in the sense defined earlier.

[Page 464]

In the previous section it was noted that,
as a threshold, s. 110(1) applies only in respect of persons having a close
connection with government. Once that threshold is passed, however, the
section imposes stringent limitations. It is clear that the right to
contract with government is not something to be bought with under-the-table
payments. It is equally clear, in my view, that access to government officials
is not something to be bought. Even if it is a seemingly modest intervention,
opening doors or arranging meetings is caught by s. 110(1)(a) and (d)
as constituting cooperation or assistance.

(c) The Form of the Indictment

If there had been an agreement that Giguère be
given a benefit as consideration for opening doors and arranging meetings, an
offence would have been committed. But would that be an offence under this
indictment, which charged “cooperation, assistance and the exercise of
influence”?

It should be noted at the outset there is no
problem of duplicity here. Counsel for the respondents did not argue duplicity
in the conspiracy counts, nor was it suggested that the counts would have been
duplicitous if the substantive offence had been charged instead of conspiracy.
Cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence are alternate modes of
committing an offence under s. 110(1)(a) or (d).

The Crown’s primary position at trial was that
there was an agreement for Giguère to do all three, that Giguère was actually
to get contracts for Canadian Advertising Agency. Labrosse J. rejected the Crown’s
primary position on the facts. The Crown’s alternate position was that there
was at least an agreement for Giguère to cooperate and assist. Labrosse J.
assumed the form of the indictment precluded a conviction on this basis. I
think he was in error on this point.

[Page 465]

In R. v. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Nos. 1 and
2) (1981), 33 O.R. (2d) 694 (C.A.), the indictment charged contravention of
the Combines Investigation Act in respect of sales of Librium and
Valium, but the trial judge found the evidence proved an offence only in
respect of Valium. In concluding that it was not necessary to amend the
indictment to enter a conviction, Martin J.A. drew an analogy to the cases of
theft or false pretences (p. 712). If an indictment charges theft of several items,
it is sufficient to prove theft of one to enter a conviction, and it is not
necessary to amend the indictment. The same applies to a charge of obtaining
money by false pretences or possession of stolen goods; Lake v. The Queen, [1969]
S.C.R. 9 (false pretences); R. v. Spot Supermarket Inc. (1979), 50
C.C.C. (2d) 239 (Que. C.A.) (theft); R. v. Kestenberg and McPherson (1959),
126 C.C.C. 387 (Ont. C.A.) (possession); this Court recently reaffirmed that
position in Lilly v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 94, although in
that case it was considered inappropriate to enter a conviction and a new trial
was ordered.

I agree with Martin J.A. that theft of lesser
amounts is no different in principle from committing an offence in one of the
two or more ways charged. A number of other Courts of Appeal adopted the view
that a conviction is warranted if the Crown proves at least one of the modes of
committing an offence charged: R. v. Graham (1954), 108 C.C.C. 153
(B.C.C.A.) (conspiracy to steal and receive and retain stolen
goods); R. v. Hundt (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 279 (Alta. S.C., A.D.)
(while not being a member of the Alberta Guild… and not being a holder
of a certificate of competence… and not supplying in accordance with…);R.
v. MacNeil (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 46 (Ont. C.A.) (failed or refused to
comply with demand… to provide… samples of breath… and to accompany a
peace officer for the purposes…); R. v. Simard (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d)
306

[Page 466]

(N.S.S.C., A.D.) (failed
to stop and give his name and render assistance); R.v. Roberts
(1980), 18 C.R. (3d) 191 (Ont. C.A.) (robbery using knife and
revolver).

I conclude that if Labrosse J. had thought the
Crown had proved a conspiracy to pay a benefit to Giguère in consideration for
cooperation and assistance, but not for the exercise of influence, a conviction
should have followed for the part proved. This is simply one example of the
general principle that an accused is liable for conviction on any part of the
indictment that constitutes an offence.

III The Trial Judge’s Findings of Fact

I have concluded Labrosse J. made a number of
errors of law concerning the elements of an offence under s. 110. Nevertheless,
the accused would be entitled to have their acquittals affirmed in this Court
if the trial judge had made sufficient findings of fact to support such a
verdict. Labrosse J. made a clear finding of fact that there was no agreement
that Giguère exercise influence. If he had also found no proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of any agreement to cooperate or assist, including opening
doors or arranging meetings, that would be sufficient to warrant an acquittal
despite the inadequate findings of fact concerning “benefit. as consideration
for”.

There is one finding in Labrosse J.’s judgment
which may, at first glance, seem to represent a holding of no proof of an
agreement to cooperate or assist: “I am not satisfied that anything Giguère
received was in consideration for something”. In the context, however, all
Labrosse J. seems to have been saying was that he found no benefit, about which
I have said he erred. The full passage from Labrosse J.’s judgment, part of
which was repro-

[Page 467]

duced earlier, is as follows:

I have already dealt with the argument of
the sale of Giguere’s shares at an inflated price in nineteen sixty-seven
(1967). I am not satisfied that he received any benefit other than what he was
entitled to for the value of his shares. That applies also to the benefit
referred to in Count two (2), which is part of the same money.

…

It follows from the above that I am not
satisfied that anything that Giguere received was in consideration for
something. But if I had found that a benefit had been accepted or given, it would have then been necessary that it be in consideration for
cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence. On the working of
the indictment, the words cooperation, assistance and the exercise of influence
must be taken conjunctively. In my view, this is the strongest argument
advanced by the defence. There was no evidence from any of the numerous
witnesses that Giguère exercised influence in respect of the government
contracts received by the agency. I accept that exercise of influence would
mean to affect a decision or do something that would affect the decision, but
there was no evidence that any decision to award a contract to the agency was
affected by the intervention of Giguere. The evidence was that he opened doors.
There was evidence that he arranged appointments to permit the representatives
of the agency to make presentations to government officials and in my view,
this is not what is contemplated by section 110 of the Code.

(Emphasis added.)

The Ontario Court of Appeal treated this only as
a negation of consideration under s. 110. I would not be prepared to conclude
on the basis of this passage alone that Labrosse J. found no proof of any
agreement that Giguère cooperate or assist.

At several places in his judgment Labrosse J.
said there was no agreement that Giguère provide “services”. He did not,
however, define what he meant by the word “services”. Nevertheless, the
ordinary meaning of the word is broad enough to include opening doors,
arranging meetings, or other forms of cooperation or assistance. There is
nothing in the judgment which would demonstrate conclusively that Labrosse J. was
using the word

[Page 468]

“services” to represent anything narrower than
its ordinary meaning. I therefore conclude that Labrosse J.’s findings of fact
were not only that the Crown had not proved an agreement that Giguère exercise
influence, but also that the Crown had not proved an agreement that Giguère
cooperate or assist, as defined earlier. Since proof of an agreement that
Giguère either exercise influence, or cooperate, or assist is an essential
ingredient of the offences charged, the accused are entitled to an acquittal
unless those findings of fact can somehow be challenged.

The Crown does attempt to challenge Labrosse
J.’s findings of fact on the basis that Labrosse J. misdirected himself on
issues of corroboration and circumstancial evidence. The alleged errors,
however, arise from what Labrosse J. did not say, not from what he did say. The
Crown asks us to infer error from the fact that the trial judge did not review
the law of corroboration or circumstancial evidence. I find nothing in Labrosse
J.’s judgment which would support the inference of misdirection in these
respects and I find no merit in the Crown’s argument. In my view Labrosse J.’s
findings of fact were ones open to him on the evidence, and ones which cannot
be interfered with on appeal.

In respect of Giguère only, the Crown alleged
that Labrosse J. had erred in failing to admit similar fact evidence. The
Ontario Court of Appeal agreed that Labrosse J. had erred on this point but
held, as the Crown had conceded, that this alone did not warrant a new trial.
The Crown again raised the similar fact point in this Court, but it is not
necessary to deal with it in light of the Crown’s concession before the Court
of Appeal.

I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 469]

The judgment of Mclntyre and Lamer JJ. was
delivered by

LAMER J.—The trial judge having accepted, as he
was entitled to do, the evidence of the respondents Dionne and Belhumeur that
there was no discussion nor agreement as to “future services”, and having
doubted the testimony of Crown witness Léon Simard on that point, the Court of
Appeal for Ontario committed no error of law in dismissing the appeal by
choosing not to interfere with the finding and to consider the word “services”
used by Labrosse J. as encompassing any activity contemplated under s. 110(1)(a)
of the Criminal Code.

The appeal to this Court from that decision
should therefore be dismissed.

The following are the reasons delivered by

WILSON J. (dissenting)—I am in respectful
agreement with the interpretation of s. 110 of the Criminal Code contained
in the reasons for judgment of my colleague, Mr. Justice Dickson.

However, the problem before the Court as I see
it is that the learned trial judge, because he misdirected himself as to the
constituent elements of the offence under s. 110 in the ways indicated by my
colleague, failed to make the relevant findings of fact. In particular, having
failed to appreciate that an agreement to open doors and arrange meetings in
return for a “benefit” could constitute cooperation or assistance within the
meaning of the section, he made no express finding as to whether such an
agreement existed or not. Instead he focussed his attention on whether there
was an agreement that Giguère would provide “services” by which he clearly
meant something well beyond the opening of doors and arranging of meetings i.e.
something which would constitute the offence on his interpretation of the
section. He found that there was no such agreement. I do not see, however, how
a finding of no agreement to go beyond the opening of doors and arranging of
meetings can be construed as a finding of no agreement to open doors or arrange
meetings.

[Page 470]

Accordingly, I must respectfully differ from my
learned colleague as to the proper disposition of the appeal. I would allow it
and order a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Narcotics—Importation—Meaning
of “import”—Places of offence—Whether importing a narcotic a continuing
offence—Whether the act of importing a narcotic terminates upon the narcotic
crossing the border into Canada—Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1,
s. 5—Customs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-40, s. 101(a) [am. 1974-75-76
(Can.), c. 5, s. 3].

Criminal law—Trial—Directed verdict at close
of Crown’s case—Defence not yet concluded at that stage—Whether trial judge
erred in directing verdict of acquittal before evidence completed.

Appellant was charged with importing
narcotics contrary to s. 5 of the Narcotic Control Act. The drug,
hidden in footstools shipped from Jamaica to appellant’s home address in St‑Hubert, P.Q., was found at Toronto International Airport by customs officers who notified
the R.C.M.P. The footstools were then shipped to Mirabel Airport and taken by R.C.M.P. officers to their headquarters where
most of the drug was removed from the footstools. A few days later, they
returned them to Mirabel where they were picked up by the appellant. At trial,
at the close of the Crown’s case, appellant’s counsel made a motion for a
directed verdict of acquittal. The trial judge did not accept appellant’s argument
that the act of importation had been completed in Toronto on entry of the
marijuana into the country, but he nevertheless granted the motion on the basis
that the R.C.M.P.’s intervention broke the chain of possession of the goods and
completed the act of importation before the goods were received by the
appellant. On appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal
and ordered a new trial. The Court held that the offence of importing a
narcotic was a continuing offence which was not completed until the appellant
received the goods.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 472]

Per Beetz,
Estey, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ.: The trial judge erred in directing a verdict
of acquittal. While moving for a directed verdict, appellant’s counsel
announced that a defence would be presented. The evidence therefore had not
been completed at that stage of the trial and it was not for the trial judge to
weigh the evidence and to himself reach a conclusion as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused. It was incumbent upon him to consider the evidence
then before him and decide whether or not there was evidence upon which a
properly-instructed jury could convict the appellant of importing. He did not
address that question as he wrongly decided that the temporary seizure of the
imported narcotics by the R.C.M.P. precluded the finding of importation by the
appellant. The R.C.M.P.’s intervention in the circumstances of this case was
irrelevant. The offence of importing a narcotic is not of a continuing nature.
The ordinary meaning of the word “import” in s. 5 of the Narcotic
Control Act makes the offence of importing complete upon the entry of the
goods in the country.

Per Dickson
J.: On an offence of importing, there is no reason to restrict the relevant
location within Canada to the
actual point of border crossing. The word “import” should not be stultified by
narrow interpretation. The elements of the offence are present as soon as the
goods cross the border but the offence is not over and done with until the
goods have reached their intended final destination within Canada. Accordingly, a charge could be laid
relating to the point of entry or of destination or anywhere in between. Here,
it was open to the Crown to charge importing at Toronto, Mirabel or at St-Hubert. Consequently, the trial judge erred in
directing a verdict of acquittal as there was evidence to go to the jury. The
R.C.M.P.’s temporary and lawful diversion of the narcotics did not terminate
the ongoing act of importing and was irrelevant in the circumstances of this
case.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of
Appeal (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 317, setting aside appellant’s acquittal on a
charge of importing narcotics contrary to s. 5 of the Narcotic Control
Act. Appeal dismissed.

Richard Perras, for the appellant.

Gérald La Haye, for the respondent.

The following are the reasons delivered by

DICKSON J.—Section 5 of the Narcotic Control
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, makes it a crime, punishable by imprisonment for
not less than seven years, to “import into Canada” any narcotic, except as
authorized by the Act or the regulations. The main question in this appeal is
whether the act of importing a narcotic terminates upon the narcotic crossing
the border into Canada or
whether the act of importing carries on until the narcotic reaches the intended
final destination within Canada.

I The Facts and Judicial History

Harris Bell was charged with importing a
narcotic, and two related charges. Only the importing charge is relevant to
this appeal. That count reads:

1. On or about April 18, 1979 at Mirabel,
District of Terrebonne, Harris BELL did unlawfully import into Canada a
narcotic to wit: 6.7 lbs. of Cannabis (marijuana), committing thereby an
indictable offence contrary to sections 5(1) and 5(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act. R.S.C. 1970.

The trial on the three counts was held, with a
jury, before Mr. Justice Bergeron of the Quebec Superior Court. At the end
of the Crown’s case defence counsel, while reserving his right to call
evidence, made a number of motions among which was a motion for a directed
verdict of acquittal on the importing charge.

For the purpose of dealing with the defence
motions, the trial judge gave the following summary of the Crown’s evidence:

On April 11 or 12, just a disparity of an
hour or two there, a shipment of four foot stools gift wrapped with birthday
paper originating from Jamaica and addressed

[Page 474]

to the accused’s name bearing a St-Hubert
P.Q. address first arrived in Toronto. A brief examination by customs disclosed
that the foot stools contained cannabis. The R.C.M.P. of a St-Jérôme
detatchment [sic], Québec near the point of arrival for
international flight of Mirabel, duly advised of the fact, obtained the goods
from customs, gave receipt and took them to their St-Jérôme headquarters. An
examination revealed the presence of six point seven pounds of marijuana in the
four stools.

Most of the substance was removed from
them, a small quantity being left in them before repacking the stools as well
as could be done and then taking them back on/or about April 18 to the customs
warehouse where instructions to advise …with instructions to advise the
R.C.M.P. as to anyone calling for their release. On the afternoon of
April 18, the accused presented himself to Air Canada’s counter to pay a
terminal fee of seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) owed on the waybill
relating to the shipment and to a custom’s counter to sign an entry form and
obtain a release.

He later proceeded to the Air Cargo building
to take possession of the four stools by taxi and drove to his house at
St-Hubert P.Q. under the constant surveillance of the R.C.M.P. He then took the
stools inside and came out of the house to join two other people who had seen [sic]
in a car following him from the issue of the Mirabel boulevard where it
joins the Laurentian Autoroute. Two more people also arrived, a man in a
Cadillac and a young girl, all these people black. The police rounded up the
whole group and immediately proceeded into the house using a writ of assistance
and found the four stools unwrapped and piled on a single bed in the back room.

Their wrapping paper was found partly on
the kitchen table, partly in the waste basket or garbage container and partly
on the floor. On the table was also present what appeared to be the structure
of a dismantled foot stool, it’s covering material removed. Another similar
structure was found outside the house, in the back of it, off a small gallery
and near a garbage bag or can. A scraping of the stool structure between the
post and the walls showed the presence of zero point six grams of marijuana.
Much more was filed as evidence regarded the procedure used in exporting from
Jamaica, waybills, releases et cetera, and procedure at counters and so on.

[Page 475]

The evidence revealed that the four footstools
had been shipped from Jamaica to Toronto and then to Mirabel bearing Air Canada
waybill no. 014-42419624, addressed to Mr. & Mrs. Harris Bell,
5615 Perlini Street, St-Hubert, Montreal.

The accused argued before Bergeron J. that,
since the goods came into Canada at Toronto, the importation was terminated in
Toronto, so that there was no evidence to go to the jury of importing at
Mirabel as charged. The trial judge did not accept the argument, holding that
importing may extend beyond the time and place of entry into Canada. Bergeron
J. nonetheless granted the motion for a directed verdict on the basis that the
police possession of the marijuana interrupted the necessary continuity of
possession of the accused. Upon the granting of the directed verdict on the
importing charge, the Crown elected not to proceed on the two other charges.

The Crown appealed the acquittal on the
importing charge. The Quebec Court of Appeal, speaking through Mr. Justice
Montgomery, Bernier and Monet JJ.A concurring, allowed the appeal and ordered a
new trial. Montgomery J.A. concluded the police possession was irrelevant to
the charge of importing and that importing was a continuing offence which was
not completed until the accused took delivery of the goods consigned to him.

Harris Bell appeals to this Court as of right
under s. 618(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.

II When Is Importing Terminated?

The Narcotic Control Act contains no
definition of importing. The appellant argues, as he did before Bergeron J.,
that importing is terminated as soon as the goods cross the border into Canada.
In the present case it is contended that any importing was finished on April 11
or 12 in Toronto. In support of this submission, reliance is placed in

[Page 476]

part on s. 101(a) of the Customs
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-40 (am. 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 5, s. 3).

101. For the
purpose of the levying of any duty, or for any other purpose of this Act or any
other law relating to the customs,

(a) the importation of any
goods, if made by sea, coastwise or by inland navigation, in any vessel, shall
be deemed to have been completed from the time such goods were brought within
Canadian waters, and if made by land, then from the time such goods were
brought within the limits of Canada;

It is contended that this provision is
incorporated into the Narcotic Control Act by virtue of s. 14 of
the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23:

14. (1)
Definitions or rules of interpretation contained in an enactment apply to the
construction of the provisions of the enactment that contain those definitions
or rules of interpretation, as well as the other provisions of the enactment.

(2) Where an enactment contains an
interpretation section or provision, it shall be read and construed

(a) as being applicable only
if the contrary intention does not appear, and

(b) as being applicable to
all other enactments relating to the same subject-matter unless the contrary
intention appears.

(Emphasis added.)

In my view s. 101(a) of the Customs Act has
no application. It is concerned with the levying of duty, or for any other
purpose of the Customs Act or any other law relating to customs. The Narcotic
Control Act is concerned with the health and welfare of mankind and the
serious social and economic evil of non-medical use of narcotics. The two Acts
are unrelated and the Interpretation Act does not provide a nexus. Even
if s. 101(a) of the Customs Act were considered to apply, it
would not, in my view, settle the point. Section 101(a) would establish
an importing into Toronto, but it would not preclude a finding that there was
also importing into Mirabel, as charged. Section 101(a) does not purport
to be an exhaustive definition. The true meaning of the phrase “import into
Canada”, as used in the Narcotic Control Act,

[Page 477]

cannot be found by recourse to the Customs
Act. It is manifestly necessary to look at the natural and ordinary meaning
of the phrase.

Bruce A. MacFarlane, the author of Drug
Offences in Canada (1979) observes, at p. 231 of his work, that Courts
have generally held there is no ambiguity or equivocation in the phrase “import
into Canada” as used in the Narcotic Control Act and that it should be
given its ordinary and natural meaning.

The ordinary meaning of the word “import”,
according to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, is “to bring in
(goods or merchandise) from a foreign country”. Le
Petit Robert, Dictionnaire alphabétique et
analogique de la langue française, 1976, defines thus the word importer:

Importer 1°
Introduire sur le territoire national (des produits en provenance de pays
étrangers). La France importe du café, du coton. 2° Importer
de la main-d’œuvre, un brevet de fabrication… Ant.
Exporter.

To import into Canada means to bring in goods
from anywhere outside Canada to anywhere inside Canada. I see no reason in
principle or precedent to restrict the relevant location within Canada to the
actual point of border crossing. The word “import” should not be stultified by
narrow interpretation. Importing is a process which, although it necessarily
includes the act of crossing the border, extends to the point of intended final
destination. In my view the test is whether there is a direct link between the
place of origin outside Canada and the destination inside Canada. Where goods
are mailed from Jamaica to St-Hubert, the nexus between Jamaica and St-Hubert
is obvious. If goods come from Jamaica via Toronto and Mirabel to St‑Hubert
they have come from Jamaica outside Canada to Mirabel inside Canada. They have
been imported to Mirabel. It is true that they have also come from Jamaica
outside Canada to Toronto inside Canada, and from Jamaica outside Canada to
St-Hubert inside Canada, so that there is also importing to Toronto and to
St-Hubert. This multiplicity does not, however, raise any

[Page 478]

problem for an accused because this Court’s
decision in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 would ensure
against multiple convictions.

The above analysis is consistent with the
authorities. The appellant has not referred the Court to any decision in which
it was held that importing did not extend beyond the time and place of actual
border crossing. The cases which discuss this point all go the other way. It is
sufficient to refer to three of them.

In R. v. Hijazi (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d)
183 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada dismissed November
12, 1974, [1974] S.C.R. ix) the accused picked up some narcotics from customs.
It was argued by the accused that the actus reus was subsequent to
importing because his call at the customs warehouse was after the landing of
the goods in Canada. The Ontario Court of Appeal disagreed, saying at
p. 184:

In our opinion, the importation process is
not to be so narrowly construed. It extends to the point where delivery is
taken from the bonded warehouse by or on behalf of the person claiming the
goods.

With respect, I agree. Hijazi was found guilty
on the basis that he was at least an aider or abettor to the offence of
importing and therefore criminally liable under s. 21(1) of the Criminal
Code. In my view this was a proper analysis. Section 21(1) reads:

21. (1)
Every one is a party to an offence who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in
committing it.

To “actually commit” importing, an accused must
bring in, or cause to be brought in, to Canada, goods from a foreign country;
this, by definition, necessitates crossing the Canadian border. Some-

[Page 479]

one who becomes involved only after the border
crossing, however, may be aiding and abetting a person bringing the goods from
outside Canada to a given destination inside Canada. In Hijazi the final
destination within Canada intended by the importer was clearly not the customs
warehouse. The importing was unfinished until after the narcotics had cleared
customs.

Re Whynott and The Queen (1974), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 433 (N.S.S.C.,T.D.), is not unlike the case
at bar. Hashish was concealed in a guitar case which went from Amsterdam
through Toronto to Halifax. The accused was charged with unlawfully importing a
narcotic at or near Enfield in the County of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The basis of
the application before the court was that there was no evidence that any
offence took place in the Province of Nova Scotia. The facts are given the
judgment of Chief Justice Cowan of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Trial
Division, at p. 440:

The evidence in the case before me
indicates that the applicant, Whynott, had arranged with the shipper, Thompson,
for the sending of the guitar and of the narcotic contained in it, from
Amsterdam to Kentville, Nova Scotia. The goods were destined for Kentville,
Nova Scotia, and the mere fact that the aircraft carrying them entered Canada
at some place unknown, or that it actually landed at Montreal or at Toronto, in
a Province other than Nova Scotia, is not conclusive on the question of the
place of importation. In accordance with the instructions of the sender of the
goods and the intention of the intended recipient, the goods were not held and
did not come to rest in the customs warehouse at Toronto. The goods were
transferred by KLM to Air Canada, and were brought to Nova Scotia. They then
rested briefly in the International Airport at Halifax, in the custody of Air
Canada, and were then taken to the sufferance warehouse at New Minas, near
Kentville, Nova Scotia. It is true that the actual transportation from Halifax
International Airport to the sufferance warehouse at New Minas was by police
officers, but the goods in question were still under the control of customs
officials who had delivered possession to the police for a

[Page 480]

certain restricted purpose.

The Chief Justice concluded:

In my opinion, there was evidence before
the committing Judge that an offence of importing into Canada a narcotic had
been committed and that this offence had been committed in the Province of Nova
Scotia.

He refused the motion in the nature of certiorari
to quash the committal. Whynott was later tried and convicted.

The Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme
Court ((1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 321) upheld the accused’s conviction for
importing into Enfield. The hashish was imported into Enfield since Enfield was
the home of the accused and the ultimate destination within Canada. Coffin
J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court quoted with approval from the
reasons of O’Meara J.S.P. in R. v. Geesman (1970), 13 C.R.N.S. 240, at
p. 254:

There may be other cases where, beneath the
scrutiny of other laws, a more technical or special sense may be given to the
word “import”; however, in the case at bar, the ordinary, grammatical and plain
meaning of the words far better comports with the object to be attained. The
unique object of the enactment in question, in respect of the evil against
which it is directed, is the suppression of illicit importation into and
exportation from Canada of narcotics.

In my considered opinion, to ascribe to the
words “import into Canada” that narrow and uniquely specialized meaning for
which defence counsel contended, would be utterly to emasculate the enactment,
to defeat its object, to promote the evil against which it is aimed and
thoroughly to misapprehend the intent of Parliament.

In R. v. Tanney (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d)
445 (Ont. C.A.) the accused became involved in a scheme after the hashish was
already in Canada, in bond in Toronto, pending arrangements to ship it to the
United States. Tanney was enlisted to accomplish this end. On appeal, an
acquittal was

[Page 481]

entered on the charge of importing. Evans J.A.,
speaking for the court, said this, at p. 450:

After reviewing the evidence, I am
satisfied that the Crown has not conclusively established with that degree of
certitude necessary in a criminal case that the involvement of the appellant
constituted acts in furtherance of a scheme to import the drugs into Canada.
The drugs were already in bond in Canada when the appellant became involved and
what he did was to order their transhipment to New York. While his conduct
might be culpable it does not constitute the offence charged against him.

In the circumstances of that case, the final
destination within Canada intended by the importer was the customs warehouse in
Toronto. The importing was finished before Tanney did anything and in my view
Tanney was properly acquitted.

The elements of an offence of importing are
present as soon as the goods cross the border, but the offence is not over and
done with until the goods have reached their intended final destination within
Canada. Accordingly, a charge could be laid relating to the point of entry or
of destination or anywhere in between. In this case there was evidence that the
intended and actual destination within Canada was St-Hubert, but there were
stops along the way at Toronto and Mirabel. In my view it was open to the Crown
to charge importing at Toronto or at Mirabel or at St-Hubert.

A number of judgments have referred to the crime
of importing narcotics as a “continuing offence”, defined in Black’s Law
Dictionary, 5th ed., as a “type of crime which is committed over a span of
time as, for example, a conspiracy” and as a “transaction or a series of acts
set on foot by a single impulse, and operated by an unintermittent force, no
matter how long a time it may occupy”. Words and Phrases (Permanent
Edition, vol. 9) defines a continuing offence as, inter alia, a “breach
of criminal law, not terminated by single act or fact, but subsisting for
definite period and intended to cover or apply to successive similar

[Page 482]

obligations or occurrences”. Whether the
importation of narcotics falls within the ambit of these definitions, or any of
them, may be open to debate. In my opinion, however, nothing turns on the
definitional niceties. So far as the outcome of this appeal is concerned, it is
of no consequence whether the importation of narcotics is or is not regarded as
a continuing offence.

III The Effect of Police Possession

As I have mentioned, the trial judge directed a
verdict of acquittal on the ground that continuity of possession had been
interrupted by removal by the police of the footstools to St‑Jérôme. I
agree with the Court of Appeal that the police possession was irrelevant. The
temporary and lawful diversion of the narcotics to the R.C.M.P. detachment at
St-Jérôme, for the purpose of testing, could not be said to have terminated the
ongoing act of importing. I agree with what was said by Cowan C.J.T.D. in Whynott
that the goods in question were “still under the control of customs
officials who had delivered possession to the police for a certain restricted
purpose”. I find no merit in the appellant’s argument on the interruption of
possession which found favour at trial.

IV Conclusion

I conclude there was evidence to go to the jury
that Harris Bell had imported marijuana into Mirabel on April 18, 1979 and that
the trial judge erred in directing a verdict of acquittal. The appeal should be
dismissed. I would confirm the order of the Court of Appeal of Quebec ordering
a new trial.

The judgment of Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and
Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal is taken against the
finding by the Quebec Court of Appeal that the acquittal of the accused upon a
charge of importing a narcotic into Canada should be set aside and that a new
trial should be ordered. The appellant

[Page 483]

was charged in an indictment, dated October 9,
1979, with three counts. The first count was in these terms:

1. On or about April 18, 1979 at Mirabel,
District of Terrebonne, Harris BELL did unlawfully import into Canada a
narcotic to wit: 6.7 lbs. of Cannabis (marijuana), committing thereby an
indictable offence contrary to sections 5(1) and 5(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970.

The second and third counts charged,
respectively, possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking at
Mirabel, and, simple possession at St-Hubert.

On April 9, 1979 four parcels, each containing a
footstool, were shipped by Air Canada from Jamaica to Canada. The parcels were
consigned to the appellant at his home address in St‑Hubert, Quebec. On
April 10 or 11, 1979 the parcels arrived at Toronto International Airport. Upon
inspection by customs officers it was found that some 6.7 lbs. of cannabis (marijuana)
were secreted in the footstools. The R.C.M.P. were notified and upon their
instructions the parcels were shipped on to their designated destination at
Mirabel Airport in Quebec. On April 12, 1979 the R.C.M.P. took the footstools
from Mirabel to their headquarters at St-Jérôme, Quebec. On April 17 they took
apart the footstools and removed most of the marijuana, leaving only five grams
in one of the footstools. They then reassembled and re-packaged the footstools.
On April 18, having been informed that inquiries had been made at Mirabel
regarding the parcels, the R.C.M.P. returned them to the airport. There the
appellant received the parcels, paid the freight charges, and took the parcels
to his home at St-Hubert, Quebec. He was followed by the R.C.M.P. and was
arrested there. A search of his house revealed a piece of paper near the
telephone on which was written a number which corresponded to the number of the
Air Canada way-bill covering the shipment to Canada and an address in Jamaica.
The way-bill, in addition to showing the address of the appellant as the
recipient and giving the address of a sender in Jamaica, described the
footstools as a gift.

[Page 484]

The appellant was tried before a judge of the
Superior Court of Quebec for the District of Terrebonne sitting with a jury. At
the close of the Crown’s case, counsel for the defence announced that a defence
would be presented but asked that the jury be excused. In the absence of the
jury, defence counsel made a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. This
motion was granted and the jury acquitted the appellant in response to the
judge’s direction. The trial judge in his reasons for the directed verdict
rejected the defence submission that the act of importation had been completed
in Toronto on entry of the marijuana into the country. He seems to have
accepted the view expressed in several cases, which will be referred to later,
that the offence of importing a narcotic is of a continuing nature and could
have extended in this case up to the receipt of the goods at Mirabel after they
had been released from Customs. He considered, however, that the act of the
R.C.M.P. in taking the marijuana out of Customs and returning the parcels after
removing most of the marijuana broke the chain of possession of the goods and
completed the act of importation before the goods were received by the
appellant. He said in his reasons:

The last opinion as to the interpretation
of the word “import” is one which this Tribunal shares. What troubles the Court
however is the juridical consequence of the intervention of the R.C.M.P. by
their removal from customs of the goods from bond, against simple receipt to
customs. By this intervention they deprive the customs who have the final say
on import goods in their eventual release to consignee of the element of
control necessary to establish the continuity of possession until they are
released to the accused, breaking the necessary link which is needed to tie
him, to the commission of the infraction of importing as per the definition
retained by this Court.

However necessary it may have been to
secure evidence or even to avoid the risk of the narcotics finding their way on
the streets, a main quantity could have been extracted from the stools without
the goods leaving the customs warehouse and the customs control. This was not
done, with the consequence that the importation was completed as to the time of
removal by the R.C.M.P. from the customs warehouse and by their own possession
of the goods after their entry into Canada.

[Page 485]

From the evidence adduced on this very
point it cannot be offered to the jury that there is evidence for the jury to
weigh as regards the first count of importing. A verdict shall therefore be
directed as to the first count.

The Crown elected not to proceed with the other
two counts.

The Crown’s appeal was allowed. Montgomery J.A.,
speaking for the court, adopted the view that importation is a continuing
offence and that in this case it would have extended up to the time the goods
were released from custody at Mirabel into the possession of the appellant. In
allowing the Crown’s appeal and ordering a new trial, he accepted as decisive
the reasoning in R. v. Hijazi (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 183 (Ont. C.A.) and
R. v. Whynott (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 321 (N.S.C.A.), in holding that the
offence of importing a narcotic is a continuing offence which is not completed
until the appellant receives the goods. He said:

The trial judge appears to have
distinguished the Hijazi and Whynott cases on the ground that the
R.C.M.P had removed the footstools containing the narcotics from the control of
the customs authorities, thereby completing the importation. With the utmost
respect, I cannot see the significance of this. In my opinion, the importation
was a continuing offence, which was not completed until respondent took
delivery of the goods consigned to him. What happened between their first
arrival in Canada and this delivery I regard as irrelevant, and I cannot agree
that the R.C.M.P. should have examined the footstools without removing them
from the customs warehouse.

The court considered the fact that for a time
the R.C.M.P. had removed the parcels from the custody of the customs
authorities to be irrelevant. This appeal is as of right, pursuant to
s. 618(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.

In this Court the appellant argued that the act
of importation was complete upon the entry of the parcels into Canada on April
10 or 11, 1979, dates which in my opinion fall within the words in the
indictment, “on or about April 18, 1979”. There was, therefore, no involvement
with the appellant

[Page 486]

at the place where the importation occurred or
on the date specified. It was also argued that the offence, if one was
committed, occurred in Toronto and not within the jurisdiction of the Quebec
Superior Court and, as no timely motion to amend the indictment had been made
by the Crown, that the appellant was entitled to an acquittal. The respondent
argued that the Court of Appeal had not found, nor did the evidence reveal,
that the whole offence was committed into Ontario and that any interruption in
possession occasioned by the intervention of the R.C.M.P. was irrelevant. In
this the respondent was supporting the idea that importation is a continuing
offence.

The characterization of importing a narcotic as
a continuing offence has appeared in several cases. In R. v. Whynott, supra,
hashish concealed in a guitar case entered Canada at Toronto on an aircraft
from Holland. It was then shipped to Nova Scotia where it was picked up by the
accused from Canadian customs officers and taken to his home. He was arrested
by the R.C.M.P. at his home with the narcotic in his possession after having
removed it from the guitar. He was convicted of importing and his appeal to the
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal was dismissed. The court had to decide whether or
not the courts of Nova Scotia had jurisdiction to try the offence in light of
s. 434(1) of the Criminal Code, which reads in part:

…nothing in this Act authorizes a court in
a province to try an offence committed entirely in another province.

After a review of several cases, Coffin J.A.,
speaking for the court (Coffin, Cooper and Macdonald JJ.A.) held, at
p. 340, that the offence was a continuing offence that actually occurred
when the appellant took the material out of the guitar at his home in Nova
Scotia. It was said that when he did this he provided clear evidence that he had
knowledge of the contents and hence a mens rea. It will be observed that
effect was given to the description of the offence as a ‘continuing’ one by
determining that it occurred when the goods were removed from the guitar
several days after their entry into

[Page 487]

Canada. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal dealt
with this question again in R. v. Salvador (1981), 21 C.R. (3d) 1. In
that case a yacht entered port in Nova Scotia with a cargo of some eight tons
of marijuana. On a charge of importing, the accused argued that the ship had
been forced by bad weather to enter Canadian waters and seek refuge, its real
destination being the United States. The entry was therefore not voluntary and
therefore not criminal. The court rejected this defence and upheld the
conviction. In dealing with this defence, the court considered that the entry
of the yacht into Canada was voluntary and that the voluntary bringing into the
country of narcotics constituted the crime of importation. MacKeigan C.J.N.S.
held that the trial judge had correctly instructed the jury that importation
was the act of knowingly bringing a forbidden narcotic into the country and
quoted from the trial judge’s charge to the jury, at pp. 5-6: “As well, the
moving of it within Canada after having brought it in may be the continuing
offence of importing. You may import not only merely as you enter but if you
continue with it after your entry.” Macdonald J.A. reached the same conclusion.
He was of the view that the authorities supported the proposition that
importing is a continuing offence and he referred with approval to R. v.
Hijazi, supra, and the words of Schroeder J.A., where he said, at pp.
184-85, after holding that the acts of importation could extend to the point
where the goods were released from customs:

Taking a view of the evidence most highly
favourable to the accused it may be said that it was established on the
evidence that the goods were in Canada before any overt act or acts on his part
became evident; and his culpability must be founded upon his conduct in
securing the release and delivery of the goods from the bonded warehouse. In
our view, that conduct was sufficient to make him a participant in the
commission of the offence charged through the operation of the provisions of
s. 21(1)of the Code.

[Page 488]

Other cases concerning this question which were
considered in Salvador include R. v. Geesman (1970), 13 C.R.N.S.
240 (Que. S.P.); R. v. Martin (1973), 21 C.R.N.S. 149 (Ont. S.C.).

It can be seen that there is judicial support
for the Crown’s contention in the case at bar that the ‘continuing offence’
principle could be used to justify the conviction of the appellant. It
therefore becomes necessary to consider what a continuing offence is and
whether importing can be classed as one.

A continuing offence is not simply an offence
which takes or may take a long time to commit. It may be described as an
offence where the conjunction of the actus reus and the mens rea, which
makes the offence complete, does not, as well, terminate the offence. The
conjunction of the two essential elements for the commission of the offence
continues and the accused remains in what might be described as a state of
criminality while the offence continues. Murder is not a continuing offence.
When the requisite intent to kill is present the crime is complete when the
killing is effected. Conspiracy to commit murder could be a continuing offence.
The actus reus and mens rea are present when the unlawful
agreement is made and continue until the killing occurs or the conspiracy is
abandoned. Whatever the length of time involved, the conspirators remain in the
act of commission of a truly continuing offence. Theft is not a continuing
offence. It is terminated when the wrongful taking has occurred with the
requisite intention. On the other hand, possession of goods knowing them to
have been obtained by the commission of theft is a continuing offence. The
offence of kidnapping would not be a continuing offence, but that of wrongful
detention of the victim following the kidnapping would be.

It is apparent, in my view, that importing a
narcotic cannot be a continuing offence. I do not find it necessary to make
extensive reference to dictionaries in order to define the word “import”. In my
view, since the Narcotic Control Act does not give a special definition
of the word, its ordi-

[Page 489]

nary meaning should apply and that ordinary
meaning is simply to bring into the country or to cause to be brought into the
country. With the utmost respect for judges who have taken a different view, I
am of the opinion that the characterization of importing a narcotic as a
continuing offence is misconceived. The offence is complete when the goods
enter the country. Thereafter the possessor or owner may be guilty of other
offences, such as possession, possession for the purpose of trafficking, or
even trafficking itself, but the offence of importing has been completed and
the importer in keeping or disposing of the drug has embarked on a new criminal
venture.

In some of the cases which have been referred to
above, it has been said that to limit the act of importing to simple entry of
the goods into the country is to adopt too strict an approach. The concept of a
continuing offence, it seems to me, has been adopted in these cases to extend the
reach of s. 5 of the Narcotic Control Act, to encompass conduct
which cannot really be classed as importing. It has been considered that this
approach is justified in order to give full effect to the purpose of the Act
which in this respect is to control and suppress the social evils resulting
from the importation of narcotics into the country and the adoption of a narrow
construction of the word “import” would be to defeat that purpose. In my view,
the construction I have placed on the word is not a narrow one. It is merely
the normal or ordinary one, and one which has been adopted in some of the
earlier cases: see Pennell J. in R. v. Martin and O’Meara J.S.P. in Geesman.

I do not consider that there is merit in the
suggestion that the application of this view makes a conviction on an importing
charge a virtual impossibility and thereby frustrates the clearly expressed
intention of Parliament. To convict of importing, it is not necessary to show
that the accused actually carried the goods into the country. Neither is it
necessary to show that the accused was present at the point of entry. It is
quite possible for ‘A’ while at town ‘X’ to make all the arrangements and
perform all the acts required

[Page 490]

to import illicit goods at town ‘Y’. Indeed in
ordinary commerce, merchants in, say, Vancouver import goods through eastern
Canadian ports on a regular basis without ever visiting the port of entry. The
same principle can be applied in criminal cases and criminal acts performed in
one province can render the actor liable to prosecution in another province and
subject to the jurisdiction of that other province. In R. v. W. McKenzie
Securities Ltd., [1966] 4 C.C.C. 29, stock promoters in Ontario, who were
not licensed under The Securities Act of Manitoba, solicited by mail and
telephone the purchase of shares in Manitoba without ever being in Manitoba.
They were convicted in Manitoba of an infraction of the Manitoba Securities
Act. Their appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal was dismissed. Freedman
J.A. (as he then was), in giving judgment for the court, said at p. 37:

The issue as to whether the activities of
the accused constituted a violation of the Securities Act of Manitoba
falls to be decided solely on what occurred within this Province. That they
were registered to trade in securities in Ontario would only be relevant if
they were faced with a charge of violating the corresponding statute of that
Province. It is an irrelevant circumstance in the present prosecution. The sole
point to be determined is whether the accused Dubros and the accused West, both
of whom were unlicenced here, traded in securities in Manitoba. That they did
not physically enter the borders of the Province is not conclusive of the
matter. A person may, from outside the borders of a Province, do certain acts
within the Province so as to make himself liable to the provisions of this
statute. Williamson, Securities Regulation in Canada (University of
Toronto Press, 1960), at p. 204 says:

“There seems to be no reason why a person
cannot become subject to a licensing statute of a province without ever
entering the province, constitutional questions aside.”

Although offences are local, the nature of
some offences is such that they can properly be described as occurring in more
than one place. This is peculiarly the case where a transaction is carried on
by mail from one

[Page 491]

territorial jurisdiction to another, or
indeed by telephone from one such jurisdiction to another. This has been
recognized by the common law for centuries. Thus, where a threatening letter
was written and posted in London, and delivered in Middlesex, it was held by
the Court that the writer could properly be tried in Middlesex: R. v.
Girdwood (1776), 1 Leach 142, 168 E.R. 173 (C.A.). Vide also R.
v. Esser (1767), 2 East P.C. 1125.

To similar effect is Re Bennett and Schuette
v. The Queen (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 61. In that case, involving charges
under s. 340 of the Criminal Code, the placing of an order with a
Vancouver broker which was passed on to a Calgary broker for entry in the
Calgary stock exchange (which entry constituted the offence) was held to be
sufficient to constitute the commission of the offence in British Columbia and
give jurisdiction to the British Columbia courts.

The principle expressed in McKenzie
Securities and Re Bennett and Schuette is peculiarly applicable to
the case at bar. The Narcotic Control Act forbids the importation of
narcotics into Canada. The offence of importation may be committed anywhere in
Canada and one offence may occur in whole or in part at more than one location
in Canada. As in the case of the honest merchant, the drug importer may from
one part of Canada make all the arrangements and do all the acts necessary to
bring about the importation of narcotics at another point. In so doing, it may
be said he has committed an offence which has occurred at two places, or
commenced in one jurisdiction and completed in another. Either the courts of
the jurisdiction where the goods entered the country or those of the province
where the acts or arrangement leading to the importation occurred will have
jurisdiction to deal with the case: see s. 432(b) of the Criminal
Code. The intervention of the R.C.M.P. in the circumstances of the present
case is, I agree, irrelevant.

It will be recalled that at the close of the
Crown’s case the appellant, while moving for a directed verdict, announced that
a defence would be presented. The evidence therefore had not been completed at
that stage of the trial and it was not

[Page 492]

for the trial judge to weigh the evidence and to
himself reach a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. It was
the task of the trial judge to consider the evidence then before him and to
decide whether there was evidence upon which a properly-instructed jury could
convict the appellant of importing marijuana as alleged in the indictment: see R.
v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R. 172. Because of an error in law, that is, a
finding that the temporary seizure of the imported narcotics by the R.C.M.P.
precluded the finding of importation by the appellant, the trial judge did not
address that question. He was therefore in error in directing a verdict of
acquittal.

For the above reasons it is my opinion that the
appeal must fail and the order of the Court of Appeal for a new trial must be
affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Crown immunity—Combines investigation—Crown
corporations charged with conspiracy to lessen competition—Whether corporations
entitled to Crown immunity—Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23, s.
32(1)(c) [rep. & sub. 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 76, s. 14]—Interpretation Act,

The respondents were charged under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act of conspiring with others to unduly lessen competition in
the production or sale of uranium products in Canada. They applied to the
Supreme Court of Ontario for an order prohibiting the Provincial Court from
proceeding to inquire into the charges on the basis that the Provincial Court
lacked jurisdiction to proceed because they were agents of the Crown and
therefore the Combines Investigation Act did not apply. The Supreme
Court granted the applications and the Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
This appeal is to determine whether respondents are immune from criminal
liability under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act
because they are agents of the Crown.

[Page 552]

Held (Mclntyre and Wilson JJ. dissenting in part): The
appeals should be dismissed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz and
Chouinard JJ.: The Combines Investigation Act is not binding on the
Crown. Section 16 of the Interpretation Act makes it clear that the
Crown is immune unless expressly bound. There is no section in the Combines
Investigation Act or the Interpretation Act which makes the Act
applicable to Her Majesty. The effect of Crown immunity is not that the Crown
is immune from prosecution even though there has been an unlawful act, rather,
there is no unlawful act under the statute because the statute does not apply
to the Crown. Crown immunity extends to agents and servants because the Crown
only acts through agents and servants. The respondents are each by statute “for
all its purposes an agent of Her Majesty”. A Crown agent is only entitled to
immunity when it acts within the scope of the public purposes it is statutorily
empowered to pursue. Prima facie, the conduct complained of was within
the scope of Crown purposes, for which the companies were incorporated—namely,
to implement national policy relating to atomic energy in all its aspects. No
evidence was presented or alluded indicating that the companies acted outside
corporate objects for other than Crown purposes. Accordingly, there is no merit
in the appellant’s submission that the prohibition orders were premature.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz and
Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question is whether respondents, Uranium Canada
Limited (“Uranium Canada”) and Eldorado Nuclear Limited (“Eldorado”), are
immune from criminal liability under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23, because they are agents of the
Crown.

I The Proceedings to Date

By informations sworn July 4 and July 7, 1981 by Orest R. Sametz,
Combines Investigation Officer, the respondents and others were charged with
having conspired, combined, agreed or arranged together and with another to
prevent or lessen, unduly, competition in the production, manufacture,
purchase, sale or supply in Canada of uranium, uranium oxide and other uranium
substances, contrary to s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act.
A summons was issued to each of the respondent Companies. Each appeared before
Judge Rice of the Ontario Provincial Court (Criminal Division). Tentative dates
were set for a preliminary inquiry. Before the commencement of the inquiry,
each Company applied to the Supreme Court of Ontario for an order prohibiting
Judge Rice or any other judge from proceeding to inquire into the charges. It
was contended that the Provincial Court lacked jurisdiction to proceed because

[Page 554]

they were agents of the Crown and therefore the Combines
Investigation Act did not apply.

Although Uranium Canada and Eldorado were charged in separate
informations, the two prohibition applications were heard together, by
agreement. Notwithstanding certain differences in the legal origins of the two
Companies, the two cases raise similar issues, and it is convenient to deal
with both in a single judgment.

The prohibition applications were successful in the court of
first instance. Mr. Justice J. Holland found that under the express terms
of their governing statutes neither Company could act other than as an agent of
the Crown, and, since the Combines Investigation Act did not bind Her
Majesty, either expressly or by necessary implication, the conduct complained
of in the charges could not be characterized as criminal. There was accordingly
no foundation upon which the charges could be validly laid or prosecuted.

In an oral judgment the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the
prohibition orders. Cory J.A., Houlden and Thorson JJ.A. concurring, concluded:

(i) the Combines Investigation Act does not apply to the
Crown because of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23;

(ii) by virtue of the statutes under which Uranium Canada and
Eldorado are constituted, each Company is an agent of Her Majesty for all its purposes,
and may act in no other capacity than as agent of the Crown;

(iii) the two Companies are authorized by their respective
corporate objects clauses and relevant legislation to perform the acts
complained of in the charges against them; and

[Page 555]

(iv) in carrying out such corporate purposes Uranium Canada and
Eldorado are entitled to the same immunity from prosecution as the sovereign.

The Court of Appeal took this further point. Both the preamble
and the specific provisions of the Atomic Energy Control Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. A-19, emphasize it is in the national interest to control and
supervise atomic energy. The specific provisions of the Act should therefore
prevail over the general provisions of the Combines Investigation Act.
It followed that the Combines Investigation Act does not apply to the
two Companies.

The appeal to this Court by the Attorney General of Canada is
based on the submission that the Combines Investigation Act is binding
on the Crown; in the alternative, that even if the Combines Investigation
Act does not bind the Crown, Uranium Canada and Eldorado cannot claim Crown
immunity for the following reasons:

(i) Nothing in the corporate objects of either Company, nor in
the statutory provisions governing the Companies’ corporate existence, nor in
the Atomic Energy Control Act itself, authorizes either Company to
conspire, combine or agree to lessen unduly competition in the production,
manufacture, purchase, sale or supply of uranium.

(ii) Although breaches of the Combines Investigation Act
are not authorized by either Company’s corporate objects, nevertheless both
Companies have the capacity, as opposed to the legal power, to commit criminal
acts for which they may be held responsible.

(iii) By statute each Company is “for all its purposes” an agent
of the Crown, but the words “its purposes” should be construed as meaning lawful
purposes, such that the Companies will be agents of Her Majesty only when
carrying out corporate purposes and exercising corporate powers in a lawful
manner.

(iv) Uranium Canada and Eldorado are entitled to Crown immunity
only when acting within

[Page 556]

their authority in furtherance of Crown purposes.

(v) There was no evidence before the Court of Appeal upon which
to base a finding that Uranium Canada and Eldorado had not exceeded their
respective corporative authorities. It is implicit in the fact that the
information charges an offence contrary to s. 32(1) of the Combines
Investigation Act that the Attorney General takes the position that the
accused were not authorized to do the acts constituting the offence. Whether
the accused exceeded authority is a factual matter to be determined from
evidence which the Attorney General will lead in proof of the charge. Hence the
prohibition orders were premature.

II Does the Combines Investigation Act bind the Crown?

The doctrine of Crown immunity from statutes is a very old common
law doctrine. In 1457 Ashton J. stated, Y.B. 35 H.6, f.62:

quant un remedy soit fait pur un statute ce
ne serra entendu en contre le roy s’il ne soit pas expressement reherse.

That wording may seem to be quite broad, but it has been
suggested by H. Street, in “The Effect of Statutes upon the Rights and
Liabilities of the Crown”, (1948) 7 U. of T.L.J. 357 at p. 361, that this had
application only to the King’s prerogative and was therefore relatively narrow.
It can at least be said that, a century later, the Court of Appeal in Willion
v. Berkley (1561), 1 Plowd. 223, 75 E.R. 339, recognized clear limits on
the extent of Crown immunity. The case concerned a statute involving the right
to alienate land. The majority of the Court decided the King was bound, though
there were no express words to that effect. Dyer C.J. said this at pp. 251-52:

And as to what is said, that the King shall not be bound by
the Act, and that there shall not be any restraint in the estate which he
takes, unless the same be precisely expressed in the Act, sir, in some cases I
admit that the King shall not be restrained by general words, without express
restraint in the Act, and that is according to the

[Page 557]

matter of the Act; but in this Act he shall be bound, for it
is made for the furtherance of restitution, that is to say, where it was a
great abuse that the donee had the power of aliening after issue had, (which being
a common error was taken for the common law) this statute was made to reform
the abuse, and to restore the common law in this point to its right and just
course, which it did by restoring to the donor the observance of his intent. So
that the design of the Act is to give restitution, and in restitutions the King
has no favour, nor has his prerogative any exemption, but the party restored is
favoured. [Footnotes omitted]

Brown J. said, at p. 248 “it is a difficult argument to prove
that a statute, which restrains men generally from doing wrong, leaves the King
at liberty to do wrong”. Street describes the law of that time in the following
way, at p. 362:

By 1561 it had been established that the crown was bound by
a statute which was intended to bind it, and it is clear that where the statute
affected the subject’s rights rather than the crown’s, the courts would readily
read into the statute an intention to bind the crown. On the contrary, there
was a strong presumption that a general statute would not affect the king’s
prerogative rights unless he were named in it.

Street’s thesis is that the modern common law position is based
on a misunderstanding of the precedents. Whether or not this is true, and
Street does make a persuasive case, it is clear that the current common law
position embraces a broad notion of Crown immunity. In Province of Bombay v.
City of Bombay, [1947] A.C. 58, the Privy Council held that the Crown was
only bound by statute if expressly named therein, unless the Crown were bound
by necessary implication. The latter concept was explained, at p. 63, in the
following terms:

If it can be affirmed that, at the time when the statute was
passed and received the royal sanction, it was apparent from its terms that its
beneficent purpose must be wholly frustrated unless the Crown were bound, then
it may be inferred that the Crown has agreed to be bound.

The Bombay test makes no differentiation between types of
statutes involved, or types of rights or obligations imposed. This Court relied
on the

[Page 558]

Bombay test in Her Majesty in Right of the Province of Alberta
v. Canadian Transport Commission, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 61. I note in passing
that the Attorney General is not submitting in this appeal, as he apparently
did in the courts below, that the Crown is bound by the necessary implication
doctrine.

Parliament has followed the lead of the common law, and taken the
development one step further. Section 16 of the Interpretation Act removes
even the necessary implication exception:

No enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her
Majesty or Her Majesty’s rights or prerogatives in any manner, except only as
therein mentioned or referred to.

The conceptual rationale underlying the doctrine of Crown
immunity is obscure. In Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King, [1916]
1 A.C. 566, the Privy Council said, at p. 586:

…it is the general rule in the construction of statutes that
the Crown is not affected unless there be words to that effect, inasmuch as the
law made by the Crown with the assent of the Lords and Commons is enacted prima
facie for the subject and not for the Sovereign.

Why that presumption should be made is not clear. It seems to
conflict with basic notions of equality before the law. The more active
government becomes in activities that had once been considered the preserve of
private persons, the less easy it is to understand why the Crown need be, or
ought to be, in a position different from the subject. This Court is not,
however, entitled to question the basic concept of Crown immunity, for
Parliament has unequivocally adopted the premise that the Crown is prima
facie immune. The Court must give effect to the statutory direction that
the Crown is not bound unless it is “mentioned or referred to” in the
enactment.

The Combines Investigation Act contains no
section purporting to make the Act applicable to Her Majesty. Prima
facie then, because of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, the
Combines Investigation

[Page 559]

Act is not binding on the Crown. The Attorney General,
however, makes two arguments directed to showing that the Combines
Investigation Act does apply to the Crown.

The first argument turns on the fact that s. 32 of the Combines
Investigation Act, on which the charges in this case are based, was at one
time s. 411 of the Criminal Code, 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51. In 1960
Parliament enacted An Act to amend the Combines Investigation Act and the
Criminal Code, 1960 (Can.), c. 45, which repealed s. 411 of the Code
and re-enacted the provision as s. 32 of the Combines Investigation Act.
Section 22 of the 1960 amending legislation also contained the following
provision:

Except to the extent that subsection (1) of
section 32 of the Combines Investigation Act as enacted by this Act
is not in substance the same as section 411 of the Criminal Code as
in force immediately before the coming into force of this Act, the said
subsection (1) of section 32 of the Combines Investigation Act
shall not be held to operate as new law, but shall be construed and have effect
as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the said
section 411 of the Criminal Code.

The Attorney General makes the point that both s. 411 of the
1953-54 Criminal Code and s. 32 of the Combines Investigation Act
used the words “every one”, which were defined in s. 2(15) of the 1953-54 Criminal
Code (as it still is today) in the following terms:

‘every one’, ‘person’, ‘owner’, and similar expressions
include Her Majesty and public bodies, bodies corporate, societies, companies
and inhabitants of counties, parishes, municipalities or other districts in
relation to the acts and things that they are capable of doing and owning
respectively;

Relying on the above-quoted provision in the 1960 amending
legislation, the Attorney General submits that the words “every one” in s. 32
of the

[Page 560]

Combines Investigation Act now have the meaning it had
when the section was part of the Criminal Code, and s. 32 of the Combines
Investigation Act therefore applies to the Crown.

The flaw in the Attorney General’s first argument is that the
definitions in s. 2 of the Criminal Code begin with the words “In this
Act”. In other words, in the absence of a provision expressly incorporating the
Criminal Code definition of “every one” into the Combines
Investigation Act, the definition applies only in the Code itself.
In my opinion the provision in the 1960 amending statute to the effect that s.
32 of the Combines Investigation Act should not “operate as new law” is
not sufficient to overcome express words in the Criminal Code that
restrict the definition of “every one” to that Act. Section 16 of the Interpretation
Act requires an express provision to make an act binding on the Crown. The
giving of royal assent amounts to a waiver of immunity. In the Court’s decision
in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. Attorney-General for Ontario,
[1959] S.C.R. 188 (the 1959 CBC case), both the majority and dissent
agreed that clear language was needed to bind the Crown. The “shall not be held
to operate as new law” stipulation in the 1960 amending Act is far too vague
and oblique a reference to have the effect for which the Attorney General
contends.

The Attorney General’s second argument is to the effect that the Criminal
Code definition of “every one” is inferentially imported into the Combines
Investigation Act by s. 27(2) of the Interpretation Act which reads:

All the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to
indictable offences apply to indictable offences created by an enactment, and
all the provisions of the Criminal Code relating to summary conviction
offences apply to all other offences created by an enactment, except to the
extent that the enactment otherwise provides.

[Page 561]

The Attorney General submits that the definition of “every one”
in s. 2 of the Code is a provision “relating to indictable offences” and
as such it applies to offences created by the Combines Investigation Act.

With respect, I disagree. The gist of this argument is that s.
27(2) of the Interpretation Act incorporates the Criminal Code
definition of “every one” into all federal penal enactments, thereby making all
such enactments binding on the Crown, “except to the extent that the enactment
otherwise provides”. This cannot be right because it is directly contrary to
the express words of s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, which provides
that “No enactment is binding on Her Majesty… except only as therein mentioned
or referred to”. Section 16 makes the Crown immune unless expressly bound,
and it cannot be that s. 27 of the same Act binds the Crown unless expressly
exempted. In my view s. 27(2) of the Interpretation Act does not import
the Criminal Code definition of “every one” into the Combines
Investigation Act, and it does not make the latter Act binding on the
Crown.

Even if the Attorney General could succeed in showing that the Criminal
Code definition of “every one” is incorporated into the Combines
Investigation Act, he woud still face the obstacle posed by the decision in
the 1959 CBC case, supra, where the majority held that the Criminal
Code definition of the word “person”, which is identical to the definition
of “every one”, did not make the Lord’s Day Act binding on the Crown,
even though that Act expressly incorporated the Criminal Code
definition. The majority view was that the provision that “person” included Her
Majesty was not sufficiently clear to make the Crown criminally liable; it was
read as stipulating that Her Majesty could be a victim of crime. The Interpretation
Act, however, has been amended since this judgment was rendered. In 1959
the exception recognized by the section was: “unless it is expressly
stated therein that Her Majesty is bound thereby”. The new exception clause
reads: “except only as therein mentioned or referred to”.

[Page 562]

It is not necessary to determine whether the 1959 CBC case
was rightly decided or whether the result in the case would be the same under
the new version of s. 16; for present purposes it is enough to observe that
there is some doubt whether the definition of “every one” in the Criminal
Code has the effect of making the Code, and any enactment
incorporating that definition, binding on the Crown.

For the above reasons, then, the submission of the Attorney
General that the Combines Investigation Act binds the Crown must fail.
The question that remains is whether Uranium Canada and Eldorado are entitled
to the benefit of the Crown’s immunity from the prohibitory terms of the Combines
Investigation Act.

III Are Eldorado Nuclear and Uranium Canada
entitled to Crown Immunity?

In Canada, the head of state is Her Majesty the Queen, the
reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. By providing that “no enactment is
binding on Her Majesty… except only as therein mentioned or referred to”,
Parliament has put the state, commonly referred to as the Crown, beyond the
reach of Acts of Parliament that are not expressly made applicable to the
Crown.

Like a corporation, the Crown must act through agents or
servants. Assuming for the moment that Uranium Canada and Eldorado were acting
as agents of the Crown, where do they stand vis-à-vis the Combines
Investigation Act? The Attorney General submits that even if the Crown is
immune, agents of the Crown may be personally liable for breaches of the civil
or criminal law. It is argued that the principles applicable to civil and
criminal responsibility are the same. The conclusion reached is that a Crown
agent may be criminally responsible under the Combines Investigation Act.

The Attorney General relies on this Court’s decision in Conseil
des Ports Nationaux v. Langelier, [1969] S.C.R. 60. This was a delict case.

[Page 563]

During the course of his reasons Martland J., speaking for the
Court, said this, at p. 70:

What is in issue here is the responsibility of a person,
whether individual or corporate, who, though a Crown agent, and purporting to
act as such, commits an act which is unlawful. My understanding of the law is
that a personal liability will result. The liability arises, not because he is
an agent of the Crown, but because, though he is an agent of the Crown, the
plea of Crown authority will not avail in such event.

This passage properly states the law, but I do not agree it
produces the result for which the Attorney General contends.

At common law, the Sovereign could not be brought into the
Queen’s courts in the ordinary way. This arose from an immunity of the
Sovereign from court process. This immunity was distinct from the immunity of
the Sovereign under statutes. Immunity from court process did not, however,
leave the subject without any civil remedy. For certain matters, such as breach
of contract, the procedure of petition of right was available to settle
disputes between the Crown and a subject. In tort the Queen could not be sued
but that did not prevent an agent of the Queen from being sued. In Feather
v. The Queen (1865), 122 E.R. 1191 (C.A.), one of the authorities relied
upon by Martland J., Cockburn C.J. speaking for the Court, said this, at pp.
1205-06:

For the maxim that the King can do no wrong applies to
personal as well as to political wrongs; and not only to wrongs done personally
by the Sovereign, if such a thing can be supposed to be possible, but to
injuries done by a subject by the authority of the Sovereign. For, from the
maxim that the King cannot do wrong it follows, as a necessary consequence,
that the King cannot authorize wrong. For to authorize a wrong to be done is to
do a wrong; inasmuch as the wrongful act, when done, becomes, in law, the act
of him who directed or authorized it to be done. It follows that a petition of
right which complains of a tortious act done by the Crown, or by a public
servant by the authority of the Crown, discloses no matter of complaint which
can entitle the petitioner to redress. As in the eye of the law no such wrong
can be done, so, in law, no right to redress can arise; and the petition therefore,
which rests on such a

[Page 564]

foundation falls at once to the ground. Let it not, however,
be supposed that a subject sustaining a legal wrong at the hands of a minister
of the Crown is without a remedy. As the Sovereign cannot authorize wrong to be
done, the authority of the Crown would afford no defence to an action brought
for an illegal act committed by an officer of the Crown… But in our opinion no
authority is needed to establish that a servant of the Crown is responsible in
law for a tortious act done to a fellow subject, though done by the authority
of the Crown—a position which appears to us to rest on principles which are too
well settled to admit of question, and which are alike essential to uphold the
dignity of the Crown on the one hand, and the rights and liberties of the
subject on the other.

The maxim that the Queen can do no wrong is a legal fiction
which, at common law, serves the purpose of preventing the Queen from being
impleaded in her own courts. There is, however, no comparable maxim that an
agent of the Queen can do no wrong.

The conclusion that a Crown agent is personally responsible for
an unlawful act still leaves the question whether the act is unlawful. Where
the unlawfulness or the wrongfulness of the act arises without any recourse to
a statute, the Crown’s immunity from statute, as expressed in s. 16 of the Interpretation
Act, is irrelevant. If, for example, the agent commits a tortious act, it
is the common law which characterizes it as unlawful. There is no immunity that
the agent can claim.

Where the only source of the unlawfulness is a statute, however,
the analysis is entirely different. Reference to a statute is necessary for
criminal responsibility in Canada, apart from contempt of court, because s. 8
of the Criminal Code precludes any conviction for an offence at common
law. If a person commits an act prohibited by statute, and the Attorney General
seeks to prosecute for violation of that statute, the preliminary question that
must be asked is whether that person is bound by the statute. If not, the
person simply does not commit a violation of the statute. The situation is not
that the person is immune from prosecution even though there has been an
unlawful act;

[Page 565]

rather, that there has been no unlawful act under the
statute. I have already said that the Combines Investigation Act does
not bind the Crown. If Uranium Canada and Eldorado share the Crown’s immunity,
they can have committed no offence under the Act.

Both the majority and the dissent in the 1959 CBC case, supra,
accepted that proposition of law that s. 16 of the Interpretation Act
extends to agents of the Crown. This Court’s decision in Formea Chemicals
Ltd. v. Polymer Corporation Ltd., [1968] S.C.R. 754 also makes it clear
that a reference to the Crown in a statute extends to Crown agents. If this
were not the interpretation given to s. 16, the section would have no
meaning, since the Crown only acts through servants and agents. Crown agents
benefit from Crown immunity because they are acting on behalf of the Crown. The
critical question, then, is whether Uranium Canada and Eldorado were acting as
agents.

Uranium Canada and Eldorado are each, by statute, expressly made
“an agent of Her Majesty”. Uranium Canada owes its status as a Crown agent to
s. 10(4) of the Atomic Energy Control Act, which reads:

A company is for all its purposes an agent of Her Majesty
and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

Eldorado’s agency status derives from the Government Companies
Operation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. G-7; section 3 reads:

Every Company is for all its purposes an agent of Her
Majesty and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

The fact that these statutory provisions make each of the
respondent Corporations “for all its purposes” an agent of the Crown does not
mean, however, that these Companies act as Crown agents in everything they do.

Statutory bodies such as Uranium Canada and Eldorado are created
for limited purposes. When a Crown agent acts within the scope of the public

[Page 566]

purposes it is statutorily empowered to pursue, it is entitled to
Crown immunity from the operation of statutes, because it is acting on behalf
of the Crown. When the agent steps outside the ambit of Crown purposes,
however, it acts personally, and not on behalf of the state, and cannot claim
to be immune as an agent of the Crown. This follows from the fact that s. 16 of
the Interpretation Act works for the benefit of the state, not for the
benefit of the agent personally. Only the Crown, through its agents, and for
its purposes, is immune from the Combines Investigation Act.

This Court recently adopted this approach in Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation v. The Queen, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 339 (the 1983 CBC
case), where the CBC sought immunity in relation to charges of showing an
obscene film contrary to s. 159(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The
CBC is established under the Broadcasting Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. B-l 1;
section 40(1) of that Act provides as follows:

Except as provided in subsection 38(3), the Corporation
is, for all purposes of this Act, an agent of Her Majesty, and its power under
this Act may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

This Court upheld the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal
that the CBC could be prosecuted under the Criminal Code,
notwithstanding it was an agent of the Crown. In the Court of Appeal and here,
the key to this result was a Regulation promulgated under the Broadcasting
Act which prohibited the broadcast of any “obscene, indecent or profane…
presentation”. The CBC was charged with breach of the Criminal Code, not
with breach of the Broadcasting Regulations, but the Regulation was important
because the Broadcasting Act made the Corporation a Crown agent “for all
purposes of this Act”, and the Regulation demonstrated that in broadcasting an
obscene film the Corporation was not acting for purposes entrusted to it under
the Act. This Court expressly adopted the following passage from the judgment
of the Ontario Court of Appeal (at p. 353):

[Page 567]

In my view, when the Corporation exercises its powers with a
view to carrying out the purposes of the Broadcasting Act, it acts as
agent of Her Majesty and only as agent of Her Majesty. But, when it exercises
its powers in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of the Act, it steps
outside its agency role. That role subsists only so long as the Corporation’s
broadcasts are implementing the policy laid down in the Act. This seems to me
to be the effect of s. 40(1).

When the present proceedings were before the Ontario Court of
Appeal this Court had not rendered judgment in the 1983 CBC case. The
Court of Appeal distinguished its own decision in that case on the basis that
the Broadcasting Act makes the CBC a Crown agent “for all purposes of
this Act” while the Atomic Energy Control Act and the Government
Companies Operation Act make each of the respondents in this appeal an agent of
the Crown “for all its purposes”. The Court of Appeal thought the latter words
were broader than the words of the Broadcasting Act, and under the
statutory provisions at issue here “there are no limits on the status of the
agency”.

With respect, I disagree. The Broadcasting Act uses the
words “purposes of this Act” in the agency clause because the CBC is
established by the Broadcasting Act and derives its corporate objects
and powers from that Act (ss. 34(1), 39). Uranium Canada and Eldorado, on the
other hand, are not created by the Atomic Energy Control Act or the Government
Companies Operation Act, but are incorporated under the Canada
Corporations Act  and receive their corporate objects and powers from that
statute and from their letters patent. Under these circumstances, it would be
inappropriate for the Atomic Energy Control Act or the Government
Companies Operation Act to refer to the “purposes of this Act” in the
agency clauses. For this reason I cannot accept that the difference in wording
has the significance the Ontario Court of Appeal attributed to it. In my
opinion, any limitations that might be imposed on the CBC’s agency status by
the words “purposes of this Act” are also imposed on the agency of

[Page 568]

Uranium Canada and Eldorado by the words “its purposes”. That
being so, the 1983 CBC case makes the same point as the present one: a
Crown agent is entitled to the benefit of the immunity afforded by s. 16 of the
Interpretation Act only when it acts within the scope of the Crown
purposes it is authorized to serve.

I think it is also important to draw a distinction between (i)
acts committed in the course of fulfilling Crown purposes but in no way
undertaken in order to effect Crown purposes; and (ii) those acts committed
which are designed to effect Crown purposes. Whereas the latter situation does
invoke Crown immunity, the former does not. I refer, by way of illustration, to
R. v. Stradiotto, [1973] 2 O.R. 375 (C.A.). In that case a member of the
militia was charged with careless driving under the Ontario Highway
Traffic Act. At the time, Stradiotto was driving a Department of National
Defence vehicle while in his official militia duties. The Ontario Court of
Appeal rejected the claim of Crown immunity on the basis that Stradiotto could
have effected Crown purposes without violating The Highway Traffic Act.
I agree with the result reached in Stradiotto, but not with the reasoning
of the Ontario Court of Appeal. In my view, the reason Crown immunity could not
be invoked was that the careless driving was wholly incidental to official
militia purposes. The careless driving was in no manner in the furtherance of
the Crown purposes of the militia. In driving carelessly, Stradiotto stepped
outside Crown purposes and no longer was acting as agent. Accordingly, he could
not claim immunity.

Against this background, can it be said that the acts alleged in
the indictments here in question fall within the purposes of Uranium Canada and

[Page 569]

Eldorado? I will deal firstly with Uranium Canada.

Section 10(1) of the Atomic Energy Control Act
provides that the Minister responsible for the Act may:

(b) with the approval of the Governor in Council,
utilize, cause to be utilized and prepare for the utilization of atomic energy;

(c) with the approval of the Governor in Council,
acquire, or cause to be acquired by purchase, lease, requisition or
expropriation, prescribed substances and any mines, deposits or claims of
prescribed substances and patent rights relating to atomic energy and any works
or property for production or preparation for production of, or for research or
investigation with respect to, atomic energy;

Section 10(2)(a) of the Act gives the Minister
authority to procure the incorporation of companies under Part I of the Canada
Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-32 , for the purpose of exercising and
performing on behalf of the Minister such of the powers conferred upon him by
s. 10(1) of the Atomic Energy Control Act as the Minister may from time
to time direct.

Part I of the Canada Corporations Act , referred to in s.
10(2)(a) of the Atomic Energy Control Act, deals with the
formation of new companies, and makes provision for matters typically dealt
with in business corporation statutes, such as the powers and duties of
companies, transfer of shares, alteration or reduction of share capital, calls,
borrowing powers, and so on.

On June 21, 1971 Uranium Canada was incorporated under Part I of
the Canada Corporations Act  by the Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources pursuant to his powers under s. 10(2) of the Atomic Energy Control
Act. The Company’s letters patent set out its objects as follows:

(a) to exercise and perform on behalf of the Minister of
Energy, Mines & Resources the powers, respon-

[Page 570]

sibilities, duties and obligations that may be imposed upon
the Company pursuant to contracts to be entered into with the approval of the
Governor in Council pursuant to the authority of Vote L-11 c of the
Appropriation Act No. 1, 1971;

(b) to exercise and perform such other powers conferred on
the Minister by subsection 1 of section 10 of the Atomic Energy
Control Act, 1946, as amended by S.C. 1954, chapter 47, as the Minister may from
time to time direct.

By supplementary letters patent issued June 10, 1975, Uranium Canada’s objects were amended by adding thereto paragraph (c) which reads:

to negotiate, execute and perform agreements for the
purchase, stockpiling and sale of uranium concentrates and to do or procure the
doing of anything necessary or incidental thereto, all subject to the approval
of the Governor in Council.

Vote L-11c referred to in paragraph (a) of the Company’s objects
is as follows:

Acquisition in fiscal years 1970-71, 1971-72, 1972-73,
1973-74 and 1974-75 of uranium concentrates in accordance with contracts to be
entered into, with the approval of the Governor in Council, with Denison Mines
Limited including authority to sell the uranium concentrates acquired under the
said contracts and to appoint a sales agent for such purpose.

During the period covered by the charges in this case all the
shares of Uranium Canada, except qualifying shares of the directors, were held
by the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources in trust for Her Majesty in
right of Canada. All of the Company’s directors and officers were senior
officials in various departments and branches of government, including External
Affairs; Energy, Mines and Resources; Finance; Industry, Trade and Commerce;
Justice; the Privy Council Office; and the Natural Sciences and Engineering
Research Council. Uranium Canada conducts its affairs in, and has no place of
business separate from, the offices of the Department of Energy, Mines and
Resources. It has no employees of its

[Page 571]

own. Its total assets are $9 received in payment for directors’
qualifying shares.

In broad terms, Uranium Canada’s corporate functions are to buy
and sell uranium and related products with the approval of the Governor in
Council, and to exercise such other powers with respect to the acquisition,
production and utilization of uranium as the Minister may direct. Uranium Canada
is “for all its purposes” an agent of the Crown. The question that arises is
whether entering into a conspiracy or arrangement to reduce competition in the
production, sale or supply of uranium is within Uranium Canada’s corporate
objects and “purposes”. On this point the Court of Appeal said:

It can be seen that the respondents are charged with doing
acts which by their objects they are authorized to perform. Assuming, as we
must, for the purposes of the appeal that the respondent companies performed
the acts attributed to them in the indictment then the performance of those
acts prima facie fell within the powers conferred on them by their
objects clauses and their authorizing legislation.

I have no doubt marketing arrangements relating to uranium come
within the powers conferred by paragraph (c) of Uranium Canada’s letters
patent. They cannot be said to be incidental to the Company’s powers. Such
powers, however, are to be exercised “subject to the approval of the Governor
in Council”. Mr. Justice J. Holland concluded on the basis of the relevant
legislation and the affidavits filed on the application that Uranium Canada is
a Crown agent incorporated for the single purpose of carrying out the policy of
the government of Canada relating to atomic energy, and that in so doing it
operated under the directing mind of the Minister of Energy, Mines and
Resources, and with the approval of the Governor in Council. Nothing in the
records indicates otherwise. Whether Uranium Canada acted with or without
government approval is important because the Atomic Energy Control Act
provides that Uranium Canada is a Crown agent “for all its purposes”, not that
it is a Crown agent in whatever it does. If Uranium Canada performed the acts
complained of in the information with the approval

[Page 572]

of the Governor in Council, it acted within “its purposes” and is
entitled to immunity as a Crown agent. If, on the other hand, it acted without
such approval, it acted outside “its purposes”, and beyond the scope of its
agency, and cannot claim to be immune on the basis that it entered the alleged
combine on behalf of the Crown.

I turn now to the other respondent. Eldorado Mining and Refining
(1944) Limited was incorporated by Letters Patent on June 30, 1945, under Part
I of The Companies Act, 1934. In 1952 the Company’s name was
changed to Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited, and in 1968 changed again to
Eldorado Nuclear Limited—Eldorado Nucléaire Limitée. By 1964-65 (Can.), c. 52,
s. 2, the short title of the Companies Act was changed to the Canada
Corporations Act ; thereafter Eldorado was incorporated under Part I of the Canada
Corporations Act . Eldorado’s corporate objects and purposes read in part:

To acquire, own, lease, prospect for, open, explore,
develop, work, improve, maintain and manage mines and mineral lands and
deposits, and to dig for, raise, crush, wash, smelt, assay, analyze, reduce,
amalgamate, refine, pipe, convey and otherwise treat ores, metals and minerals,
whether belonging to the company or not, and to render the same merchantable
and to sell or otherwise dispose of the same or any part thereof or interest
therein;

In 1968, by supplementary letters patent, the following was added
to the above description of the Company’s objects:

and to purchase, lease, mine, refine, process and sell
uranium, zirconium or any other material or equipment relative to the nuclear
industry;

All of Eldorado’s issued shares are owned by, or held in trust
for, Her Majesty in right of Canada. Hence Eldorado comes within the definition
of “company” in the Government Companies Operation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
G-7 (as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 33, s. 265 (Item 4)), which
reads:

[Page 573]

“Company” means a company incorporated under Part I of the Canada
Corporations Act , or a corporation incorporated under the Canada
Business Corporations Act, all the issued shares of which are owned by or
held in trust for Her Majesty in right of Canada except, in the case of a
company incorporated under Part I of the Canada Corporations Act , shares
necessary to qualify other persons as directors;

Section 6 of the same Act provides:

This Act applies to a Company only from the date of the
issue of a proclamation by the Governor in Council declaring this Act to be
applicable to such Company.

On or about August 1, 1946, the Governor in Council issued a
proclamation directing that the Government Companies Operation Act be
applicable to Eldorado Mining and Refining (1944) Limited, which, as indicated
above, subsequently became Eldorado Nuclear Limited. It is s. 3 of the Government
Companies Operation Act that makes Eldorado “for all its purposes” an agent
of Her Majesty.

As with Uranium Canada, agreements relating to the sale and
supply of uranium fall within Eldorado’s corporate objects. I note, however,
that unlike Uranium Canada, Eldorado’s corporate objects do not restrict it to
acting with the approval of the Minister or the Governor in Council. Whatever
the de facto relationship between Eldorado and the government may be,
the Company’s corporate objects clauses and the relevant statutes leave it free
to operate without government direction.

Does Eldorado’s independence in any way affect its right to claim
Crown immunity? At common law the question whether a person is an agent or
servant of the Crown depends on the degree of control which the Crown, through
its ministers, can exercise over the performance of his or its duties. The
greater the control, the more likely it is that the person will be recognized
as a Crown agent. Where a person, human or corporate, exercises substantial
discretion, independent of ministerial control, the common law denies Crown

[Page 574]

agency status. The question is not how much independence the
person has in fact, but how much he can assert by reason of the terms of
appointment and nature of the official: Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V.
v. Administrator of Hungarian Property, [1954] A.C. 584 at pp. 616-17, and
see Hogg, Liability of the Crown, 1971, p. 207. While Uranium Canada
would easily meet the common law test of Crown agency, since it needs approval
of the Governor in Council for what it does, I think it is clear that the common
law would not recognize Eldorado as a Crown agent since it does not meet the de
jure control test. I do not, however, think that this deprives Eldorado of
the right of Crown immunity when acting within its corporate purposes.

The position at common law is not that those under de jure
control are entitled to Crown immunity, but rather that immunity extends to
those acting on behalf of the Crown. In Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v.
Sheedy, [1927] A.C. 899, the Privy Council found the Board not to be a Crown
agent because “there is nothing in the statute which makes the acts of
administration his [the Minister’s] as distinguished from theirs” (p. 905). Sheedy
is not an immunity case, rather, the question was whether Crown priority could
be asserted in a liquidation. Nevertheless, it does indicate that the de
jure test applies only in the absence of specific language indicating the
body acts on behalf of or as an agent of the Crown. See also Tamlin v.
Hannaford, [1950] 1 K.B. 18 (C.A.). A case such as British Columbia
Power Corp. v. Attorney-General of British Columbia (1962), 34 D.L.R. (2d)
25, is easily distinguishable. In that case the statutory designation of Crown
agent was held not to be conclusive, because the statute did not say “for all
its purposes”. The majority concluded the statute made the Power Corporation an
agent only for some

[Page 575]

purposes, not including the matter at issue in that appeal.

This Court’s decision in Formea Chemicals Ltd. v. Polymer
Corporation Ltd., supra, is also instructive. The case concerned s. 19 of
the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 203.

The Government of Canada may, at any time, use any patented
invention, paying to the patentee such sum as the Commissioner reports to be a
reasonable compensation for the use thereof, and any decision of the
Commissioner under this section is subject to appeal to the Exchequer
 Court.

Martland J., speaking for the Court, equated “Government of
Canada” with the Crown. Polymer, like Eldorado, was made, for all its purposes,
an agent of the Crown, though not under de jure control. Nonetheless,
Polymer was held entitled to take advantage of s. 19.

In my opinion the Crown, under s. 19, has an unrestricted
right to use a patent. It caused the respondent [Polymer] to be incorporated to
manufacture, sell and deal in synthetic rubber and made the respondent, for all
its purposes, its agent. The use by the respondent of the patent was, in the
circumstances, a use by the Crown within s. 19. This being so, there was no
infringement by the respondent of such patent [at p. 764].

The “agent for all its purposes” designation was held to be
determinative; there was no inquiry into the actual independence of Polymer. I
think this case makes it clear that when an enactment refers to the Crown, and
a particular body is expressly made a Crown agent for all purposes, the
enactment embraces the statutory agent. This applies to the construction of
s. 16 of the Interpretation Act.

I also note that in the 1959 CBC case, supra, the
CBC was by statute an agent:

The Corporation is for all purposes of this Act an agent of
Her Majesty and its powers under this Act may be exercised only as an agent of
Her Majesty.

As noted in Locke J.’s concurring judgment, the CBC was not under
the regulation or direction of

[Page 576]

any department of government. Nevertheless, the majority found
the CBC entitled to immunity. The dissenting members of the Court agreed that
if the Crown had been immune under the Lord’s Day Act, that immunity
would have extended to the CBC.

The major difference between Uranium Canada and Eldorado is that
while the former is closely controlled by government, the latter, at least on
paper, is not. Yet the statutory provisions making both corporations Crown
agents for all their purposes are identical. I do not think it is admissible,
without rewriting the statutes, to interpret these identical provisions
differently. The status of Crown agents “for all its purposes” gives each such
agent the benefit of Crown immunity under s. 16 of the Interpretation Act.
The draftsmen of the governing statutes of Uranium Canada and Eldorado may well
have been thinking of immunity from taxing statutes rather than criminal
statutes, but the result is that there is immunity from both as long as the
corporations are acting within their respective authorized purposes.

The Attorney General’s “lawful Crown purposes” argument has
already been met by the conclusion that the two respondents are not bound by
the Combines Investigation Act when acting within authorized purposes,
so they cannot commit a violation of that Act when so acting. One additional
point ought to be made. The Attorney General contended that neither respondent
was given authority to contravene the Combines Investigation Act and
therefore Crown immunity was not available; Crown immunity would apply only if
there were statutory authority to contravene the Combines Investigation Act.
With respect, I do not think this is an appropriate form of analysis. Statutory
authority to commit an act that would otherwise be illegal, does not, it seems
to me, invoke Crown immunity. It gives rise to a defence of statutory
justification. A defence of statutory

[Page 577]

justification can be raised by any person, whether or not a Crown
agent. This is conceptually and analytically distant from Crown immunity.

IV Were the Prohibition Orders Premature?

There is nothing in the statutory framework or in the letters
patent of either Company to suggest that agreements or arrangements to lessen
competition in the production, sale or supply of uranium are extraneous to the
state purposes for which the two Companies were incorporated.

The Attorney General says, however, the prohibition orders in
this case were premature because the question whether either Company exceeded
its authority is a factual matter to be determined only upon evidence the
Attorney General will lead in proof of the charges at the preliminary inquiry,
and at subsequent trial if either Company should be committed for trial.

The Attorney General does not make any positive assertion that
Uranium Canada acted without approval of the Governor in Council. If the
Attorney General had evidence to this effect, or other evidence tending to show
that Uranium Canada or Eldorado acted for other than Crown purposes, he should
have so indicated by way of affidavit at the application before J. Holland J.
No such evidence was presented there, or alluded to here. This matter has now
been before three courts. In my opinion there is no merit in the submission
that the prohibition orders were premature. The Attorney General has had ample
opportunity to demonstrate, or at least assert categorically, that in entering
the allegedly unlawful agreements and combinations the two Companies acted for
other than Crown purposes. The Crown is immune from the Combines
Investigation Act; the respondents are agents of the Crown. Prima facie,
the conduct

[Page 578]

complained of is within the scope of Crown purposes for which the
Companies were incorporated, which, as found by J. Holland J., are to implement
national policy relating to atomic energy in all its aspects. Absent some
indication that the Companies acted outside corporate objects for other than
Crown purposes, they are immune from the terms of the Combines Investigation
Act as agents of the Crown, and the Provincial Court Judge lacked
jurisdiction to inquire into the charges. I would dismiss the appeals. No costs
are sought.

The reasons of Mclntyre and Wilson JJ. were delivered by

WILSON J. (dissenting in part)—I have had the benefit of
reading the reasons for judgment of my colleague, Dickson J., and must
respectfully disagree with his conclusion that both Eldorado Nuclear Limited
and Uranium Canada Limited are entitled to assert the Crown’s immunity from
prosecution under s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-23. In my view, only Uranium Canada is entitled to assert
such immunity.

The history of the proceedings is set out in my colleague’s
reasons for judgment and it is unnecessary for me to repeat it here. I agree
with my colleague’s conclusion that by virtue of s. 16 of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, the Crown is immune from prosecution under the Combines
Investigation Act. The issue before the Court however, as I see it, is
whether the respondent corporations can at this stage of the proceedings claim
the benefit of this immunity by virtue of their status as Crown agents.

Prima facie the resolution of this issue would appear to
involve a consideration of the alleged acts of the corporations in light of
their authorized objects and purposes. An inquiry would be

[Page 579]

required to determine whether or not such acts were within such
objects and purposes. It is submitted on behalf of the respondents, however,
that such an inquiry is unnecessary since the respondents are expressed in
their governing statutes to be for all their purposes agents of Her Majesty and
able to exercise their powers only as such. This, they say, means that no
matter what they do in carrying out their purposes, they are entitled to Her
Majesty’s immunity. Parliament has effectively equated their authority with
their capacity and the holding of a preliminary inquiry in these circumstances
would be a futile exercise.

Uranium Canada makes its claim to immunity on the basis of s.
10(4) of the Atomic Energy Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-19, which
reads:

A company is for all its purposes an agent of Her Majesty
and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

Eldorado’s claim is based on s. 3(1) of the Government
Companies Operation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.G-7, which states:

Every Company is for all its purposes an agent of Her
Majesty and its powers may be exercised only as an agent of Her Majesty.

Do these statutory provisions, by making a conclusive legislative
pronouncement on the status of the respondents as Crown agents, also provide
them with a blanket immunity from prosecution under the Combines
Investigation Act for any acts which they might perform in furtherance of
their statutory mandate? With respect, I do not think so.

In my view the authorities governing the scope of immunity of
Crown agents demonstrate that the courts must apply a two-step test in
determining whether an agent of the Crown is entitled to assert the Crown’s
immunity. The first step is to decide whether the agent is authorized,
expressly or impliedly, to perform the acts in question. In making this
determination it is not enough to say that the purpose for which the
acts are performed is an authorized purpose; the Court must also determine that
the means which the agent uses to accomplish the purpose are expressly
or impliedly

[Page 580]

authorized. If as a matter of statutory interpretation the means
are authorized, the agent is entitled to immunity. If, however, there is no
such authorization, the Court must move to the second step. The second step is
to decide whether or not the agent is, for all intents and purposes, the alter
ego of the Crown. If because of the degree of control—and by this is meant de
jure as opposed to de facto control—which the Crown is able to exercise
over the agent it is impossible for the Court to characterize the agent’s act
as anything other than the act of the Crown, the agent is entitled to assert
Crown immunity whether or not its governing statute authorizes the means by
which the agent carries out its statutory purposes. If, however, the Crown does
not have that degree of control, the agent will not be entitled to assert the
immunity if the means it used are outside the purview of the statute. I turn to
the authorities.

In R. v. Stradiotto, [1973] 2 O.R. 375, a member of the
Canadian Armed Forces was held not to be immune from prosecution under the
Ontario Highway Traffic Act even although he was acting under orders in
the course of his employment. Evans J.A., writing for the Ontario Court of
Appeal, said at p. 377:

The question for determination may be briefly stated: Is a
servant of the Crown immune from prosecution under the Highway Traffic Act
when he drives a motor vehicle in a negligent manner while in the course of
carrying out orders which can be obeyed without driving carelessly?

He concluded that he was not. The Court conceded in Stradiotto
that if the soldier had been ordered to do the very act alleged to constitute
the offence, he would be immune from prosecution. Evans J.A. said at p. 379:

In my view, a distinction must be drawn between a breach of
the Highway Traffic Act which is required to be committed by a soldier
in order to carry out a military order and a breach of the statute which a
soldier commits during the course of carrying out his duties which duties,
however, can be properly discharged without committing a breach of the statute.

In Conseil des Ports Nationaux v. Langelier, [1969] S.C.R.
60, the respondents, who were

[Page 581]

owners of properties bordering on the St. Lawrence River,
petitioned for an injunction to restrain the National Harbours Board from
carrying out certain works on the river which they claimed would injuriously
affect their properties. The Board moved by way of declinatory exception to
dismiss the respondents’ petition on the ground that, being an agent of the
Crown, it was not subject to injunction. The exception was dismissed at trial
and the trial judgment was affirmed on appeal. The Board was granted leave to
appeal to this Court. Mr. Justice Martland, speaking for the Court, dealt
with the argument made on behalf of the Board that it was only capable of
acting as a Crown agent and therefore enjoyed all the immunities of the Crown.
He said at p. 70:

What is in issue here is the responsibility of a person,
whether individual or corporate, who, though a Crown agent, and purporting to
act as such, commits an act which is unlawful. My understanding of the law is
that a personal liability will result. The liability arises, not because he is
an agent of the Crown, but because, though he is an agent of the Crown, the
plea of Crown authority will not avail in such event.

After reviewing a number of authorities Martland J. stated at p.
72:

As Choquette J. has pointed out, in the reasons for judgment
of the Court of Appeal, s. 3(2) of the National Harbours Board Act declares
that the Board “shall be and be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this
Act, the agent of Her Majesty in right of Canada”. (The italicizing is my
own.) It is only when the Board is lawfully executing the powers entrusted to
it by the Act that it is deemed to be a Crown agent.

I am not prepared to accept the proposition enunciated in Wheeler
v. Public Works Commissioners, [1903] 2 I.R. 202, that a corporation
constituted for the sole purpose of doing acts for the Crown is not capable of
doing a wrongful act in its corporate capacity, unless that statement is to be
limited in its meaning to say that such a wrongful act is not authorized by its
corporate powers. Otherwise the statement subscribes to the theory that a
corporation cannot be made liable in tort because its corporate powers do not
authorize it to commit a wrong. In my opinion, if a corporation, in the
purported carrying out of its corporate purposes, commits a wrongful act, it is
liable therefor and it cannot

[Page 582]

escape liability by alleging that it is not responsible for
anything done outside its corporate powers. This is true whether it is
purporting to act as a Crown agent, or not.

The National Harbour Board’s appeal was dismissed.

It has been suggested that there is a distinction to be drawn
between the Crown’s immunity at common law from an action in tort and its
immunity from liability or prosecution under a statute by virtue of s. 16 of
the Interpretation Act and that the observations of Martland J. in Conseil
des Ports Nationaux are confined to the former situation. With respect, I
think this is to read down the principle applied by the learned justice in the
case. The plaintiff, it will be recalled, was not seeking to enjoin the
National Harbours Board from commission of a common law tort but from
commission of a délit as contemplated by arts. 1053 et seq. of
the Civil Code. Any immunity which the National Harbours Board was
seeking to assert must accordingly have included immunity from provisions of
the Civil Code.

Although a number of the cases upon which Martland J. relied
involved the liability of public officials for tortious acts at common law, I
do not believe that he intended to confine his remarks to common law liability.
Rather, he seems to have espoused the broader principle which he quoted from
Dicey on The Law of the Constitution (10th ed., 1959), p. 193 to the
effect that Crown agents are personally liable “for acts done in their official
character but in excess of their lawful authority”. As an example of such an
act he refers to the violation of the Civil Code by the Quebec Liquor
Commission in Roncarelli v. Duplessis, [1959] S.C.R. 121.

Moreover, I do not believe that it is sound in principle to draw
a distinction in the present context between wrongs which are recognized by the
common law and those which are created by statute. In Tobin v. The Queen
(1864), 33 L.J.C.P. 199, Erle C.J. explained the principle that “the

[Page 583]

king can do no wrong” in the following way at p. 205:

The maxim that “the king can do no wrong” is true in the
sense that he is not liable to be sued civilly or criminally for a supposed
wrong; that which the sovereign does personally the law presumes will not be
wrong; that which the sovereign does by command to his servants cannot be a
wrong in the sovereign, because if the command be unlawful, it is in law no
command, and the servant is responsible for the unlawful act in the same way as
if there had been no command.

(Emphasis added.)

The principle thus stated recognizes that the servants and agents
of the Crown are under an obligation to obey the law which is enforceable in
the courts even if the sovereign’s personal obligation to do so is not
enforceable in the same manner. To remove breaches of statute from the ambit of
this principle would create an enormous range of executive action which would
not be subject to independent judicial control.

Mr. Justice Estey, writing for the Court in the recent
decision in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v. The Queen, [1983] 1
S.C.R. 339, seems to have approved the reasoning in both Conseil des Ports
Nationaux and Stradiotto. He stated at p. 343:

There is no doubt that in the existing state of the law
employees of the Crown are responsible for their own acts done in their
official character but in excess of their lawful authority.

And later he says at pp. 351-52:

The appellant is certainly in no better position than a
minister of the Crown. It is difficult to believe that after the great constitutional
struggles through which we and our forebears have gone to bring to an end the
concept of the absolute monarchy we are still faced with the defence of
absolute immunity by the monarch’s administration. Borrowing the words of
Martland J., in Conseil des Ports Nationaux, supra: “It is only when the
(Corporation) is lawfully executing the powers entrusted to it by the Act that
it is deemed to be the Crown agent” (at p. 72). When so acting and thereby
enjoying the status of Crown agent the immunities of the Crown flow through to
the agent for its benefit. Where, however, the Corporation is not acting “for
all purposes of this Act”

[Page 584]

or with reference to “its powers under this Act” the status
and the benefits of Crown agency disappear.

The attribution of Crown immunity to the appellant may be an
issue in circumstances not here before the Court and hence need not, for the
disposition of this appeal, be determined. However, even if Crown immunity may
be attributed to the appellant in some circumstances, and the actions of the
appellant in such circumstances attributed to the Crown, it does not
necessarily follow that the immunities attendant upon the status of Crown
agency will flow through to the benefit and protection of the appellant in all circumstances.
Here we have the Attorney General of the Province of Ontario prosecuting
charges under the federal Criminal Code against a corporation
established by the Parliament of Canada. The former brings the charges in the
course of its duty to enforce the criminal law in the province and the latter
is called upon to answer those charges by reason of its corporate existence and
responsibilities under the Broadcasting Act. There is no authorization
given by Parliament in its parent statute for the conduct of the appellant. The
law reveals no reason why Her Majesty as the fountainhead of justice should not
invoke the powers of the criminal courts to enforce a statute which expressly
makes Her Majesty’s agents subject to its terms. But even that is not the case
before us. There certainly can be no reason in law why the law enforcement
agencies should not bring before the criminal court a corporation, however
established, or any other person, where the conduct of that person, natural or
legal, offends the Criminal Code and is not expressly authorized by Act
of Parliament. We are not here concerned with whether the same principle would
apply to conduct expressly authorized by another legislature acting within its
plenary competence.

These cases seem to me to be authority for the proposition that
the fact that an individual or a corporation enjoys the status of an agent of
the Crown is not conclusive of his right to immunity. The agent will be
personally liable for acts carried out beyond the scope of his authority and
his authority must be closely examined in order to determine whether the means
he used in carrying out his mandate were authorized or not. Following the
approach taken by Evans J.A. in Stradiotto, I would find that where
there is no express authorization to perform the alleged acts, the courts
should presume that acts which violate the law are

[Page 585]

the unauthorized acts of the agent for which he will be
personally liable. The onus should be on the agent to show that he could not
carry out his mandate without the commission of such acts.

Without commenting on the correctness of their decision, I think
that the majority of this Court in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v.
Attorney-General for Ontario, [1959] S.C.R. 188, took a similar approach to
the question of whether the C.B.C. was entitled to assert Crown immunity from
prosecution under the Lord’s Day Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 171 (now R.S.C.
1970, c. L-13), for broadcasting on a Sunday. The statutory mandate in that
case was to “carry on a national broadcasting service within Canada”. The
majority treated that as a mandate to broadcast free of any limitation as to
time. Since it would frustrate the corporation in the exercise of its mandate
if the prohibition in the Lord’s Day Act applied to it, it had implied
authority to broadcast on a Sunday and was entitled to the immunity for so
doing.

By applying for an order of prohibition at this stage of the
proceedings the respondents in this case have made it impossible for the courts
to assess whether or not the acts alleged were necessary to enable the
respondents to carry out their statutory mandate.

It has been argued that by confining the scope of the Crown
agent’s immunity to those acts which were authorized the Court would be
destroying the principle of Crown immunity. The argument is that Crown agents
do not need immunity when they are carrying out acts within the scope of their
authority. Since the Crown can act only through agents, it is said, the
restriction of Crown immunity to the authorized acts of agents deprives the
immunity of any substance. With respect, I do not think that this is so. In my
view the common law authorities demonstrate that where the Crown agent’s
capacity to act was so circumscribed that any act done in the course of his duties
must be viewed as an act of the Crown itself, he was entitled to assert Crown
immunity. The test, as set

[Page 586]

out in the House of Lords’ decision in Bank voor Handel en
Scheepvaart N.V. v. Administrator of Hungarian Property, [1954] A.C. 584, is
whether the Crown exercises de jure control over the agent. As Lord Reid
put it at p. 617:

The question is not how much independence the [agent] in
fact enjoys but how much he can assert and insist on by reason of the terms of
his appointment or the nature of his office.

I do not see why the common law principle is not equally
applicable to individuals or corporations who have been designated by statute
as Crown agents. If those agents have the capacity to act for their own
purposes as well as for purposes of the Crown, they will be entitled to
immunity only to the extent that they act for purposes of the Crown. The fact
that they are designated by statute to be Crown agents for all their purposes
does not in my view preclude their acting for purposes of their own if they
have the capacity to do so. I believe that the authorities bear out this
analysis.

In British Columbia Power Corp. v. Attorney-General of British
Columbia (1962), 34 D.L.R. (2d) 25 (B.C.C.A.), the issue was whether a
public utility, the sole shareholder of which was the Crown in right of British
Columbia, was immune from discovery and inspection in a suit by former
shareholders. The utility claimed the immunity on the basis that under s. 6(1)
of the governing statute it was stated to be “an agent of Her Majesty the Queen
in right of the Province”. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council had the power to
appoint the directors of the utility and to name someone to exercise all the
powers, rights and duties of the Crown as a shareholder.

The utility argued that s. 6(1) made it an agent of the Crown
“for all purposes with power to act only as agent”. Sheppard J.A. said that he
had difficulty with that submission because it added words which were not
present in the section. Moreover, he pointed out at p. 31 of his reasons that

[Page 587]

even if those words had been in the section “the agency so
defined does not necessarily bring the agent within the immunity”. The issue
was whether the utility had “by the statute in question become an agent within
the prerogative” so as to be entitled to the Crown’s immunity. This had to be
determined by the true interpretation of the statute as a whole. Sheppard J.A.
said that:

In construing the statute, regard should be had to those
tests applied in determining whether or not there is such an agency as to come
within the prerogative of the Crown and the immunity from discovery.

He found that the utility was not entitled to the Crown’s
immunity.

In the course of his reasons Sheppard J.A. considered whether the
corporation had a contractual capacity apart from the Crown and he reviewed the
powers of the corporation, including the power to sue and be sued and the power
to enter into contracts in its own name. At page 35 he concluded that the
utility could aptly be described in the words of Lord Justice Denning (as he
then was) in Tamlin v. Hannaford, [1950] 1 K.B. 18, at p. 24:

In the eye of the law, the corporation is its own master and
is answerable as fully as any other person or corporation. It is not the Crown
and has none of the immunities or privileges of the Crown. Its servants are not
civil servants, and its property is not Crown property. It is as much bound by
Acts of Parliament as any other subject of the King. It is, of course, a public
authority and its purposes, no doubt, are public purposes, but it is not a
government department nor do its powers fall within the province of government.

DesBrisay C.J.B.C., the other member of the majority in the British
Columbia Power Corp. case, held that since s. 6(1) did not expressly
designate the utility as an agent of the Crown for all purposes, it was not
entitled to assert Crown immunity from discovery when it was acting pursuant to
the directions of the legislature rather than as agent of the Crown. In my
view, however, the reasoning of Sheppard J.A. embraces the broader principle
that a legislative pronouncement to the effect that a corporation is a Crown
agent

[Page 588]

for all its purposes does not deprive the corporation of the
capacity to act for purposes of its own as opposed to those of the Crown. For
example, in Conseil des Ports Nationaux the National Harbours Board had
been deemed a Crown agent for all the purposes of the National Harbours
Board Act. This did not prevent the courts from finding that the National
Harbours Board was sufficiently independent from the Crown that it could be
held personally liable for tortious acts committed in the course of carrying
out its mandate and that it could be enjoined from causing the plaintiffs
further injury through such acts.

I do not think that Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v.
Sheedy, [1927] A.C. 899, and Formea Chemicals Ltd. v. Polymer
Corporation Ltd., [1968] S.C.R. 754, are at all in conflict with this
reasoning. In Sheedy the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
considered the question whether the Board was entitled to assert the Crown’s
priority in the collection of debts owed to it by a company in liquidation. The
court examined the legislation setting up the Board and found that it was a
body with discretionary powers of its own. Accordingly, it determined that the
Board could not be described as an agent of the Crown. The court observed at p.
905 that “Even if a Minister of the Crown has power to interfere with them [the
Board], there is nothing in the statute which makes the acts of administration
his as distinguished from theirs”. This observation, in my view, simply
confirms that, viewed as a whole, the statute could not be said to have
subjected the Board to the de jure control of the Crown.

In the Formea Chemicals case this Court addressed the
question of whether the respondent Crown corporation had infringed the
appellant’s patent. The majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal (per
McLennan J.A.) held that Formea could not maintain an action of patent infringement
against Polymer because the latter was immune from suit on the basis that it
was an agent

[Page 589]

of the Crown ([1967] 1 O.R. 546). Wells J.A. dissented.

Mr. Justice Martland, writing for this Court, held that
Formea’s appeal should be dismissed. He said at p. 758:

While I have reached the conclusion that the appeal fails,
my reasons are not the same as those of the majority in the Court of Appeal.

It is unnecessary to determine, in the circumstances of the
present case, what may be the liability of an agent of the Crown, which,
without lawful authority, infringes upon the rights of others. I do not base my
decision upon, nor do I adopt the general proposition that an action in tort
will not lie as against an agent of the Crown.

Mr. Justice Martland decided the case on the basis that s.
19 of the Patent Act which gave the Crown the right to use the patent
accrued to the benefit of Polymer because it was a Crown agent. He did not
approach the case as a claim of Crown immunity by Polymer but rather as a
question of the construction of s. 19 of the Patent Act to determine
whether the right conferred by it on the Crown was available to Crown agents.

This Court’s recent decision in Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation v. The Queen deals, in my view, with a somewhat different
situation. In that case the question was whether the C.B.C. could assert Crown
immunity from prosecution for broadcasting an obscene film. The Radio (T.V.)
Broadcasting Regulations expressly prohibited the broadcast of any
obscene presentation. The Court held that although the C.B.C. was by statute
declared to be a Crown agent for all its purposes, it could hardly be within
the scope of its purposes to present a film which the regulations prohibited it
from broadcasting. The fact that this analysis was apt for the case before the
Court does not in my estimation mean that the only way an agent who has been
designated by statute as a Crown agent for all purposes can forfeit Crown
immunity is by committing an act which lies outside the scope of its statutory
purposes.

[Page 590]

I would approach the issue in the present case by following the
path laid out by the authorities already referred to. How then do they apply?

In my view there is nothing in the governing statutes of either
of the respondents to indicate that they were expressly or impliedly authorized
to carry out their statutory purposes by engaging in violations of the Combines
Investigation Act. It may be that the respondents could mount a case that
the only way in which they could carry out their mandate effectively was
through the acts alleged by the Crown. This question is not, however, before
the Court at this stage of the proceedings and any resolution of the issue
would have to await the outcome of a factual inquiry. It seems to me,
therefore, that neither respondent can be said to be entitled at this stage to
assert Crown immunity under the first step of the two-step test for immunity i.e.
express or implied authorization.

Turning to step two—the de jure control test—I think that
a distinction must be drawn between Uranium Canada and Eldorado. Uranium Canada
operates under the direction of the Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and
exercises its powers “subject to the approval of the Governor in Council”. The
identity between Uranium Canada and the Crown is accordingly just about as
close as it could be. If the Governor in Council approved the alleged illegal
acts of Uranium Canada I agree that Uranium Canada should be entitled to the
Crown’s immunity.

Eldorado, on the other hand, has a wide measure of latitude with
respect to the way in which it exercises its corporate powers. Indeed, I can
find nothing in the governing legislation or in its Letters Patent to require
it to respond to government directives. It is trite law that a corporation is a
separate entity from its shareholders and that it is to the corporation and not
the shareholders that the directors’ duties are owed. It seems to me,
therefore, that Eldorado’s capacity exceeds its authority as agent of the Crown
and that it can have “purposes” of its own. If this is so, I do not believe

[Page 591]

that its agency status is conclusive of its right to immunity.

The corporate powers of Eldorado are found in its Letters Patent
and Supplementary Letters Patent and in The Companies Act, 1934, 1934
(Can.), c. 33, pursuant to which it was incorporated. Under its principal
objects it has the usual powers of a mining company in relation to the
exploration for and development of mines and minerals. These powers were
expanded by Supplementary Letters Patent in 1968 to add:

and to purchase, lease, mine, refine, process and sell
uranium, zirconium or any other material or equipment relative to the nuclear
industry.

It also has extensive ancillary powers under both The
Companies Act, 1934 and the Government Companies Operation Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. G-7, including the power to contract in its own name, employ
its own officers and servants, and sue and be sued in its own name.

There is nothing in the Letters Patent, Supplementary Letters
Patent or the governing statutes to permit the government or the Minister to
interfere with the operation of the corporation. I note, for example, that
pursuant to s. 73 of the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
F-10, “the Governor in Council may make regulations with respect to the
conditions upon which an agency corporation may undertake contractual
commitments”. An “agency corporation” means a corporation named in Schedule C
of the Act and Uranium Canada is a Schedule C corporation. Eldorado, however,
is a “proprietary corporation” or a Schedule D corporation for purposes of the
Act and no similar powers of interference in corporate operations is authorized
in respect of this type of Crown corporation. Article 8 of the Financial
Administration Act provides the government only with a certain element of
fiscal, as opposed to operational, control over proprietary or Schedule D
corporations. It is, in my view, quite unrealistic to treat Eldorado either as
a matter of fact or a

[Page 592]

matter of law as the alter ego of the Crown in exercising
all its powers.

In my view the preceding analysis is in accordance not only with
authority but with sound policy. It seems to me that when Parliament wishes to
give the executive the special powers and immunities it requires to carry out
particular government responsibilities, it should do so in clear and
unequivocal terms and not rely on either the common law doctrine of Crown
immunity or s. 16 of the Interpretation Act. I think this is
particularly true when it wishes to authorize illegal acts. I see no reason why
the Court should contribute to a weakening of Parliamentary control over the
executive branch of government by holding that a statutorily conferred agency
status is conclusive of the agent’s right to immunity.

I have serious doubts that Parliament ever intended the
respondents to have a carte blanche to engage in illegal activities on
behalf of the Crown and to encourage other citizens to do likewise. The words
of Taschereau J., dissenting in Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v.
Attorney-General of Ontario, supra, at p. 195 come readily to
mind:

I am quite satisfied that it never entered the mind of
Parliament that C.B.C. could not be reached by the statute, while all the other
private stations, not agents of the Crown, and which are now on an equal
footing with the appellant, would be amenable to the law.

We might ask in this case whether Parliament ever contemplated
that the respondents would go about the implementation of their statutory
purposes by means of an illegal conspiracy with others, counting on the
protection of their Crown immunity and leaving their co-conspirators to the
full rigours of the law. In the case of Uranium Canada we at least have the
comfort of knowing that the corporation is incapable of acting without the
approval of the Governor in Council. With respect to Eldorado we have no
comfort at all.

[Page 593]

For the reasons given I would dismiss the appeal with respect to
Uranium Canada and allow it with respect to Eldorado.

1970, c. E-21, ss. 3, 13, 16.

Appellant brought extradition proceedings
against respondent Piperno. At the extradition hearings, the Extradition Judge
refused to admit in evidence three documents in the form of unsworn depositions
made pursuant to Italian law. Appellant’s application for mandamus to compel
the Extradition Judge to admit the unsworn depositions was dismissed by the
Federal Court Trial Division and the Federal Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Mandamus does not lie unless jurisdiction is
in issue respecting the performance of a statutory duty, as where there is a
denial or excess of jurisdiction. Here, even if the Extradition Judge were
wrong in rejecting the unsworn depositions because they lacked quality as admissible
evidence, his ruling could not be reviewed by way of mandamus since no question
of jurisdiction was involved.

[Page 321]

Although article XI of the Extradition
Treaty dealt only with sworn depositions, s. 16 of the Extradition
Act provided for depositions taken in a foreign state under oath or by
affirmation. Since Italian law did not provide expressly for affirmations or
sworn depositions in proceeding before a juge d’instruction, the Extradition
Treaty should be given a liberal interpretation to admit affirmations and
to accept as affirmations depositions taken in circumstances where the deponent
recognizes the importance of the truth being told on the particular occasion.
Therefore, the two depositions of the deponents, who had been warned of their
duties to tell the truth and were aware of penal consequences if they did not,
were admissible. The deposition of the third deponent, however, was
inadmissible since she was in no jeopardy and had accepted no obligation to
tell the truth.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal, affirming
a judgment of the Trial Division, dismissing appellant’s application for
mandamus against the decision of Boilard J. sitting as Extradition Judge.
Appeal dismissed.

Joseph Nuss, Q.C., for the appellant.

Pierre Poupart and Michel F. Denis, for
the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This case raises a question of
substance and a question of procedure. It arises out of extradition proceedings
in which the question of substance concerned the admissibility in evidence
before the Extradition Judge of certain depositions, tendered on behalf of the
Government of the Republic of
Italy in seeking to extradite the respondent Francesco Piperno. Boilard J.,
sitting

[Page 322]

as Extradition Judge, held the depositions to be
inadmissible. Other depositions of like character were in readiness for
submission but, having regard to the ruling of Boilard J., counsel for the
Italian Government decided to test it. He brought mandamus with certiorari in
aid, seeking to quash the ruling and to compel the Extradition Judge to carry
out a duty said to arise under article XI of the applicable Extradition
Treaty to receive the proffered depositions and others like them. Thus
arose the question of procedure, namely, whether mandamus would lie in respect
of the allegedly erroneous ruling.

The Extradition Judge’s ruling did not end the
proceeding before him. He made no order of dismissal nor, of course, any order
of committal. Whatever be the outcome of this appeal, the extradition
proceeding remains on foot before him. It may properly be said, therefore, that
the courts before whom mandamus was sought, either at first instance or on
appeal, are concerned with an interlocutory proceeding. So too is this Court.

The application for mandamus came before Addy J.
of the Federal Court, Trial Division, pursuant to s. 18 of the Federal
Court Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10. Addy J. dismissed the
application on two grounds; first, on the ground that mandamus did not lie when
there was no jurisdictional error and, second, on the merits of the issue of
admissibility. An appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal was dismissed in short
reasons limited to the question whether mandamus would lie. That Court held
that any error committed by the Extradition Judge was made in the exercise of
jurisdiction. No opinion was expressed on admissibility. Leave to appeal was
obtained to come here.

The extradition proceedings

Piperno was arrested in Quebec on an extradition warrant on September 18, 1981. He was admitted to bail
and has been at liberty since October 15, 1981. The extradition hearing began
on October 21, 1981. Three
documents in the form

[Page 323]

of unsworn depositions were offered in evidence
to the Extradition Judge. Each was made to or before a juge d’instruction in
Rome by the following three
persons, Stefano Lepri, Francesco Cipullo and Guiliana Conforto.

The deposition of Lepri, dated October 21, 1979,
is signed by him by the juge d’instruction and contains the stamped seal
of a civil and criminal tribunal of Rome. It begins with a warning to the deponent of his obligation to tell
the truth, in conformity with art. 357 of the Italian Code of Penal
Procedure, and recites that he has been informed of penal consequences
under art. 372 of the Italian Penal Code if he gives false
testimony. The deposition of Cipullo, dated November 21, 1979, is similarly signed and
sealed and contains the same warning of the duty to tell the truth and of penal
consequences if false testimony is given. There is this difference however in
the two depositions; that of Cipullo refers to an earlier statement to the
police made on May 3, 1979.

The Conforto deposition, unsworn like the other
two, is dated January 24, 1980.
It differs from them, however, because as a person charged with offences
(although unrelated to those charged against Piperno) she was not required to
answer when interrogated before a juge d’instruction and was not warned
of the duty to tell the truth and of penal consequences if false testimony is
given. She was only warned of consequences if she refused to answer or if she
gave untrue answers with respect to her name and other particulars.

The depositions were taken in alleged conformity
with Italian law and expert evidence as to that law was adduced before the
Extradition Judge. I shall come to it shortly.

No issue was raised as to the relevancy of the
depositions if they were admissible. Attention was, however, directed to
article XI of the Extradition Treaty entered into between Great Britain and Italy in 1873 and which admittedly applies to Canada. Article XI reads as follows:

[Page 324]

ARTICLE
XI.

In the examinations to be made in
conformity with the preceding stipulations, the authorities of the State to
which the demand is addressed shall admit, as entirely valid evidence, the
documents and depositions taken on oath in the other State, or copies of them,
and likewise the warrants and sentences issued there; provided that such
documents are signed or certified by a Judge, Magistrate, or Officer of such
State, and are authenticated by the oath of some witness, or stamped with the
official seal of the Department of Justice or some other Department of State.

This Extradition Treaty is incorporated
as part of the domestic law of Canada under s. 3 of the Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-21
which is in these terms:

3. In the
case of any foreign state with which there is an extradition arrangement, this
Part applies during the continuance of such arrangement; but no provision of
this Part that is inconsistent with any of the terms of the arrangement has
effect to contravene the arrangement; and this Part shall be so read and
construed as to provide for the execution of the arrangement.

Although ss. 13 and 16 of this Act were brought
into account by the respondent, it is clear from s. 3 aforesaid that
treaty provisions prevail against them if they are inconsistent. It is
desirable, however, to reproduce them in their terms, as follows:

13. The
fugitive shall be brought before a judge, who shall, subject to this Part, hear
the case, in the same manner, as nearly as may be, as if the fugitive was
brought before a justice of the peace, charged with an indictable offence
committed in Canada.

…

16.
Depositions or statements taken in a foreign state on oath, or on affirmation,
where affirmation is allowed by the law of the state, and copies of such
depositions or statements and foreign certificates of, or judicial documents
stating the fact of conviction, may, if duly authenticated, be received in
evidence in proceedings under this Part.

I come now to consider the expert evidence of
applicable Italian law. It was given before judge Boilard by Mr. Alberto
Sciollo, a judge of the Italian Cour de cassation who, at the time, was
in Montreal on leave from his
judicial post to repre-

[Page 325]

sent his country in the International Civil
Aviation Organization, whose headquarters are in Montreal. He gave uncontradicted evidence.

According to the witness, a criminal proceeding
under Italian law has a pre-trial stage before a juge d’instruction (like
a preliminary hearing here, as I assess it) and, on sufficient proof to satisfy
the juge d’instruction, an accused is sent to trial before the Assizes Court. There is no provision under
Italian law for taking sworn testimony at the pre-trial stage unless because of
illness a witness may not be available at the trial and excepting also
testimony as to identification of an accused. However, a witness before the juge
d’instruction is warned of penal consequences if he gives false evidence.
The warning of penal consequences if false testimony is given does not apply,
however, in the case of a witness himself or herself accused in another case.
Such a witness cannot testify under oath even at the trial proper, but the
evidence of the witness may be acted on by the trial judge to convict an
accused on that evidence alone, although given without any warning of penal
consequences if it is false.

The relevant provisions of Italian law,
art. 357 of the Code of Penal Procedure and art. 372 of the Penal
Code, read as follows (as translated from the French translation in the
record):

[TRANSLATION] 357. (Acts prior to the
deposition; swearing of witnesses for future purposes). Each witness shall be
heard separately. The judge shall advise him of his duty to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, and make known to him the penalties applicable
to persons guilty of perjury (372 Penal Code). He shall then question him as to
his personal identification and any relationship of consanguinity or interest
which he may have with the other parties to the proceeding, or as to other
circumstances that may be useful in assessing his credibility. He shall then
proceed to examine the witness.

[Page 326]

Witnesses shall not take oaths in the
preliminary hearing, unless the law provides otherwise (313, 363). The judge
shall in addition receive the deposition on oath of the witnesses he considers
necessary, when he anticipates that, for reasons of health or other serious
impediment, they may not appear in court[1].
In such cases the usual transcript shall be prepared, and the judge may direct,
of his own motion or at the request of the prosecution or of one of the other
parties (provided always that the necessary equipment is available), that the
deposition shall be reproduced using recording apparatus (496 bis). The witness
shall take oath according to article 449 (4622).

All the foregoing shall be mentioned in the
transcript (155 foll.).

In cases of recorded depositions the
provisions of paragraphs one, two, three and four of article 496 bis[2] shall apply.

…

372) (Perjury). Any person who, in giving a
deposition as a witness before a judicial authority, states a falsehood or
denies what is true, or withholds in whole or in part what he knows concerning
the facts on which he is questioned, shall be liable to imprisonment of from
six months to three years (375-377, 384; 349-352, 359, 458 C.P.P.).

In refusing to admit the proffered depositions
judge Boilard acted on the submission of counsel for Piperno that depositions
given neither under oath nor on affirmation did not satisfy the requirements of
the applicable law. Judge Boilard appeared to apply Canadian standards, as, for
example, those under the Criminal Code respecting preliminary inquiries
and provisions of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10,
respecting taking of evidence under oath or affirmation, on the view that there
was consonance between the Treaty and Canadian law so as to justify advertence
to such law. His reasons suggest that even if there was inconsistency between
the Treaty and otherwise applicable Canadian law, there was a question of
Canadian public policy involved requiring preference for Canadian law under
which evidence must be given on oath or by

[Page 327]

affirmation. He did not find the English case of
R. v. Governor of Pentonville Prison, ex parte Singh, [1981] 3 All E.R.
23, persuasive in its holding, inter alia, that a treaty provision
referring to “sworn depositions or statements” should be liberally construed to
extend to affirmations. This case was heavily relied on by counsel for the
appellant Government and I will consider it in due course.

The mandamus proceedings

I have already noted that Addy J. denied
mandamus. He did so because it was not a procedure open to challenge
admissibility of evidence when there was no excess of jurisdiction or refusal
to exercise jurisdiction and when the extradition proceedings had not yet
concluded. His support of the ruling of judge Boilard on the merits was
supplemented by holding the Singh case to be inapplicable to Canada and
by asserting the strong policy that prevailed in Canada, especially having
regard to s. 13 of the Extradition Act, against subjecting an
individual to extradition process otherwise than in conformity with Canadian
law, as reflected in s. 16 of the Extradition Act.

The Federal Court of Appeal refused to express
an opinion on the admissibility of the depositions but held, as I have already
said, that even assuming that judge Boilard was wrong in his ruling, mandamus
would not lie.

It was the strong submission of counsel for the
Government of Italy that the right to mandamus, the right to require the
Extradition Judge to perform a statutory duty, arose under article XI of the Extradition
Treaty which imperatively (“shall admit”) directed the admission of
evidence as therein specified. The difficulty with this submission, giving it
all the force which counsel sees in it, is that as a term of a treaty it must
be, so to speak, domesticated to be enforceable in Canada and its domestic
effect depends on the application of s. 3 of the Extradition Act and
thus brings into

[Page 328]

account a number of considerations canvassed by
both judge Boilard and judge Addy. On this view, I do not see how article XI of
the Treaty can be treated as resting on a statutory duty going to the
jurisdiction of the Extradition Judge.

A line of cases in this Court, among them Rourke
v. The Queen, [1978] S.C.R. 1021, at p. 1026 and Dressler v.
Tallman Gravel & Sand Supply Ltd., [1962] S.C.R. 564, at p. 569
have affirmed that mandamus does not lie unless jurisdiction is in issue
respecting the performance of a statutory duty as where there is a denial or
excess of jurisdiction. Moreover, the cases, for example R. v. N., [1980]
1 W.W.R. 68 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 72-73, point to a denial of mandamus where the
question to which mandamus is addressed is admissibility of evidence. Nor is
the appellant assisted in claiming mandamus by the judgment of this Court in Kipp
v. Attorney-General for Ontario, [1965] S.C.R. 57. This Court affirmed the
issue of mandamus in that case where the trial judge had wrongly quashed an
indictment before plea on the ground of duplicity when he should have tried the
charge before him.

Counsel for the appellant urged that the line
between refusing to accept evidence and refusing to accept jurisdiction can be
a thin one and that the distinction has no validity in this case, relying for
this position on R. v. Marsham, [1892] 1 Q.B. 371. It also was implicit
in his submission that the liberality of approach when international comity is
involved, as it is here, should extend not only to substantive matters, but
also to procedures of the domestic court.

Whatever disposition there may be to take a wide
view of jurisdiction in order to support mandamus, I can find no basis upon
which that remedy can be available here. First, the Marsham case does
not help. Although mandamus was held to lie

[Page 329]

to a magistrate where he rejected evidence, the
English Court of Appeal held that what happened amounted to a declining of
jurisdiction as to the whole inquiry before him. This was because, unlike the
case where evidence is wrongly rejected on the view that it would not prove the
matter into which the magistrate was bound to inquire, there the evidence was
rejected (when it was integral to the inquiry) whether or not it would prove
the matter in issue. The distinction is between rejection of evidence going to
the entire inquiry because of its character and rejecting evidence because of
its quality as proof. In the present case, the rejection of the evidence was
not because its character was such that no evidence of that kind could be
adduced but because it lacked quality as admissible evidence on the issues
before the Extradition Judge. Even if he was wrong in rejecting it, his ruling
could not be reviewed by way of mandamus, no question of jurisdiction being
involved.

Second, the Extradition Judge did not stultify
the inquiry before him by his evidence ruling. Judge Addy noted in the
concluding paragraph of his reasons that art. 449 of the Italian Code
of Penal Procedure envisages the use of affidavits and of solemn
affirmations and, after proper authentication, could be used in extradition
proceedings. Article 449 was, by consent, added in its French translation
to the record on appeal. It reads as follows [translation from the French
translation in the Record]:

[TRANSLATION] 449. (Swearing of witnesses).
All witnesses, even in the capacity of informant (7 et seq.),
complainant (9 et seq.) or civil party (91), shall take an oath, if they
have not previously sworn (357*, 418**) and if they are not expressly exempted
by law from doing so.

The presiding judge or the trial judge,
having duly complied with the provisions of article 142, shall cause the
witnesses to be sworn individually, as each of them appears to be heard, and
shall use the following formula:

[Page 330]

“Aware of the responsibility which you
assume before God[3] and
man, do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?”

No person shall be allowed to take an oath
who, at the time he gives evidence, has not reached his fourteenth birthday.
Nevertheless, the judge shall advise him of his duty to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, and apprise him of the action which may be ordered
with respect to persons less than fourteen years old who commit an act which
the law regards as an offence (224 Penal C.).

Counsel for the appellant contended that the
reference to art. 449 by judge Addy was improper and was in the face of
the expert evidence that sworn evidence can only be given under Italian law at
trial at the public hearing and not before a juge d’instruction. Accepting the
contention that art. 449 could not be invoked to supply affidavit evidence
in this case, I cannot regard judge Bollard’s ruling as amounting to a denial
of jurisdiction, unless it could be said that even if Italian witnesses were
brought before him (and none were so brought) he would exclude their evidence
because of its character and not because of its allegedly irrelevant quality in
the particular circumstances.

Third, the procedural remedies of the domestic
court, invoked by way of review or appeal of rulings of an Extradition Judge,
owe nothing to the Extradition Treaty. None of the Treaty’s terms affect
the review or appeal procedures of the domestic court. It is the domestic law
alone that determines what review or other remedies can be brought to bear upon
extradition rulings or extradition decisions.

In my opinion, therefore, the Courts below were
right in holding that mandamus did not lie.

Was any other form of relief available?

In the course of argument by the appellant, a
question was put from the Bench as to whether

[Page 331]

review of judge Boilard’s ruling could be
obtained by an invocation of the Federal Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction under
s. 28 of the Federal Court Act. That provision reads as follows:

28. (1)
Notwithstanding section 18 or the provisions of any other Act, the Court
of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine an application to review and
set aside a decision or order, other than a decision or order of an
administrative nature not required by law to be made on a judicial or
quasi-judicial basis, made by or in the course of proceedings before a federal
board, commission or other tribunal, upon the ground that the board, commission
or tribunal

(a) failed to observe a
principle of natural justice or otherwise acted beyond or refused to exercise
its jurisdiction;

(b) erred in law in making
its decision or order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the
record; or

(c) based its decision or order on
an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or
without regard for the material before it.

(2) Any such application may be made by the
Attorney General of Canada or any party directly affected by the decision or
order by filing a notice of the application in the Court within ten days of the
time the decision or order was first communicated to the office of the Deputy
Attorney General of Canada or to that party by the board, commission or other
tribunal, or within such further time as the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof
may, either before or after the expiry of those ten days, fix or allow.

(3) Where the Court of Appeal has
jurisdiction under this section to hear and determine an application to
review and set aside a decision or order, the Trial Division has no
jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding in respect of that decision or order.

(4) A federal board, commission or other
tribunal to which subsection (1) applies may at any stage of its
proceedings refer any question or issue of law, of jurisdiction or of practice
and procedure to the Court of Appeal for hearing and determination.

(5) An application or reference to the
Court of Appeal made under this section shall be heard and determined
without delay and in a summary way.

[Page 332]

(6) Notwithstanding subsection (1), no
proceeding shall be taken thereunder in respect of a decision or order of the
Governor in Council, the Treasury Board, a superior court or the Pension
Appeals Board or in respect of a proceeding for a service offence under the National
Defence Act.

If I am correct in my assessment of the present
case as involving an interlocutory proceeding, a question arises whether it may
be the subject of review under s. 28(1). The case law in the Federal
Court, and especially in the Federal Court of Appeal, has tended to the view
that a “decision or order” under s. 28(1) means a final determination: see
Mullan, The Federal Court Act: Administrative Law Jurisdiction (1977),
at pp. 22 et seq., prepared for the Law Reform Commission of Canada. I
am far from wishing to be categorical on this issue because to explore it would
be wrong when there was no consideration given to it in the Federal Court of
Appeal and when counsel for the respondent asserted that he was taken by
surprise when the matter was raised.

It would be improper, therefore, to turn this
mandamus proceeding into something else not heretofore considered. I should not
leave s. 28 without adverting to the provisions of s. 28(4) but,
again, I cannot consider this to be before this Court for the determination of
its application here.

The admissibility of the evidence

Although my view that mandamus does not lie is
enough to dispose of this appeal here, as it was similarly disposed of in the
Federal Court of Appeal, the substantive issue is of considerable importance
and deserves to be addressed, as it was by counsel before this Court and as it
was by Addy J. at first instance in the Federal Court. Moreover, since the
extradition hearing has not yet concluded and remains alive before judge
Boilard, a multiplicity of proceedings will be avoided if the merit of his
ruling is reviewed now rather than awaiting a final decision from him on the
request for extradition.

There are two critical questions that must be
answered in assessing the correctness of judge Boilard’s ruling and its
affirmation by judge Addy. The first is whether article XI of the Extradition
Treaty is an exclusive reference to admissible documents or depositions,
and only if taken on oath and authenticated by oath or by official seal, or
whether it permits also documents or depositions taken on affirmation and, if
not, whether the provisions of article XI may be supplemented by reference to
s. 16 of the Extradition Act. For convenience of assessment of
these matters, I reproduce again the aforesaid article XI and s. 16, which
are as follows:

ARTICLE
XI.

In the examinations to be made in
conformity with the preceding stipulations, the authorities of the State to
which the demand is addressed shall admit, as entirely valid evidence, the
documents and depositions taken on oath in the other State, or copies of them,
and likewise the warrants and sentences issued there; provided that such documents
are signed or certified by a Judge, Magistrate, or Officer of such State, and
are authenticated by the oath of some witness, or stamped with the official
seal of the Department of Justice or some other Department of State.

…

16.
Depositions or statements taken in a foreign state on oath, or on affirmation,
where affirmation is allowed by the law of the state, and copies of such
depositions or statements and foreign certificates of, or judicial documents
stating the fact of conviction, may, if duly authenticated, be received in
evidence in proceedings under this Part.

The second question is whether there is a
paramount public policy or other limitation in Canadian law which would
preclude acceptance of the depositions proffered in this case if they were otherwise
admissible.

In my opinion, even if it be the case that
article XI of the Extradition Treaty must, in literal compliance with
its terms, be limited to depositions taken on oath, I would not regard it as
inconsistent to supplement article XI by the provisions of s. 16 of the Extradition
Act which provides for deposi-

[Page 334]

tions taken in a foreign state to be either on
oath or on affirmation where affirmation is there allowed. This does not
advance the matter when there is no express provision for affirmations as there
is none for sworn depositions under Italian law in proceedings before a juge
d’instruction. It remains to consider whether what occurred here may be
regarded as an equivalent in applying considerations of comity.

I come in this respect to the recent judgment of
the English Queen’s Bench Division in R. v. Governor of Pentonville Prison,
ex parte Singh, supra. It involved habeas corpus challenging a
warrant of committal for the extradition of the applicant Singh to Norway where he was wanted in respect of
various drug offences. The Extradition Treaty between Great Britain and Norway was also concluded in 1873 and includes article X which is in terms
similar to article XI of the Treaty with Italy involved here. Both Ackner L.J. and Skinner J. who heard the
application were of the opinion that the words “sworn depositions or statements
of witnesses” should be construed as extending to affirmations. They so held on
the basis of giving an extradition treaty a liberal construction and, to a degree,
on the basis of the course of English legislation which recognized affirmations
although not brought directly into the Treaty. After the Treaty was signed on
June 26, 1873 but prior to an implementing Order in Council on September 13, 1873, the Extradition Act, 1873 was
passed on August 5, 1873 and it provided as follows in s. 4:

…the provisions of the principal Act
relating to depositions and statements on oath taken in a foreign state, and
copies of such original depositions and statements, do and shall extend to
affirmations taken in a foreign state, and copies of such affirmations.

The critical question then became whether the
depositions taken from witnesses in Norway involved affirmations. Section 168 of the Norwegian Penal Code provided
a penalty of imprison-

[Page 335]

ment for giving false testimony before a Court,
the prosecution or other public authority. The Norwegian Penal Code also
forbade the taking of an oath by persons who, inter alia, were under
suspicion of guilt of the act which is the subject of investigation. Here the
depositions were by accomplices, and hence they could not be sworn. However,
they accepted that the statements that they had made were accurate; the
statements were dictated into the court record by the judges and they were
signed by the witnesses. Three of the witnesses later stated that they were
aware of the penal consequences if false testimony was given and the fourth
said that he did not know of the penal provision when he gave his evidence but
said it would have been the same even if he had known of it and he repeated
that he had told the truth.

Both judges in the Singh case held the
depositions to be admissible as affirmations. Ackner L.J. said this (at
p. 27):

…it is agreed that the mere signature to a
document or the verbal acknowledgment that its contents are correct cannot
amount to an affirmation. Where then is the line to be drawn?

The answer cannot be precise: it must be a
matter of fact and degree dependent on the particular circumstances of the
case. I do not consider that the affirmation need take place prior to the
making of the statement. What is required, where the statement has been made,
is its adoption in circumstances which recognise the gravity and importance of
the truth being told on the particular occasion. I would not necessarily accept
that the mere acknowledgment, albeit before a judicial authority, that what has
been previously said is the truth would amount to an affirmation. But in this
case the acknowledgment before the judicial authority was made after the terms
or the substance of s 168 of the Norwegian Penal Code was drawn to the
attention of each of the alleged accomplices. The fact that the provisions of
this section were not drawn to their attention initially when they appeared
before the judge does not seem to me, in the circumstances of this case, to
make any material difference. They were brought back before the court within a
very short time of their initial appearance and their subsequent acknowledgment
in the circumstances which I have described of the truth of what they had
previously said amounted, in my judgment, to a sufficient acknowledgment.

[Page 336]

I am of the opinion that this Court should take
the same liberal view here with respect to the depositions of Lepri and Cipullo.
Each was warned of his duty to tell the truth and each was aware of penal
consequences if he did not. Each signed his deposition which was duly
authenticated by a juge d’instruction. However, those considerations do
not apply to Conforto. The consequences, not penal, in her case were merely
that her evidence might be acted on by the trial judge to convict the accused;
she herself was in no jeopardy and she had not accepted any obligation to tell
the truth. In my opinion, therefore, her deposition was not admissible before
the Extradition Judge.

Counsel for the respondent Piperno relied on R.
v. Governor of Pentonville Prison, ex parte Kirby, [1979] 2 All E.R. 1094.
That case had to do with the contents of the evidence brought by way of
deposition before the Extradition Judge and with its consequent admissibility.
It was inadmissible because under the English Fugitive Offenders Act 1967
it did not satisfy admissibility under English rules of evidence which applied
to extradition proceedings. The Kirby case is of no assistance here nor
is the judgment of the House of Lords in Government of Australia v. Harrod,
[1975] 1 W.L.R. (U.K.) 745,
which dealt with matters not involved in the present proceeding.

For the foregoing reasons, it is my opinion that
the Lepri and Cipullo depositions are admissible but not that of Conforto.

I would, however, dismiss the appeal on the
ground that mandamus does not lie. The respondent is entitled to costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Two convictions for same
act—Whether second conviction proper—Whether the Quon case continues to
govern—Whether s. 21 applicable to a charge under s. 83—Criminal Code, R.S.C
1970, c. C-34 as amended ss. 21, 83.

Appellant and two co-accused pleaded guilty
to a charge of attempted robbery while armed with an offensive weapon and not
guilty to a charge of use of a firearm while attempting to commit robbery. They
were acquitted on the second charge by a Provincial Court Judge on the basis of
the Kienapple case forbidding multiple convictions for the same matter.
On an appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal of Ontario reversed the verdict of acquittal.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Ritchie J. dissenting in part): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Dickson, Estey, Mclntyre and Chouinard JJ.: Section 21 of the Code with
respect to parties to an offence applies to s. 83; the appellant, who did not actually
use the firearm himself, could be found guilty of an offence under s. 83. By
enacting s. 83—a section materially different from the earlier s.
122—Parliament departed from the fundamental common law principle, found in Kienapple,
that no one should be punished twice for the same matter. Section 83
formed part of a comprehensive scheme of gun control legislation. In
section 83 Parliament created a distinct offence and provided in
unambiguous language that a sentence under it be served consecutively to any
other punishment imposed for another offence arising out of the same event. To
construe the section as inapplicable where a firearm was used during a
robbery would largely defeat Parliament’s clear intention to punish more
severely those who make use of firearms during the commission of offences.

[Page 285]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Ritchie J., dissenting in part: Unless Parliament gives a clear
indication that multiple prosecutions and multiple convictions are envisaged,
the common law principle expressed in Kienapple should be followed. The
formulation of s. 83 did not justify a departure from the principle and from
what this Court decided in Quon where the words “any criminal offence”
in s. 122 had not been extended to cover criminal offences of which an
essential element was “possession of a firearm capable of being concealed upon
the person”. Section 83 is not that different from former s. 122 in making
it an indictable offence “to use a firearm while committing or attempting to
commit an indictable offence”. The restrictive interpretation given in Quon should
be applied here and the conviction under s. 83 quashed.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie J. were
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting in part)—This
appeal, which is here as of right, concerns a number of issues raised by the
appellant in respect of Criminal Code, s. 83 following his conviction
thereunder by the Ontario Court of Appeal which set aside his acquittal at
trial.

The appellant accused and two co-accused pleaded
guilty to a charge of attempted robbery

[Page 286]

(an attempt to steal money while armed with an
offensive weapon, a twelve-gauge shot-gun). They were subsequently arraigned on
a charge of using a firearm (the same twelve-gauge shot-gun) while attempting
to commit an indictable offence, the attempted robbery to which they pleaded
guilty. To this second charge, brought under Criminal Code, s. 83(1)(a)
they pleaded not guilty. Evidence was called on that charge but the accused
did not testify. He was acquitted by the Provincial Court Judge mainly on the
basis of the Kienapple case, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, forbidding multiple
convictions for the same matter or delict. The Ontario Court of Appeal,
following its own previous judgment in R. v. Langevin (1979), 47 C.C.C.
(2d) 138 (which had not been decided when the Provincial Court Judge acquitted
here) held that Kienapple was not a bar to a conviction under s. 83(1)(a)
following the conviction of attempted robbery and it held, further, that on
the evidence a conviction should be entered under that provision.

In this Court, counsel for the appellant took
three points which it will be convenient to set out in the following order
although argued differently. He contended, first, that the accused could not be
convicted under s. 83(1)(a) when, at the worst, he was implicated with
his co-accused as driver of their get-away car and he himself did not use any
firearm. The contention was that a person could not be convicted under s.
83(1)(a) unless he himself used a firearm while committing or attempting
to commit an indictable offence; in short, a conviction was not open under s.
83(1)(a) by invocation of Criminal Code, s. 21. Secondly, counsel
submitted that even if s. 21 applied to an offence charged under s. 83(1)(a),
the Ontario Court of Appeal was wrong to find that the appellant was a party
here to the use of a firearm. The third submission was that the Kienapple
principle was properly applicable in respect of the charge under s. 83(1)(a)
because this provision, although brought into force in 1978 as enacted by
1976-77 (Can.), c. 53, s. 3, was substantially the same as its forerun-

[Page 287]

ner which was in force as s. 122 when R. v.
Quon, [1948] S.C.R. 508 was decided. In that case a charge under s. 122,
following a plea of guilty to robbery, was quashed by the Ontario Court of
Appeal and this holding was sustained in this Court.

The relevant statutory provisions on the three
points taken by counsel for the appellant are as follows:

83. (1)
Every one who uses a firearm

(a) while committing or
attempting to commit an indictable offence, or

(b) during his flight after
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence,

whether or not he causes or means to cause
bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment

(c) in the case of a first offence under
this subsection, except as provided in paragraph (d), for not
more than fourteen years and not less than one year; and

(d) in the case of a second
or subsequent offence under this subsection, or in the case of a first such
offence committed by a person who, prior to the coming into force of this
subsection, was convicted of an indictable offence or an attempt to commit an
indictable offence, in the course of which or during his flight after the
commission or attempted commission of which he used a firearm, for not more than
fourteen years and not less than three years.

(2) A sentence imposed on a person for an
offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other
punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or
series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time
the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).

…

21. (1)
Every one is a party to an offence who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do
anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in committing
it.

[Page 288]

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of
the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose
is a party to that offence.

I shall deal with the history of s. 83 when I
come to consider the submission on the application of the Kienapple case.

Turning to the first point taken on behalf of
the accused, it proves too much. If valid, it would nullify large
sections of the Criminal Code in respect of persons charged as
parties under s. 21. To take one striking illustration, it would preclude
a conviction of a party under s. 21 of murder under s. 213(d), which
uses words similar to those found in s. 83(1)(a). The main reliance on
behalf of the appellant for the contention that only a person who himself uses
a firearm may be found culpable under s. 83(1)(a) is the judgment of
this Court in Paquette v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 189. That case was
examined and distinguished in the associated case of Nicholson v. The Queen,
[1981] 2 S.C.R. 600, heard in this Court immediately after the present
case. It was pointed out there that Paquette does not have the general
effect contended for but rather has a special and limited force.
Section 21 is itself general and not special, and in its generality is
applicable to all criminal offences so as to bring parties thereunder within
the scope of criminal responsibility. It is only when the application of s. 21
is either expressly or by necessary construction excluded in respect of an
offence or a defence to an offence (as this Court stated in Paquette in
respect of Criminal Code, s. 17) that the submission made here can
prevail. That is not this case and, consequently, the Court of Appeal correctly
held that the accused could be culpable under s. 83(1)(a) through
s. 21.

[Page 289]

In contending, on his second point, that the
Court of Appeal wrongly found that the accused was a party to the offence
charged under s. 83(1)(a), his counsel submitted also that there was no
evidence that the accused was a party. At the most, so the contention went, the
accused was an accessory after the fact and outside of s. 21. The issues raised
by counsel under his second point engage the proceedings before the trial judge
and I wish to refer to them.

After the accused and his co-accused pleaded
guilty to attempted robbery and after their arraignment on the s. 83(1)(a)
charge, but before any evidence was called on that charge, Crown counsel
purported to read in an agreed statement of facts on the attempted robbery.
When the trial judge told him to read in just the facts to substantiate the
plea of guilty, Crown counsel said “They’re both intertwined. I’m in agreement
to read in the facts. There’s no problems [sic] there, but as long as My
Friends feel that it’s not going to prejudice their defence…” Counsel for the
appellant here then said “I don’t think there’s too much problem. We
substantially agree to certain facts on the guilty plea…” Various facts were
then recited by Crown counsel, the concluding statement being “And the person
who was driving the car, in which they were able to escape from the scene, was
Mr. McGuigan”. The latter’s counsel agreed that the facts were correct.

Before Crown counsel read in the facts and
before appellant’s counsel said “I don’t think there’s too much problem” and so
on, the trial judge said this:

Well I’m not going to take those facts into
consideration on a plea of not guilty. I mean they haven’t admitted anything on
a plea of not guilty, except that they’re here.

After the facts were read in, the trial judge
said “On the basis of the information provided by the Crown Attorney, and to
the extent to which that is acknowledged by the Pros-[sic] by the
Defence

[Page 290]

Counsel, there will be a conviction of each of
you on this charge [of attempted robbery].” Thereupon, the Crown called
evidence on the second charge, that under s. 83(1)(a).

Judgment was reserved at the conclusion of the
evidence, and in the course of his reasons the trial judge said that “The
circumstances of the case [that is the s. 83(1)(a) charge], I don’t
think I need to go into them in great detail as a result of the plea of guilty
but are…” and thereupon he repeated substantially what the Crown Attorney had
recited. Having said this he turned to the defence which was based on Kienapple,
and without more acquitted the accused.

The Court of Appeal made no reference to the
course of the proceedings to which I have referred but, having concluded that
s. 21 was applicable to a charge under s. 83(1)(a), it said this [at p.
310]:

We are all of the view that it was open to
the trial Judge to conclude that these accused entered into a common purpose to
commit the offence of armed robbery and that each of them knew or ought to have
known that the use of a firearm was a probable consequence of the carrying out
of that unlawful purpose. This was not a case where the firearm in question was
a small hand-gun capable of being concealed upon the person of one of the
accused in circumstances where the others might not know that he was in possession
of a gun. Here, the firearm was a shot-gun belonging to one of the accused,
carried by another accused and transported in a car driven by the third accused
and in which shot-gun shells were found. Not only do we think it was open to
the trial Judge to draw a conclusion that each of the accused had entered into
a common purpose to rob and that each knew or ought to have known that the use
of the gun was a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery, but we think
it was not open to him on the facts proved or admitted to come to any other
conclusion.

The question is whether there was reversible
error in the proceedings before the trial judge, error not cured by the
different position taken by the Court of Appeal. Counsel for the appellant
asserted, and did so emphatically, that he was not seeking a new trial but
rather acquittal, or, I

[Page 291]

would add, acquittal or nothing. In my opinion,
if there was non-curable error, I would not agree that an acquittal must
result, unless the trial judge was correct in applying Kienapple. If
not, the proper order would be to direct a new trial in respect of the
appellant.

There is no doubt that an agreed statement of
facts referable to a particular charge is not admissible in a subsequent trial
unless it can be said to amount to an admission accepted by counsel for the
accused as applicable to the subsequent trial: Cf. R. v. Falconer and Mann, [1970]
4 C.C.C. 362. In the present case, the transcript suggests that the facts
recited were accepted as an admission and that the trial judge and, indeed, the
Court of Appeal treated them in that way. This despite the trial judge’s
initial assertion that he was not going to take them into consideration on the
s. 83(1)(a) charge. The Court of Appeal, in the concluding sentence
quoted from its reasons set out above, referred to “the facts proved or
admitted”. It is difficult in these circumstances, having regard, moreover, to
the wide powers of the Court of Appeal in reviewing the propriety of an
acquittal, to say that it could not properly assess the evidence in the terms
recited above. Counsel for the accused conceded in his factum that “if the
Court of Appeal… was correct in holding that it was open to the learned Trial
Judge to look to the admitted facts on the guilty plea to attempted armed
robbery, then there was some evidence” to support the conviction of the
appellant as a party to the offence under s. 83(1)(a). There would,
accordingly, not be a strict question of law to support an appeal.

The Court of Appeal was entitled to proceed on
the facts proved, failing any finding on the facts by the trial judge. In
founding itself on “the facts proved or admitted”, the Court of Appeal
indicated in effect that there was no substantial difference. I do not think,
therefore, that it can be said that the Court of Appeal utilized inadmissible

[Page 292]

evidence. Its powers under Criminal Code, s.
613(4)(b)(ii) are in themselves ample enough to support its view of the
evidence so as to raise in this Court only a question of sufficiency.

Of course, this Court is entitled to determine
for itself whether there was any evidence to support a conviction, especially
when in this case there was no express or clear finding on the evidence by the
trial judge. However, in the absence of any countering evidence by the
appellant, I do not think that a finding of no evidence would be justified. I
would not, therefore, interfere with the view taken by the Court of Appeal
adverse to the appellant.

I turn, finally, to the ground of appeal founded
on the Kienapple case. This Court, in applying in that case a rule
against multiple convictions for the same matter or delict, pointed out that it
was open to Parliament to avoid the rule by prescribing multiple convictions as
it might see fit. The Court made the following pronouncement in that connection
(at p. 753):

Parliament’s power to constitute two
separate offences out of the same matter is not in question, but unless there
is a clear indication that multiple prosecutions and, indeed, multiple
convictions are envisaged, the common law principle expressed in the Cox and
Paton case should be followed. Neither the definitions of the respective
offences nor their history gives any support to the view that that common law
principle has been ousted. The limits of punishment are the same, and I have
already spoken of the ingredients of the respective offences.

In R. v. Langevin, supra, the Ontario
Court of Appeal concluded that the present formulation of s. 83, taken as a
whole, justified a departure from the Kienapple principle on the facts
of that case and supported a different result from that reached by this Court
in the Quon case under what was then s. 122 of the Criminal Code. The
Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R.
v. Eby (1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 27, the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Matheson (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 92
and the Quebec Court of Appeal
in R. v. Pineault; R. v.

[Page 293]

Bérubê (1979), 12
C.R. (3d) 129 all reached the result that the Ontario Court of Appeal reached
in Langevin. Even a little earlier, Kienapple was held
inapplicable in the light of the terms of s. 83 in R. v. Desrosiers (1978),
47 C.C.C. (2d) 253, a judgment of the Quebec Sessions of the Peace.

What must be determined here is whether s. 83
has indeed the effect on the facts of this case that the Ontario Court of
Appeal found, on the basis of the facts in Langevin, that it had there
and, consequently, in the present case. Did Langevin and does this case
justify a departure from the Kienapple principle and, more particularly,
from what this Court decided earlier in R. v. Quon?

Weapons offences have a long history in Canadian
criminal law. The Criminal Code of 1892 included two provisions found
earlier in R.S.C. 1886, c. 149, s. 4 and c. 148, s. 2. They were, respectively,
ss. 102 and 107, reading as follows:

102. Every
one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to five years’ imprisonment
who has in his custody or possession, or carries, any offensive weapons for any
purpose dangerous to the public peace.

…

107. Every
one who when arrested, either on a warrant issued against him for an offence or
while committing an offence, has upon his person a pistol or air-gun is guilty
of an offence and liable, on summary conviction before two justices of the
peace, to a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars and not less than twenty
dollars, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months, with or
without hard labour.

These sections were carried forward in the Criminal
Code, in the R.S.C. 1906, c. 146 (as ss. 115 and 120) and, again, in
the Criminal Code as it appeared in R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, as ss. 115
and 120.

These provisions were revised by 1932-33 (Can.), c. 25 and became ss. 122 and 123,
which were in the following terms:

122. Every
one who has upon his person a pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being
concealed on

[Page 294]

the person while committing any criminal
offence of which he is convicted, shall receive a sentence of two years in
addition to the sentence imposed in respect of the offence aforesaid of which
he is convicted.

123. Every
one who has upon his person any offensive weapon, with intent therewith
unlawfully to do injury to any other person, is guilty of an offence and
liable, on summary conviction before two justices, to a penalty not exceeding
two hundred dollars and not less than fifty dollars, or to imprisonment for any
term not exceeding six months, with or without hard labour.

A minor amendment was made to s. 122 by 1938 (Can.), c. 44, s. 7 so as to make the
provision read as follows:

122. (1)
Every one who has upon his person a rifle, shot-gun, pistol, revolver or any
firearm capable of being concealed upon the person while committing any
criminal offence is guilty of an offence against this section and liable
to imprisonment for a term not less than two years in addition to any penalty
to which he may be sentenced for the first mentioned offence, and an offence
against this section shall be punishable either on indictment or summary
conviction in the same manner as the first mentioned offence.

(2) Such imprisonment shall be served after
undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be sentenced for
the first mentioned offence.

It was this provision that was considered in the
Quon case.

In the Quon case the accused, armed with
a revolver, committed a robbery to which he pleaded guilty. He was also charged
with having on his person a revolver contrary to s. 122. He was sentenced to a
two-year term for the robbery and to a further two years under s. 122. The only
material change to s. 122, effected in 1938, was the addition of the words
“rifle” and “shot-gun” to the list of weapons and a re-arrangement of the
penalty provisions. In upholding the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal
quashing the conviction under s. 122, this Court adverted first to the Court of
Appeal’s view that the words “any criminal offence” in s. 122 could, if viewed
as exhaustive, encompass every offence under the Criminal Code. The
Ontario Court of Appeal felt that this would give too broad a scope to s. 122
and that its

[Page 295]

reference to having a revolver or any firearm
while committing any criminal offence should not be extended to cover a
criminal offence of which an essential element was possession of a revolver or
any firearm capable of being concealed upon the person (to use the exact words
of s. 122). The Ontario Court of Appeal had also pointed to what was referred
to in Quon as absurdities or inconsistencies arising from other
provisions of the Criminal Code, such as s. 118 which made a person
liable to imprisonment for up to five years if, not having a prescribed permit,
he has upon his person, elsewhere than in his dwelling house or shop, a pistol,
revolver or other firearm capable of being concealed upon his person. Again, s.
457(2), as it then stood, provided for a conviction of a person who, when
arrested for or when committing burglary, had upon his person any offensive
weapon—and he was liable to whipping in addition to imprisonment on conviction
of burglary.

Estey J., speaking for himself and Rinfret C.J.C.,
after reviewing various provisions of the Criminal Code, was prompted to
say this (at p. 511):

The construction given to this
section [s. 122] by the learned Judges of the Appellate Court avoids these
absurdities and repugnancies. Moreover, that construction seems to be supported
by a perusal of many sections of the Code. The group of
sections such as 115 to 129 deal in the main with custody and possession
of the specified weapons under certain circumstances; then the offences such as
sec. 264 (attempts murder); sec. 273 (wounding with intent);
sec. 446 (robbery) cover those cases in which the weapons are used in the
manner as therein described. In all of these latter offences the maximum
punishment provided is life imprisonment. In those sections where
possession or custody is the basis of the offence, Parliament has in mind the
mischief of risk to the public occasioned by the possession of one of these
firearms. Apart from 122 there is no section that deals with the having,
with or without a permit, the firearms specified in 122 upon the person of one
while committing a criminal offence. A firearm upon the person of a criminal
while committing an offence is fraught with the

[Page 296]

greatest possible danger to the public,
when detected, he resorts to his firearm with usually serious and sometimes
fatal consequences to one or more of the public. It is in sec. 122, as in
the other sections with which it is associated under the heading
“Offensive Weapons”, that Parliament seeks to punish and to that extent to
protect the public against the possession or custody of these firearms and
thereby avoid the consequences already suggested.

Kellock J., with whom Taschereau J. in effect
agreed, spoke in the same vein. He too rejected the literal interpretation of the
phrase “any criminal offence” in s. 122. He said this in reference to
associated offences (at pp. 524-25):

In my opinion it would be absurd to say
that a person liable to conviction under the provisions of subsection 2
[of s. 457] is also liable to be convicted under the provisions of
section 122, if the offensive weapon is a firearm. The absurdity of such a
construction is heightened by the fact that the penalty provided by
section 457, subsection 1, is imprisonment for life.

Coming to section 446(c) [robbery],
Parliament has by this provision, declared that for that offence, involving as
one of its main elements, the presence on the offender of an offensive weapon,
the penalty may be imprisonment for life and whipping. That is expressly the
penalty for the totality of that conduct. I do not think therefore, that there
is to be attributed to Parliament the intention that one part of that conduct
(where the weapon in question is a firearm) may be made the subject of a
separate charge under section 122, a procedure which would be ineffective
and absurd where the maximum penalty had been imposed. In any case where the
maximum is not imposed, it is to be taken that it is because the trial tribunal
did not consider that the conduct involved merited such a penalty. Surely it
cannot be said that in such a case Parliament has expressed the intention,
nonetheless, that the same tribunal may be called upon to impose an additional
penalty for the same conduct under the guise of a separate charge. While it is
the fact that in the case of the offences provided for by clauses (a)
and (b) of section 446, the penalty is the same as in the case of
an offence under clause (c), an offensive weapon is not there in either
case involved. The same considerations therefore do not apply as in a case
under clause (c).

It is quite true that under the provisions
of section 122, subsection 1, a conviction for the offence thereby

[Page 297]

provided does not depend upon a conviction
for the other offence to which the subsection refers but it does depend
upon such offence being proved to have been in fact committed. I do not think,
therefore, that this situation has any bearing upon the construction of the
section from the standpoint above set forth.

Although the approach of the Court in the Quon
case was on the basis of construction of s. 122, it nonetheless
followed, once the words “any criminal offence’’ were given a restricted
meaning, that the Court applied a rule against multiple convictions for the
same matter or delict. Kerwin J., who alone dissented, saw no reason to cut
down the scope of the words “any criminal offence”. However, adverting to the
view of the Ontario Court of Appeal that its quashing of the conviction did not
rest on res judicata or, rather, that it did not consider that defence,
he concluded that, if that be so, the case should be remitted to that Court to
pass upon the defence. However, if the Ontario Court of Appeal had decided the
point against the accused, the appeal should be dismissed. I shall return to
the Quon case later in these reasons.

The Criminal Code was amended in 1951 by
the repeal of former s. 122 and the substitution by 1951 (Can.), c. 47 of s. 115, which was similar
to s. 102 in the Code of 1892. The new s. 115 was as follows:

115. Every
one who carries or has in his custody or possession an offensive weapon for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace is guilty of an indictable offence and
liable to imprisonment for five years.

A revision by way of extension of this provision
occurred in R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 83 which was in these words:

83. Every
one who carries or has in his possession a weapon or imitation thereof, for a
purpose dangerous to the public peace or for the purpose of committing an
offence, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for five
years.

So the situation remained until the present s.
83 was enacted by 1976-77 (Can.),
c. 53, s. 3. It resembles the former s. 122, which was in force

[Page 298]

from 1934 to 1951 (with some changes in 1938),
and as already noted, was the provision that, subject to the changes in 1938,
was considered in the Quon case. What then were the differences between Quon
and Langevin that produced in the latter case a departure from the
former? I do not think that any difference can turn on the restricted meaning
given to the words “any criminal offence” in former s. 122, considered in the Quon
case. The question of principle raised here must be assessed on the basis
that the words “any criminal offence” do not include an offence of which an
essential element is the possession upon the person of a revolver or any
firearm capable of being concealed upon the person. Put another way, this Court
has said in Quon that the Crown is not entitled to vex an accused, to
subject him to prosecution, coming and going, so to speak; that is, to
prosecute him for robbery while armed with a revolver and to prosecute him also
for having that revolver while committing the robbery. These are, in short,
obverse faces of the same coin.

Section 83 is not that different from
former s. 122 in making it an indictable offence to use a firearm while
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence. The last mentioned
words (“while committing… an indictable offence”) do not appear to me to differ
in substance from the words in former s. 122, “while committing any criminal
offence”. There is, however, a difference in the introduction of the offence in
former s. 122 and the present s. 83(1)(a). Section 122 introduced
the offence thereunder with the words “Every one who has upon his person a
rifle, shot-gun, pistol, revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed
upon the person”, while s. 83(1)(a) uses the simpler expression “Every
one who uses a firearm”. In Quon, the robbery charge under the then s.
446(c) was defined as “being armed with an offensive weapon or instrument robs…
any person”. The weapon of the accused Quon, with which he was armed, was a
pistol or revolver. In Langevin, robbery under the present s. 302(d)
is defined as stealing from a person while armed with an offensive weapon. In
that case, the

[Page 299]

weapon was particularized as a rifle which, of
course, like a pistol or revolver, is a firearm.

So far, it does not appear that on the facts of Quon
and Langevin there is any material difference between them. In each
case, the robbery had to involve and did involve an offensive weapon. The
pistol or revolver brandished by the robber in the Quon case to
intimidate the victim, was clearly in his possession within the then s. 122;
and it could be said that it was “used”, if that expression had then been in s.
122. “Use” was, of course, the basis of the s. 83(1)(a) conviction in Langevin
and also in the present case. Of course, if in the Langevin case or
in the present case the accused had committed a robbery while in possession of
an offensive weapon, but without using the weapon (and I postulate a
distinction between possession and use), then he could not in any event have
been charged under s. 83(1)(a).

Where then did the Ontario Court of Appeal in Langevin
find the distinction from Quon? Martin J.A. who spoke for that Court
in Langevin, approached the matter from the standpoint of an assumption
that Parliament was aware of the existing state of the law when it enacted the
present s. 83, and hence aware of the rule against multiple convictions for the
same matter or delict. I do not see where such an assumption leads if the
legislation to which it is directed does not plainly support it. The citation
by Martin J.A. of civil cases to sustain what is in truth a fiction should have
a no bearing on the proper construction of the criminal law. It is as fully a
cogent principle that an accused is not liable to conviction unless clearly
caught by the statute under which he is charged as is the assumption invoked by
Martin J.A. in Langevin. The same restrictive interpretation (compatible
with the principle just mentioned) that was given in Quon was equally
open in Langevin.

[Page 300]

The learned Justice of Appeal drew a distinction
between possession as an element under former s. 122 and use as the element
under the present s. 83(1)(a), offensive weapons, which were firearms,
being involved in either case. I can see no basis for such a differentiation
when the possession or use, as the case may be, is geared to the commission of
a criminal offence in the one case and the commission of an indictable offence
(which is a criminal offence) in the other. Nor am I as certain as was Martin
J.A. in Langevin that Parliament had shown its clear intention to make
use of firearms in the commission of an offence culpable in its own right and
expressed it in language which reflected that intention. Again, there is
fiction involved in speaking of the intention of Parliament, especially in
criminal matters, unless it is manifested not by an a priori assumption
but by express language.

The Court of Appeal agreed that Langevin was
not of unlimited scope. The following passage from the reasons of Martin J.A.,
at p. 145, points to some limitations:

Mr. Hunt [for the Crown] conceded during
argument that it would not be reasonable to interpret s. 83 as applying to
offences which by their definitions in the Code require the use of a
firearm as a constituent of the offence, for example, pointing a firearm at
another (s. 84(1) (rep. & sub. idem)) and discharging a
firearm with intent to wound (s. 228). It is also obvious that questions may
arise as to the nature and purpose of the use of a firearm required to render
s. 83 applicable. To illustrate: it would not, I think, be sensible to conclude
that a person in possession of a firearm falling within the definition of a
restricted weapon for which he did not have a registration certificate and,
hence, guilty of an indictable offence under s. 89(1) (rep. & sub. idem) of
the Code, would also be liable to conviction under s. 83(1) if, while
committing the s. 89(1) offence, he used the firearm for target practice. The
scope of s. 83(1), and whether it may successfully be invoked in particular
circumstances, must be determined as those circumstances arise, but I am
satisfied that it is properly invoked in the present case notwithstanding the
respondent is charged with theft while “armed” with a firearm.

[Page 301]

Unless I mistake the meaning of this passage, it
appears to me to concede that if in the particular circumstances of a robbery
an accused has in fact used a firearm, he would be within the exclusionary
interpretation of s. 83 accepted by counsel for the Crown in Langevin. True,
he may be charged, in the formal language of s. 302(d) with stealing
while armed with an offensive weapon, but if the circumstances show that he
used the weapon it would be the height of technicality or formalism to say that
he also renders himself separately liable to conviction under s. 83(1)(a).
It is worth repeating that I speak here of offences which involve firearms as
essential elements. The statement of an offence in the terms of the Criminal
Code cannot be dissociated from the circumstances affecting the accused or
his conduct so as to expose him to an additional liability for that conduct
unless the additional liability is clearly assigned.

In short, I am not persuaded by what has so far
gone before that if Parliament had the intention ascribed to it, that intention
was carried out in the kind of language required to establish culpability in a
criminal matter. To hold a person guilty under s. 83(1)(a) where he has
pleaded or been found guilty of robbery, that is theft while armed with a
firearm, carries no clear distinction for me from a conviction of robbery while
armed with a firearm which the accused brandished resulting in an acquittal in Quon
of being in possession of a firearm while committing robbery.

There remains one important point raised by the
Crown in respect of s. 83 which Martin J.A. mentioned but did not emphasize. It
was put as follows (at p. 144):

Mr. Hunt, in support of his contention
that Parliament has shown a clear intention to exclude the rule against
multiple convictions in respect of the same delict, relied upon the language of
s. 83(2) which pro-

[Page 302]

vides that “a sentence imposed on a person
for an offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to
any other punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same
event or series of events…”.

There is, of course, no reason to deny the
effect of a penalty provision as establishing or fortifying a departure from
the rule against multiple convictions for the same matter or delict. The
situation in respect of penalty, however, appears to me to be indistinguishable
as between Quon and Langevin and the present case.
Section 122, in force when Quon was decided, provided for a penalty
in addition to that imposed for the primary offence, in that case as this,
robbery, and also for serving the additional penalty consecutively.
Section 83(2), dealing with penalty, also provides for consecutive
punishment but concludes it is to be consecutive “to any other punishment
imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or series of
events”. It is to be observed that s. 83(2) does not speak of the same matter
or delict. It refers rather to a happening or happenings and thus to
occurrences which may not arise from the same matter or delict. I cannot agree
that the penalty provisions of s. 83(2) achieve what the substantive definition
of the offence in s. 83(1)(a) did not.

The argument based on penalty would have great
cogency if it were the fact that s. 83 was limited in subject matter to the
offences in Langevin and in the present case. That, however, is not so.
As was pointed out in Langevin it applies to other offences in which, it
was conceded by the Crown, the rule against multiple convictions still
operated. So much then for the force of the penalty provision, and its lack of
force in the instances specified was probably the reason why Martin J.A. did
not emphasize it.

But beyond this, there are other offences in
which a firearm may be used which could carry a second conviction by reason of
such use without attracting the multiple conviction rule; for example, the use
of a firearm in connection with a rape.

[Page 303]

There would be no connection then between the
principal offence and use of the firearm, as there is in robbery in which being
armed with a firearm is an ingredient of the offence. Another illustration lies
in the offence of breaking and entering. Here, again, if a firearm is used,
there is adequate ground to charge its use as a separate offence not excluded
by the rule against multiple convictions. Other illustrations lie in the
definition of robbery in s. 302(a),(b) and (c) where being
armed with an offensive weapon is not a required element of the offences.
Again, being unlawfully in a dwelling house, contrary to s. 307(1) is an
offence which may involve use of a firearm but it is not an element of the
offence. Other examples abound in the Code but it is unnecessary to
detail them all. It is enough to say that there is ample subject matter for s.
83(1)(a), ample enough to allow the co-existence of the rule in Quon and
the rule in Kienapple.

For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that Langevin
was wrongly decided and that the appeal in the present case should be
allowed and the conviction under s. 83(1)(a) quashed.

The judgment of Martland, Dickson, Estey,
Mclntyre and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellant, Thomas William
McGuigan, and two other persons, were jointly charged that on or about January
7, 1979, at the Village of Angus in the County of Simcoe, they did unlawfully
attempt to steal a sum of money from Ik-Soo Kim while armed with an offensive
weapon, to wit: a twelve-gauge shot-gun, contrary to s. 302(d) and s.
421 of the Criminal Code. To that charge the three accused pleaded
guilty. The same three persons were also charged that on the same date and at
the same place they did use a firearm, to wit a twelve-gauge shot-gun, while
attempting to commit robbery, contrary to s. 83 of the Code. To that
charge they pleaded not guilty.

[Page 304]

Crown counsel read a statement of facts on the
charge of attempted robbery, following which a conviction was entered in
respect of that charge against McGuigan and his co-accused. (McGuigan was
sentenced to three years in penitentiary.) The Crown then called as witnesses,
in respect of the second charge, Mr. Ik-Soo Kim, his wife Sundae Tie Kim, three
constables, a firearms examiner, and a Mr. Elliott who identified a
twelve-gauge shot-gun entered as an exhibit and testified that he had given it
to one of the accused, not McGuigan.

The evidence may be sketched briefly.
Mr. Kim operates a variety store in Angus. On the evening in question, he
and his wife and baby were in the store when he heard a noise to the rear of
the store. Investigating, he saw a car with two occupants. He enquired of the
driver what he was doing there and received no response. The car drove away but
Mr. Kim recorded the number of the license plate on a piece of cardboard.
About ten minutes later two men wearing stocking masks entered the store, one
armed with a shot-gun, and demanded money. Mr. Kim grabbed the gun and took
it from the intruder. The gun discharged, pellets striking the ceiling.
Mr. Kim struck one of the men with the gun and chased both men outside to
a waiting car. He hit the front windshield of the car with the gun, damaging
both windshield and gun. The car left and Mr. Kim called the police who
arrived at 10:06 p.m. Twenty-five minutes later a constable in a patrol car saw
a vehicle of the description and bearing the license number noted by
Mr. Kim. The three accused were arrested shortly thereafter. Mr. McGuigan
was the driver of the car. The right front of the windshield was broken. In the
vehicle the police found a box containing nine shot-gun shells. A nylon
stocking was located on the floor behind the passenger side.

Provincial Court Judge Anjo acquitted all three
on the charge of using a firearm while committing an indictable offence. He
held that an essential

[Page 305]

element of the attempted robbery charge to which
they had pleaded guilty, namely, the twelve-gauge shot-gun, was an essential
element of the second count under s. 83 and therefore the principle of Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 against multiple convictions arising out
of the same delict applied. The Ontario Court of Appeal (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d)
306 reversed on an appeal by the Crown from the acquittal.

The appellant takes three points on this appeal.

First, he says that the Court of Appeal erred in
holding that he was a party to the offence charged. The error alleged arises
from the following paragraph in the reasons for judgment of the Appellate Court
(at p. 310):

Not only do we think it was open to the
trial Judge to draw a conclusion that each of the accused had entered into a
common purpose to rob and that each knew or ought to have known that the use of
the gun was a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery, but we think it
was not open to him on the facts proved or admitted to come to any other
conclusion. [Emphasis added]

It is submitted that the phrase “facts proved or
admitted” indicate that the Court relied upon the admissions of fact made
pursuant to the plea of guilty to the charge of attempted armed robbery. It is
argued that, apart from those admissions, the evidence against the appellant
consisted merely of the fact that he was driving a vehicle some twenty to forty
miles away from the scene of the offence, some one-half hour after the offence
and this vehicle had passengers who were connected to the offence of attempted
armed robbery.

I do not know what the Court of Appeal intended
by the reference to facts admitted. I agree with counsel for the appellant that
in the absence of consent (and there was none) it was not open to the trial
judge to look to the admitted facts on the guilty plea under count one in
determining that the appellant was a party to the weapons offence

[Page 306]

under count two. A careful reading of the
transcript makes it clear, however, that that was not what the trial judge did.
When the time came for Crown counsel to read the statement of facts, the
following exchange took place. Mr. Hermiston was counsel for
Mr. McGuigan.

CROWN: The only problems [sic] that
I can foresee Your Honour, as My Friend says, that would be the argument on
Section eighty-three is a legal argument, rather than an argument on the
factual situation. But I—if I read the facts in, there’s certain aspects of
that fact that are not acceptable to the Accused, then we’re in a position that
I—I may prejudice the not guilty plea.

BY THE COURT: I think if you just read in
sufficient facts to substantiate the plea of guilty?

CROWN: They’re both intertwined. I’m in
agreement to read in the facts. There’s no problems [sic] there,
but as long as My Friends feel that it’s not going to prejudice their defense…

BY THE COURT: Well I’m not going to take
those facts into consideration on a plea of not guilty. I mean they haven’t
admitted anything on a plea of not guilty, except that they’re here.

MR. HERMISTON: I don’t think there’s
too much problem. We substantially agree to certain facts on the guilty plea,
and if there’s certain facts that we don’t agree to, but nevertheless admit our
guilt. There’s no problem, I don’t think.

BY THE COURT: All right. Read—I’d like to
hear the facts on the plea.

CROWN: Your Honour, the facts on the plea
to the robbery, or attempted robbery, indicates that…

At the conclusion of the reading of the
statement, the Court asked the accused to stand up and then continued:

On the basis of the information provided by
the Crown Attorney, and to the extent to which that is acknowledged by the
Pros-[sic] by the Defense Counsel, there will be a conviction of each of
you on this charge.

CROWN: Can we deal with the next trial
matter?

[Page 307]

BY THE COURT: Yes.

CROWN: All right. I’ll call Mr. Kim to
the Witness Box.

Then followed the oral testimony of the seven
witnesses, the evidence of whom I have earlier summarized. Apart from the
statement of facts, there was thus a considerable body of evidence, including
the finding of a nylon mask, shot-gun shells and a broken windshield, which was
available against the appellant on the second charge. The appellant did not
testify.

During argument in this Court, counsel for the
appellant stated he did not wish a new trial for his client; he was asking for
an acquittal or nothing. It was pointed out to him that in the circumstances of
the case there was some evidence against his client. The Court was not faced
with a situation of “no evidence”, therefore no question of law was raised
which might engage the jurisdiction of the Court. Crown counsel was advised
that he did not have to respond to the argument on the first ground of appeal.

The second ground of appeal was phrased in this
manner: Did the Court of Appeal for Ontario err in law in holding that the
application of s. 83 of the Criminal Code of Canada is not limited to
cases in which the person charged with using a firearm during the commission or
attempted commission of an indictable offence, himself uses the firearm while
he is himself committing or attempting to commit the indictable offence?

It is contended that only the person who
actually uses a firearm falls within s. 83 of the Code and that s. 21
cannot therefore be invoked on a charge under s. 83. Section 21 of the Criminal
Code reads:

21. (1)
Every one is a party to an offence who

(a) actually commits it,

(b) does or omits to do anything for
the purpose of aiding any person to commit it, or

(c) abets any person in committing
it.

(2) Where two or more persons form an
intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other
therein and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an
offence, each of them

[Page 308]

who knew or ought to have known that the
commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the
common purpose is a party to that offence.

The Court of Appeal, speaking through
Mr. Justice Martin, rejected this contention when the point was argued in
that Court. The Court could not find any Parliamentary intention to exclude the
application of s. 21 of the Code to a charge under s. 83 and held that
both ss. 21(1) and (2) are applicable to a charge under s. 83, if
warranted by the evidence. The reasoning of this Court in Zanini v. The
Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 715 was relied upon. The Court of Appeal concluded (at
p. 310):

We are all of the view that it was open to the
trial Judge to conclude that these accused entered into a common purpose to
commit the offence of armed robbery and that each of them knew or ought to have
known that the use of a firearm was a probable consequence of the carrying out
of that unlawful purpose. This was not a case where the firearm in question was
a small hand-gun capable of being concealed upon the person of one of the
accused in circumstances where the others might not know that he was in
possession of a gun. Here, the firearm was a shot-gun belonging to one of the
accused, carried by another accused and transported in a car driven by the
third accused and in which shot-gun shells were found. Not only do we think it
was open to the trial Judge to draw a conclusion that each of the accused had
entered into a common purpose to rob and that each knew or ought to have known
that the use of the gun was a probable consequence of carrying out the robbery,
but we think it was not open to him on the facts proved or admitted to come to
any other conclusion.

With respect, I agree. The second ground of
appeal cannot be sustained.

I turn then to the final, and weightiest, ground
on which this appeal is brought, namely, that the rule against multiple
convictions enunciated in Kienapple v. The Queen, supra, was a bar to a
conviction for the offence under s. 83, because the shot-gun mentioned in the
attempted robbery charge is the same shot-gun as is referred to in the firearms
charge under s. 83 of the Code. The ground of appeal is stated thus in
the appellant’s factum: “The Court of Appeal for Ontario erred in law in holding that the learned Provincial
 Court

[Page 309]

Judge erred in holding that the Appellant may
not be convicted of the weapons offence and of attempted armed robbery, where
both offences arise out of the use of a single firearm during a single
transaction.”

It will be recalled that Provincial Court Judge
Anjo gave effect to this submission in acquitting Mr. McGuigan of the
firearms charge. Since the judgment of Provincial Court Judge Anjo, rendered February 27, 1979, four courts of appeal have
reached the opposite conclusion. They have held that the Kienapple principle
has no application: the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Langevin (1979),
47 C.C.C. (2d) 138 (rendered April 18, 1979, Martin, Houlden and Zuber JJ.A.)
and in the present case (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 306 (rendered October 3, 1979,
MacKinnon A.C.J.O., Martin and Morden JJ.A.); the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R.
v. Matheson (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 92 (rendered September 4, 1979, Freedman
C.J.M., Monnin and Hall JJ.A.) and in R. v. Nicholson, [1980] 5 W.W.R.
115 (rendered March 25, 1980, Freedman C.J.M., Monnin and Matas JJ.A.); the
Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division in R. v. Eby (1979), 49
C.C.C. (2d) 27 (rendered July 5, 1979, Hart, Jones and Macdonald JJ.A.); the

C.R. (3d) 129 (rendered October 29, 1979, Mayrand, Nolan JJ.A. and Roberge J. (ad
hoc)).

At the heart of this appeal is this Court’s
decision in R. v. Quon, [1948] S.C.R. 508 in respect of then s. 122 of
the Code and the question as to whether Quon continues to govern,
notwithstanding the material differences in wording between the former s. 122
and the present s. 83. Those differences can perhaps best be studied if the two
sections are placed side by side. Former s. 122 and present s. 83 read as
follows:

[Page 310]


 
  
  122. (1)
  Everyone who has upon his person a rifle, shot-gun, pistol, revolver or any
  firearm capable of being concealed upon the person while committing any
  criminal offence is guilty of an offence against this section and liable to
  imprisonment for a term not less than two years in addition to any penalty to
  which he may be sentenced for the first mentioned offence, and an offence
  against this section shall be punishable either on indictment or summary
  conviction in the same manner as the first mentioned offence.
  (2) Such imprisonment shall be served
  after undergoing any term of imprisonment to which such person may be
  sentenced for the first mentioned offence.
  
  
  83. (1)
  Every one who uses a firearm
  (a) while committing or attempting
  to commit an indictable offence, or
  (b) during his flight after
  committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence,
  whether or not he causes or means to cause
  bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable
  offence and is liable to imprisonment
  (c) in the case of a first offence
  under this subsection, except as provided in paragraph (d), for not
  more than fourteen years and not less than one year; and
  (d) in the case of a second or
  subsequent offence under this subsection, or in the case of a first such
  offence committed by a person who, prior to the coming into force of this
  subsection, was convicted of an indictable offence or an attempt to commit an
  indictable offence, in the course of which or during his flight after the
  commission or attempted commission of which he used a firearm, for not more
  than fourteen years and not less than three years.
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
  (2) A sentence imposed on a person for an
  offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other
  punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or
  series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time
  the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).
  
 


The differences between the two
sections are apparent and material. The robbery section in

[Page 311]

force at the time Quon was decided and
the present section read:


 
  
  446. Every
  one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life
  and to be whipped who
  …
  (c) being armed with an offensive
  weapon or instrument robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person.
  
  
  302. Every
  one commits obbery who
  …
  (d) steals from any person while
  armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof
  
 


Again there are differences in the two sections.
The present definition of “firearm” in s. 82(1) is narrow in that, for example,
it excludes a firearm which cannot be fired. It reads:

“firearm” means any barrelled weapon from
which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged and that is capable
of causing serious bodily injury or death to a person, and includes any frame
or receiver of such a barrelled weapon and anything that can be adapted for use
as a firearm;

In Quon the accused had entered a
restaurant armed with a revolver and robbed the proprietor of $75. He pleaded
guilty to an offence contrary to s. 446(c) of the Code, was found
guilty of having on his person a revolver, contrary to s. 122 of the Code, and
was sentenced to a term of two years on each count. The Appellate Court for
Ontario quashed the conviction under the second count on the basis that the
words “any criminal offence” in s. 122 “do not include any criminal offence an
essential element of which is the possession upon the person of the pistol,
revolver or any firearm capable of being concealed upon the person” (R. v.
Quon, [1947] O.R. 856, at p. 859 per Roach J.A.). A Crown appeal to
this Court was dismissed. Justices Estey, Taschereau and Kellock each wrote.
Chief Justice Rinfret agreed with Mr. Justice Estey. Mr. Justice
Kerwin dissented. If I understand the reasoning of the majority correctly, it
proceeded on two main lines. First, the words “any criminal offence” in
s. 122 must be given a narrow meaning, otherwise a person could be charged
under then s. 118 with the criminal offence of having a pistol upon his
person elsewhere than in his dwelling house without a permit,

[Page 312]

and also be charged under s. 122 with having a
pistol while committing a criminal offence. Or, a person might be charged with
possession of an offensive weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace
contrary to then s. 115 and be liable also to conviction for the additional
offence created by s. 122. Section 457(2) provided that anyone convicted
of breaking and entering a dwelling house by night with intent who had upon his
person any offensive weapon when he committed the offence would be liable to be
whipped, in addition to the imprisonment otherwise prescribed. Would he also be
liable to conviction under s. 122? Other sections were referred to, such
as then ss. 116, 117, 123, 124 and 446(c) as giving rise to
“absurdities, inconsistencies or repugnancies” if “any criminal offence” in s.
122 meant “any criminal offence”. The second consideration which seems
to have impelled a majority of this Court to limit s. 122 lay in the fact that
the Code had already provided maximum punishment of life imprisonment
for those particularly serious offences such as attempted murder, wounding with
intent and robbery, in which weapons are an element of the offence in the
manner described in s. 122. A further consideration voiced by one of the judges
was the view that a person should not be punished for a robbery of $75 when armed
with a revolver and then receive an additional punishment because he has on his
person the same revolver which was an element of the first criminal offence.

In R. v. Langevin, supra, followed in the
present case, the Ontario Court of Appeal distinguished Quon. In Langevin
the accused had been convicted of robbery and the single question presented
on a Crown appeal was whether a person who has been convicted of theft while
armed with an offensive weapon, to wit, a rifle, may be convicted of an
additional offence under s. 83(1)(a) of the Code of

[Page 313]

using the same firearm while committing the
indictable offence of robbery. Mr. Justice Martin, delivering the judgment
of the Court, answered the question in the affirmative. I should like to quote
two passages from the judgment (at p. 145):

Notwithstanding that in most cases of
“armed robbery” the offender will have used the weapon, none the less, s.
83(1), by making the use of a firearm an essential element of the offence created
by the subsection, unlike s. 122 which required only that the offender have a
firearm on his person, imports a further element in addition to those which
suffice to constitute theft while armed with a firearm.

The introduction of the requirement of the
use of the firearm while committing or attempting to commit an indictable
offence also removes some of the absurdities referred to in R. v. Quon,
supra, and to which a literal interpretation of s. 122 led, when applied to
offences involving possession of a firearm.

and later (at p. 146):

It is clear to me that Parliament intended
by s. 83 to repress the use of firearms in the commission of crimes by making
such use an offence in its own right, and one which attracts a minimum sentence
of one year consecutive to that imposed for the offence which such use
accompanies. The use of firearms in the commission of crimes is fraught with
danger and gravely disturbing to the community, and Parliament has sought to
protect the public from the danger and alarm caused by that use by enacting the
present legislation. It is not for the Courts to pass upon either the wisdom or
the necessity for the legislation, but to give effect to the clear intention of
Parliament expressed in language which reflects that intention.

Manifestly, the legislation is directed at
those crimes in which firearms are likely to be used, such as robbery, and not
offences where they are not likely to be used, for example, forgery. To
construe the section as not applicable to the use of a firearm during the
commission of the offence of theft while armed with a firearm would largely
defeat the clear intention of Parliament.

I do not find persuasive as a reason for
excluding robbery while armed with a firearm from the application of s. 83 the
fact that robbery itself is punishable by life imprisonment under the Code. Section 83
clearly would

[Page 314]

properly be invoked where a firearm is used
in the commission of rape or breaking and entering a dwelling-house with intent
to commit an indictable offence therein, both of which offences are punishable
by life imprisonment.

In R. v. Matheson the Manitoba Court of
Appeal, several months after the decision in Langevin, was called upon
to face the question faced by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Langevin. Mr. Justice
Monnin speaking for himself and Freedman C.J.M. (Hall J.A. differing on another
point), and without mentioning either Quon or Langevin, said, in
reference to s. 83 (at p. 101):

This is a recent offence created
specifically by Parliament to deter the use of firearms while committing other
offences. Parliament has recently and deliberately provided additional and
consecutive terms of imprisonment for such offences. Counsel for the accused
argued that Dubienski, Prov.J., erred in imposing multiple convictions for the
same delict and sought to find assistance in Kienapple v. The Queen (1974),
15 C.C.C. (2d) 524, 44 D.L.R. (3d) 351, 26 C.R.N.S. 1.

He then read s. 83 and continued:

Parliament in its wisdom has created a new
offence and provided in unambiguous language that the sentence in such new
offence is to be served consecutively. It has further provided that in the case
of second and subsequent such offences, the minimum consecutive term of
imprisonment should not be less than three years. This is intentional and the
language is unambiguous. If this constitutes punishment for the same delict, it
is a punishment which Parliament has decided upon. The section must be
enforced as written.

The Matheson case was appealed to this
Court. Judgment was delivered on June 22, 1981[1]
and the appeal allowed, but on another ground. The judgment makes no reference
whatever to the point presently under discussion.

[Page 315]

Three months later the Manitoba Court of Appeal,
differently constituted, decided the case of R. v. Nicholson, supra. Mr. Justice
Matas spoke for the Court, and in the course of his judgment said (at p. 118):

To clear away one question—the rule against
multiple convictions—I respectfully agree with the decision in R. v.
Langevin (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 138. The Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin,
Houlden and Zuber JJ.A.) held that:

An accused may be convicted of the offence
contrary to s. 83 of the Criminal Code of using a firearm while
committing ‘an indictable offence’ where that offence is robbery contrary to s.
302(d) of the Criminal Code and the accused has been convicted of
the robbery. The wording of s. 83 shows a clear legislative intention to depart
from the fundamental principle that an accused should not be punished twice for
the same matter.

Very shortly after the Langevin case came
before the Ontario Court of Appeal, the case of R. v. Eby, supra, was
heard by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division. Eby had been charged
with attempting to steal while armed with offensive weapons, to wit, a.45
calibre pistol and a.38 calibre revolver. He pleaded guilty to the charge of
attempted robbery. The trial judge acquitted him of a further charge under s.
83 (1)(c) of the Code, applying the reasoning in the Quon case.
The Appeal Division allowed the Crown’s appeal from acquittal. Jones J.A.
quoted at length, with approval, what had been said by Martin J.A. in Langevin
concluding (at pp. 32 and 34):

I agree with the reasoning of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in the Langevin case. When one examines s. 83 in the
light of the extensive revision of Part II. 1 of the Criminal Code it is
clear that Parliament intended to impose very severe restrictions on the
ownership and use of firearms in Canada. The object was to restrict the availability and use of firearms
during the commission of criminal offences. It has been aptly described as “gun
control” legislation. The original Bill C-83 introduced in Parliament on February 24, 1976, was entitled “An Act for the
better protection of Canadian society against perpetrators of violent and other
crime”.

[Page 316]

and,

It would appear that Parliament has clearly
provided for multiple convictions under s. 83 and accordingly the principle in Kienapple,
supra, is not applicable to a charge under that section.

The decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in R.
v. Pineault; R. v. Bérubé, supra, is consistent with that of the other
courts of appeal to which I have referred. The headnote reads:

As a general rule, an accused cannot in
Canadian criminal law be punished twice for offences based on the same set of
facts unless Parliament clearly indicates an intention to the contrary. In
enacting s. 83 and subs. (2) of that section, Parliament intended to
specifically ban the use of firearms and to impose a second penalty for the
same set of facts. Parliament intended to punish more severely those who make
use of firearms, and effect should be given to such purpose. A crime under s.
228 can be committed by means of a firearm, and also by means of other weapons,
such as a hammer or a crowbar. It can even be committed by the use of a fist.

Let me say, with respect, that I agree with the
judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Langevin and with the
judgments of those courts which followed that decision.

Four courts of appeal which have considered the
matter have agreed in six different cases upon an important point of criminal
law. Although not unheard of, it is a sufficiently rare occurrence as to merit
attention. It suggests that the point is reasonably clear, and one should be
cautious in arriving at a different conclusion. Many of the criminal cases
which reach this Court do so because of differing views of provincial appellate
courts. The unanimity in this case cannot but be significant.

That aside, it is well to recall the legislative
history of s. 83. It formed part of a comprehensive “gun control” legislative
scheme intended to discourage the use of firearms by the criminal element of
our society. Penalties were more than doubled. Compare ss. 84(1), 85, 88(2),
89(3), 89(1), 94(1) with the earlier ss. 86, 83, 90, 94, 91(1), 92.
Section 83 was added as a new offence,

[Page 317]

after the decisions of this Court in Quon and
Kienapple were well known. Section 83 is materially different from
the earlier s. 122. It is more narrowly phrased, less draconian, thereby avoiding
some of the “absurdities” which gave this Court concern in Quon. The
emphasis is now upon “use” of a firearm, a very different concept than “has
upon his person”. The word “firearm” is narrowly and clearly defined.

One of the matter which troubled the Ontario
Court of Appeal in Quon was the fact that the penalty provided by s. 122
was not additional punishment attaching to the commission of “any other
offence” but rather a sanction imposed for the commission of the specific
offence defined by the section. That concern was removed in the repeal of s.
122 and the enactment of s. 83. I will repeat s. 83(2) for ease of reference:

(2) A sentence imposed on a person for an
offence under subsection (1) shall be served consecutively to any other
punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or
series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time
the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsection (1).

The subsection contemplates that the
sentence imposed upon a person who uses a firearm while committing or
attempting to commit an indictable offence shall be served consecutively to any
other punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event. I
do not know what clearer language could be used to negate the so-called Kienapple
principle.

One must also, I think, ask why Parliament,
gravely concerned with the proliferation of firearm-related crime, would pass
legislation giving absolution from s. 83 to those using firearms in the commission
of those crimes in which firearms are most likely to be used. If the contention
of the appellant is correct, s. 83 is limited to those crimes in which firearms
are not likely to be used, such as forgery or rape. Such an interpretation
would seem to me to defeat the plain and express language of the section.

[Page 318]

In R. v. Quon, supra, Kellock J. stated
(at p. 520):

It is obvious of course that Parliament
may, if it sees fit, constitute two separate offences out of the same act or
omission or make part of an act or omission or one or more of a series of acts
or omissions a separate offence additional to that constituted by the complete
act or omission or the whole series.

The same thought is expressed in the Kienapple
case (at p. 753, per Laskin C.J.):

Parliament’s power to constitute two
separate offences out of the same matter is not in question, but unless there
is a clear indication that multiple prosecutions and, indeed, multiple
convictions are envisaged, the common law principle expressed in the Cox and
Paton case should be followed.

In my view Parliament has in the enactment of s.
83 departed from the fundamental common law principle of the criminal law that nemo
debet bis puniri pro uno delicto, elaborated in Kienapple, and has
shown that the use of a firearm in the commission of the offence of robbery
shall also constitute a separate and distinct offence under s. 83 for which a
separate and additional (increased in the case of second or subsequent offence)
punishment shall be imposed.

It seems clear that what was intended in the
enactment of s. 83 was to impose an additional penalty for what is, in effect,
an aggravated form of robbery. Robbery can be committed without either the
possession or the use of a firearm. The “use” of a “firearm” is not an
essential element of the crime of robbery. A person may be convicted of that
crime in the absence of a pistol, revolver or other firearms. Anyone who steals
from any person while armed with an offensive weapon, or even the imitation of
an offensive weapon, commits robbery. An offensive weapon would include a
knife, a broken bottle, a baseball bat, a bicycle chain. The offence is
complete if the accused is “armed with” the offensive weapon—he need not “use”
it. When Parliament turned its attention to s. 83 it is obvious from the
language used that Parliament was concerned with “use”, not innocent
possession, and concerned with “firearms”, not knives or toy pistols.
Parliament clearly contemplated that when in

[Page 319]

the course of a robbery a firearm is used,
multiple prosecutions and multiple convictions would follow and would supplant
the common law principle expressed in Kienapple and in Cox and Paton
v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 500.

I would have thought Parliament would have had
in mind the very sort of thing that happened in this case, an attempt to steal
with the aid of a shot-gun for the purpose of intimidating the victim. The
would-be robbers entered the store with a shot-gun which was obviously loaded
and, it would appear, cocked. Mr. Barbetta, the firearms examiner,
testified that in order to put the shot-gun in a firing position, it has to be
cocked manually. As I have mentioned, the weapon discharged when the proprietor
of the store wrested it from one of the accused. Shot‑guns kill or maim
with great ease at close range and the three accused are fortunate that the
pellets struck the ceiling and not Mr. Ik-Soo Kim or his wife Sundae Tie
Kim or their baby. This was an aggravated form of robbery which exposed the
intended victim to serious injury or death.

If Parliament had intended to exclude from the
meaning of the words “an indictable offence” in s. 83(1)(a) any criminal
offence an essential element of which is the having of a firearm, it could have
made its meaning clear through apt words, or it could have simply re-enacted
the former s. 122, which had been judicially interpreted restrictively, as the
new s. 83. Parliament did neither.

For the foregoing reasons, and for the reasons
given by Mr. Justice Martin in the Langevin case, I conclude that
the conviction on the charge of attempted armed robbery did not preclude a
conviction on the charge under s. 83 of the Code. I would dismiss the
appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND

Criminal law — Impaired driving — Care or
control — No intention to drive — Applicability of s. 237(1)(a) in a charge
under s. 236 of Criminal Code. R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, as amended.

Appellant was found intoxicated in the
driver's seat of his vehicle parked in a field at a party and was charged with
having care or control contrary to s. 236 of the Criminal Code. He
had earlier agreed to another person's driving his vehicle after the party. The
trial court acquitted him on the ground that s. 237(1)(a) applied in that
although he had the care or control of the vehicle he lacked the intention to
drive. The Court of Appeal held an absence of intention to drive a vehicle did
not constitute a good defence to the charge. This appeal is to determine the mens
rea for the offence.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer J.J.: Section 237(1)(a)
does not import an element of ""intent to drive"" into the offence of
care or control which is created by s. 236. Section 237(1)(a) is
concerned exclusively with the method of proof of a charge under s. 236; its
effect is purely evidentiary so that the offence created by s. 236 remains
unaffected. Proof that the accused did not enter the vehicle with the intention
of setting it in motion does not of itself lead to an acquittal where an
accused performs some act or series of acts involving the use of the car, its
fitting or equipment, which indicate that the accused had care or control of
the vehicle.

The case of R. v. Young has not
applicability; it was not concerned with the presumption created by s. 237(1)(a).

[page 232]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J., dissenting: Although s. 237 is concerned with
evidentiary matters it can be looked to as an aid to interpreting the patent
ambiguity in s. 236. It creates a rebuttable presumption of having ""care
or control"" over, not having intention to drive, a motor vehicle. An
intention to set the vehicle in motion is an essential element of the offence.
If an accused demonstrates that he did not have that intention the Crown has
failed to prove an essential element of the offence and the accused deserves to
be acquitted.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Prince Edward Island (1979), 24 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 91 reversing a judgment
of Plamondon J. on an appeal by way of stated case. Appeal dismissed, Laskin
C.J. and Dickson J. dissenting.

John L. MacDougall, for the appellant. 

Darrell E. Coombs, for the respondent.

The
reasons of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J. were delivered by

DICKSON
J. (dissenting)—The issue in this appeal is narrow but it has given rise
to conflict of views at both trial and appellate level for thirty years. The
question is: what is the mens rea for the offence of
having the 'care or control' of a motor vehicle while intoxicated? The relevant
sections of the Criminal
Code are ss. 236(1) and 237(1)(a),
reproduced below:

236. (1) Every one who drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not,
having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof in his
blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence
punishable on summary conviction and is liable

(a) for a first offence, to a fine of not
more than two thousand dollars and not less than fifty dollars or to
imprisonment for six months or to both;

(b) for a second offence, to imprisonment for
not more than one year and not less than fourteen days; and

[page 233]

(c) for each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not more than two
years and not less than three months.

237. (1) In any proceedings under section 234
or 236,

(a) where it is proved that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of a motor vehicle, he shall
be deemed to have had the care or control
of the vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or mount the
vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion; ...

Section 237, it will be noted, does not create
an irrebuttable presumption of care or control. The section permits the accused
to rebut the presumption if he ""establishes that he did not enter or mount
the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion"". What if the accused
successfully establishes that he did not mount the vehicle with the intention
of setting it in motion? Is he then to be acquitted? In plainer terms, is an intention
to set the vehicle in motion an ingredient of the offence of having care or
control of a motor vehicle while in a state of intoxication? If an intention to
set in motion is the mens rea of the offence,
elementary principles of criminal law would suggest that an accused who rebuts
the presumption in s. 237 must be acquitted, since the Crown has failed to
prove one of the ingredients of the offence. On the other hand, if an intention
to set in motion is not an essential ingredient of the offence, the accused may
or may not be guilty, depending on whether the Crown can adduce other evidence
to prove care or control.

The appellant, David Benjamin Ford, was charged
that he did on or about March 16, 1979 at or near Ebenezer, in the County of
Queens, Province of Prince Edward Island, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity
that the proportion in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
millilitres of blood, unlawfully have care or control of a motor vehicle,
contrary to s. 236 of the Criminal Code of Canada, as
amended. He was found not guilty of the offence and acquitted by the Provincial
Court Judge.

The Crown appealed by way of stated case from
which the following facts emerge. At 11:35 p.m. on

[page 234]

March 16, 1979 a
police constable on patrol observed motor vehicles in a field near the highway.
He drove to the location and found Mr. Ford sitting behind the steering wheel
of a vehicle in the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver. The dome light of
the car was on, and there were five or six occupants. Ford, owner of the
vehicle, had been in and out of it numerous times during the course of the
evening, going from one car to another. He had turned the motor on and off a
number of times because of the cold weather. During the course of the evening,
because of his impaired condition, Mr. Ford had agreed with one Darla Simpson
that she would drive his car when the party broke up and the car had to be
driven out of the field.

The trial judge held
that s. 237(1)(a) applied
but he held also that when Mr. Ford entered the vehicle for the last time he
had no intention of driving and had therefore discharged the onus under s. 237(1)(a).
The judge further held that because Mr. Ford
was sitting behind the steering wheel of the vehicle, which was running, and
had not yet traded places with Darla Simpson, he still had the care or control
of the vehicle but, because he had no intention to drive, he had a good defence
to the charge.

The Crown questioned
the validity of the decision. The question asked on the stated case was this:
""Did I err in law in holding that the necessary mens rea for a charge under section 236 of the Criminal Code relating to the 'care or control' of a
motor vehicle went to the intention of the accused to drive the motor vehicle
or set it in motion, and not the intention to assume or have care or control of
the motor vehicle?"" Although the question was phrased in that manner in
the case stated, the judge was of the view that the question should have taken
the following form: ""Did I err in law in holding that after finding an
accused in care or control of a motor vehicle, he still has a defence to the
charge by showing that he had no intention to drive the motor vehicle?"",
adding that his decision ""did not equate the intention to drive with mens

[page 235]

rea but rather as being a defence to
the charge"".

The
Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, in banco, in a decision reported at (1979),
24 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 91, held that, regardless of the manner in which the
question may have been framed, the trial judge had erred in holding that an
absence of intention to drive the motor vehicle constituted a good defence to a
charge of care or control. The reasoning of the Court was summarized in the
judgment as follows:

Put briefly and succinctly, I would hold the
law to be this:

(a) Section 236 creates the offences of
driving, or having the care, or having the control, of a motor vehicle while
impaired;

(b) the mens rea required, in the case of
driving, is either the driving itself, or the intention to drive;

(c) the mens rea required, in the cases of
care or control, is the intention to assume such care or control;

(d) Section 237(1)(a) creates a rebuttable
presumption of intention to drive;

(e) the successful rebuttal by the accused of
that presumption negates the effect of that section, but leaves undisturbed the
effect of Section 236, which then must be dealt with on its own factual merits;

(f) a conviction may then be obtained on a
driving charge if the evidence establishes actual driving;

(g) a conviction may then be obtained on a
care or control charge if the evidence, establishes an intention to drive,
(apart from the statutory presumption), or alternatively if the evidence
establishes an intention to assume some measure of active control over or with
respect to the vehicle, notwithstanding the absence of any intention to drive
[at pp. 95-96, emphasis added].

If
the Court of Appeal is correct we are left with this somewhat curious
situation: in a prosecution for having care or control of a motor vehicle while
intoxicated, an intention to set the vehicle in motion is not an essential
ingredient of the offence; nevertheless, the accused may be called upon to
disprove such an intention or be convicted if the Crown invokes the presumption
in s. 237. If an intention to set the vehicle in motion is not part of

[page 236]

the mens rea of the offence, why should the accused be concerned
with disproving such intention?

There are many
authorities on the mens
rea of a care or control
offence under s. 236, with various views expressed. There is one decision of
this Court, R. v.
Appleby, [1972] S.C.R.
303, which obliquely discusses the point. This discussion is admittedly obiter dicta, since the issue in that case was the
meaning of the word 'establishes' ins. 237. Ritchie J., writing for the
majority of the Court, held that s. 237 required the accused to prove, on a
balance of probabilities, that he did not have an
intention to set the vehicle in motion. Ritchie J. also commented, however,
that if an accused could succeed in disproving this
intention, he should be acquitted:

In giving effect to the statutory presumption
created by s. 224A(1)(a) in relation to a charge under s. 222, the position is
that if it is proved that the accused was impaired by alcohol or a drug, and it
is further proved that he was, at the relevant time, occuping [sic] the seat
ordinarily occupied by the driver, he shall be deemed to have had the care or control of the
vehicle, but the accused has the opportunity of rebutting this presumption if
he ""establishes"" by the balance of probabilities ""that he did
not enter or mount the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion"".

If the accused cannot so satisfy the court
then the statutory presumption prevails and he is guilty of an offence under s.
222, but, if he is able to provide the requisite evidence he must be acquitted
[at p. 316].

Mr. Justice Ritchie
based his observations on the discussion of statutory presumptions by Lord
Diplock in Public
Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj, [1970]
2 W.L.R. 226, at p. 232:

Generally speaking, no onus lies upon a
defendant in criminal proceedings to prove or disprove any fact: it is
sufficient for his acquittal if any of the facts which, if they existed, would constitute the offence with
which he is charged, are ""not
proved."" But exceptionally, as in the present case, an enactment creating an offence expressly provides
that if other facts are proved, a particular fact, the existence of which is a
necessary factual ingredient of the offence, shall be presumed or deemed to
exist

[page 237]

""unless the contrary is proved."" In
such a case the consequence of finding that that particular fact is
""disproved"" will be an acquittal, whereas the absence of such a finding will have the consequence of a conviction.

As Lord Diplock
points out, the effect of a ""reverse onus"" clause is to force the
accused either to prove or disprove the existence of a particular set of facts.
This set of facts is always an essential ingredient of the offence. It would be
peculiar to suppose otherwise. If the facts are not an essential ingredient of
the offence, then how can 'disproving' them possibly assist the accused? A
reverse onus clause makes sense only if the particular facts are understood as
being essential to the commission of the offence.

Various propositions
have been advanced as to the mens rea of care or control of a motor
vehicle. It has been said by some to be the intention to assume care or control
of the vehicle but, standing by itself, this is unsatisfactory as it does not
serve to limit or define the already vague actus reus of care and control. It has been said by others to be the intention to
drive the vehicle. There has been a reluctance to adopt this proposition,
perhaps because of confusion with the mens rea of the driving offence.
If ""intention to drive"" is the mens rea of the driving offence
how, one might ask, can it also be the mens rea of the care or control
offence? The use of the word ""intention"" is misleading in this
context. An ""intention to drive"" while one is driving is not the same
as the ""intention to drive"" demonstrated by a person putting keys in
an ignition and his foot on the accelerator. The latter is more properly
""intention to set the car in motion"". This latter proposition has
also been advanced as the mens rea required to constitute the offence,
and, as it is the language used in s. 237(1)(a), it would certainly seem to be
that most consonant with the legislation.

The use of intention
to set in motion' as the mens rea for the offence of care or control has
a number of virtues. It narrows the vague ""intention

[page 238]

to assume care or
control"" and gives precision and focus to the offence. It is consistent
with legislative intent as evidenced in s. 237(1)(a). It is more closely
connected to the mischief which the legislator seeks to control and it
eliminates the more extreme and absurd results which are within the realm of
the imagination.

Whether or not the
intention exists is, of course, a determination for the trial judge to make. An
accused may deny any intention to set the vehicle in motion but the trial judge
is in a position to believe or disbelieve him in the circumstances of each
case.

In the present case
the Court of Appeal states that s. 237 creates a rebuttable presumption of
intention to drive in proposition (d) cited above. With respect, this is simply
wrong. Section 237 creates a rebuttable presumption of having 'care or control'
over a motor vehicle. The presumption may be rebutted by the accused if he can
establish that he did not have an intention to set the vehicle in motion.

The error in
proposition (d) opens the way for the Court to conclude, in propositions (e)
and (f), that the rebuttal of the presumption in s. 237 does not lead to an
acquittal under s. 236. The Court treats the two sections as though they were
directed towards different offences. Section 237, apparently, creates a
rebuttable 'intention to drive'. This intention is, in the Court's view,
irrelevant to the intention to assume care or control: therefore, rebutting the
presumption in s. 237 ""leaves undisturbed the effect of section 236""
(proposition (e)).

Consider the
following situation. Suppose that the Crown's only evidence of care or control
was the fact that an accused was sitting in the driver's seat. The accused then
adduces evidence to establish that he did not intend to set the vehicle in
motion. In such a case, on the view of the Court of Appeal in this case, the
accused would have to be acquitted. The accused could only be convicted if the
Crown adduced some further evidence to establish care or control and the Crown,
in the example I have given, failed to do so. Thus the accused would be
acquitted.

[page 239]

Such a result would
be strange indeed if an intention to set the vehicle in motion were not an
essential ingredient of the offence of having care or control over a motor
vehicle while intoxicated. The accused would be acquitted by proving something
which, according to the Court of Appeal, was totally extraneous to the offence.
How can proving an irrelevant fact rebut anything? Such a proposition offends
common sense and must be wrong.

The problem with
which we are faced began even in the manner in which the question was framed in
the courts below and in this Court. The Court of Appeal was faced with the
question of whether a lack of intention to drive was a 'defence' to a charge of
impaired driving. The Court of Appeal answered this question in the negative.

In my view, it is
incorrect to ask whether a lack of intention to drive is a 'defence' to a
charge. The accused in this case is not asserting that lack of intention to
drive is a positive defence. Rather, his argument is that an intention to set
the vehicle in motion is the mental element of the offence of 'care or control'
under s. 236. Thus if an accused does not have an intention to set the vehicle
in motion he has not really established a 'defence'; he has demonstrated that
the Crown has failed to prove an essential element of the offence and thus
deserves to be acquitted.

It is obvious that
simply clarifying the issue does not resolve the appeal. The question which
arises is this: on what basis can it be said that an 'intention to set the
vehicle in motion' forms the mental element of the offence under s. 236?

Section 236 itself
does not specify the requisite mental element for the offence of care or
control. The section specifies that if one has ""care or control of a motor
vehicle, whether it is in motion or not"", and one's blood alcohol level
exceeds a certain level, then an offence has been committed. The section does
not specifically indicate the

[page 240]

mental element required
to establish 'care or control'. Is the mental element the intention to have
care or control? On this view an individual who is sitting in his living room with the keys to his car
in his pocket has the
mental element necessary to constitute the offence. Care or control in the Criminal
Code should not be confused with the indicia of possession under the law of property. An intention simply to exclude others from
control is not sufficient; in my view one must also have an intention to set
the vehicle in motion before one comes within the subsection.

Surely it is
legitimate for a court to look at s. 237 in order to assist it in resolving the
ambiguity present in s. 236. We are expected to read the sections in their
entirety in an attempt to give meaning to a part thereof.

1 do not think it
helps in the resolution of the question before the Court to argue that s. 237
is concerned with evidentiary matters only and therefore the offence created by
s. 236 remains unaffected by it. I do not suggest that s. 237 somehow alters s.
236 or creates a positive defence to the charge under s. 236. I agree that s.
237 is concerned with evidentiary matters. However this does not mean that we
cannot look to s. 237 as an aid to interpreting the patent ambiguity in s. 236.

In my view s. 237 is
available as an important interpretative aid in determining the mens rea for
a charge under s. 236. Section 237 becomes absurd unless an intention to put
the vehicle in motion is part of the mental element of care or control under s.
236. Otherwise, if the Crown is right, s. 237 is the only section in the Code
which imputes a certain mental element to an accused even though that
mental element is not the mens rea of the offence.

Assuming that an
intention to set the vehicle in motion constitutes the mental element of the
offence, what is the result if the accused can demonstrate that he did not have
that intention? The question answers itself. If an essential element of the
offence is lacking, then the accused must be

[page 241]

acquitted. The Crown has simply failed to prove
its case.

Normally, the rule is that the Crown must prove
the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. It is obvious that the
Crown may have trouble proving that an accused sitting in a car had the
intention of setting the car in motion. Section 237 changes that. It alters the
burden of proof in favour of the Crown. If an accused is found sitting in the
driver's seat, we presume that he had an intention to set the vehicle in
motion. It will then rest on him to disprove that he had any such intention.
His proof will be on a balance of probabilities. If he succeeds why should he
not be acquitted, as his conduct is not within the mischief aimed at?

Quite apart from authority, it seems to me that
the appellant's position is the stronger one, simply on the basis of statutory
construction and the nature and effect of statutory presumptions. I must say,
however, that I am in agreement with the views of Jessup J.A., speaking for a
unanimous Ontario Court of Appeal (Jessup, Dubin and Martin JJ.A.) in R. v. McPhee; R. v. Mullen (1975), 30
C.R.N.S. 4:

In a prosecution
under s. 234 [now s. 236] if the only proof offered by the Crown of care or control is
that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of
a motor vehicle and the accused establishes that he did not enter or mount the
vehicle for the purpose of. setting it in motion, the accused must
be acquitted. It follows therefore, in my
opinion, that in a prosecution under
s. 234 it is an essential element of the offence that the accused had the
purpose or intention of setting the vehicle in motion, either personally
or through the agency of a driver he controlled. The accused must have the intent to assume control over the
operation of the car [at pp. 6-7].

Leave to appeal to this Court from this decision
was dismissed on June 16, 1975.

R. v. McPhee; R.
v. Mullen, supra, was applied in R. v. White (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 353,
(Ont. C.A.). Martin J.A. speaking for a Court consisting of himself, Howland
C.J.O. and Brooke J.A. said:

[page 242]

This Court held in R. v. McPhee; R. v. Mullen (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 412, 9 O.R. (2d) 687, 30 C.R.N.S. 4, that an intention to operate the motor vehicle is an
essential element of ""care or control"". A fair reading of the
appellant's evidence supports a conclusion that he had abandoned any intention
of driving his motor vehicle after it had
become stuck in the ditch. If the appellant did not intend to operate the vehicle after he had consumed the liquor, subsequent to
the car going into the ditch, the
offence was not established [at p. 354].

I would add only this. If I should be wrong and
intent to set the vehicle in motion is not an ingredient of the offence of care
or control I would nonetheless enter an acquittal in this case as Mr. Ford
rebutted the presumption under s. 237(1)(a) and the Crown has not in my opinion
adduced further evidence sufficient to warrant a finding of care or control.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and restore the verdict of acquittal rendered at trial.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an
appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, holding that the learned trial
judge had erred in holding that an absence of intention to drive a motor
vehicle constituted a good defence to a charge of care or control under s. 236
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
and ordering that this matter be remitted back to His Honour Provincial Judge
Bertrand R. Plamondon for disposition in conformity with the judgment of the
Appeal Division.

The facts of this case are not in dispute and
are fully set out in the case stated by the learned provincial judge which
reads as follows:

1. On the 2nd day of May, 1979, an
Information was laid under oath before E.
Dorothy Kitson, Justice of the Peace for the Province of Prince Edward
Island, by Donald Gosse, a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, for that the above-named David Benjamin

[page 243]

Ford did on or about the 16th day of March
A.D. 1979, at or near Ebenezer, in the County of Queens, Province of Prince
Edward Island, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion
in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood,
unlawfully have care or control of a motor vehicle, contrary to Section 236 of
the Criminal Code of Canada and amendments thereto. On the 9th day of May A.D.
1979, the said charge was duly read before me in the presence of the accused
and after hearing the evidence adduced and submissions made on behalf of the
Crown and the accused, I found the said David Benjamin Ford not guilty of the
said offence and acquitted him. At the request of Darrell E. Coombs, Solicitor
for Her Majesty the Queen, I state the following case for the consideration of
this Honourable Court.

(i) It was shown before me that Cst. W.
Gairns was patrolling in the Ebenezer area in Queens County, Province of Prince
Edward Island, on Highway No. 224 at the hour of 11.35 p.m., on the 16th day of
March, 1979.

(ii) Some motor vehicles attracted his
attention in a field nearby the highway and he drove the police car to the
location.

(iii) The officer found the accused sitting
behind the steering wheel in the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver, the
dome light of one vehicle was on and there were five or six occupants in this
particular vehicle.

(iv) As a result of his observation of the
accused, (the usual signs of impairment), the said officer made forthwith at
11.45 p.m. a demand on the accused to provide samples of his breath, which
demand the accused understood and agreed to provide.

(v) The officer and the accused proceeded to
Charlottetown detachment, where breathalyzer tests were performed on the
accused and a copy of the certificate together with a notice of intention to
produce the certificate was served on the accused on the 17th day of March,
1979, the said certificate showing that at the hour of 12.42 a.m. on the 17th
day of March, 1979, the result of the chemical analysis shows a reading of 190
milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and at the hour of 1.06 a.m.
on the 17th day of March, 1979, the result of the chemical analysis was 170
milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.

(vi) The accused, who owns the car, had been
in and out of the motor vehicle numerous times during the course of the
evening, going from one car to the other, and had also turned the motor of his
motor vehicle on and off a number of times because of the cold weather.

(vii) During the course of the evening,
because of his impaired condition, the accused had agreed with one Darla
Simpson for her to drive the accused's motor

[page 244]

vehicle when the party was going to break up
and the car had to be driven out of the field.

2. I held that Section 237(1)(a) applied to
the case at bar and when the accused entered the motor vehicle the last time,
he had no intention to drive, therefore, he had discharged the onus under
Section 237(1)(a). However, because the accused was still sitting behind the
steering wheel of his own motor vehicle which was running and had not yet
traded places with Darla Simpson, I held that he still had the care and control
of the motor vehicle, but because he had
no intention to drive, I held that he had a good defence to the charge of having
the care and control of a motor vehicle. [The italics are my own.]

3. The Appellant, Her Majesty the Queen,
desires to question the validity of the decision on the ground that it is
erroneous in point of law, the grounds of appeal as stated by the Appellant
being,

""Did I err in law in holding that the
necessary mens rea for a charge under Section 236 of the Criminal Code relating
to the care and control of a motor vehicle went to the intention of the accused
to drive the motor vehicle or set it in motion and not the intention to assume
or have care and control of the motor vehicle?""

4. It is humbly submitted that the question
as framed is not supported by my decision but should take the following form,

""Did I err in law in holding that after
finding an accused in care or control of a motor vehicle, he still has a
defence to the charge by showing that he had no intention to drive the motor
vehicle?""

It is submitted that my decision did not
equate the intention to drive with means rea [sic] but rather as
being a defence to the charge.

In
the course of the reasons for judgment which he delivered on behalf
of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, Mr.
Justice McQuaid answered the question so posed in the following terms:

Regardless of the manner in which the
question put to this Court may have been framed, I am of opinion, and hold,
that the learned trial judge did err in holding that an absence of intention to
drive a motor vehicle constituted a good defence to a charge of care or
control.

[page 245]

The
notice of appeal to this Court raises the following two grounds of appeal:

1. Whether the Supreme Court of Prince Edward
Island, in Banco erred in holding that
an absence of intention to drive a motor
vehicle does not constitute a valid defence to a charge under section
236 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970 —
Cap. C-34;

2. Whether the Supreme Court of Prince Edward
Island, in Banco erred in reversing
the position it had adopted with respect to
the above-noted defence in R. v. Young (1979), 21 Nfld. Sc P.E.I.R. 77 (P.E.I.
S.C. In Banco).

The
disposition of this appeal turns in great measure upon the answer to the first
question and is dependant upon whether or not s. 237 of the Code is to be construed as importing an element of ""intent to
drive"" into the offence of ""care or control"" which is created by
s. 236. The relevant provisions of s. 236 read as follows:

236. (1) Every one who drives a motor vehicle
or has the care or control of a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not, having consumed alcohol in such a
quantity that the proportion thereof in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood,
is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary
conviction and is liable .. .

It
is to be noted that the offence of ""care or control"" created by this
section is not dependant upon the motor vehicle being in motion, but it is
nevertheless contended that s. 237(1)(a) is to be construed as meaning that the
question of whether or not at the time when the accused entered or mounted the
vehicle it was ""for the purpose of setting it in motion"" is central
to a determination of his guilt or innocence under s. 236. Section 237 (1)(a)
provides:

237. (1) In any proceedings under section 234
or 236,

(a) where it is proved that the accused
occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver of a motor vehicle, he
shall be deemed to have had the care or control
of the vehicle unless he establishes that he did not enter or mount the
vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion; . . .

I
should say at the outset that I am in agreement with the Appeal Division, for
the reasons

[page 246]

stated by Mr. Justice
McQuaid, that s. 237(1)(a) is concerned exclusively with the method of proof of
a charge under s. 236 and that its effect is purely evidentiary so that the
offence created by the latter section remains unaffected by it. There can be no
doubt that if the case for the Crown rests solely upon proof that the accused
occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by the driver, he is not deemed to have
had care or control of the vehicle if he can establish that he did not enter or
mount it for the purpose of setting it in motion. In the latter event the
presumption is rebutted and the Crown is deprived of the advantage of the
deeming provision of s. 237(1)(a). In practical terms the only result of the
accused having established that he did not mount the vehicle for the purpose of
setting it in motion, is that the Crown is seized with the burden of proof
without the aid of the presumption. The latter words of s. 237(1)(a) are in my
view definitive of the evidence required of the accused in order to shift the
burden of proof back to the Crown, but I cannot see that they purport to create
or define a defence to the charge or to alter the nature of the offence created
by s. 236 so as to import ""an intention to drive"" as an essential
element which the Crown is required to prove in order to secure a conviction
under s. 236.

In this regard it is
to be recalled that s. 236 creating the offence of ""care or control of a
motor vehicle while intoxicated"" was enacted as part of the Criminal Code by 1925 (Can.), c. 38, s. 5, whereas it was
not until 1947 (by c. 55, s. 10) that the presumption which is now s. 237(1)(a)
was created. I adopt what was said by Limerick J.A. in the course of his
reasons for judgment in the Appellate Division of the New Brunswick Supreme
Court in R. v. Price (1978),
40 C.C.C. (2d) 378, at p. 383, where he said:

This section is enabling legislation of
evidentiary value to the Crown. It creates, under certain specific
circumstances, a burden on the accused to rebut a prima
facie case or a presumption created by statute. The
section has no application (1) unless the
accused is found occupying the driver's seat and (2) unless the Crown elects to
invoke the section. The Crown may rely on other evidence to prove care or control, in which case the section has no applicability. The section
does not purport

[page 247]

to change the law as to the meaning of
""care or control"" as it existed prior to its enactment.

Indeed s. 37(3) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, provides:

37. (3) The repeal or amendment of an enactment
in whole or in part shall not be deemed to be or to involve any declaration as to the previous state of the law.

The amendment being enabling and directed to
a specific purpose should not, therefore, be interpreted as being restrictive or as amending or defining the
meaning of the words 'care or control', as interpreted by the Courts
prior to the amendment, nor should it be considered as indicative of the
intention of 'a previous Parliament. If Parliament in 1947 intended to define
""care or control"" as necessarily including an intention to drive the
motor vehicle involved, it could and should have so stated.

I have also had the
benefit of reading the reasons for judgment delivered by Jessup J.A. on behalf
of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. McPhee; R v. Mullen (1975), 30 C.R.N.S. 4 and I note his conclusion
that:

... if the only proof offered by the Crown of
care or control is that the accused occupied the seat ordinarily occupied by
the driver of a motor vehicle and the accused establishes that he did not enter
or mount the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion, the accused must
be acquitted.

With all respect
this amounts to nothing more than saying that where the Crown is relying
exclusively on the presumption and the presumption is rebutted, there is then
no evidence left for the prosecution and the accused must be acquitted. There
can in my view be no denying the force of this reasoning. I am, however, unable
to agree with the next sentence of Mr. Justice Jessup's reasons for judgment in
which he says: ""It follows therefore, in my opinion, that in a prosecution
under s. 234 it is an essential element of the offence
that the accused had the purpose or intention of setting the vehicle in motion
...

In the present case
the appellant's counsel placed great reliance on the judgment of this Court in R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R. 303 which he treated as affording authority for the
proposition that ""an acquittal is automatic where the accused is able to
rebut the presumption of care or

[page 248]

control under s. 237(1) (a) with evidence
carrying proof on the balance of probabilities"". This would mean that
wherever an accused establishes ""that he did not enter or mount the
vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion . . . "" he must be acquitted.

It will be found, however, that the effect of
the Appleby case is in fact limited to cases where the Crown is relying
on the presumption standing alone and gives no consideration to the offence
being established by other means. The Appleby case is concerned
exclusively with the question of the nature of the burden of proof called for
by s. 237(1)(a). In that case it was decided that the measure of proof
requisite to discharge the burden was the balance of probabilities and the mere
raising of a reasonable doubt was not sufficient. The case is not, however, any
authority to support the contention that evidence rebutting the presumption
necessarily gives rise to an acquittal notwithstanding other evidence which may
be called by the Crown to establish the offence. There is a wide difference
between rebutting a statutory presumption and establishing innocence. The
statutory presumption affords an aid to the Crown in the proof of its case, but
this is far from saying that the evidence which rebuts such a presumption
necessarily carries with it an acquittal.

In the present case the appellant was found to
be the owner of the motor vehicle in question and to have been in and out of it
numerous times during the course of the evening, and there was also evidence that
he turned the engine on and off a number of times in order to use the heater.
These are all additional factors tending to establish care or control so that
under the particular circumstances of this case rebuttal of the presumption
created by s. 237(1)(a) is far from conclusive on the issue of the guilt or
innocence of the appellant.

Nor, in my opinion, is it necessary for the
Crown to prove an intent to set the vehicle in motion in order to procure a
conviction on a charge under s. 236(1) of having care or control of a motor
vehicle, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the proportion thereof
in his blood exceeds 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres

[page 249]

of blood. Care or control may be exercised
without such intent where an accused performs some act or series of acts
involving the use of the car, its fittings or equipment, such as occurred in
this case, whereby the vehicle may unintentionally be set in motion creating
the danger the section is designed to prevent.

For all these reasons I am of the opinion that
the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island did not err in
holding that an absence of intention to drive a motor vehicle does not
constitute a valid defence to a charge under s. 236 of the Criminal Code,
and I would answer the first question raised by the notice of appeal
accordingly.

The second question raised by the notice of
appeal is predicated on the assumption that the Appeal Division of the Supreme
Court of Prince Edward Island reversed the position it had adopted in the case
of R. v. Young (1979), 21 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 77. I am on the contrary of opinion that
the case of R. v. Young has no
application to the present appeal and that it was not concerned with the
statutory presumption created by s. 237(1)(a). In this regard the following
excerpt from the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice McQuaid in that case is
significant and in my view conclusive of the distinction between the two cases.
The learned judge there said of Young at p. 81:

Since he was not found in the seat of the
vehicle ordinarily occupied by the driver, he does not come within the
presumption set forth in Section 237(1)(a) and can
not be ""deemed"" to have care and control. The
onus therefore rested on the Crown to
establish the care and control.

Having regard to all the above, I would dismiss
this appeal and affirm the direction of the Court of Appeal that the matter be
remitted ""back to the trial court for disposition by it having regard to
the above ruling"".

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NOVA
SCOTIA

Criminal law — Search warrants — Right to
inspect search warrants and informations on which search warrants based —
Whether access restricted to ""interested parties"" or open to general
public — Whether right to inspect only on execution of search warrant or
whether hearings dealing with search warrants open — Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, ss. 443, 446.

Respondent, an investigative journalist, was
denied access to search warrants and supporting material by appellant Grainger,
the Justice of the Peace who had issued them, because such material was not
available for inspection by the general public. At trial, respondent was held
entitled to a declaration that search warrants after their execution, and the
informations related to them in the control of the justice of the peace or
court official, were court records available for examination by members of the
general public. In dismissing an appeal, the Appeal Court declared that the
public was entitled to inspect informations upon which search warrants were
issued pursuant to s. 443 of the Criminal Code, and that any member of
the public, including individuals

[page 176]

about to be the
subject of a search warrant, was entitled to be present in open court when the
search warrants were issued.

Held (Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal
should be dismissed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Dickson, McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: After a
search warrant has been executed, and objects found during the search are
brought before a justice, members of the public are entitled to inspect the
warrant, and the information upon which it was issued. Curtailment of public
accessibility is justified only where the need to protect other social values
is of superordinate importance. In cases where a search warrant is issued but
nothing is found, protection of the innocent is such an overriding social
value. Furthermore, the public interest in the effective administration of
justice must override public accessibility to the extent that the proceedings
at which the warrant is issued can be conducted in camera. Otherwise a person whose property was to be
searched could remove the goods. The need for confidentiality disappears,
however, once the warrant has been executed. At this point the public as well
as those who are directly interested have a right to inspect the warrant and
the related information.

Per Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and Estey JJ. (dissenting):
The broad declaration of the Court of Appeal, for
reasons given by Dickson J., cannot be sustained. Respondent cannot assert a
right to examine the search warrants and related informations on the basis that
the issuance of the search warrants was a judicial act in open court with a
right for the public to be present.

Proceedings before a justice under s. 443 are
part and parcel of criminal investigative procedure and are not analogous to
trial proceedings which are generally required to be conducted in open court.
The opening to public inspection of the documents before the justice is not
equivalent to the right of the public to attend and witness proceedings in
court. Access to these documents should be restricted to persons who can show a
direct and tangible interest in the documents. There is no general right to
inspect search warrants and the informations relating thereto.

The judgment of
Laskin Cl and Dickson, McIntyre, Chouinard and
Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON
J.—The appellant, Ernest Harold Grainger, is
Chief Clerk of the Provincial Magistrate's Court at Halifax and also a Justice
of the Peace. In the latter capacity he had occasion to issue certain search
warrants. The respondent, Linden MacIntyre, is a television journalist

[page 178]

employed by the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation. At the material time Mr. MacIntyre was researching a story on
political patronage and fund raising. Mr. MacIntyre asked Mr. Grainger to show
him the search warrants and supporting material. Mr. Grainger refused, on the
ground that such material was not available for inspection by the general
public. Mr. MacIntyre commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia,
Trial Division, for an order that search warrants and informations relating
thereto, issued pursuant to s. 443 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, or other related or similar statutes, are a matter of public record and
may be inspected by a member of the public upon reasonable request.

Mr. Justice Richard of the Trial Division of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia delivered reasons approving Mr. Maclntyre's
application. He held that Mr. MacIntyre was entitled to a declaration to the
effect that search warrants ""which have been executed"", and
informations relating thereto, which are in the control of the justice of the
peace or a court official are court records available for examination by
members of the general public.

An appeal brought by the Attorney General of
Nova Scotia and by Mr. Grainger to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia was dismissed. The Appeal Division proceeded on much broader
grounds than Richard J. The order dismissing the appeal contained a declaration
""that a member of the public is entitled to inspect informations upon
which search warrants have been issued pursuant to section 443 of the Criminal Code of
Canada"". The Court also declared that Mr. MacIntyre was entitled to be
present in open court when the search warrants were issued. This right, the
Appeal Division said, extended to any member of the public, including
individuals who would be the subjects of the search warrants.

[page 179]

This Court granted
leave to appeal the judgment and order of the Appeal Division. The Attorney
General of Canada and the Attorneys General of the Provinces of Ontario,
Quebec, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta intervened to
support the appellant Attorney General of Nova Scotia. The Canadian Civil Liberties
Association intervened in support of Mr. Maclntyre.

Although Mr.
MacIntyre happens to be a journalist employed by the C.B.C. he has throughout
taken the position that his standing is no higher than that of any member of
the general public. He claims no special status as a journalist.

II

A search warrant may
be broadly defined as an order issued by a justice under statutory powers,
authorizing a named person to enter a specified place to search for and seize
specified property which will afford evidence of the actual or intended
commission of a crime. A warrant may issue upon a sworn information and proof
of reasonable grounds for its issuance. The property seized must be carried
before the justice who issued the warrant to be dealt with by him according to
law.

[page 180]

Search warrants are
part of the investigative pretrial process of the criminal law, often employed
early in the investigation and before the identity of all of the suspects is
known. Parliament, in furtherance of the public interest in effective
investigation and prosecution of crime, and through the enactment of s. 443 of
the Code,
has legalized what
would otherwise be an illegal entry of premises and illegal seizure of
property. The issuance of a search warrant is a judicial act on the part of the
justice, usually performed ex parte and in camera, by the
very nature of the proceedings.

The search warrant
in recent years has become an increasingly important investigatory aid, as
crime and criminals become increasingly sophisticated and the incidence of
corporate white collar crime multiplies. The effectiveness of any search made
pursuant to the issuance of a search warrant will depend much upon timing, upon
the degree of confidentiality which attends the issuance of the warrant and upon
the element of surprise which attends the search.

As is often the case
in a free society there are at work two conflicting public interests. The one
has to do with civil liberties and the protection of the individual from
interference with the enjoyment of his property. There is a clear and important
social value in avoidance of arbitrary searches and unlawful seizures. The
other, competing, interest lies in the effective detection and proof of crime
and the prompt apprehension and conviction of offenders. Public protection,
afforded by efficient and effective law enforcement, is enhanced through the
proper use of search warrants.

In this balancing of
interests, Parliament has made a clear policy choice. The public interest in
the detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes has been permitted to
dominate the individual interest. To the extent of its reach, s. 443 has been
introduced as an aid in the administration of justice and enforcement of the
provisions of the Criminal
Code.

III

The Criminal Code
gives little guidance
on the question of accessibility to the general public of search warrants and
the underlying informations. And there is little authority on the point. The
appellant Attorney General of Nova Scotia relied upon Taylor's Treatise on the Law of Evidence (11th ed. 1920), upon a footnote to Order 63, Rule
4 of the English Rules of Court, and upon Inland
Revenue Commissioners v. Rossminster Ltd., [1980] 2 W.L.R. 1. These authorities indicate that
under English practice there is no general right to inspect and copy judicial
records and documents. The right is only exerciseable when some direct

[page 181]

and
tangible interest or proprietary right in the documents can be demonstrated.

It
does seem clear that an individual who is 'directly interested' in the warrant
can inspect the information and the warrant after the warrant has been
executed. The reasoning here is that an interested party has a right to apply
to set aside or quash a search warrant based on a defective information (R. v. Solloway Mills & Co., [1930] 3 D.L.R. 293 (Alta. S.C.)).
This right can only be exercised if the applicant is entitled to inspect the
warrant and the information immediately after it has been executed. The point
is discussed by Mr. Justice MacDonald of the Alberta Supreme Court in Realty Renovations Ltd. v. Attorney-General for Alberta et al. (1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d)
249 at pp. 253-54:

Since the issue of a search warrant is a
judicial act and not an administrative act, it appears to me to be fundamental
that in order to exercise the right to question the validity of a search
warrant, the interested party or his counsel
must be able to inspect the search warrant and the information on which it is based. Although there is no
appeal from the issue of a search warrant, a superior Court has the right by
prerogative writ to review the act of the Justice of the Peace in issuing the
warrant. In order to launch a proper application, the applicant should know the
reasons or grounds for his application, which reasons or grounds are most
likely to be found in the form of the information or warrant. I am unable to conceive anything but a denial of
Justice if the contents of the information and warrant, after the
warrant is executed, are hidden until the police have completed the investigation
or until the Crown prosecutor decides that access to the file containing the
warrant is to be allowed. Such a restriction
could effectively delay, if not prevent review of the judicial act of
the Justice in the issue of the warrant. If a warrant is void then it should be set aside as soon as possible and the
earlier the application to set it aside can be heard, the more the right
of the individual is protected.

The
appellant, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia, does not contest the right of
an 'interested party' to inspect search warrants and informations after
execution. His contention is that Mr. MacIntyre, a member of the general
public, not directly affected by issuance of the warrant, has no right of
inspection. The question, therefore, is whether, in

[page 182]

law, any distinction can be drawn, in respect of
accessibility, between those persons who might be termed 'interested parties'
and those members of the public who are unable to show any special interest in
the proceedings.

There would seem to be only two Canadian cases
which have addressed the point. In (1959-60), 2 Crim. L.Q., 119, reference is
made to an unreported decision of Greschuk J. in Southam Publishing Company v. Mack in Supreme Court Chambers
in Calgary, Alberta. Mandamus was granted requiring a magistrate to permit a
reporter of the Calgary Herald to
inspect the information and complaints which were in his possession relating to
cases the magistrate had dealt with on a particular date.

In Realty
Renovations Ltd. v. Attorney-General for Alberta, supra, MacDonald
J. concluded his judgment with these words:

I further declare that upon execution of the
search warrant, the information in support
and the warrant are matters of Court
Record and are available for inspection on demand.

It is only fair to observe, however, that in
that case the person seeking access was an ""interested party"" and
therefore the broad declaration, quoted above, strictly speaking went beyond
what was required for the decision.

American courts have recognized a general right
to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records
and documents. Such common law right has been recognized, for example, in
courts of the District of Columbia (Nixon
v. Warner Communications, Inc. (1978), 98 S. Ct. 1306). In that case
Mr. Justice Powell, delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United
States, observed at p. 1311:

Both petitioner and respondents acknowledge
the existence of a common-law right of access to judicial records, but they
differ sharply over its scope and the circumstances warranting restrictions of
it. An infrequent subject of litigation, its contours have not been delineated
with any precision.

[page 183]

Later,
at p. 1312, Mr. Justice Powell said:

The interest necessary to support the
issuance of a writ compelling access has been found, for
example, in the citizen's desire to keep a watchful eye on the
workings of public agencies,
see, e.g., State ex rel. Colscott v. King, 154 Ind. 621, 621-627, 57 N.E. 535, 536-538 (1900); State ex
rel. Ferry v. Williams, 41 N.J.L. 332,
336-339 (1879), and in a newspaper publisher's intention to publish
information concerning the operation of government,
see, e.g., State ex rel. Youmans v. Owens, 28 Wis.2d 672, 677, 137 N.W.2d 470, 472 (1965), modified
on other grounds, 28 Wis.2d 685a, 139 N.W.2d 241 (1966). But see Burton v. Reynolds, 110 Mich. 354, 68 N.W. 217 (1896).

By
reason of the relatively few judicial decisions it is difficult, and probably
unwise, to attempt any comprehensive definition of the right of access to
judicial records or delineation of the factors to be taken into account in
determining whether access is to be permitted. The question before us is
limited to search warrants and informations. The response to that question, it
seems to me, should be guided by several broad policy considerations, namely,
respect for the privacy of the individual, protection of the administration of
justice, implementation of the will of Parliament that a search warrant be an
effective aid in the investigation of crime, and finally, a strong public
policy in favour of ""openness"" in respect of judicial acts. The
rationale of this last-mentioned consideration has been eloquently expressed by
Bentham in these terms:

'In the darkness of secrecy, sinister
interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as
publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice
operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice.' 'Publicity is the
very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all
guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial.'

The
concern for accountability is not diminished by the fact that the search
warrants might be issued by a justice in camera. On the contrary, this fact increases
the policy argument in favour of accessibility. Initial secrecy surrounding the
issuance of warrants may lead to abuse, and publicity

[page 184]

is a strong
deterrent to potential malversation.

In short, what
should be sought is maximum accountability and accessibility but not to the
extent of harming the innocent or of impairing the efficiency of the search
warrant as a weapon in society's never-ending fight against crime.

IV

The appellant, the
Attorney General of Nova Scotia, says in effect that the search warrants are
none of Mr. Maclntyre's business. MacIntyre is not directly interested in the
sense that his premises have been the object of a search. Why then should he be
entitled to see them?

There are two
principal arguments advanced in support of the position of the appellant. The
first might be termed the 'privacy' argument. It is submitted that the privacy
rights of the individuals who have been the object of searches would be
violated if persons like Mr. MacIntyre were permitted to inspect the warrants.
It is argued that the warrants are issued merely on proof of 'reasonable
grounds' to believe that there is evidence with respect to the commission of a
criminal offence in a ""building, receptacle or place"". At this stage
of the proceedings no criminal charge has been laid and there is no assurance
that a charge ever will be laid. Moreover, search warrants are often issued to
search the premises of a third party who is in no way privy to any wrongdoing,
but is in possession of material necessary to the inquiry. Why, it is asked,
submit these individuals to embarrassment and public suspicion through release
of search warrants?

The second,
independent, submission of the appellant might be termed the 'administration of
justice' argument. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the search warrant
procedure depends to a large extent on the element of surprise. If the occupier
of the premises were informed in advance of the warrant, he would dispose of
the goods. Therefore, the public must be denied access to the warrants,
otherwise the legislative purposes and

[page 185]

intention of Parliament, embodied in s. 443 of
the Criminal Code, would be
frustrated.

V

Let me deal first with the 'privacy' argument.
This is not the first occasion on which such an argument has been tested in the
courts. Many times it has been urged that the 'privacy' of litigants requires
that the public be excluded from court proceedings. It is now well established,
however, that covertness is the exception and openness the rule. Public
confidence in the integrity of the court system and understanding of the
administration of justice are thereby fostered. As a general rule the
sensibilities of the individuals involved are no basis for exclusion of the public
from judicial proceedings. The following comments of Laurence J. in R. v. Wright, 8 T.R. 293, are apposite
and were cited with approval by Duff J. in Gazette
Printing Co. v. Shallow (1909), 41 S.C.R. 339 at p. 359:

Though the
publication of such proceedings may be to the disadvantage of the particular individual
concerned, yet it is of vast importance to the public that the
proceedings of courts of justice
should be universally known. The general
advantage to the country in having these proceedings made public more
than counterbalances the inconveniences to
the private persons whose conduct may be the subject of such
proceedings.

The leading case is the decision of the House of
Lords in Scott v. Scott, [1913]
A.C. 417. In the later case of McPherson v.
McPherson, [1936] A.C. 177, at p. 200, Lord Blanesburgh, delivering
the judgment of the Privy Council, referred to ""publicity"" as the
""authentic hallmark of judicial as distinct from administrative
procedure"".

It is, of course, true that Scott v. Scott and McPherson v. McPherson were cases in
which proceedings had reached the stage of trial whereas the issuance of a
search warrant takes place at the pre-trial investigative stage. The cases
mentioned, however, and many others which could be cited, establish the broad
principle of ""openness"" in judicial proceedings, whatever their
nature, and in the exercise of judicial powers. The same policy considerations

[page 186]

upon which is
predicated our reluctance to inhibit accessibility at the trial stage are still
present and should be addressed at the pretrial stage. Parliament has seen fit,
and properly so, considering the importance of the derogation from fundamental
common law rights, to involve the judiciary in the issuance of search warrants
and the disposition of the property seized, if any. I find it difficult to
accept the view that a judicial act performed during a trial is open to public
scrutiny but a judicial act performed at the pretrial stage remains shrouded in
secrecy.

The reported cases
have not generally distinguished between judicial proceedings which are part of
a trial and those which are not. Ex parte applications
for injunctions, interlocutory proceedings, or preliminary inquiries are not
trial proceedings, and yet the 'open court' rule applies in these cases. The
authorities have held that subject to a few well-recognized exceptions, as in
the case of infants, mentally disordered persons or secret processes, all
judicial proceedings must be held in public. The editor of Halsbury's 4th Edition states the rule in these terms:

In general, all
cases, both civil and criminal, must be heard in open
court, but in certain exceptional cases, where
the administration of justice would be rendered impracticable by the presence of the public, the court may sit in
camera [Vol. 10, para. 705, at p. 316].

At every stage the
rule should be one of public accessibility and concomitant judicial
accountability; all with a view to ensuring there is no abuse in the issue of
search warrants, that once issued they are executed according to law, and
finally that any evidence seized is dealt with according to law. A decision by
the Crown not to prosecute, notwithstanding the finding of evidence appearing
to establish the commission of a crime may, in some circumstances, raise issues
of public importance.

In my view,
curtailment of public accessibility can only be justified where there is
present the need to protect social values of superordinate

[page 187]

importance. One of
these is the protection of the innocent.

Many search warrants
are issued and executed, and nothing is found. In these circumstances, does the
interest served by giving access to the public outweigh that served in
protecting those persons whose premises have been searched and nothing has been
found? Must they endure the stigmatization to name and reputation which would
follow publication of the search? Protection of the innocent from unnecessary
harm is a valid and important policy consideration. In my view that
consideration overrides the public access interest in those cases where a
search is made and nothing is found. The public right to know must yield to the
protection of the innocent. If the warrant is executed and something is seized,
other considerations come to bear.

VI

That brings me to
the second argument raised by the appellant. The point taken here is that the
effective administration of justice would be frustrated if individuals were
permitted to be present when the warrants were issued. Therefore, the
proceeding must be conducted in camera, as an
exception to the open court principle. I agree. The effective administration of
justice does justify the exclusion of the public from the proceedings attending
the actual issuance of the warrant. The Attorneys General have established, at
least to my satisfaction, that if the application for the warrant were made in
open court the search for the instrumentalities of crime would, at best, be
severely hampered and, at worst, rendered entirely fruitless. In a process in
which surprise and secrecy may play a decisive role the occupier of the
premises to be searched would be alerted, before the execution of the warrant,
with the probable consequence of destruction or removal of evidence. I agree
with counsel for the Attorney General of Ontario that the presence in an open
courtroom of members of the public, media personnel, and, potentially, contacts
of suspected accused in respect of whom the search is to be made, would

[page 188]

render the mechanism
of a search warrant utterly useless.

None of the counsel
before us sought to sustain the position of the Appeal Division of the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia that the issue of the search warrant is a judicial act
which should be performed in open court by a justice of the peace with the
public present. The respondent Mr. MacIntyre stated in paragraph 5 of his
factum:

One must note that the Respondent never
sought documentation relating to unexecuted
search warrants nor did he ever request to be present during the
decision making process .. .

It appeared clear during
argument that the act of issuing the search warrant is, in practice, rarely, if
ever, performed in open court. Search warrants are issued in private at all
hours of the day or night, in the chambers of the justice by day or in his home
by night. Section 443(1) of the Code seems to recognize the possibility
of exigent situations in stating that a justice may ""at any time""
issue a warrant.

Although the rule is
that of ""open court"" the rule admits of the exception referred to in Halsbury, namely, that in exceptional cases, where
the administration of justice would be rendered impracticable by the presence
of the public, the court may sit in camera. The
issuance of a search warrant is such a case.

In my opinion,
however, the force of the 'administration of justice' argument abates once the
warrant has been executed, i.e. after entry and search. There is
thereafter a ""diminished interest in confidentiality"" as the purposes
of the policy of secrecy are largely, if not entirely, accomplished. The need
for continued concealment virtually disappears. The appellant concedes that at
this point individuals who are directly 'interested' in the warrant have a
right to inspect it. To that extent at least it enters the public domain. The
appellant must, however, in some manner, justify granting access to the
individuals directly concerned, while denying access to the public in general.
I can find no compelling reason for distinguishing between

[page 189]

the occupier of the premises searched and the
public. The curtailment of the traditionally uninhibited accessibility of the
public to the working of the courts should be undertaken with the greatest
reluctance.

The 'administration of justice' argument is
based on the fear that certain persons will destroy evidence and thus deprive
the police of the fruits of their search. Yet the appellant agrees these very
individuals (i.e. those 'directly interested') have a right to see the warrant,
and the material upon which it is based, once it has been executed. The
appellants do not argue for blanket confidentiality with respect to warrants.
Logically, if those directly interested can see the warrant, a third party who
has no interest in the case at all is not a threat to the administration of
justice. By definition, he has no evidence that he can destroy. Concern for
preserving evidence and for the effective administration of justice cannot
justify excluding him.

Undoubtedly every court has a supervisory and
protecting power over its own records. Access can be denied when the ends of
justice would be subverted by disclosure or the judicial documents might be
used for an improper purpose. The presumption, however, is in favour of public
access and the burden of contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the
exercice of the right.

I am not unaware that the foregoing may seem a
departure from English practice, as I understand it, but it is in my view more
consonant with the openness of judicial proceedings which English case law
would seem to espouse.

VII

I conclude that the administration of justice
argument does justify an in camera proceeding at the time of issuance of
the warrant but, once the warrant has been executed, exclusion thereafter of
members of the public cannot normally be countenanced.

[page 190]

The general rule of
public access must prevail, save in respect of those whom I have referred to as
innocent persons.

I would dismiss the
appeal and vary the declaration of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia to read as follows:

IT IS DECLARED that after a search warrant
has been executed, and objects found as a result of the search are brought
before a justice pursuant to s. 446 of the Criminal Code, a member of the public is entitled to
inspect the warrant and the information upon which the warrant has been issued
pursuant to s. 443 of the Code.

There will be no costs in this Court.

The reasons of
Martland, Ritchie, Beetz and Estey JJ. were delivered by

MARTLAND
J. (dissenting)—T his appeal is from a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court
of Nova Scotia. The facts which gave rise to the case are not in dispute.

The appellant,
Ernest Harold Grainger, is Chief Clerk of the Provincial Magistrate's Court at
Halifax and is also a Justice of the Peace. The respondent is a television
journalist employed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation who, at the
material time, was researching a story on political patronage and fund raising.
He asked the appellant, Grainger, to show him certain search warrants and
supporting material and was refused on the ground that such material was not
available for inspection by the general public.

The respondent gave
notice to the appellants of an intended application in the Supreme Court of
Nova Scotia, Trial Division, for ""an Order in the nature of mandamus
and/or a declaratory judgment to the effect that the search warrants and
Informations relating thereto issued pursuant to Section 443 of the Criminal
Code of Canada or other related or similar statutes are a matter of public
record and may be inspected by a member of the public upon reasonable
request"".

[page 191]

The application was
heard by Richard J. who ordered that the respondent ""is entitled to a
declaration to the effect that the Search Warrants and Informations relating
thereto which have been executed upon and which are in the control of a Justice
of the Peace or a Court Official are court records and are available for
examination by members of the general public."" It will be noted that this
order was limited to search warrants which had been executed.

The appellants appealed
unsuccessfully to the Appeal Division. The judgment dismissing the appeal
contained the following declaration:

IT IS DECLARED
that a member of the public is entitled to
inspect informations upon which search warrants have been issued pursuant
to section 443 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

This declaration was
broader in its scope than that made by Richard J. in that it was not limited to
search warrants which had been executed. The basis for the Court's decision is
set forth in the following paragraph of the reasons for judgment:

In my opinion any
member of the public does have a right to inspect informations upon which search
warrants are based, pursuant to s. 443
of the Criminal Code, since
the issue of the search warrant is a judicial act performed in open court by a
justice of the peace. The public would be entitled to be present on that
occasion and to hear the contents of the
information presented to the justice
when he is requested to exercise his discretion in the granting of the
warrant. The information has become part of the record of the court as revealed
at a public hearing and must be available for inspection by members of the
public.

Subsection (1) of s.
443 of the Criminal Code
provides:

443. (1) A justice who is satisfied by information
upon oath in Form 1, that there is reasonable
ground to believe that there is in a building, receptacle or place

(a) anything upon or in respect of which any
offence against this Act has been or is
suspected to have been committed,

(b) anything that there is reasonable ground
to believe will afford evidence with respect
to the commission of an offence against this Act, or

[page 192]

(c) anything that there is reasonable ground
to believe is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any offence against the person for which a person
may be arrested without warrant,

may at any time issue a warrant under his
hand authorizing a person named therein or a
peace officer to search the building, receptacle or place for any such
thing, and to seize and carry it before the justice who issued the warrant or
some other justice for the same territorial division to be dealt with by him
according to law.

Section 446 of the Criminal Code provides
that anything seized under a search warrant issued pursuant to s. 443 and
brought before a justice shall
be detained by him or he may
order that it be detained until the conclusion of any investigation or until
required to be produced for the purpose of a preliminary inquiry or trial.

Subsection (5) of s.
446 provides: 446... .

(5) Where anything is detained under
subsection (1), a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or of a
court of criminal jurisdiction may, on summary application on behalf of a
person who has an interest in what is detained, after three clear days notice
to the Attorney General, order that the person by or on whose behalf the
application is made be permitted to examine anything so detained.

The appellants, by
leave of this Court, have appealed from the judgments of the Appeal Division.
The two issues stated by the appellants are as follows:

(i) Are search warrants issued pursuant to
Section 443 of the Criminal Code issued in open court and are they and
the informations pertaining thereto consequently documents open for public
inspection,

(ii) Whether there is otherwise a general
right to inspect search warrants and the informations pertaining thereto.

With respect to the
first issue, I am in agreement with my brother Dickson, for the reasons which
he has given, that the broad declaration made by the Appeal Division cannot be
sustained.

[page 193]

That being so, the respondent cannot assert a
right to examine the search warrants and the related informations on the basis
that the issuance of the search warrants was a judicial act in open court with
a right for the public to be present.

That brings us to the
second issue defined by the appellants as to whether there is a general right
to inspect search warrants and the informations pertaining thereto. This was
the real basis of the submission of the respondent who did not seek to sustain
the position taken by the Appeal Division. His position is that search warrants
issued under s. 443 and the informations pertaining thereto are court documents
which are open to general public inspection.

The respondent relies
upon an ancient English statute enacted in 1372, 46 Edward III. An English
translation of this Act, which was enacted in law French, appears in a note at
the end of the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in Caddy v. Barlow (1827), 1 Man. & Ry. 275 at pp. 279-80.
I will quote that part of the note which includes the statutory provision:

It appears that originally all judicial
records of the King's Courts were open to
the public without restraint, and were
preserved for that purpose. Lord Coke, in his preface to 3 Co. Rep. 3,
speaking on this subject says, ""these records, for that they contain great
and hidden treasure, are faithfully and safely kept, (as they well deserve), in the king's treasury. And yet not so
kept but that any subject may for his necessary use and benefit have
access thereunto; which was the ancient law of England, and so is declared by
an act of Parliament in 46
Edw. 3, in these words: Also the Commons pray, that, whereas
records, and whatsoever is in the King's Court, ought of reason to remain
there, for perpetual evidence and aid of all
parties thereto, and of all those whom
in any manner they reach, when they have need; and yet of late they
refuse, in the Court of our said Lord, to make search or exemplification of any
thing which can fall in evidence against the King, or in his disadvantage. May it please (you) to ordain by
statute, that search and
exemplification be made for all persons (fait as touts gentz) of whatever record touches them in any manner, as well as that which
falls against the King

[page 194]

as other persons. Le Roy le voet.""

The respondent cites this legislation in support
of the proposition that a member of the public has access to all judicial
records. However, the provisions of the statute did not go that far. It
referred to ""whatever record touches them in any manner"".
(Emphasis added.) I take this as meaning that to obtain the benefit of the
statute the person had to show that the document sought to be searched in some
way affected his interests.

This view is supported by the portion of the
footnote which precedes the quotation of the statute. Lord Coke states that any
subject may have access to the records ""for his necessary use and
benefit"".

The case of Caddy v. Barlow itself
related to the admissibility, in an action for malicious prosecution, of a copy
of an indictment against the plaintiff which had been granted to her brother,
the co-accused.

The respondent refers to the judgment of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in The Attorney-General v. Scully (1902),
4 O.L.R. 394, in which reference is made to Caddy v. Barlow and to the
English statute. That case dealt with an application made to the clerk of the
peace for a copy of the indictment in a criminal charge of theft against the
applicant who had been acquitted. He obviously had an interest in obtaining the
document.

The Appeal Division in the present case which,
as previously noted, based its decision to permit the examination of the search
warrants and informations upon its conclusion that these documents were
produced at a judicial hearing in open court, did deal with the assertion of a
general right to examine court documents in the following passage in its
reasons;

In my opinion at common law courts have
always exercised control over their process in open court and access to the records. Although the public have a
right to any information they may gleam [sic] from attendance at a public hearing of a process in open
court, and to those parts of the record that are part of the public
presentation of the judicial proceeding in open court

[page 195]

there have always been some parts of the
court file that are available only to ""persons interested"" and this
""interest"" must be established to the satisfaction of the court.
Parties to civil actions and the accused in criminal proceedings have always
been held by the courts to be persons so interested. Other persons must
establish their right to see particular documents before being entitled to do
so.

The
Appeal Division cited in its reasons paragraphs 1492 and 1493 of Taylor on Evidence, 11th ed. (The same
paragraphs appear with the same numbers in the 12th edition):

1492. It is highly questionable whether the records
of inferior tribunals are open to the inspection of all persons without
distinction; but it is clear that everyone has a right to inspect and take
copies of the parts of the proceedings in which he is individually interested.
The party, therefore, who wishes to examine any particular record of one of
those courts, should first apply to that court, showing that he has some
interest in the document in question, and that he requires it for a proper
purpose. 1f his application be refused, the Chancery, or the King's Bench
Division of the High Court, upon affidavit of the fact, may send either for the
record itself or an exemplification; or the latter court will, by mandamus,
obtain for the applicant the inspection or copy required. Thus, where a person,
after having been convicted by a magistrate under the game laws, had an action
brought against him for the same offence, the Court of Queen's Bench held that
he was entitled to a copy of the conviction; and the magistrate having refused
to give him one, they granted a writ of certiorari, for the mere purpose of
procuring a copy, and of thus enabling the defendant to defeat the action. So,
where a party, who had been sued in a court of conscience and had been taken in
execution, brought an action of trespass and false imprisonment, the judges
granted him a rule to inspect so much of the book of the proceedings as related
to the suit against himself.

1493. Indeed, it may be laid down as a
general rule, that the King's Bench Division will enforce by mandamus the
production of every document of a public nature, in which any one of his
Majesty's subjects can prove himself to be interested. Every officer,
therefore, appointed by law to keep records ought to deem himself a trustee for
all interested parties, and allow them to

[page 196]

inspect such documents as concern themselves,—without
putting them to the expense and trouble of making a formal application for a
mandamus. But the applicant must show that he has some direct and tangible
interest in the documents sought to be inspected, and that the inspection is bona fide required on some special and
public ground, or the court will not interfere in his favour; and therefore, if
his object be merely to gratify a rational curiosity, or to obtain information
on some general subject, or to ascertain facts which may be indirectly useful
to him in some ulterior proceedings, he cannot claim inspection as a right
capable of being enforced.

The
first edition of this work was published in 1848, and so these propositions may
be taken as representing the author's views of the law of
England on this subject.

In Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed., vol. 1, para.
97, a similar statement of the law appears:

The applicant's interest in the documents
must be direct and tangible. Neither curiosity, even though rational, nor the
ascertainment of facts which may be useful for furthering some ulterior object,
constitutes a sufficient interest to bring an applicant within the rule on
which the court acts in granting a mandamus for the inspection of public
documents.

Although reasonable grounds must be shown for
requiring inspection, it is not necessary to show as a ground for the
application for a mandamus to inspect documents that a suit has been actually
instituted. It will suffice to show that there is some particular matter in
dispute and that the applicant is interested therein.

It
is quite clear that the respondent has no direct and tangible interest in the
documents which he sought to examine. He wished to examine them to further an
ulterior object, i.e. for the purpose of
preparing a news story. Applying the rule applicable under English law, the
appellant, Grainger, was entitled to refuse his request.

It
is suggested that a broader right might be recognized consonant with the
openness of judicial proceedings. This suggestion requires a consideration of
the nature of the proceedings provided for in s. 443. That section provides a
means whereby persons engaged in the enforcement of criminal law may obtain
leave, inter alia, to search buildings, receptacles
or places and seize documents or

[page 197]

other things which
may afford evidence with respect to the commission of a criminal offence. A
justice is empowered by the section to authorize this to be done. Before giving
such authority, he must be satisfied by information on oath that there is
reasonable ground for believing that there is in the building, receptacle or
place anything in respect of which an offence has been committed or is
suspected to have been committed; anything that there is reasonable ground to
believe will afford evidence of the commission of a criminal offence; or
anything that there is reasonable ground to believe is intended to be used for
the commission of an offence against the person for which a person may be
arrested without warrant.

The function of the
justice may be considered to be a judicial function, but might more properly be
described as a function performed by a judicial officer, since no notice is
required to anyone, there is no opposite party before him and, in fact, in the
case of a search before proceedings are instituted, no opposite party exists.
There is no requirement that the justice should perform his function in court.
The justice does not adjudicate, nor does he make any order. His power is to
give authority to do certain things which are a part of pretrial preparation by
the Crown. No provision is made in either s. 443 or s. 446 for an examination
by anyone of the documents on the basis of which the justice issued a search
warrant.

As the function of
the justice is not adjudicative and is not performed in open court, cases
dealing with the requirement of court proceedings being carried on in public,
such as Scott v. Scott, [1913] A.C. 417, and McPherson v. McPherson, [1936] A.C. 177, are not, in my opinion,
relevant to the issue before the Court. The documents which the respondent seeks
to examine are not documents filed in court proceedings. They are the necessary
requirements which enable the justice to grant permission for the Crown to
pursue its investigation of possible crimes and to prepare for criminal
proceedings.

[page 198]

If the documents in
question in this appeal are not subject to public examination prior to the
execution of the search warrants, I see no logical reason why they should
become subject to such examination thereafter, at least until the case in
respect of which the search has been made has come to trial. It is true that a
search of those documents before the search warrant has been executed might
frustrate the very purpose for which the warrant was issued by forewarning the
person whose premises were to be searched. The element of surprise is essential
to the proper enforcement of the criminal law. There are, however, additional
and important reasons why such documents should not be made public which
continue even after the warrant has been executed.

The information upon
oath on the basis of which a search warrant may be issued is in Form 1
contained in Part XXV of the Criminal Code. It requires a description of
the offence in respect of which the search is to be made. The informant must
state that he has reasonable grounds for believing that the things for which
the search is to be made are in a particular place and must state the grounds
for such belief. This document, which may be submitted to the justice before
any charges have been laid, discloses the informant's statement that an offence
has been committed or is intended to be committed.

The disclosure of
such information before trial could be prejudicial to the fair trial of the
person suspected of having committed such crime. Publication of such
information prior to trial is even more serious.

In R. v. Fisher (1811), 2 Camp. 563, 170 E.R. 1253, a prosecution was
instituted for criminal libel in consequence of the publication by the
defendants of the preliminary examinations taken ex parte before a
magistrate prior to the committal for trial of the plaintiff on a charge of
assault with intent to rape. In his judgment, Lord Ellenborough said, at p.
570:

If anything is more important than another in
the administration of justice, it is that jurymen should come to the trial of those persons on whose
guilt or innocence they are to decide,
with minds pure and unprejudiced. Is it
possible they should do so, after having read
for weeks

[page 199]

and months
before, ex parte statements of the evidence against the accused, which the
latter had no opportunity to disprove or to controvert? ... The
publication of proceedings in courts of justice, where both sides are heard,
and matters are finally determined, is salutary, and therefore it is permitted.
The publication of these preliminary
examinations has a tendency to pervert the public mind, and to disturb the course of justice; and it is
therefore illegal.

Inspection of the information and the search
warrant would enable the person inspecting the documents to discover the identity
of the informant. In certain types of cases this might well place the informant
in jeopardy. It was this kind of risk which led to the recognition in law of
the right of the police to protect from disclosure the identity of police
informants. That right exists even where a police officer is testifying at a
trial. The same kind of risk arises in relation to persons who give information
leading to the issuance of a search warrant. For the same reasons which justify
the police in refusing to disclose the identity of an informer, public
disclosure of documents from which the identity of the informant may be
ascertained should not be compelled.

In his reasons, my brother Dickson has referred
to the fact that in recent years the search warrant has become an increasingly
important investigatory aid as crime and criminals become increasingly
sophisticated and has pointed out that the effectiveness of a search pursuant
to a search warrant depends, inter alia, on the degree of confidentiality
which attends the issuance of the warrant. To insure such confidentiality, it
is essential that criminal organizations, such as those involved in the drug
traffic, should be prevented, as far as possible, from obtaining the means to
discover the identity of persons assisting the police.

Apart from the protection of the identity of the
person furnishing the information upon which the issuance of a search warrant
is founded, it is undesirable, in the public interest, that those engaged in
criminal activities should have available to them information which discloses
the pattern of police activities in connection with searches. In Inland Revenue Commissioners v.

[page 200]

Rossminster Ltd.,
[1980] 2 W.L.R. 1, the House of Lords considered the validity of a search
warrant procured pursuant to an English statute, the Taxes Management Act 1970, 1970 (U.K.), c. 9. The warrant was obtained because of suspected tax frauds. When executed,
the occupants of the premises were not told the offences alleged or the
""reasonable ground"" on which the judge issuing the warrant had acted.
In his reasons for judgment, Lord Wilberforce
said, at pp. 37-38:

But, on the plain words of the enactment, the
officers are entitled if they can persuade the board and the judge, to enter
and search premises regardless
of whom they belong to: a warrant which confers this power is strictly and
exactly within the parliamentary authority, and the occupier has no answer to
it. I accept that some information as regards the person(s) who are alleged to
have committed an offence and possibly as to the approximate dates of the offences must almost certainly have been
laid before the board and the judge. But the occupier
has no right to be told of this at this stage, nor has he the right to
be informed of the ""reasonable grounds"" of which the judge was
satisfied. Both courts agree as to this: all
this information is clearly protected by the public interest immunity
which covers investigations into possible criminal offences. With reference to
the police, Lord Reid stated this in these words:

""The police are carrying on an unending
war with criminals many of whom are today highly intelligent. So it is
essential that there should be no disclosure of anything which might give any
useful information to those who organise criminal activities. And it would
generally be wrong to require disclosure in a civil case of anything which
might be material in a pending prosecution: but after a verdict has been given
or it has been decided to take no proceedings there is not the same need for
secrecy."" (Conway v. Rimmer [1968] A.C. 910, at pp. 953-954.)

The release to the
public of the contents of informations and search warrants may also be harmful
to a person whose premises are permitted to be searched and who may have no
personal connection with the commission of the offence. The fact that his
premises are the subject of a search warrant generates suspicion that he was in
some way involved in the offence. Publication of

[page 201]

the fact that such a
warrant had been issued in respect of his premises would be highly prejudicial
to him.

For these reasons, I
am not satisfied that there is any valid reason for departing from the rule as
stated in Halsbury
(supra) so as to afford
to the general public the right to inspect documents forming part of the search
warrant procedure under s. 443.

In summary, my
conclusion is that proceedings before a justice under s. 443 being part and
parcel of criminal investigative procedure are not analogous to trial
proceedings, which are generally required to be conducted in open court. The
opening to public inspection of the documents before the justice is not
equivalent to the right of the public to attend and witness proceedings in
court. Access to these documents should be restricted, in accordance with the practice
established in England, to persons who can show an interest in the documents
which is direct and tangible. Clearly the respondent had no such interest.

I would allow the
appeal and set aside the judgments of the Court of Appeal and of Richard J. In
accordance with the submission of the appellants, there should be no order as
to costs.

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR QUEBEC

Criminal Law — Trial — Election by accused
for a trial by judge and jury — Re-election for trial by judge alone — Whether
failure to comply with re-election procedure depriving court of jurisdiction —
Whether an accused may waive compliance with the procedural requirements of s.
492 of the Criminal Code — Whether the accused did waive them — Waiver must be
clear and unequivocal — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 492.

Criminal law — Possession of heroin for the
purpose of trafficking — Non-compliance of trial judge with s. 8 procedure of
the Narcotic Control Act — Error of law — No waiver — Non-applicability of s.
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code — New trial ordered — Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, s. 8 — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s.
613(1)(b)(iii).

Accused unsuccessfully appealed his
conviction of possessing heroin for the purpose of trafficking to the Quebec Court
of Appeal. The appeal to this Court was on two grounds: (1) the lack of
jurisdiction in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace to try the accused due
to the fact that he had not validly re-elected for a trial by judge alone and
(2) the trial judge's error in convicting the accused without offering him the
opportunity to address the issue of ""purpose"" after having made a
finding that he was in possession of the narcotic in light of the provisions of
s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

A party may waive a procedural requirement
enacted for his benefit. The validity of any waiver, however, is dependent upon
it being clear and unequivocal, i.e. that the person is waiving the
procedural safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the rights the
procedure was enacted to protect and of the effect the waiver will have on
those rights in the process. When considering

[page 42]

the circumstances surrounding the present case, the trial judge was justified to believe that there had been an informed waiver by the accused through his attorney
of the procedural requirements of
s. 492 of the Criminal Code.

The second ground
of appeal succeeded as the judge did not comply with the procedure set out in s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act. Without valid waiver on the part of the accused, such non-compliance is fatal. The
denial of an opportunity of presenting a defence will always leave the court uncertain as to what would finally
be the evidence adduced had the
opportunity denied been given the
accused. Section 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code cannot apply where the
provisions of s. 8 have not been complied with.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec dismissing the appellant's appeal from his conviction on a charge of
possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. Appeal allowed.

Paul Skolnick and Ivan Lerner, for the
appellant.

Jacques Letellier, for the respondent.

The judgment of the
Court was delivered by

LAMER
J.—The appellant, one Tibor Korponay, was found
guilty of possession of 5 kilos of heroin for the purpose of trafficking (s.
4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. N-1) by a judge of the Sessions of the Peace, sitting in the judicial
district of Montreal as a judge under Part XVI of the Criminal Code.

Korponay's appeal to
the Quebec Court of Appeal was dismissed and he now comes to this Court on two
grounds: his first ground is that, having chosen originally a trial by jury,
the Court that convicted him did not have jurisdiction to do so because he had
not been properly put to a

[page 43]

re-election to the
latter court under s. 492 of the Criminal Code; his second ground is
predicated on the provisions of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act which
require that the court conducting a trial for an offence contrary to s. 4(2) of
the Narcotic Control Act proceed in determining the guilt or innocence
of an accused in two phases. The appellant argues that the trial judge did not
proceed in compliance with the special procedure set out in s. 8, in that he
did not make a finding as to possession and then give the accused an
opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for
the purpose of trafficking, and that, as a result, a new trial should be
ordered. Appellant's first ground should not in my opinion succeed. However, as
I am of the view that his second should, the issue raised by the first ground
must nevertheless be decided as it is determinant of which court will have
jurisdiction to hear the new trial that should in my opinion be ordered.

First ground

Korponay had
elected, under s. 484(2) of the Code, to be tried by a court composed of
a judge and jury. Following a preliminary inquiry he was, on September 22,
1972, committed for trial before the Superior Court of Criminal Jurisdiction.

Korponay, who was on
bail, appeared before that Court on November 6, 1972, and his case was remanded
from one assize to the other the last of such remands being to November 22,
1974.

However, on November
6, 1974, we find Korponay, assisted by two attorneys, appearing before the
Chief Judge of another court, the Court of the Sessions of the Peace, in
Montreal. The relevance of this occurrence will become apparent later. The
Clerk of that Court had the Superior Court's record and, in the presence of
all, including the Crown Attorney, read the charge to Korponay. What then
happened is best described by reproducing here the transcript of the
proceedings:

(S) GRACE LIBERATORE

(S) THÉRÈSE
PELLETIER

The trial commenced
on the date of that appearance before the Chief Judge by the reading into the
record by consent of evidence adduced in other proceedings, against other
persons involved in the events that gave rise to the charge against Korponay.
The trial appears to have continued piece-meal on many occasions over the next
three years. After the Crown finally closed its case, Korponay offered a
defence and testified on his own behalf on May 5, 1977. On August 3 of the same
year, Chief Judge Mayrand found him guilty and, on September 23, 1977 sentenced
him to 14 years in the penitentiary.

It was not until
October 19, 1979, some two years later, that the appellant, in a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus, questioned for the first time since the beginning
of his trial in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace that Court's
jurisdiction to try him.

This appeal is not
concerned with those proceedings but with the appeal from his conviction. His
first ground alleges a lack of jurisdiction in the Court of the Sessions of the
Peace to try him due to the fact that he had not validly re-elected for a trial
by judge alone, and that the only court having jurisdiction for doing so was
the court he had initially chosen, the Superior Court. Korponay says that the provisions set out in s. 492 for re-electing are
mandatory, must be complied with strictly, and that substantial compliance with
the provisions of that section is not sufficient to confer upon the court jurisdiction to try him.

[page 47]

Section 492 reads as follows:

492. (1) Where an accused has elected or is
deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, the
accused may notify the sheriff in the territorial division in which he is to be
tried that he desires to re-elect under this section,

(a) to be tried by a judge without a jury; or

(b) if he has the consent in writing of the
Attorney General or counsel acting on his behalf, to be tried by a magistrate
without a jury.

(2) A sheriff who receives a notice and a
consent, if required, pursuant to subsection (1) shall forthwith inform a judge
or magistrate having jurisdiction and the judge or magistrate, as the case may
be, shall fix a time and place for the accused to re-elect and shall cause
notice thereof to be given to the accused,

(3) The accused shall attend or, if he is in
custody, shall be produced at the time and place fixed under subsection (2) and
shall, after the charge upon which he has been committed for trial or ordered
to stand trial has been read to him,

(a) if the notice states that the accused
desires to re-elect to be tried by a judge without a jury, be put to his
election in the following words:

You have elected or are deemed to have
elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. Do you now elect to
be tried by a judge without a jury?;

or

(b) if the notice states that the accused
desires to re-elect to be tried by a magistrate without a jury, be put to his
election in the following words:

You have elected or are deemed to have
elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, Do you now elect
to be tried by a magistrate without a jury?

(4) Where an accused elects under this
section to be tried by a judge without a jury or a magistrate without a jury,
the judge or magistrate, as the case may be, shall proceed with the trial or
fix a time and place for the trial.

(5) Where an accused who desires to re-elect
to be tried by a judge without a jury does not notify the sheriff in accordance
with subsection (1) more than fourteen days before the day fixed for the
opening of the sittings or session of the court sitting with a jury by which he
is to be tried, no election may be made under

[page 48]

this section unless the Attorney General or
counsel acting on his behalf consents in writing.

The appellant says
that no notice was given by him to the sheriff, that no notice was given him by
the judge, and that he was not read the words set out in s. 492(3)(a). He
concludes that, this not having been done, the judge did not have the
jurisdiction to proceed to trial as he did.

All of appellant's
arguments in his factum and before this Court related to whether there was or
was not strict compliance with the section and were then in support of a
requirement for strict compliance.

In my view there was
no compliance with the section at all, not even substantial compliance, and the
issue whether there must be strict or need only be substantial compliance is of
no relevance to the determination of this case. What the procedures followed in
this case raise as an issue is whether an accused may waive compliance with the
procedural requirements set out in the section, if so, in what manner, and
whether the accused in this case did waive them.

Some procedural
requirements are enacted for the protection of the rights of one of the
parties, Crown and accused, and others for both. A party may waive a procedural
requirement enacted for his benefit, the concurrence of both being required
when enacted for both. Generally speaking, the right to waive that type of
procedural requirement has been recognized by all the courts, including this
Court, and has been recently reaffirmed by this Court's decision as regards the
waiver of a voir dire into the circumstances surrounding the
giving of a statement by an accused to a person in authority (see Park v. The Queen, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 64). Paramount to such a right is that of the trial
judge to require compliance notwithstanding a desire to waive, he being the
ultimate judge of what procedural safeguards need nevertheless be respected in
order to protect the certainty and the integrity of the judicial process.

[page 49]

When one looks at
the various cases dealing with waiver, the problem which presents itself
relates to what formalities should surround a waiver before the court should
accept it and give it effect, in order that it will be a bar to the party
seeking to assert a non-compliance with the procedural requirement.

As a general
proposition, I should like to restate here what was said by our brother Dickson
J., speaking for the Court, in Park, supra. He was of course speaking of
the waiver by counsel of a voir dire [at pp.
73-74]:

No particular words or formula need be
uttered by defence counsel to express the
waiver and admission. All that is necessary is that the trial judge be
satisfied that counsel understand the matter and has made an informed decision
to waive the voir dire. [...]

Although no particular form of words is
necessary the waiver must be express. Silence or mere lack of objection does
not constitute a lawful waiver. The question is—does the accused indeed waive
the requirement of a voir dire and admit that the statement is voluntary
and admissible in evidence? If that
question can be answered in the affirmative I cannot think that any
further procedural safeguards are necessary to protect the rights of an accused
person.

Indeed the Court is saying in Park that the validity
of such a waiver, and I should add that that is so of any waiver, is dependent
upon it being clear and unequivocal that the person is waiving the procedural
safeguard and is doing so with full knowledge of the rights the procedure was
enacted to protect and of the effect the waiver will have on those
rights in the process. This has long been recognized, as is illustrated by
many cases, and particularly so by those dealing with a judge's duties as
regards a plea of guilty, which is the waiver by an accused of his right to put
the Crown's case to the test of a trial. (See amongst others, Adgey v. The
Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426; Brosseau v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 181). The
judge's duties concerning any waiver are no different than those on a plea of
guilty. The factors he will take into account in determining whether the
accused has clearly and unequivocally made an informed decision to waive his
rights will vary

[page 50]

depending on the
nature of the procedural requirement being waived and the importance of the
right it was enacted to protect. However, always relevant will be the fact that
the accused is or is not represented by counsel, counsel's experience, and, in
my view of great importance in a country so varied as ours, the particular
practice that has developed in the jurisdiction where the events are taking
place.

I will now consider
those principles as they apply to the procedural requirements of s. 492.

First let us look at
the notice that an accused may give to the sheriff. To identify the right of
the accused Parliament intended to protect through this procedure one must look
at the purpose of the notice. That purpose is revealed by the fact that it
creates an obligation upon the sheriff to ""forthwith inform"" the
judge who in turn ""shall fix a time and place for the accused to
re-elect"" and then ""cause notice thereof to be given to the
accused"".

The right to be
protected by the procedural enactment is that of the accused, wishing to
re-elect, to have a timely opportunity to do so. He is entitled to have the
judge informed of his wish, and thus require the judge to act under the
section. An accused who has in fact acted on that opportunity cannot later
complain that the notice requirement needed waiver by him as it obviously, in
those circumstances, no longer had any purpose.

As for the notice
that the judge must give the accused, it is to ensure that he will know where
and when to attend to re-elect. An accused who does in fact agree to a time and
place to attend would clearly and unequivocally be waiving that notice.

The procedural step set out in s. 492(3),
requiring the use of certain words, is there to ensure that an accused is
properly informed of the choice he has made and the one he now proposes to
adopt. His alternatives in the case at bar would be trial by a court composed
of a judge and jury, which he has formerly chosen, or trial by judge or
magistrate

[page 51]

alone, which he then contemplated. An informed
waiver must therefore be, as regards that portion of s. 492, a clear and
unequivocal indication by the accused himself or through his counsel that he
knows the words that the law says must be used when putting him to his
re-election, that he does not require that those words be uttered to him, that
he knows he was going to have a trial before a judge and jury, that he still
has the right to such a trial but that he still has the right to re-elect for a
trial before a judge sitting without a jury or a magistrate.

Now to apply these
considerations to the facts of the present case.

The events took
place in the judicial district of Montreal. Pursuant to questions by this Court
at the hearing, attorney for the appellant acknowledged the existence of a
practice particular to that district as regards re-election. (See: Traité de
procédure pénale,
vol. 1, 1981,
by Béliveau, Bellemare and Lussier, at pp. 302-308). As appears from that book,
an accused, who has elected for a trial by jury and who wishes to re-elect for
a trial by judge alone, does not advise the sheriff of same but rather a
particular clerk of the court who is known as being currently the person
responsible for re-elections. If the re-election is to be made at a date prior
to the date the accused was told to be present before the Assizes Court at his
last appearance before that Court, that clerk, having been so advised by
accused's counsel, arranges for an appearance before the Chief Judge of the
Court of the Sessions of the Peace (or any judge replacing him for that
purpose) for re-election. This is usually done in the absence of the Crown
Prosecutor who is handling the case, unless there is some special reason for
his being present, such as a plea of guilty followed by pre-sentence
representations, or evidently unless, as in this case, the trial is to commence
at that time by the reading into the record of evidence already adduced in
other procedures.

That this be the
practice in the judicial district of Montreal, appellant does not contest. He
questions

[page 52]

however the validity of that practice as not
being in accordance with s. 492. In this case, the accused with his attorney,
the Crown attorney and the clerk were in the Court of the Sessions of the Peace
before the Chief Judge of that Court. The record, which was the Superior
Court's record by virtue of the appellant's original election, had been brought
to that Court and the clerk had read the charge to Korponay and asked him
whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty. To that, the accused's attorney
replied ""judge alone"". It is clear from the exchange that ensued that
the Crown, and probably the court clerk, were under the mistaken impression
that the accused had already re-elected to that Court and was there to commence
the trial, which is what eventually happened.

It is equally clear that appellant's attorney
and appellant himself were there to commence the trial before that Court and
that the attorney for the appellant, being of the view, and rightly so, that
there had not been a re-election, indicated to the judge in his client's name
that he wanted to be tried by a judge alone. The judge had before him an
attorney whose knowledge of the law and of the practice of the criminal law
does not appear to be in issue. He was, in my view, amply justified in
assuming, since everyone was there to proceed with the trial, that the attorney
had discussed the matter with Korponay and that Korponay made an informed
decision, on the advice of his attorney, to proceed to trial, not before a jury,
but before that judge sitting without a jury, and that the attorney was fully
authorized to do anything necessary to that end. The judge was therefore in my
view amply justified in considering that the attorney's saying ""judge
alone"" was an informed waiver of the requirement of putting to his client
the words of the section. The accused's attorney knew what those words were, he
knew what they meant and what effect his answer ""judge alone"" would
have on his client's rights. Also, I should like to make my own the words of
Monnin J. A. when, speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal for
Manitoba in the case of R. v.
Matheson (1979), 13 C.R. (3d)
62, (the decision was reversed by this Court[1]

[page 53]

but for reasons irrelevant to the passage that I
am quoting with approval), he said (at p. 71):

I am of the view that what the accused can
personally do counsel speaking on his behalf and in his presence can likewise do; otherwise we are diminishing the
role of counsel and making a mockery of open trials solemnly conducted
in the presence of the accused fully represented by counsel of his choice. It
is certainly more expeditious and free from doubt to let a person who is
trained and learned in the law inform the court of the election and the plea of the accused, providing it is done in
open court and in the hearing of the accused, rather that [sic] to
insist that a slow and tedious trial ritual be accomplished only through the
mouth of the accused, who may not fully understand the questions raised and who may be hesitant to reply for fear of
misunderstanding or mistake. Counsel has a role to play in the
courtroom. He should be able to play it to the fullest.

This is a case of a clear and unequivocal waiver
by the accused through his attorney of the uttering of the words set out in the
section. The attorney thought the accused had not re-elected, was right in
thinking so and did re-elect for the purpose of getting on with what everyone
was there to do: start the trial. As for his ""notice"" to the sheriff,
I think that what I have already said on the matter is sufficient. He was being
offered the choice the notice was enacted to ensure, and that procedure would
have been superfluous and needed not be waived.

This also disposes of notice from the judge. In
any event it is also evident that all there had agreed to a time, place and
purpose, and that it would be extravagant to even suggest that there was not a
clear and unequivocal waiver of that requirement.

This ground should therefore fail. 

Second ground

This ground concerns the procedure set out in s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act:

[page 54]

8. In any prosecution for a violation of
subsection 4(2), if the accused does not plead guilty, the trial shall proceed
as if it were a prosecution for an offence under section 3, and after the close
of the case for the prosecution and after the accused has had an opportunity to
make full answer and defence, the court shall make a finding as to whether or
not the accused was in possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3; if the
court finds that the accused was not in possession of the narcotic contrary to
section 3, he shall be acquitted but if the court finds that the accused was in
possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3, he shall be given an
opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for
the purpose of trafficking, and thereafter the prosecutor shall be given an
opportunity of adducing evidence to establish that the accused was in
possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking; if the accused
establishes that he was not in possession of
the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, he shall be acquitted of
the offence as charged but he shall be convicted of an offence under section 3
and sentenced accordingly; and if the accused fails to establish that he was
not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, he shall be
convicted of the offence as charged and sentenced accordingly.

After the Crown closed its case, Korponay, on
May 5, 1977, testified and then closed his defence. The trial judge set August
3 for judgment. On that date, Korponay and three other accused, who had been
charged on different records with two counts, conspiracy to traffic in a
narcotic, and trafficking, appeared before him for judgment. Korponay had been
tried separately. Evidence adduced at the trials of the others had been read
into Korponay's trial. The trial judge was pronouncing judgment of all four
accused on the same day for they were all part of the same illegal transaction though
charged differently and not tried with Korponay. This is of some relevance in
understanding what I consider to be but an unfortunate oversight on the judge's
part, he being well cognizant of the exceptional procedure to be followed on a
trial governed by s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act. In a written
judgment, which he read, he concluded by finding all of them guilty as charged.
He had evidently momentarily overlooked the special position Korponay was in
and as a result did not in any way comply with the procedure set out in s. 8,
make a

[page 55]

finding as to
possession (evidently affirmative), and then offer him the opportunity to
address the issue of ""purpose"".

Though raised in the
Court of Appeal, this ground was in no way addressed or even mentioned by that
court. Having dealt with the ground related to the re-election procedure Nolan
J.A., speaking for the Court, reviewed the evidence and then said (A.C. at p.
2789):

In my opinion the Appellant has failed to
justify his grounds of appeal. The Crown,
in my view, has proven Appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and I
would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Both counsel agreed
that this was an unfortunate oversight. I agree, all the more so as it was not
only a serious ground but in my opinion one that should have succeeded.

Appellant argues
essentially that the procedure set out in s. 8 is mandatory and seeks support
for that proposition in the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in R. v. McDonald (1958), 120 C.C.C. 209. He further says that non-compliance is fatal and
that the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) cannot be invoked, and, to that end,
he relies on this Court's decision in Cloutier v.
The Queen, [19791 2
S.C.R. 709.

Respondent says that
the McDonald decision must be read in the light of the peculiar
facts of the case as was done by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Sharpe (1961),
131 C.C.C. 75, and later by the Court of Appeal of Quebec in R. v. Sylvain (1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 323. In essence, respondent relies on the Sharpe and Sylvain cases
to argue that there is no reason why, given the proper circumstances, as those
courts felt was the case in those two instances, the curative provisions of s.
613(1)(b)(iii) cannot be applied.

[page 56]

Section
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code

Respondent says
that, as Korponay was de facto given the opportunity to offer an explanation and did offer one as to the
purpose of his possession, the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) could and in
this case should be applied.

This to me is, with
deference, a misunderstanding of the rights of an accused at a trial governed
by s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act.

Under s. 8, the
rights of an accused are fourfold:

—a trial conducted during the first phase
as if the charge were one under s. 3;

—a full answer and defence to the issue of
possession before being put in actual jeopardy of conviction of an
offence under s. 4(2);

—a finding on possession before
deciding on a defence and revealing its nature as regards the purpose of that
possession in the event that finding be affirmative;

—an opportunity of presenting that defence.

The respondent—Crown
is saying that a breach of the accused's right to a finding by the judge before
addressing the issue of the purpose of his possession is necessarily cured by
the accused having in fact been given at some time prior to that finding an
opportunity to address the issue and by his having availed himself of that
opportunity.

The accused's right
is not limited to that of being given an opportunity of establishing that the
purpose of his possession was not trafficking; were that the case, I would
agree with the Crown that the accused having testified as to that aspect of the
offence, s. 613(1)(b)(iii) could, given the proper circumstances, be applied
and cure the oversight with respect to the second stage of s. 8.

[page 57]

Such is not however
the case because most important is the additional right of an accused to avail
himself of that opportunity, or decide not to, only after having been given the
trier of fact's finding as to possession and only if that finding is adverse.
The question therefore, as regards the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii), is whether the
Crown has discharged the burden of satisfying the court that even if the
accused had known that the finding would be adverse to him his defence would
have been necessarily the same. I find it difficult to imagine a court ever
being so satisfied. Indeed, an accused's whole approach to his case might well
be very different at that second stage of the proceedings. Let me illustrate.
An accused is perfectly entitled, by his not testifying himself in his own
defence though offering a defence at the first stage of the proceedings, to
refrain from revealing an addiction to drugs which could be incriminating as
regards possession. He might however want to establish that fact at the second
stage of the proceedings when contending that the purpose of his possession was
for personal consumption. This example illustrates the general proposition that
a court cannot know that a defence after the finding would necessarily have
been the same as that advanced before and conclude that there was ""no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice"".

In my view, the
curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) can never succeed in face of this type of error. Such
non-compliance with the section will be fatal unless there has been a valid
waiver on the part of the accused. Though Parliament has not put any error of
law beyond the reach of s. 613(1)(b)(iii), certain types of errors of law are such that the Crown will never succeed
in satisfying the court that, had it not been for the error, the verdict would
of necessity have been the same.

Such is the type of
error in the present case. Indeed the denial of an opportunity of presenting a
defence will always leave the court uncertain as to

[page 58]

what would finally
be the evidence adduced had the opportunity denied been given the accused.

Appellant's reliance
on this Court's decision in Cloutier was predicated on what was said by
Pratte J. (at p. 724):

The accused, who is erroneously denied a
peremptory challenge, is entitled to
ask that the trial and the guilty verdict
returned by an irregularly empanelled jury be
annulled; it is not necessary for him
to prove a prejudice; there is a 'préjudice de droit'; as to this no
doubt exists: R. v. Churton (1919), 31 C.C.C. 188; Henry Williams
(1925), 19 Cr. App. R. 67; R. v. Page, [1965] Crim. L.R.
444.

This passage is obiter. In
any event, to the extent that Pratte J. could be interpreted as suggesting that
the irregular empanelling of a jury is an error of law which may never be cured
by the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii), I cannot, with deference, agree. But I
do agree with the appellant that such is the error in the present case. And, as
I have said, the fatal effect on the trial of non-compliance in the present
case can only be avoided if there be a valid waiver.

Waiver

Though waiver was
not commented on by either party to the proceedings, the issue of waiver must
nevertheless be addressed, as it is determinative of this appeal.

When considered in
the perspective of waiver the question to be addressed is the following: has an
accused waived his right to a ""finding"" and to then presenting anew a
defence on the issue of ""purpose"" by the mere fact that he has already
addressed that issue at the first stage?

I need not repeat
here, when considering s. 8, what 1 have said earlier as regards the criterion
for determining the existence and validity of a waiver, except to repeat that
it must be informed, clear and unequivocal.

Two cases relied
upon by respondent in support of an application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) and which,
it is true, were in fact decided on that basis, in my

[page 59]

view offer
illustrations of circumstances where valid waivers had in fact been made, and
for that reason, though disagreeing as to the propriety of resorting to s.
613(1)(b)(iii), I find myself in agreement with the result: R. v. Sylvain, supra, which is the waiver of the ""finding"", and R. v. Sharpe, supra, which is different, being the waiver of adducing evidence after the
finding.

In Sylvain, the
accused testified at the first stage; at the outset he admitted possession and
then addressed the issue of ""purpose"" before the judge made a finding
as to his possession. The Court of Appeal of Quebec dismissed the appeal by
applying s. 613(1)(b)(iii). As I said earlier, I do not think that s. 613 can
have any application where the provisions of s. 8 have not been complied with.
But, the fact that Sylvain, assisted by his attorney, and in answer to questions
by his attorney, started by admitting possession and then dealt directly with
""purpose"" was, in the circumstances of that case, in my opinion, a
clear and unequivocal waiver of his right to a ""finding"" on
possession by the judge before testifying as to purpose.

The Sharpe case
appears to have been decided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario by resorting to
a combination of ""waiver"" and the provisions of s. 613. Sharpe had
testified at the first stage. What then happened is best described by the Court
of Appeal per Morden J.A. (at p. 80):

In the case at bar the Magistrate was well
aware of the provisions of s. 4(4). After
hearing counsel on the issue of possession, he made a finding that the
appellant was guilty of possession. It was
at that point he turned to the issue of trafficking and heard argument. The
record does not show that he specifically
advised the accused of his
right to give or call evidence on this issue. However, I assume
that the counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial (who was not his
counsel in this Court), knew the correct procedure and if he had
evidence he wished to call on the issue of
trafficking, he would have so advised the Magistrate and it would have
been received. In view of the appellant's denial of possession,
it would be difficult to imagine what
evidence he himself

[page 60]

could have given on the issue of trafficking.
At very most, the Magistrate's failure to ask whether defence wished to call
evidence at this stage was an irregularity and
in view of his counsel's acquiescence, it could not be a ground for allowing this appeal. As Lord Goddard
C.J. said in R. v. Neal, [1949] 2 K.B.
590 at p. 597: ""We desire, however, to emphasize that if an irregularity
arises in a trial which can be cured, and it is not brought timeously to the
attention of the court of trial, it does not by any means follow that this
court will allow advantage to be taken of it when it is too late to remedy it
except by quashing the conviction.""

See also R. v. Lashbrooke (1958), 43 Cr. App. R. 86.

When the finding of possession was made
against the appellant, then s. 4(4) imposed
an onus upon him to establish by a balance of probabilities that he was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking. He did
not call evidence on this issue. He was entitled to rely upon the
evidence already given and if that evidence as a whole raised a reasonable
doubt then he would have been entitled to have been acquitted: R. v. Cappello, supra. In my opinion,
the quantity of narcotics found in his possession
and their value and the fact that the appellant was not an addict, left
no room for reasonable doubt of his guilt and the Magistrate did not err when
he convicted the appellant of having in his possession a drug for the purpose
of trafficking.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal. 

(The underlining is mine.)

The fact that the
attorney did not, after the affirmative finding as to possession, call
any evidence but rather proceeded immediately to present his arguments as
regards ""purpose"" could, in that case, be considered a waiver of the
accused's right to adduce, anew, evidence on the issue of purpose. If and to
the extent the Court of Appeal for Ontario is predicating its conclusion
on the presence of a valid waiver, I agree. I should not, however, with deference,
for reasons already set out, agree with what appears to be an application of
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) by speculating as to whether the accused could and would
have added anything

[page 61]

else to his defence
had he exercised his right to do so after a ""finding"".

The present case is
different from Sharpe in that there was no finding. It differs
from Sylvain in that the accused did not admit
possession. There is no basis, when applying the proper criterion, for
concluding that there was a waiver of the ""finding"", as in Sylvain, or of the calling of further evidence as in Sharpe. There being no waiver, we have here an error of
law, non-compliance with s. 8, that cannot, as I said, be dealt with under s.
613(1)(b)(iii). This ground of appeal should therefore in my view succeed and a
new trial should be ordered.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Evidence—Statements against
penal interest—Hearsay—Exception to the hearsay rule—Whether such statements
having an inculpatory effect on the accused admissible.

Accused was charged with arson in the burning
of his house. A friend of the accused, who was severely burned and died a few
days later, made two statements at the hospital to R.C.M.P. officers admitting
that he had personally set the house afire and had been hired by the accused to
do so. At trial, the statements were admitted into evidence and the accused
convicted. An appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

In a proper case, statements tendered on
behalf of the accused and made by an unavailable person may be admitted at
trial if they can be shown to have been made against the penal interest of the
person making them; but such a rule could not apply to statements which have an
inculpatory effect on the accused. Such statements implicating the accused robs
him of the invaluable weapon of cross-examination which has always been one of
the mainstays of fairness in our courts.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba
(1979), 1 Man. R. (2d) 182, 50 C.C.C. (2d) 535, dismissing an appeal from a
judgment of Darichuk J. Appeal allowed.

Paul Walsh, for the appellant.

[Page 29]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal brought as of right
pursuant to s. 618(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and is
accordingly limited to the questions of law on which Mr. Justice
O’Sullivan dissented in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. The said s. 618
(1)(a) reads as follows:

618. (1) A
person who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is
affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents,…

The grounds of appeal are referred to in the
following terms in the notice of appeal to this Court:

AND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that the grounds of the
said appeal are the grounds in law set forth by The Honourable Mr. Justice
O’Sullivan of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, in his dissent from the
Judgment of the said Court of Appeal for Manitoba which said grounds of dissent
in law are more particularly set out in the Reasons for Judgment of the said
The Honourable Mr. Justice O’Sullivan in the formal Certificate of
Decision of the said Court of Appeal for Manitoba, namely:

1. THAT the learned trial Judge erred in
law in permitting the introduction into evidence of a confession/statement by a
deceased person accusing an accused, as an exception to the rule against
hearsay evidence; and

2. THAT the learned trial Judge erred in
law assuming the said confession/statement implicating the accused were admissable
[sic], in admitting into evidence such portion of the said statement
which was an accusation directed against the accused.

The appellant was convicted at trial by His
Honour Judge W. Darichuk in the County Court Judges’ Criminal Court for the Dauphin
Judicial District on the following charge, namely:

THAT he the said ARMAND LUCIER on or about
the ninth day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand, nine hundred
and seventy-seven at or near the Rural Municipality of Shell River in the Dauphin
Judicial District, in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawful-

[Page 30]

ly and wilfully set fire to a building, to
wit: a dwelling house, the property of Armand Lucier.

The appellant’s appeal from this conviction was
dismissed in a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and it is from this
judgment that the appeal is now taken on the grounds referred to above which
are more fully set forth in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice
O’Sullivan.

The facts of this case are essentially
undisputed and reveal that the appellant’s house was destroyed by fire at a
time when he was absent from the locality and shortly after he had increased
his fire insurance policy by the sum of $20,000. The circumstances immediately
preceding this fire are recounted by the appellant’s friend, one Dumont, who
had himself been in the house at the time of the fire with the result that he
was seriously burned and upon escaping to his sister’s house nearby he was
ultimately removed to a hospital in Winnipeg. There he was visited by a
constable of the R.C.M.P to whom he made a statement admitting that he had
personally set the house afire and that he had been hired to do so for the
purpose by the appellant who had undertaken to pay him $500 for the task.
Dumont later made a further statement to another R.C.M.P. officer which was to
the same effect in that he admitted responsibility for setting the fire and
implicated the accused in the undertaking. Both these statements were made to
persons in authority after Dumont had been duly cautioned and they were in my
view contrary to his penal interest. A few days later Dumont died and it is the
question of whether or not his statements should be admitted against the
appellant which lies at the root of this appeal. After a careful review of the
leading cases on the somewhat vexed question as to the admissibility of
statements made against penal interest, the Court of Appeal concluded that the
Dumont statements were admissible.

It is, of course, obvious that the account given
by the policemen of what Dumont had told them was hearsay evidence and in fact
it might be characterized as double hearsay in that it constituted the
policemen’s recollection of what the deceased said about what was said to him
by the

[Page 31]

appellant concerning the lighting of the fire.
The rule against the admission of hearsay evidence has been constantly repeated
over the years and is succinctly stated by Lord Norman in Teper v. The
Queen, [1952] A.C. 480, at p. 486 where he said:

The rule against the admission of hearsay
evidence is fundamental. It is not the best evidence and it is not delivered on
oath. The truthfulness and accuracy of the person whose words are spoken to by
another witness cannot be tested by cross-examination, and the light which his
demeanour would throw on his testimony is lost.

The Sussex Peerage case, decided in 1844 (1844), 11 Cl. and Fin. 85, 8 E.R. 1034
(H.L.), recognized an exception to the hearsay rule in respect of a statement
made by a deceased person against his pecuniary interest, but this exception
did not apply to a statement against penal interest. The advisability of
extending the application of the exception to declarations against penal
interest has been debated in a number of cases and by Wig-more in his text on
evidence (5 Wigmore, Evidence, 3rd ed., paras. 1476 and 1477).
However, the matter has been determined in this Court in R. v. O’Brien, [1978]
1 S.C.R. 591. Dickson J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said at
p. 599:

The effect of the rule in The Sussex
Peerage case, as it has been generally understood, is to render admissible
a statement by a deceased that he had received payment of a debt from another
or that he held a parcel of land as tenant and not as owner, but to render
inadmissible a confession by a deceased that he and not someone else was the
real perpetrator of the crime. The distinction is arbitrary and tenuous. There
is little or no reason why declarations against penal interest and those
against pecuniary or proprietary interest should not stand on the same footing.
A person is as likely to speak the truth in a matter affecting his liberty as
in a matter affecting his pocketbook. For these reasons and the ever-present
possibility that a rule of absolute prohibition could lead to grave injustice I
would hold that, in a proper case, a declaration against penal interest is
admissible according to the law of Canada; the rule as to absolute exclusion of
declarations against penal interest, established in The Sussex Peerage case,
should not be followed.

[Page 32]

In R. v. Demeter (1975), 10 O.R. (2d)
321, the Ontario Court of Appeal, while not deciding the issue of the
admissibility of declarations against penal interest, did enunciate the
principles which would have to apply to determine if a statement alleged to be
against penal interest could be admitted. On the appeal to this Court, [1978] 1
S.C.R. 538, it was stated at p. 545 that the principles enunciated by the
Court of Appeal would be a valuable guide if this Court decided that
declarations against penal interest were not, per se, inadmissible.
Those principles are as follows [at p. 544]:

1. The declaration would have to be made to
such a person and in such circumstances that the declarant should have
apprehended a vulnerability to penal consequences as a result. In Sussex
Peerage the Lord Chancellor would not have admitted the declaration in any
event of the rule because it was made to the declarant’s son. In ordinary
circumstances where a declaration is made for instance to an unestranged son,
wife or mother, the psychological assurance of reliability is lacking because
of [sic] risk of penal consequences is not real and the declarant may
have motives such as a desire for self‑aggrandizement or to shock which
makes the declaration unreliable.

2. The vulnerability to penal consequences
would have to be not remote.

3. “…the declaration sought to be given in
evidence must be considered in its totality. If upon the whole tenor the
weight is in favour of the declarant, it is not against his interest”: Re
Van Beelen, p. 208; R. v. Agawa (1975) 11 O.R. (2d) 176.

4. In a doubtful case a Court might
properly consider whether or not there are other circumstances connecting the
declarant with the crime and whether or not there is any connection between the
declarant and the accused.

5. The declarant would have to be
unavailable by reason of death, insanity, grave illness which prevents the
giving of testimony even from a bed, or absence in a jurisdiction to which none
of the processes of the Court extends. A declarant would not be unavailable in
the circumstances that existed in R. v. Agawa.

Having regard to the judgment of this Court in
the Demeter and O’Brien cases, it must now be recognized that in
a proper case, statements tendered on behalf of the accused and made by an
unavailable person may be admitted at trial if they

[Page 33]

can be shown to have been made against the penal
interest of the person making them; but neither the two cases to which I have
just referred nor any of the wealth of authorities cited in the courts below
apply such a rule to statements which have an inculpatory effect on the
accused. On the contrary, wherever such statements have been admitted it will
be found that they have an exculpatory effect. The difference is a very real
one because a statement implicating the accused in the crime with which he is
charged emanating from the lips of one who is no longer available to give
evidence robs the accused of the invaluable weapon of cross-examination which
has always been one of the mainstays of fairness in our courts.

In the present case the statements made by
Dumont which were tendered by the prosecutor are obviously inculpatory of the
appellant and in my opinion this is not a “proper case” for admitting them so
that the learned trial judge did err in permitting their introduction into
evidence and I would accordingly allow this appeal on the first ground
specified in the Notice of Appeal, quash the conviction and direct a new trial
in accordance with the alternative relief sought by the appellant.

Appeal allowed.
